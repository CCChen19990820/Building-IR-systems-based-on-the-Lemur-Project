<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just weeks after telling the nation, in this year's State of the Union address, that the "era of big government is over," Bill Clinton indicated that the obituary notice was somewhat premature when he delivered his a 20-page FY 1997 budget to Congress. In contrast to the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA), which he vetoed last fall, the latest Clinton budget would mean $1,927 in higher taxes and $3,155 in higher spending for every household in America over the next seven years. This is the eighth budget plan Clinton has delivered to Congress in a year; and, except for the FY 1996 budget submitted last February (which called for $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade), each has been short on specifics and long on promises.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Clinton claims his FY 1997 budget will eliminate the federal deficit by FY 2002 using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, it does so only by using the same assortment of smoke, mirrors, and other gimmicks that has made taxpayers increasingly cynical about Washington's commitment to budget-making. Even worse, although the Clinton budget balances on paper, it flinches from making the tough decisions needed to eliminate wasteful and outmoded programs, end welfare as we know it, save Medicare from bankruptcy, or transfer failing federal programs to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it. Clinton's plan, for example:
<ul>
<li>Increases federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenues by $526 billion;
<p>
<li>Spends a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. That means $3,155 more for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of American workers;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate a single program of any significance;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency;
<p>
<li>Increases entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from the exploding costs of Medicaid; and
<p>
<li>Spends $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the BBA while calling for billions more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or that should be transferred to state and local government control.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget signals not the end of big government, but the continuation of status-quo government.
<p>

<b>CLINTON 8, TAXPAYERS 0</b><sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five years while providing tax cuts for working families, President Clinton has consistently resisted congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan with tax cuts. In addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Clinton presented four budget plans to Congress during 1995 -- each time falling far short of balancing the budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of prodding, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO certified -- at least on paper -- that this new proposal would balance the budget by 2002. Closer review of each of the budget plans proposed by Clinton during the past year, however, including the FY 1997 budget, shows that the White House has never been serious about either balancing the budget or providing meaningful tax relief. It seems interested only in finding ways to spend more taxpayer dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be balanced.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #1</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade. According to CBO, the President's February budget would increase the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The February Clinton budget did propose a few modest privatization initiatives, such as selling the Power Marketing Administrations, portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, and portions of the National Weather Service. It also proposed terminating a few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs into 27 new programs. In addition, the budget proposed a "Middle Class Bill of Rights" which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit for families that have children below age 13 and who earn less than $60,000 per year. But the Administration did little to fight for any of these proposals. On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than his first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, this plan would produce $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for families with children in addition to tax deductions for higher education and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform than the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<P>
<b>Clinton Budget #4</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up for its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In other words, the Administration wanted to have it both ways: Claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #5</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan to Congress. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had it not been for the conditions Congress included in the continuing resolution passed on January 5, 1996. These conditions stipulated, in effect, that a bill to provide operating funds for unappropriated federal programs through January 26 would not be sent to the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the CBO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, the fifth Clinton budget falls far short of being credible. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction fell in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings was to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were "sunsetted" in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget would be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sixth Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 9. It moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while boosting the net size of the tax cuts to $85 billion. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs. 
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would force hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>
<b>WHAT CLINTON'S FY 1997 BUDGET WOULD MEAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The eight Clinton budgets clearly demonstrate that this President envisions a government that has a balanced budget but somehow remains largely unchanged from government with perpetual $200 billion deficits. In other words, Clinton wants it both ways. He says he wants a balanced federal budget, but he is not willing to challenge the size and scope of government as a credible balanced budget plan requires.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boldest proposal the Administration can muster is to "reinvent government," which, in practice, amounts to putting a new paint job on a house whose foundation is collapsing under its own weight. American taxpayers sent government a very clear message in the 1994 election: They do not want useless and obsolete programs merely to waste their money more efficiently. They want the budget to be balanced in a timely fashion, and they want the result of this effort to be a smaller, less costly government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget would leave less money in the pockets of working families and more money in the hands Washington's big spenders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It spends money taxpayers cannot afford. The 20-page FY 1997 Clinton budget proposes to "balance the budget" in FY 2002 while boosting spending $361 billion over the next seven years. It would spend a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, $306 billion more than would be spent under the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed last December. This amounts to $3,155 more government spending for every household in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It takes more of their money in tax revenues. The Clinton budget assumes federal tax collections will grow an astonishing $526 billion by FY 2002, a jump of nearly 39 percent. Also, the Administration expects the government to collect a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over the next seven years, $187 billion more than under the BBA. This amounts to $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It adds to tomorrow's debt burden. Because the Clinton budget fails to control federal spending, it would add $755 billion in accumulated deficits to the national debt, even while promising to balance the budget over seven years. Compared to the BBA, this is $119 billion more deficit spending over seven years, equivalent to transferring $1,227 per household in added debt to the next generation of American workers.
<p>

<b>Balancing the Budget Without Lifting a Finger</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As was the case with Clinton's previous "balanced budget" plans, the only way the FY 1997 budget can be made to balance -- at least on paper -- is by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future President and Congress. How does it do this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>First, the Clinton plan purports to save nearly $596 billion over the next seven years, but less than 40 percent of these savings is achieved during the first five years.</b> The painful task of accomplishing 61 percent of the plan's deficit reduction falls to the first Congress and President elected in the next century. Indeed, some 54 percent of the plan's Medicare savings and 60 percent of its Medicaid savings will fall beyond a possible second Clinton term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Second, while Clinton claims his budget balances according to Congressional Budget Office assumptions, it does not. Clinton makes his job of balancing the budget in FY 2002 easier by challenging or ignoring CBO assumptions</b>.<sup>2</sup>  For instance, CBO currently projects a $228 billion deficit in FY 2002. Clinton, however, reduces that projection to $221 billion by challenging one of CBO's technical assumptions, thereby avoiding the need to cut $7 billion in spending. Also, Clinton's budget uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates of proposed spectrum auction proceeds, rather than CBO estimates, to produce an additional $11 billion in deficit reduction in FY 2002 -- again, to avoid having to produce real spending cuts. The Senate Budget Committee reports that if honest accounting methods were used, Clinton's budget would produce a $9 billion deficit in FY 2002, not the balance the Administration claims.
<p>
<b>Modest Tax Cuts, More Tax Increases</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget also manipulates its proposed tax cuts in order to avoid having to make tough choices on curbing spending. The budget proposes a meager $98.5 billion in gross tax cuts over seven years, equivalent to returning just 8 cents of every $1,000 in taxes the government expects to collect. The centerpiece of the plan is a tax credit for dependent children that begins at $300 per child and increases to $500 per child in 1999.<sup>3</sup> However, Clinton "sunsets" the child credit after FY 2001, increasing taxes on these families by over $17 billion in 2002 -- the year Clinton promises to balance the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget proposes to generate $59.4 billion in new tax revenues by "cutting corporate tax subsidies, closing loopholes, and improving tax compliance."<sup>4</sup> This amount exceeds the Administration's proposed seven-year savings in Medicaid ($59 billion) and is nearly 50 percent greater than its proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion). These new revenues effectively reduce the net size of the tax cut package to $39 billion, equal to a cut of just 3 cents for every $1,000 taxpayers will send Washington over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the major contributing factors in the Clinton budget's ability to "balance" the budget in FY 2002 is the temporary nature of the tax cuts combined with the permanent nature of the new tax revenues. The new tax measures purportedly generate $11.9 billion in FY 2002. When this amount is added to the $17 billion tax hike on families resulting from the unseating of the child tax credit, the result is $29 billion in deficit reduction, roughly 15 percent of Clinton's total deficit savings in FY 2002. Again, there is no need to make tough choices on real spending cuts.
<p>

<b>The Failure to Address Exploding Entitlement Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regrettably, Clinton proposes no credible solutions to the serious problems facing the nation's major entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. The meager savings the Administration proposes to achieve from these programs fall far short of stemming the tide of red ink in the near term -- and far short of the fundamental changes needed to keep these programs from collapsing. The White House has been warned repeatedly of the need to curb runaway entitlements:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CBO projects that, if nothing is done to slow the overall growth of entitlement programs, they will grow by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government in 2002 -- over 8 cents more than is spent today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The long-term forecasts reported by the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), are even more troubling. These projections suggest that entitlements will become a liability that cannot be sustained by the federal government, by the economy, or by the taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some examples of the Commission's findings:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Example:</b> "The gap between Federal spending and revenues is growing rapidly. Absent policy changes, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume almost all Federal revenues in 2010. In 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover entitlement spending."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "By 2030, unless appropriate policy changes are made in the interim, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all tax revenues.... If all other Federal programs (except interest on the national debt) grow no faster than the economy, total Federal outlays would exceed 37 percent of the economy. Today, outlays are 22 percent of the economy.... "<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "The share of Medicare Part B cost paid by enrollees as monthly premiums has been shrinking since the program began. When the program started, the enrollee and the Federal government had a 50-50 partnership -- each paid 50 percent of the cost. Today, the Federal government pays 70 percent of Part B costs; by 2030 the government's share is projected to increase to 92 percent."<sup>7</sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Entitlements grow as a share of budget. </b>Under the proposed FY 1997 Clinton budget, overall entitlement spending would increase by $365 billion (nearly 50 percent) over the next seven years. While the Clinton plan would slow the aggregate growth rate of these programs to an average of roughly 6 percent per year from a CBO-projected average of 7.2 percent per year, entitlement programs will increase substantially as a share of the overall federal budget. Currently, mandatory programs consume 48.7 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government. The Clinton budget plan would increase the share of federal spending dedicated to these programs to 58.8 cents of every federal dollar by FY 2002.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason is Clinton's failure to address significantly the systemic problems within these programs. The other reason is that Clinton's budget plan achieves more than 55 percent of its overall deficit savings from discretionary programs -- which comprise just 36 percent of federal spending. As these annually appropriated programs shrink as a share of total spending, a greater share of the federal budget is consumed by "uncontrolled" entitlement spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Medicare is left at risk.</b> In April 1995, the Medicare Trustees issued a warning that the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund was in severe financial imbalance and that Congress should take "timely action to establish long term financial stability for the program."<sup>8</sup> Indeed, recent figures from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) show that in 1995, the HI program paid out $35.7 million more in benefits than it took in through the HI payroll tax, thus forcing HCFA to reduce the trust fund's accrued balance to pay its bills. This is a sign that the HI trust fund, which is expected to go bankrupt by the year 2002, could face a financial crisis even earlier than has been feared.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these warning signs, the Clinton Administration's Medicare reform proposal falls short of restoring the long-term solvency of the program. Even though the President's budget promises to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over the next seven years compared to CBO projections, it provides too few details to justify such claims. The plan purports to allow beneficiaries more choices from the private sector, but it does not replace today's defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that truly gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their own health plan and range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Furthermore, the President's budget proposal maintains a heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums by requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B program costs. The original Part B program required beneficiaries to pay premiums which reflected one-half of program costs. Maintaining the taxpayer subsidy at 75 percent means there are not enough incentives to encourage enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between private-sector plans and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result: not just a reduction in the subsidy, but a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>More Medicaid costs are shifted to the states.</b> The Clinton Medicaid reform proposal would exacerbate the crisis facing most state governments: growing Medicaid costs that are siphoning off precious resources from such other priorities such as education, prisons, and infrastructure. Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that "if no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's proposal would control federal Medicaid costs by some $59 billion over seven years by implementing a "per capita cap" on the amount Washington sends to states to provide health care for the poor and elderly. But this purported reform retains Medicaid's existing entitlement structure by maintaining most of the current eligibility requirements in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Maintaining these federal strings could impose an additional $47.4 billion in Medicaid costs on already financially strapped states.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Limiting federal Medicaid expenditures while increasing the financial exposure of the states is irresponsible. The President's proposal does not allow states the flexibility they need to design benefit packages or other major program parameters. If the federal government is going to cap its Medicaid expenditures, the states must be allowed to establish new benefit packages, provider reimbursement systems, and -- most important -- eligibility criteria. While the Administration's proposal allows for some limited changes in managed care enrollment, it represents a large unfunded mandate to the states because they will not have the freedom to control costs as dictated by the federal per capita caps. The magnitude of an such an unfunded mandate will vary from state to state because of differences in population. However, a large state, such as California, could face additional costs of $4.4 billion from the per capita cap.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare reform ignores the root causes of poverty.</b> The Clinton welfare reform proposal will hardly make a dent in the massive federal welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5.5 trillion since 1965. The federal welfare system is a vast network of 78 interrelated, overlapping, means-tested programs designed to assist poor or low-income Americans. The cost to all levels of government was $350 billion in 1994, with Washington contributing 72 percent. This amounts to $3,400 for every taxpaying household in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton proposes to trim the welfare state by an unnoticeable $40 billion over the next seven years. Real reform would send programs back to the states with only a few necessary strings attached, but the Clinton plan keeps the existing structure of federal anti-poverty programs and talks vaguely about giving flexibility to the states. Clinton also talks in tough terms about imposing real work requirements on welfare recipients but the reforms drafted by the Administration contain only sham work requirements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most serious flaw in the Clinton welfare plan is its failure to address one of the major root causes of poverty: illegitimacy. Since 1965, the percentage of children born out of wedlock has grown from 7 percent of all children to 32 percent -- an almost five-fold increase. Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the Clinton plan simply tries to address the symptoms by spending more on job training and child care programs. 
<p>
<b>Spending Initiatives That Outweigh Spending Cuts</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While stating that "government should not do for individuals what they can do for themselves," the Clinton budget outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as education, high technology, crime fighting, and the environment. Remarkably, the discussion of this new spending falls under the heading "Spurring Economic Growth," thus confirming the Administration's strange and obsolete notion that directed government spending, not private spending, is the key to creating jobs and economic growth. Nowhere, however, does Clinton's budget provide even a hint of how it intends to achieve the $297 billion in discretionary spending cuts that comprise 55 percent of its deficit reduction plan. These details, presumably, will be outlined in the Administration's full FY 1997 budget, due to be published this month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's spending initiatives would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the hundreds of failed programs currently funded in the federal budget in areas the President claims are priorities. Clinton has an obligation to explain to taxpayers why these hundreds of existing programs have failed, and why they have not been eliminated, before trying to justify pumping even more money into these areas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of these new spending priorities include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Job training.</b> The budget proudly states that the Administration has shifted more money into job training programs and would increase funding for Skill Grants for dislocated workers. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that 14 separate federal departments and agencies currently fund some 164 job training programs at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $25 billion per year. Moreover, the few controlled studies that have been conducted show that these programs have little or no success either in putting people to work or in raising their wages.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Education.</b> The Administration claims it has shifted more money to education programs such as Goals 2000 and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program. Now Clinton wants new programs to "connect every classroom to the information super-highway," in addition to expanded work-study for college students, merit scholarships for high school students, and charter schools. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The Department of Education already manages roughly 240 programs, dozens of them targeted to the same students for whom Clinton would create new programs. Indeed, Goals 2000 does little to benefit students; it primarily funds state bureaucracies and duplicates many programs currently operated by the states. Also, many states already are experimenting with reform initiatives such as charter schools and do not need Washington's help. Moreover, there are some 240 programs targeted to "at-risk youth" scattered throughout such agencies as the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor. Creating more programs targeted to these young people only adds to the bureaucracy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Science and technology "investments."</b>  The Clinton budget places great emphasis on maintaining Administration's investments in high-technology spending. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li>These myriad "investment" programs have turned out to be little more than expensive corporate welfare. There is evidence to suggest that these programs not only do not create jobs, but actually may induce the recipient corporations to downsize their research and development departments.<sup>11</sup> Many corporations figure there is no reason to fund their own R&D if Washington will pick up the tab for them.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime.</b> The Clinton budget "fully funds the President's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) initiative," which the Administration claims will put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Clinton claims this program is responsible for the hiring of 23,000 new policemen to date. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li> The problem with Clinton's promise to put 100,000 new police officers on the street by 2000 is that the math does not work. The 1994 crime bill, which authorized the COPS initiative, provided $8.4 billion in federal funds over six years, enough money either to put only 20,000 permanent new policemen on the street or to pay 100,000 officers less than $15,000 per year. Since police officers make more than the minimum wage, state and local governments that accept these federal funds will have to finance the remaining cost themselves -- a cost that could total $28 billion over six years.<sup>12</sup> Congress would change this program from a matching grant to a simple block grant, allowing local governments to use the funds for other law enforcement-related purposes such as purchasing equipment, paying overtime, and establishing neighborhood programs. Clinton has rejected these reforms, and the reason is obvious: Block granting the funds will not force local governments to pay for Clinton's campaign promises. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Discretionary Spending "Cuts"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget proposes to spend $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed, while claiming to save $297 billion over seven years from these programs. How can this be true?  The truth is these savings are calculated from the CBO "baseline," which projects higher spending on discretionary programs in future years. Thus, simply freezing aggregate spending on these programs at FY 1995 levels "saves" $258 billion over seven years. The roughly $40 billion in additional "savings" (bringing the total to $297 billion) is due to Clinton's proposal to spend less in future years, below what was spent in 1995. However, the Clinton budget would implement 95 percent of these cuts in FY 2001 and FY 2002, thus leaving the tough decisions to a future President and Congress.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The era of big government is far from over. The Administration's repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys to "balance the budget" casts doubt on its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress. At every turn, Clinton fought attempts to cut spending, or even to reduce the growth in spending. Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic assumptions because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while claiming to support a balanced budget. Clinton repeatedly called on Congress to reduce the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not because eliminating the tax cuts would balance the budget any faster (say in five years rather than seven), but because smaller tax cuts would allow more money for government spending. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere. With both eyes focused firmly on domestic U.S. politics, the Administration has dropped trade expansion from its Latin American policy agenda while adopting a more aggressive stance not only against illegal immigration from Mexico, but against drug trafficking in the Americas.<sup>1</sup>  However, the Administration is not alone in its retreat from free trade. In Congress, some longtime free traders from both parties are also backpedaling from trade expansion and from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Populist proponents of protectionism have tapped into voter anxieties about the health of the U.S. economy and job security by misrepresenting NAFTA as the cause of the Mexican peso crisis, declining manufacturing wages in the U.S., rising illegal immigration from Mexico, and increased drug trafficking.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At one level, the Clinton Administration appears to understand the importance of foreign trade to the U.S. economy. The President's foreign policy team continues to extol the importance of free trade to America's economic interests. For example, Richard Brown, the White House coordinator for the Summit of the Americas, claims that the Administration has not retreated from the goal of completing negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Brown also insists that the President has not given up on obtaining fast-track negotiating authority to include Chile in NAFTA<sup>2</sup>.  In practice, however, free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton Administration. During the past year, President Clinton has:
<ul><P>
<li>Reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996. The delay in Chile's admission to NAFTA has damaged America's credibility and leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<li>Violated key provisions of NAFTA. For example, the Administration postponed indefinitely the implementation of provisions to permit the circulation of Mexican trucks in U.S. border states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dropping the ball on trade with Latin America is merely part of a larger problem with the President's Latin American policy. The Clinton Administration has never possessed a coherent vision of America's economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1993, bowing to pressure from American unions and environmental activist groups, the President delayed NAFTA's approval for a year while labor and environmental side agreements were imposed on Mexico and Canada. The Administration's invasion of Haiti in 1994 and secret immigration agreement with Cuba in 1995 likewise were undertaken in response to domestic political pressures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The damage is done. The task for American policymakers now is to correct the current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible. U.S. relations with Mexico must be repaired, NAFTA must be strengthened, and America must regain its dominant role in the process of hemispheric trade liberalization. To achieve these policy goals, the U.S. government should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Comply with NAFTA.</b>The U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA obligations on schedule. By cheating on NAFTA, the Clinton Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future.
<p>
<li><B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico. </B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico. These include such issues as currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's foreign debt, immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
<li><B>Expand NAFTA.</B> Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. NAFTA must grow to remain vibrant and alive. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile and other countries would maintain the momentum for expanding free trade in the Americas and beyond, including at a later time Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
<li><B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </B>The creation of a currency board in Mexico would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA.
<p>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development.
<P>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States.
</ul><p>
<b>THE TRUTH ABOUT NAFTA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994, Mexico has been suffering its worst economic and political crisis in more than a century. The peso's meltdown sank the myth of Mexico as the standard-bearer of economic reform in the Third World. The &quot;200,000 net new jobs&quot; promised by the Clinton Administration have not materialized, and the U.S. is running a trade deficit with Mexico estimated at $15.83 billion for all of 1995.<sup>3</sup>  Instead of a prosperous partner, Mexico has become a financial ward of the U.S. government. As a result, many Americans now believe that NAFTA caused the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nothing could be further from the truth. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency. A series of political shocks in 1994 caused a sustained run on the peso by nervous Mexican and foreign investors<sup>4</sup>.  But instead of raising domestic interest rates and cutting public spending, the Salinas administration sharply increased public spending and used the country's international reserves to support an overvalued peso. As a result, the peso collapsed. Moreover, it was the devaluation of the peso that crashed the Mexican economy and cheapened the value of Mexican exports. These cheaper Mexican exports account for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious. Thanks to NAFTA, those who favored returning to a closed, statist economy were kept at bay while President Zedillo was able to keep the country on course to capitalist democracy. NAFTA is still the best guarantee that Mexico will become a true capitalist democracy and prosperous trading partner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and U.S. Competitiveness. </b>NAFTA is the best way to stimulate America's growth and competitiveness. Mexico is America's fastest-growing export market and third largest trading partner, as well as a key factor in the international competitiveness of many U.S. industries that have established manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico since the 1960s. These plants enable U.S. manufacturers to compete against low-wage manufactures from China and other Asian countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate 2.5 times greater than U.S. export growth to the rest of the world<sup>5</sup>.  From 1987 to 1993, 48 of the 50 states expanded their merchandise sales to Latin America and the Caribbean, with Mexico absorbing the largest absolute share each year; 17 states expanded their exports to Mexico and Latin America by more than 200 percent during this period, and 15 recorded export growth of more than 100 percent. The biggest state exporters to Mexico and Latin America are Texas, Florida, California, Michigan, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana<sup>6</sup>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America each year, with Mexico absorbing more than half of the total. These exports represent 19 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports and support nearly 1.96 million U.S. jobs. During the first year of NAFTA's implementation in 1994, U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada climbed rapidly. Merchandise exports to Canada, America's largest trading partner, grew by more than 13 percent to $114 billion, while exports to Mexico increased over 22 percent to $51 billion. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.8 percent during 1995 as a result of the peso crisis but at the end of the year still remained well above the total for 1993, the last year before NAFTA went into effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Production-sharing operations along the U.S.-Mexican border, known as <I>maquiladoras</I>, are an important competitive strategy for many American firms competing in the U.S. domestic market with goods made by low-cost Asian producers. For example, products assembled in Mexico's <I>maquiladora</I> industries from U.S.-made components accounted for 48 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and America's National Security</b>. NAFTA is very important to U.S. national security. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are perceived increasingly as threats to this security. By a very large majority, Americans want their government to control and reduce illegal immigration and stop the flow of illegal drugs entering the U.S.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the Mexican peso crisis fanned the American public's concern that the U.S. is being overwhelmed by a flood of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 3 million Mexicans enter the U.S. illegally each year.<sup>9</sup>  More than 80 percent of the cocaine brought into America is transported through Mexico by Mexican drug cartels. Mexican police investigators have disclosed that drug traffickers penetrated the highest levels of the Salinas Administration. Drug-related corruption is widespread within the PRI, Mexico's ruling party, especially at the state level. The police, courts, and military also have been corrupted by Mexican drug traffickers whose operations generate profits in excess of $30 billion a year. 
<P>
NAFTA is America's most valuable foreign policy tool in managing these security threats on its southern flank. In addition to accelerating Mexico's transformation into a capitalist democracy, NAFTA is a foundation on which to develop effective cross-border agreements to deal with the twin threats of illegal immigration and drug trafficking in both countries. With NAFTA promoting closer economic ties between the U.S. and Mexico, governments in both countries will face increased pressure from their respective constituencies to work out effective solutions for cross-border problems that hinder trade, economic growth, and competitiveness.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and Democracy in Mexico. </b>NAFTA is an important anchor for reform in Mexico. The closed, one-party system that spurred Mexico's economic development and guaranteed the country's political stability for over six decades is coming apart at the seams. A pluralist democracy is emerging, but the old statist regime will not surrender quickly or quietly. On January 12, 1996, 255 of the 298 representatives of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) publicly called on the government to &quot;abandon neo-liberalism and grant priority to action against poverty and unemployment.&quot;<sup>10</sup>  Similar demands are being made by other groups, including the left-wing PRD, small and medium business, the rebels in Chiapas, consumer debtor organizations, and farmers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these pressures, President Zedillo has stood firm on Mexico's commitment to market-oriented policies, free trade, and compliance with NAFTA. Zedillo's main political priorities are to encourage the growth of a pluralist and open democracy, establish the rule of law, reform Mexico's judicial system, and eradicate widespread police corruption at the national and local level. Without NAFTA, Zedillo's chances of advancing these political reforms would be very poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>NAFTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas. </B>NAFTA is the foundation upon which the U.S. can negotiate free-trade agreements with other Latin American countries. Latin America is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and the U.S. has been one of the principal beneficiaries of that growth. For over six years, Latin American governments have pursued aggressive policies to liberalize trade. As a result, America's exports to other countries in the Western Hemisphere (including Canada) have increased over 50 percent since 1990, growing from $137 billion to nearly $207 billion in 1994 and creating 1.4 million new jobs for American workers. Overall, two-way trade between the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere jumped over 44 percent between 1990 and 1994, from $292.8 billion to $423 billion. U.S. exports to Latin America accounted for one-fifth of total U.S. exports during 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, for free trade between the U.S. and Latin America to continue growing, NAFTA must be expanded quickly to other countries in the Western Hemisphere, starting with Chile and Argentina. It also should be expanded to include countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore that want to liberalize trade faster than currently envisioned by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NAFTA is the linchpin of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup>11</sup>  It assumes that the best way to achieve both sustained economic development and stable democracy is to expand international trade. The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade and NAFTA without reservations, providing the U.S. an unparalleled foreign policy tool for the expansion of free trade, the consolidation of democracy, and the reaffirmation of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere. NAFTA is also the benchmark trade agreement for the creation by 2005 of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). As long as NAFTA's expansion remains stalled, the U.S. has no effective Latin America policy.
<P>

<b>MEXICO HAS NOT TURNED THE CORNER</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration claims that the worst of the Mexican crisis has passed. Mexico's external accounts are once again in balance, exports soared in 1995, the peso has risen, inflation is slowing, and interest rates have eased from their peak levels of 80 percent to 100 percent in early 1995. Moreover, Mexico has raised over $6 billion from international capital markets since the peso collapsed, and the Zedillo government is meeting the deadlines for repaying the money it owes to the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). <sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, the Clinton Administration's claim that Mexico has &quot;turned the corner&quot;<sup>13</sup> is premature. The Mexican economy contracted between 6 percent and 8 percent during 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz admits that 1995 was the worst year for Mexico since the revolution<sup>15</sup>, although he also projects that the Mexican economy will grow 3 percent in 1996. Yet most private analysts forecast slower growth, more devaluation, and higher inflation because Mexico's banking system is still very weak. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican government already has spent $6.5 billion to bail out the banking system and may have to spend another $10.9 billion during 1996 to keep the system afloat.  In all, the cost of bailing out Mexico's banking system could add up to $20 billion, or more than 12 percent of Mexico's GNP for 1995. Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank, estimates that 30 percent of the Mexican banking system's debts are non-performing.<sup>17</sup>  Moreover, the system's problems may be worse than they appear to be, because Mexican banks book only the interest on past-due loans and not the entire loan, including the principal, as U.S. banks are required to list in their accounting.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another problem for the Mexican economy is the political weakness of President Zedillo. Two national polls conducted in November 1995<sup>19</sup> found that three-quarters of Mexico's voters approve of Zedillo's honesty and commitment to democracy but they give him poor marks on political leadership and ability to manage the economy. Two-thirds of the respondents in both polls disapproved of how Zedillo was governing the country, and over 80 percent said that he should change his cabinet. More than half of those surveyed felt the first two ministries to be changed should be the Finance Ministry and the Trade and Industrial Development Ministry. Compared to a similar poll conducted three months earlier,<sup>20</sup> the November poll indicated less confidence in Zedillo and increasing discontent with how he is managing Mexico's difficulties.
<p>
<b>A MEXICAN FREE-MARKET SOLUTION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's $50 billion bailout has not halted Mexico's downward spiral of devaluation, depression, and eventual default. Clinton ignored the principles of free trade when he went to the aid of the Mexican government. The main beneficiaries were Wall Street speculators and Mexican banks and companies owned by business leaders close to the Salinas regime and the ruling PRI. Moreover, the Administration's decision to bail out Mexico with $20 billion from the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund effectively underwrote the cost of refinancing the Mexican government's entire short-term debt without a U.S. congressional appropriation. Clinton's failed attempt to rescue Mexico also created a moral hazard: It signaled foreign governments and private investors that mistakes caused by political incompetence and corruption will be underwritten by American taxpayers through the U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of correcting the structural causes of the Mexican peso crisis, President Zedillo is repeating the errors of the Salinas administration. The policies of Finance Minister Ortiz are indistinguishable from those pursued by Pedro Aspe, his predecessor during the Salinas government. Pressured by the U.S. Treasury and the IMF, the Zedillo administration is following policies which are destroying Mexico's economy. The Zedillo government is doing everything it can to maintain the Wall Street fiction that Mexico is an investment-grade economy. At bottom, Zedillo's economic policies are intended to keep Mexico safe for portfolio investment, not to promote the sustained export growth that constitutes the only escape route from Mexico's current economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central problem is that Mexico's financial technocrats refuse to consider a fixed exchange rate policy to achieve price stability. Since the peso's collapse, Mexico's central bank has implemented a floating exchange rate regime that allows the country's monetary authorities broad discretionary power to manipulate monetary and currency exchange policies. The problem with this policy is that Mexico's central bank lacks the credibility and international reserves to sustain itself without continued loans from the U.S. government and the IMF.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To achieve price stability under its current floating exchange rate, the Bank of Mexico will have to impose a relatively tight monetary policy and high interest rates. Inevitably, this will be accompanied by very slow economic growth. A sluggish Mexican economy would depress export earnings and foreign investment, making it more difficult for the government to service its foreign debt obligations. Slow economic growth also would fuel increased political turmoil, a revival of statist economic prescriptions, and more illegal migration to the U.S. This could weaken support for NAFTA in both countries and increase cross-border tensions over sensitive issues like drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Only Mexico can devise lasting solutions for the Mexican crisis. NAFTA is vitally important to Mexico's future economic prosperity and democratic stability, but it is only part of the equation. Mexico has yet to go the full distance to capitalist democracy. Moreover, it has yet to devise an effective economic model capable of delivering the sort of sustained growth Chile has managed to achieve since 1985. Natural resources, human capital, and access to technology are not the problems. Mexico has all three in abundance. Missing, however, is the bold, imaginative leadership capable of conceiving and executing a strategy to complete Mexico's transition to capitalist democracy. Ideally, such a strategy would involve five goals:
<p>
<b>1.) Restore confidence in Mexico by stabilizing the currency. </b>This requires replacing the Bank of Mexico with a currency board.<sup>21</sup>  To achieve sustained export growth and price stability, Mexico needs a sound monetary system, which a currency board would provide. The Bank of Mexico's floating exchange rate may be the favored option of Mexico's financial authorities, but it is fundamentally unsound because it allows arbitrary, discretionary control over Mexico's monetary and exchange problems. The principal goals of a currency board would be to fix the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and to eliminate the broad discretionary power (and lack of accountability) of Mexico's financial authorities to manipulate monetary and exchange policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The establishment of a currency board would stabilize the peso virtually overnight and restore confidence in Mexico. It would do so by instituting a non-discretionary, rules-bound, and totally transparent currency exchange regime. A currency board would prohibit public spending above levels that threaten reserves, stimulate more foreign direct investment, and insulate the peso from political interference and bureaucratic tinkering, in addition to quickly reducing inflation and interest rates, thereby spurring an increase in real long-term productive investment in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have used currency boards. In all cases, these boards have produced stable currencies that keep inflation at substantially low levels. No currency board has ever devalued its local money against its reserve currency. Argentina has been using a variant of the currency board since 1991. In every country where a currency board has been established, governments have succeeded in killing the deadly virus of high inflation, lowering local interest rates to manageable levels, and encouraging direct foreign investment in the local economy. The creation of a currency board in Mexico would be the first step in a Mexican free-market solution for the Mexican crisis.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
<b>2.) Break Mexico's addiction to foreign debt. </b>This means restructuring Mexico's banking sector. Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the bailout of Mexico's private banks will cost the equivalent of 12 percent of the country's 1995 GNP.<sup>23</sup>  Debt relief programs created by the Zedillo administration will not work under the current floating exchange rate because higher inflation from the ongoing devaluation of the peso caused by the banking crisis, along with the continuing need to cheapen Mexico's exports, will cause Mexico's domestic debts to increase more rapidly than the ability of debtors to repay them. Moreover, Mexico cannot increase its borrowings from the IMF because it already has exceeded, by a factor of nearly 20, its allowable credit ceiling under existing IMF rules. Complicating matters even more, in November 1995 the Clinton Administration rejected a formal Mexican request for more financial assistance to bail out the banking system.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, the Zedillo government may be tempted to print more pesos to rescue the banks, driving up inflation and keeping interest rates at high levels. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A currency board would create the stable price environment that Mexican banks need to recapitalize and restructure their domestic credit portfolios. Bad debts could be winnowed out of bank portfolios and written off. Collectable consumer and corporate debt could be restructured and securitized,<sup>25</sup> creating a secondary market where domestic debt paper could be traded at a discount. However, the government also should lift all remaining limits on ownership of banks and other commercial enterprises.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<B>3.) Promote sustained economic growth. </B>A key to achieving this goal is liberalizing Mexico's national oil industry.<sup>27</sup>  The Mexican government owns 100 percent of the country's oil and natural gas industry. On February 12, 1996, the Mexican government announced its new energy program for the next five years. The plan is a restatement of Mexico's traditionally anti-market, monopolistic approach to energy development. <sup>28</sup> Jesus Reyes Heroles, president of the state oil monopoly <I>Petroleos Mexicanos</I> (Pemex), predicts that Mexico will attract $6.3 billion in foreign investment in petrochemicals, power plants, and natural gas companies. However, declared Reyes Heroles, no private investment will be permitted in upstream exploration, production, and refining of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Mexico, a better alternative would be to follow the example of more efficient and successful state-owned oil companies. A good model is <I>Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA),</I> which is implementing a mixed-economy expansion program to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.<sup>29</sup>  Without giving up ownership of Mexico's oil and gas reserves, Pemex could contract with small private operators to exploit older and smaller oil and gas reservoirs that are uneconomic for Pemex to operate commercially. In addition, Pemex could enter into long-term associations with large international oil companies to find and develop major oil and gas reservoirs which Pemex is not financially or technologically capable of exploiting by itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As oil and gas export earnings increase, part of the incremental profits could be reinvested in the expansion and modernization of Mexico's oil industry, and part could be deposited directly to the accounts of Mexican workers in privately managed pension funds. Such a strategy would represent a true &quot;nationalization&quot; of the Mexican oil industry, since it would transfer real oil wealth directly to workers and their families, creating a fast-growth domestic savings industry to finance Mexico's economic development with internal savings rather than with crippling external debt. 
<p>
<b>4.) Increase disposable income. </b>Mexico's income tax rate should be cut and income thresholds increased. The top tax rate of 35 percent takes hold at very low levels of income. To spur investment, Mexico should extend its current zero percent capital gains tax rate on large stock exchange companies to all investments.<sup>30</sup>

<p>
<b>5.) Create better legal and political institutions for economic growth. </b>This requires both judicial and political reform. The rule of law and transparent democratic institutions are essential for the well-being and prosperity of successful capitalist democracies. President Zedillo has pledged massive overhaul of the judicial and political systems in Mexico, but efforts on both fronts are not progressing quickly, largely because of increased political discontent and resistance to change fueled by the current economic depression.
<p>
<b>REASSERTING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America is dangerous. The Clinton Administration is projecting an image of retreat. In Mexico, still struggling to overcome its economic difficulties and recover its political stability, there is widespread concern about the depth of Washington's commitment to NAFTA. Throughout Latin America, political leaders trying to promote unpopular free-market reforms are questioning the sincerity of the Clinton Administration's pledge that the U.S. would lead the process of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. The longer America's policy drift continues, the greater the risk that hard-won economic and democratic reforms will be stalled or even rolled back in some countries. Moreover, if Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide. To regain the initiative in Latin America, the U.S. government should: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Comply with NAFTA. </b> The Clinton Administration should respect NAFTA's provisions and timetables for implementation. By cheating on NAFTA, the Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future. Permits for Mexican trucks to circulate in the U.S. border states should be issued without further delay if the vehicles comply with all technical, safety, and legal requirements as stipulated in NAFTA.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico.</B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico, including currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's public-sector debt, illegal immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and other countries. </B>Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. Thus, NAFTA should be expanded to include Chile, and later to include Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chile is a beacon of economic prosperity and democracy for all of Latin America. It has set the standard for success in the region by achieving average growth rates of 6 percent annually every year since 1985, along with inflation of less than 8 percent, unemployment of 5 percent, and savings and domestic investment of 27 percent of GDP. Postponing Chile's admission to NAFTA would slow hemispheric trade integration and weaken American leadership.<sup>31</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Asian countries also should be considered for NAFTA membership. Some members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, are willing to liberalize trade at a much faster pace than is currently envisioned by APEC and may wish to negotiate free trade agreements with the U.S. as quickly as possible. Instead of a series of separate bilateral pacts, incorporating Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore into NAFTA would make sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </b>The current Mexican experiment with a floating exchange rate will fail eventually.<sup>32</sup>  The U.S. should encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board that would fix the peso's exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. The creation of a currency board would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA. Under a currency board, if a run on the peso occurred, the worst that could happen would be the total dollarization of Mexico, since trading would take place in U.S. dollars while the currency board held the stock of Mexican pesos.<sup>33</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development. There is no moral hazard in forgiving Mexico's entire public sector foreign debt, since it will never be repaid in full anyway. Moreover, writing off the public-sector's foreign debt would free Mexico from the IMF's destructive clutches.<sup>34</sup>  The IMF's record in Mexico, an IMF borrower since 1976, has been impoverishment, indebtedness, and dependency.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>For many years, America's war on drugs in the Western Hemisphere has concentrated on the Andean drug trade, with special emphasis on Colombia, while largely ignoring the closer threat of Mexican drug traffickers. However, since the mid-1980s, 19 distinct drug cartels have emerged in Mexico.<sup>36</sup>  President Salinas himself admitted that the annual flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs through Mexico totals some $100 billion annually. The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States. The U.S. and Mexico should begin talks to enhance cooperation in apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican peso crisis weakened support in America for NAFTA, damaged U.S.-Mexico relations, and halted further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Americas for at least the next two years. Moreover, the crisis in Mexico is not over yet: Clinton's $50 billion bailout of the Zedillo government kept Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debt obligations in 1995, but Mexico's downward economic spiral was not reversed. The economic policies of the Zedillo government will not achieve the structural reforms that Mexico needs to avoid another currency collapse. The market's recent surge of optimism in Mexico's recovery therefore may prove to be very short-lived.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the Mexican crisis continues, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow. Conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking easily could displace cooperation on trade and investment. More crisis in Mexico also will fuel opposition in both countries to NAFTA and free trade, possibly delaying NAFTA's implementation in North America and derailing its expansion to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>The Economist</I> argues that NAFTA is one of the principal factors responsible for &quot;a second Mexican revolution,&quot;<sup>37</sup> and asserts that Mexico's successful transformation into a stable capitalist democracy depends on its becoming &quot;more like America.&quot;<sup>38</sup>  More than that of any other country in Latin America, Mexico's future is tied, for better or worse, to the future of the United States. However, the American goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), based on NAFTA's expansion to all democratic countries in the Western Hemisphere, depends on the quick return of economic and political stability to Mexico. As long as the crisis continues in Mexico, it will be difficult for any U.S. Administration to rebuild bipartisan congressional support for NAFTA's expansion and regain public trust and support for free trade. The U.S. needs to work with Mexico, through NAFTA, to help end this economic crisis.

<li>&nbsp;During his State of the Union address to Congress on January 25, 1996, President Clinton announced the appointment of Army General Barry McCaffrey to head the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Although McCaffrey's appointment did not cause any reaction in the U.S., throughout Latin America it was widely seen as a sign that the Clinton Administration plans to militarize the hemispheric war on drugs. Another first was the Administration's decision to deploy local law enforcement officers alongside federal agents already patrolling the U.S. border with Mexico, and to increase the use of armed forces personnel as support for the U.S. Border Patrol.

<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reagan Administration understood that support for democracy and the hemispheric expansion of free trade was the foundation of future U.S. relations with Latin America. During the two Reagan Administrations, the Caribbean Basin Initiative was launched, and the groundwork was laid for a new relationship between the U.S. and Mexico based on the expansion of bilateral trade and investment, closer economic interdependence, and progressive economic liberalization in Mexico. In 1988, the U.S. and Canada signed a Free Trade Agreement that later would serve as the foundation for NAFTA. The Bush Administration's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, launched in 1989, outlined a blueprint for creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA); the first step in achieving the goal of a hemispheric FTAA was the negotiation of the NAFTA with Mexico. When the Clinton Administration was inaugurated in 1993, the NAFTA talks between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada already had been completed. Clinton delayed NAFTA's implementation until 1994 while unnecessary labor and environmental side agreements were negotiated with Mexico and Canada. Moreover, at the Summit of the Americas, Clinton reaffirmed long&#173;standing U.S. policy that NAFTA should be the standard for creating a hemispheric FTAA.
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 29, 1996, the Mexican government repaid the U.S. Treasury $1.3 billion in short&#173;term swaps issued under the U.S.&#173;Mexico Framework Agreement announced by the Clinton Administration on February 21, 1995. In all, $13.5 billion in U.S. funds was disbursed to Mexico from the ESF, of which $10.5 billion in medium&#173;term swaps remains outstanding. The ESF, created by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, has been used since the 1973 demise of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime to intervene in foreign exchange markets and finance short&#173;term loans to developed and developing countries. As of early 1995, the ESF held about $25 billion. The ESF is not financed with regular appropriations from Congress, so it &quot;borrows&quot; from the Federal Reserve when it needs additional funds. These loans are &quot;warehoused&quot; at the Federal Reserve, where the Treasury stores its foreign currencies in exchange for dollars that must be repaid later.

Purchases of consumer durables plunged 47 percent in the first nine months of 1995, and inflation for the year was 51.97 percent, although the price of the &quot;basic basket&quot; of food, medicine, and clothing jumped by 60.57 percent. Over 1 million workers in the formal Mexican economy were laid off. Mexico's Finance Ministry reported that public investment fell by 32.5 percent in the first nine months of 1995, while private investment dropped by 29.4 percent. Overall, gross fixed investment fell by 30 percent during that period, with the domestic component declining by 28.9 percent and the external component by 33.6 percent.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A currency board issues a local currency fully backed by reserve assets denominated in a widely used and respected foreign currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Under a currency board, the peso could be converted into the reserve currency &#173;&#173; in this case the dollar &#173;&#173; at a pre&#173;established fixed rate at any of the board's offices; the local currency supply could expand only in proportion to an increase in net exports or capital inflows; and the board's reserves could be invested in high&#173;quality, interest&#173;bearing notes and bonds denominated in the reserve currency.

<lI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debt crisis of 1982, the U.S. government and the IMF have refinanced, restructured, and rescheduled Mexico's public&#173;sector foreign debt five times, including the so&#173;called Brady Plan put forward in March 1989 by U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady and signed in early 1990. During this period, Mexico rescheduled large amounts of public&#173;sector debt principal, including $19 billion in 1983, $30 billion in 1985, $45 billion in 1987, and $48 billion in 1990, for a total of $123 billion. Yet the Brady Plan, praised in some quarters as the solution to Mexico's debt problems, succeeded in extinguishing only $15 billion of Mexico's foreign debt, or about 16 percent of Mexico's total foreign debt as of 1989.

	As part of congressional budget reconciliation, the House Agriculture Committee considered the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195) on September 20. This legislation, sponsored by Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would significantly change the wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice programs. Before the legislation was considered in committee, Roberts also incorporated serious reform of the dairy program into the Act. With certain modifications, the proposal represents serious reform of America's obsolete farm programs.1<p>	Unfortunately, Chairman Roberts' attempt to provide a beginning for real reform suffered a setback when entrenched special interests, led by the National Cotton Council, succeeded in lining up a majority of the committee to vote against his bill. Nevertheless, the possibility for real reform is not yet dead, because the proposal may be considered again later this week, either by a reconvened House Agriculture Committee or by the House Budget Committee. Because a majority of the members of the House Agriculture Committee already have demonstrated their hostility to reform, the prospects for success appear better in the House Budget Committee.

<p>	Later this week, the Senate Agriculture Committee also will address budget reconciliation, and Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN), who has been an advocate of fundamental reform, may propose incorporation of a number of provisions drawn from the Freedom to Farm Act. Unlike the House, the Senate Agriculture Committee must resist the pressure of entrenched special interests and support the end of farm welfare.
<p>
	While the Freedom to Farm Act proposes reform for some programs, other important programs are overlooked. The Act does not include reform of either the sugar or peanut programs, even though these programs also face reauthorization this year and must be addressed, either in budget reconciliation or in the 1995 farm bill. Their anti-competitive and tightly controlled production systems limit the supply of these commodities while insulating these industries from the demands of the market. Removing supply restrictions will allow these industries to respond more effectively to new market opportunities and contribute to the nation's economic growth.2
<p>
	In July, during consideration of the House agriculture appropriations bill, Chairman Roberts promised reform-minded Members that they would have an opportunity to offer amendments to reform the sugar and peanut programs during floor consideration of the farm bill. These promises, and the argument that Members should wait for the farm bill to offer amendments that change agricultural policy, succeeded temporarily in slowing the drive for reform. But whether these programs are dealt with in the farm bill or in reconciliation, any proposals considered must represent real reform.
<p>
	The Agriculture Committees must not take the politically convenient course and adopt policies that preserve the anti-competitive aspects of the sugar and peanut programs. While the budget reconciliation instructions might provide the impetus for them to accept some sort of phase-down or phase-out of the more expensive commodity programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, there is no similar pressure to reform the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. These programs are different because wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice are supported through subsidies based on what is produced. This amounts to a direct transfer of funds from taxpayers to producers. In no-net-cost programs, however, the commodity is supported through tightly limited production. This amounts to a transfer of funds from consumers to producers at little or no cost to the Treasury. Nevertheless, no-net-cost programs still impose significant economic costs on the nation.

<p>
<a name="sugar"></a><b>REFORMING THE SUGAR PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	The current sugar program operates as a cartel in which a handful of wealthy processors determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country. Production is supported by loans of 18 cents per pound for raw cane and refined beet sugar, an amount determined by a formula that supposedly reflects the relative difference in producer returns for sugar beets and sugarcane. The result is a U.S. price nearly twice as high as the world price. The law requires that this program be operated at "no-net-cost" to the government, which means prices must be maintained at levels high enough to avoid forfeiture to the government. To assure this, the government imposes import quotas and a system of domestic marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar processed for domestic use. While the amount of sugar refined may exceed the marketing allotment, it may not be sold in the United States. This further stifles domestic production.
<P>
	Because there is no cost to the taxpayers,3 defenders of the sugar program argue that it should be preserved. However, this program -- which controls sugar prices, limits imports to keep the prices high, and then dictates how much domestically produced sugar can be sold -- does impose a cost of $1.4 billion annually on U.S. consumers,4 who are forced to pay it through higher prices for products containing sugar. Moreover, consumers are not the only ones hurt. Because of its excessive subsidies, the program has forced a number of refineries that process raw sugar to close, eliminating domestic jobs and displacing workers.
<P>
	There have been discussions within certain segments of the sugar refining industry and among Agriculture Committee members about offering an alternative to the current sugar program that would reduce the support price from 18 cents per pound to 14 cents in the 1996 crop year, 13 cents in the 1997 crop year, and 12 cents in the 1998 crop year. Thus, the support price would have a floor of 12 cents per pound even though the world price is now at about 11 cents per pound and frequently has been much lower. This proposal also would terminate the sugar marketing quota and allotment program, but without making the sugar industry responsive to the world market price. It therefore fails to correct the problems of the current system.
<P>
	The sugar program is big government and corporate welfare at their worst. Almost half of its $1.4 billion in benefits goes to one percent of sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and one Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone.5
<P>
	The Sugar Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 1687), introduced by Representatives Dan Miller (R-FL) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and a Senate companion bill (S. 847) introduced by Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Bill Bradley (D-NJ) represent real reform that would benefit both farmers and consumers. Both the support price and the domestic marketing allotments would be eliminated immediately, allowing farmers to produce sugar to meet the demands of a free market. Unfortunately, all proposals introduced so far maintain existing import restrictions which artificially raise domestic prices for consumers. If the sugar program was eliminated, a market-oriented and internationally competitive policy would provide both reasonable sweetener prices and adequate supplies.
<p>

<a name="peanut"></a><b>REFORMING THE PEANUT PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	Incredibly, the peanut program actually restricts the right of Americans to produce peanuts. By establishing a quota system, it gives a limited few the exclusive right, based on inheritance or purchase, to produce peanuts in the United States for the U.S. market at a guaranteed high level of price support. These "quota" peanuts are supported at a much higher price ($678 per ton) than non-quota or "additional" peanuts, which are supported at $132 per ton. Only quota peanuts can be marketed in the U.S., while non-quota peanuts must be exported, sold to a processor responsible for exporting them, or sold to the government. To protect holders of peanut quotas even more from the effects of competition, peanut imports also are severely restricted. 
<P>
	 The peanut program is unfair not only to any farmer that would like to grow peanuts but cannot obtain a license, but also to those who succeed in buying or renting the right to produce peanuts. Two-thirds of those who own peanut growing licenses are not farmers, so farmers often must rent licenses from others. In fact, this usually is the most significant cost of producing peanuts. Although the cost of this program to taxpayers has been growing in recent years, the greatest cost falls on consumers who -- again -- are forced to pay higher prices.
<P>
	Proponents of maintaining the status quo are not concerned with the cost to consumers. They want to make the peanut program into another "no-net cost" program in the hope of preventing radical change. One way to do this is by merely reducing the support for quota peanuts from $678 a ton to $600 or $550 a ton. But while this approach might reduce the cost to taxpayers temporarily, based on current market prices, there is no assurance that costs would remain limited in the longer term. Nor would there be any expected reduction in the $300 million the program annually costs consumers; if world prices drop, the cost of the domestic program will increase.
<p>
	The only way to be sure that there is no cost while retaining the present structure is to restrict production further by reducing the amount of quota peanuts that can be produced. But, such a regressive action would penalize domestic consumers even more while reinforcing the barriers to entry in growing peanuts. Defenders of the status quo also have suggested that reducing the amount of quota peanuts -- in other words, reduce the supply to inflate the price -- could reduce the cost of the program.
<P>
	Such "reform" proposals are nothing but a hoax. The peanut program, like the sugar program, is beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can improve it. The only genuine reform of the peanut program is contained in the Peanut Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 2008), introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Andrew Jacobs (D-IN), and the companion Senate bill (S. 1027) introduced by Senators Hank Brown (R-CO) and Bill Bradley. These proposals would eliminate the program immediately. In addition, Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Richard Lugar have introduced S. 1188, which would phase out the quota system by the year 2000. Ending the quota and allotment systems will benefit farmers directly by removing one of the most significant costs of production -- rental of quotas -- and ending the discrimination against U.S.-grown non-quota peanuts. Eliminating the unproductive overhead costs will increase the share of consumer expenditures returned to the producer while, at the same time, increased domestic production of lower-cost peanuts will benefit the American consumer directly.
<p>

<p>


<a name="dairy"></a><b>REFORMING THE DAIRY PROGRAM</b>
<p>

	The dairy program guarantees that the federal government will purchase, at an established price, unlimited quantities of surplus cheese, butter, and dried milk. The law provides a mechanism by which the guaranteed purchase price can be lowered or raised, depending upon whether the government's purchases are expected to exceed or fall short of a preestablished level. Under no circumstance, however, can the support price drop below a floor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.
<P>
	When government guarantees that it will purchase any surplus production that cannot be sold in the marketplace, producers have no incentive to compete against each other. Thus, incentives for efficiency and innovation also disappear. Processors have no incentive to take the risks necessary to develop new products demanded by American and foreign consumers, so the industry is sluggish and unresponsive to the ever-changing demands of both domestic and international markets. 
<p>
	In addition, the nation's milk supply is regulated by an unbelievably complex and archaic system of federal milk marketing orders. Ostensibly designed to assure adequate supplies in all regions of the country, these marketing orders restrict the sale of milk between different regions. These pricing policies tend to raise the effective support price in high-cost regions of the country, encouraging farmers to increase production instead of permitting fluid milk to be shipped in profitably from lower cost regions. It is estimated that milk marketing orders cost consumers between $621 million and $851 billion in 1985 (in 1995 dollars, from $839 million to $1.15 billion).6  The program has hindered the U.S. dairy industry's ability to take advantage of the export market. There should be no restrictions on where milk is sold or marketed and no government attempts to manipulate interstate commerce in dairy products.
<p>
	However, the industry's reform proposal would make the situation even worse. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has outlined a proposal that would eliminate price supports for butter and powder. But it would retain price support for cheese, require the Secretary of Agriculture to buy about 2.4 billion pounds of dairy products, and mandate an increase in price supports, thereby further pushing up prices. By keeping the support price on cheese and requiring additional payments when lower world market-priced butter is used to produce other U.S. products, this proposal would insulate American dairy producers from the impact of eliminating price supports on butter and powder.
<p>
	In effect, this proposal would establish a two-tiered pricing system with a lower export price on butter and nonfat dry milk and a higher domestic price on fluid milk and cheese. U.S. manufacturers of products which use nonfat dried milk would be required to pay a higher price for that ingredient than would foreign manufacturers using the same U.S. product. This amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers.
<p>
	The expectation is that decoupling nonfat dry milk and butter from support prices would cause prices for these commodities to fall to world market levels and become competitive in international trade. However, requiring a higher price on nonfat dry milk and butter used as a domestic food ingredient would lead to a two-tier system for nonfat dry milk, with a higher price for domestic purposes than for international purposes. Ice cream, cheese, or confectionery manufacturers and bakers in the U.S. would be required to pay more for nonfat dry milk used to produce their products than would manufacturers in other countries using U.S.-made nonfat dry milk.
<p>
	Such a two-tiered pricing system not only would violate the GATT agreement, but also would make it virtually impossible for U.S. manufacturers of value-added products to compete in the world market. This will discourage expansion of that increasingly important potential export market while providing even more barriers to entry for those who are not in the industry at the present time, further limiting growth in the domestic market where 98 percent of U.S. production is consumed.
<P>
	The NMPF proposal also includes consolidating the 40 or so existing milk marketing orders into 8 to 12 market order areas. There have been other suggestions that existing federal and state milk market orders be consolidated into a single national order for all milk produced in the United States, thereby dramatically increasing the federal government's control over the marketing of milk. But consolidating milk marketing orders does nothing to reduce the federal government's involvement in and regulation of the dairy industry. In fact, mere consolidation will make the already unresponsive pricing system even less responsive to market forces.
<P>
	Two recent proposals represent real reform. For a time, there was only the Dairy Freedom Act introduced by Representative Thomas Petri (R-WI), which would end the trade-restrictive marketing orders on January 1, 1996, and phase out the dairy support program over five years. More recently, however, Chairman Roberts has incorporated a dairy reform proposal by Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI), Chairman of the Dairy Subcommittee. Similar to what Chairman Roberts has proposed for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice in the Freedom to Farm Act, Gunderson's proposal would eliminate the milk marketing orders' pricing and regulatory functions on July 1, 1996, and end the price support program on January 1, 1996, replacing it with transition payments to be made over the next seven years.

<a name="concl"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	If the House and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairmen can overcome the entrenched special interests standing in the way of reform and report the Freedom to Farm Act out of their respective committees, their committees will be making history by setting the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs on the path to reform. However, the true test of sweeping, fundamental reform will come when Congress decides what to do with the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. Incremental changes are not enough. Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs:  either outright elimination or reform comparable to what both Chairmen have proposed for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. By doing so, Congress will benefit farmers and signal clearly to the rest of the world that the United States intends to pursue an aggressively pro-growth agricultural policy into the 21st century.7<p><b>Endnotes:</b><ol><li>For a complete discussion of changes needed to improve the Freedom to Farm Act, see John E.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait is among the most important
challenges for American foreign policy in early 1996. Ever since
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the
United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating
Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of
force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and
even larger maneuvers are underway as Taiwan moves toward its
scheduled March 23 presidential election. China continues to reserve
the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare
independence. If a military clash were to occur, even a limited
one, tremendous damage would be done, both to Taiwan and to U.S.-China
relations. Failure to deter conflict also would be regarded in
Asia as a failure of U.S. leadership.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At stake in Taiwan is not only the peace and security of the region,
but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. With a population of
only 21 million, the ROC is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner,
right behind China itself. After martial law ended in 1987, the
ROC embarked on political reforms that soon will transform Taiwan
into a full democracy. Last December, free and fair elections
were held for the ROC Legislative Yuan<sup>1</sup>; and this March 23, Taiwan
will hold its first direct presidential election. The ROC is the
first full democracy in the history of the Chinese people. Taiwan
is thus a model for political reform on the mainland.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In response to the ROC's growing international stature, China
has mounted a campaign of diplomatic pressure and military intimidation
against Taiwan. On one level, these threats are directed at political
forces in Taiwan calling for independence from China<sup>2</sup>. But they
are aimed also at Taiwan's emerging democracy. Beijing's threats
have been reinforced by demonstrations of force, including large-scale
military exercises and tests of nuclear-capable missiles near
the ROC. These actions have not depressed the democratic enthusiasm
of the people of Taiwan, but they have weakened business confidence
on the island. Even larger military exercises will be held in
the days leading up to the March 23 presidential election.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bill Clinton's failure to respond adequately to Chinese saber-rattling
in the South China Sea and against Taiwan fosters an impression
of American weakness. Several statements by Clinton Administration
officials to the effect that the U.S. will not defend Taiwan if
attacked are potentially even more destabilizing. Hard-liners
in Beijing have been encouraged to step up dangerous military
pressure against Taiwan. President Clinton therefore must take
strong but measured steps to convey to Beijing America's clear
interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Congress can
play an important role as well in reaffirming America's traditional
bipartisan support for the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Thus, the
Administration and Congress should:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
<li>Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
The perception that the U.S. would not respond to a Chinese attack
will only embolden Beijing.<BR>

<P>
<li>Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully.<BR>

<P>
<li>Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. China should be told it may face economic sanctions,
ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a
full U.S. economic embargo, and that the U.S. does not rule out
using force to defend Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li>Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li><B>Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act. These may include advanced air-to-air missiles,
conventional submarines, and missile defense systems. <BR>
</B>
<P>
<li><B>Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by
deploying missile defenses. </B>China's demonstrated willingness
to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan underscores
the need to defend U.S. forces in Asia from this threat. <BR>
</ul><BR>


<P>
<b>GROWING DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN: THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN ELECTIONS</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan is the foremost lawmaking branch of the ROC
government. The December 2 Legislative Yuan elections represented
a milestone in the democratic reform process begun by former President
Chiang Ching-kuo when he lifted martial law in 1987. The elections
emphatically demonstrated the deepening of Taiwan's own democratic
political culture. Today, Taiwan's democracy includes aspects
common to all advanced democracies: competitive multi-party competition,
professionally managed and transparent voting procedures, effective
public debate, and citizen faith in the election process. This
faith was illustrated by the impressive turnout of 67.65 percent
of Taiwan's 14.2 million voting-age citizens. This occurred without
compulsory voting laws. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The elections preserved the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party's narrow
majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan. The KMT won 85 seats,
but its total declined by 11 seats. The main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) made only modest gains, from 50 to 54.
Meanwhile, the New Party, a recently formed conservative party,
went from 0 to 21 seats. Because party discipline in Taiwan is
lax, the KMT will have to form coalitions in order to conduct
the business of government. Thus, the results of the election
offer prospects for the development of a culture of compromise,
a necessary element common to all advanced democracies.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The December 2 elections were judged universally to be fair and
democratic. On election day, an observer team organized by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> visited several polling stations in Central
Taipei, witnessing voting procedures that Taiwanese appeared to
regard as routine. There was little tension because the procedures
were well known. Confidence in the secrecy and security of the
ballots is well established. That evening, the Heritage delegation
visited the National Vote Tallying Center, where computerized
tallying produced national results well before 10:00 p.m. There
were no accusations of fraud to challenge the integrity of the
process. University of Florida Professor James Robinson also noted
that &quot;Taiwan at present compares favorably with its democratic
peers in conducting fair elections.&quot;<sup>3</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan elections were dominated by domestic issues.
Political and economic issues included criticism of KMT &quot;money
politics,&quot; a perceived slowdown in the economy, accusations
of government corruption, veterans benefits, and the personalities
of the candidates. In contrast to previous elections, many observers
noted that vote-buying was much less a problem in this election.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Independence and Intimidation. </B>China's military intimidation
played a lesser role in the December elections than many expected.
Some have noted that the impressive gains made by the New Party
(NP) and the defeat of one-third of the Democratic Progressive
Party's incumbents reflect opposition to Taiwan independence.
The NP strictly opposes independence and criticizes the KMT for
covertly seeking it, while the DPP advocates independence from
China despite Beijing's repeated threat to invade Taiwan if this
were to occur. In the middle of the spectrum between the NP and
the DPP, the KMT wants peaceful unification with a reformed mainland
over the long term but, in the interim, seeks to expand Taipei's
international recognition short of formal independence. The Heritage
delegation concluded that domestic issues played a far greater
role in voting preferences than did the independence issue. The
delegation also concluded that China's military threats did not
sway the Taiwanese people significantly. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE MARCH 23 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The democratic process begun by the legislative elections last
year will be consummated this year by the presidential elections
on March 23.<sup>4</sup> The front-runner in this election is KMT incumbent
President Lee Teng-hui. Lee is the first native-born Taiwanese
to become President and has followed his predecessor, President
Chiang Ching-kuo, in advancing democratic reforms. Lee has opposed
the DPP on the issue of independence from China but has sought
vigorously to raise Taiwan's international status by seeking to
join international organizations like the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the World Trade Organization, and the
United Nations. President Lee also has pressed for greater diplomatic
support from the United States. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lee will face three opponents in the election. Peng Ming-min of
the Democratic Progressive Party is a former political exile and
is regarded as the intellectual godfather of the pro-independence
movement. Two other candidates come from factions of the KMT.
Lin Yang-kang, former President of Taiwan's Judicial Yuan, is
supported by the New Party, which opposes both independence and
Lee Teng-hui. Also running on an independent ticket is Chen Li-an,
former President of the Control Yuan, a government watchdog body.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CHINA'S THREAT TO PEACE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last year, China has deliberately increased tension in
the Taiwan Strait. Beijing views Taipei's attempts to gain admittance
to the United Nations and President Lee's private visit to the
U.S. last June as efforts to advance the cause of an independent
Taiwan. However, China's leaders have an even greater fear: A
free and democratic Taiwan stands as a threat to the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party's political dictatorship. Thus,
Taiwan's democracy and place in the world stand as important issues
in China's own ongoing political transition. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Threats of Missile Strikes. </B>Since 1994, China has mounted
three major military exercises near Taiwan. In September and October
1994, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted combined air,
land, and sea exercises on Chou Shan Island, about 60 miles south
of ROC-held Quemoy Island. At the time, Assistant Secretary of
State Winston Lord described these exercises as &quot;the most
expansive... that China has conducted in 40 or 50 years.&quot;
In June and July of last year, the PLA conducted a similar series
of exercises near Taiwan. These exercises concluded with the firing
of four 1,125-mile range DF-21 and two 375-mile range M-9 missiles
to an area about 100 miles north of the ROC.<sup>5</sup> Both missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads. These tests
mark the first time China has used missiles to threaten an opponent.<sup>6</sup>
Finally, right before the Legislative Yuan elections, in late
November, Chinese President Jaing Zemin personally presided over
large-scale combined-arms amphibious and airborne assault exercises
designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan. These exercises involved
about 20,000 troops, in addition to about 40 ships and 100 aircraft.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China has scheduled more exercises for 1996 and has been deploying
forces to Fujian Province, across the strait from Taiwan, for
large-scale military exercises planned for late February.<sup>7</sup> These
exercises may involve up to 100,000 troops and China's most modern
combat aircraft, the Sukhoi SU-27 and J-8II jet fighters.<sup>8</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Beijing also has threatened to use force against Taiwan. Before
the December Legislative Yuan elections, China used the Hong Kong
press to discuss the possible invasion and occupation of one of
the ROC's offshore islands, followed by a naval blockade of the
Taiwan Strait. These threats were designed to compel Taipei to
begin reunification talks on Beijing's terms. Even more alarming,
former Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles
Freeman, following meetings in China, reportedly has told the
Administration that while China &quot;prefers negotiation to combat,&quot;
it &quot;has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan
consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China does not have the capability to invade and conquer the ROC,
but it does have the capability to do significant harm. Last November's
amphibious exercise involved only a single PLA division, but the
effort required civilian ships to support the PLA Navy.<sup>10</sup> However,
the PLA can cause substantial damage to Taiwan by mining ports,
undertaking a limited blockade with its five nuclear-powered and
45 conventional-powered attack submarines, and conducting a terror
campaign with conventional missile strikes. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; To counter Chinese submarines, the ROC Navy has only two modern
conventional submarines. Moreover, the ROC lacks anti-missile
systems, and China conceivably could take Quemoy or Matsu, small,
fortified islands near the coast of China, albeit at heavy cost
to its invading forces. Even such limited PLA action might lead
to air battles that would reduce the number of ROC combat aircraft.
In addition to any physical damage, such a limited campaign against
Taiwan could depress public and economic confidence. Shipping
insurance rates would skyrocket, and foreign investors would be
deterred. ROC officials estimate that after the PLA missile tests
last July, capital flight amounted to $5 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Unification By Force? </B>The PRC is stepping up its efforts
to intimidate the ROC, but it may be preparing for a more decisive
confrontation with Taiwan early in the next decade. In a speech
on January 30 Premier Li Peng, the second most powerful Chinese
leader, said that &quot;During the period of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan [years 1996 to 2000] the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau. Therefore, settling
the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese
people.&quot; Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that
the &quot;the important role to be played by the Army in taking
back Taiwan&quot; was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting
Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. This meeting reportedly also endorsed military modernization
plans, including a decision to build China's first aircraft carrier.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China indeed is modernizing its armed forces. Beijing has purchased
four advanced Kilo-class conventional submarines from Russia that
are far more capable than the older Soviet-based submarines currently
used by China. The PLA Navy is building modern missile-armed destroyers
and frigates. Reports of a pending deal in which China may buy
over 70 advanced Russian SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> fighters, which
will entail co-production of this aircraft, indicate the PLA could
have over 100 of this type in about five years.<sup>12</sup> This aircraft
has superior range and may be armed already with AA-11 <I>Archer</I>
air-to-air missiles, which would threaten the U.S. F-16s the ROC
plans to put into service in 1997<sup>13</sup>. Moreover, China may be seeking
to purchase Russian or Israeli AWACS early warning and air-combat
management aircraft, which would be essential in establishing
air superiority over the Taiwan Strait.<sup>14</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>WHY THE ROC DESERVES STEADFAST AMERICAN SUPPORT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though Washington ended formal diplomatic relations with Taipei
in favor of Beijing in 1978, a long-standing bipartisan consensus
in the U.S., expressed in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, has
supported strong informal ties with the ROC. There are three reasons
why maintaining strong relations with Taipei is in America's interest.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #1:</b> The ROC is America's seventh largest trading partner,
following immediately behind the PRC. In 1995, trade with the
ROC totaled $47 billion. While Taipei maintains a $5.8 billion
trade surplus with America in manufactured goods, the U.S. had
a surplus of $1.5 billion in the export of services in 1994. Taipei
has a good track record of responding to U.S. concerns about trade
barriers, though differences still exist in the areas of intellectual
property rights protection, access to banking and insurance markets,
and some tariffs. Nevertheless, The Heritage Foundation has rated
Taiwan's economy as the eighth freest in the world, right behind
the U.S.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #2:</b> The Republic of China's transition to full democracy
reflects America's own commitment to democracy. When democratization
is completed after the country's first direct presidential election
in March, the ROC deserves to be considered a democratic ally
of the United States. The persistence of the Taiwanese people
in building their own democratic institutions and traditions despite
internal and external pressures is a testament to their courage
and determination. The American people traditionally have admired
democracies and often have come to their aid when threatened.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #3:</b> Taiwan's democracy could have a positive influence
on China. China is experiencing a critical leadership transition
as President Jiang Zemin seeks to consolidate his power as Deng
Xiaoping fades from the scene. Over the last decade, Deng's economic
reforms have produced double-digit economic growth and expanded
economic freedom. Taiwan is well placed to advance this trend.
Despite the deep-seated political antipathy of China's leadership
toward Taiwan, both sides have rapidly increased their economic
and personal interaction in recent years. ROC-PRC trade now exceeds
$20 billion annually, and millions of Taiwanese have visited the
mainland for business and family reasons. The success of Taiwan's
democratic reforms could influence mainland attitudes toward political
reform in a positive way as more mainlanders learn how Taiwanese
enjoy both political freedom and economic prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>STRENGTHENING DETERRENCE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring China from taking military action against Taiwan will
be a major test of American leadership in Asia. Since 1979, three
American Presidents have provided the leadership necessary to
protect U.S. interests in cross-straits relations. That China
now feels emboldened to threaten military action against Taiwan
indicates that it senses political weakness in Washington. This
is understandable because the Clinton Administration has failed
to make clear to Beijing that its military moves are unacceptable.
When China occupied Philippine-claimed reefs in the South China
Sea in February 1995 &#173;&#173; causing alarm throughout Southeast
Asia &#173;&#173; the Clinton Administration did not issue a statement
of &quot;concern&quot; until the following May. When China &quot;tested&quot;
six nuclear-capable missiles only 100 miles north of Taiwan last
July, the Clinton Administration again did nothing but issue a
mild statement of &quot;concern.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration may have contributed to the uncertainty
in another way. In the October 30, 1995, issue of <I>U.S. News
&amp; World Report</I>, an unnamed State Department official discounted
the possibility of direct U.S. military action if Taiwan was attacked,
saying that &quot;we would not be in a position to react with
force. We would not elect to do that I'm sure.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Others in
the Administration have coined the term &quot;deliberate ambiguity&quot;
to describe U.S. policy in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
Late last year, former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye
told Chinese officials that &quot;we don't know and you don't
know&quot; how the U.S. would respond to an attack against Taiwan.<sup>17</sup>
Is it any surprise that, only three months later, Beijing is readying
another series of large military exercises designed to intimidate
Taiwan? <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The United States cannot afford to continue this policy of timidity.
President Clinton and Congress must work together to rebuild confidence
in American leadership and strengthen deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. They should:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
Perhaps the most important message that Washington can send Beijing
is a forceful reaffirmation of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
It was the intent of Congress in 1979 that the U.S. maintain the
ability to ensure that Taiwan's defense needs were met and that
China understand America's interest in a peaceful resolution of
Taiwan's future. The elements of the TRA which convey this intent
are:<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
Sec. 2 (b): It is the policy of the United States &#173;&#173;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish
relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation
that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by
other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and
of grave concern to the United States;<BR>

<P>
(6) to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or
the social or the economic system, of the people of Taiwan. <BR>

<P>
Sec. 3 (a):... the United States will make available to Taiwan
such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability.<BR>

<P>
(c) The President is directed to inform the Congress promptly
of any threat to the security or the social or economic system
of the people of Taiwan and any danger to the interests of the
United States arising therefrom.<BR>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should remind China that these sections
of the TRA convey the clear intent of the American people. The
Administration also should make clear that the U.S. retains the
option to come to Taiwan's defense if it is attacked.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The TRA is a critical element in Washington's ability to deter
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. However, it is the Clinton Administration's
consistent weakness in the face of aggressive Chinese behavior
which threatens to undermine the value of the TRA. The Administration
should emphasize to Chinese officials that the TRA is a U.S. law
that guides American policy. To strengthen this message, early
in this legislative session, Congress should pass a joint resolution
reaffirming the TRA. Furthermore, it should insist that the Administration
fulfill its obligations under the Act, including its responsibility
to report to Congress any threats to the security of Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully. To bolster confidence
in Taipei, the Administration and Congress should acknowledge
Taiwan's emerging democracy. A former President or former Secretary
of State should be asked to lead the U.S. delegation to the inauguration
of the new ROC President. Taiwan's evolution toward democracy
belies the notion promoted by some Asians that democracy is not
suited to the Asian character.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At the same time, Washington should privately urge both Beijing
and Taipei to resume the cross-straits dialogue which began in
1991 but was suspended last year. Washington should make clear
to both sides that they bear the main responsibility in resolving
their differences. Nevertheless, Washington should stress regularly
to Beijing that, given Taiwan's democratic evolution, blatant
threats will prove increasingly counterproductive.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. The Clinton Administration should warn China privately
of the consequences that would follow direct military action against
Taiwan. The Administration should warn China that, depending on
the degree of damage it inflicts on Taiwan, it could expect sanctions
ranging from the ending of most-favored-nation trade status to
a total trade embargo with confiscation of all Chinese assets
in the U.S., and that the U.S. will not rule out using force to
defend Taiwan. China also should be told that these sanctions
would likely receive wide support in the U.S. Congress and that
the U.S. will lead a vigorous campaign to press other allies to
join them. Finally, China should be told that if it attacks Taiwan,
the U.S. will undertake a fundamental reevaluation of its relations
with China, in which policies of economic and political &quot;engagement&quot;
could give way to policies that focus on China's breach of the
peace. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan. The Clinton Administration
should order an aircraft carrier task group to be on station in
international waters near Taiwan during the period before and
after the March 23 election. This would demonstrate the U.S. commitment
to deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait and to maintaining
freedom of the seas.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act. It has been U.S. policy since 1979 to sell the ROC defensive
weapons sufficient to deter Chinese attack. As a response to China's
acquisition of the SU-27 from Russia in 1991, the Bush Administration
sold Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters in 1992. Should China's growing
military capabilities again threaten to tilt the military equilibrium
in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. should be prepared to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons to redress the balance. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's purchase of additional SU-27s and its intention to co-produce
many more of this aircraft are troubling in this regard. The F-16's
combat range and weapons already are inferior to those of the
SU-27. Washington should provide the ROC advanced armaments for
the F-16, such as the advanced medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAM missile,
giving ROC F-16s a technological margin that ensures deterrence.
In addition, the U.S. should allow U.S. shipbuilders to sell conventional
submarines to Taiwan. The U.S. is the only country willing to
supply this sorely needed defensive system to the ROC. Likewise,
in view of the PRC's missile tests near Taiwan last July, it is
essential that the U.S. offer Taiwan advanced versions of the
Patriot missile defense system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Should China attack Taiwan, the U.S. should be prepared &#173;&#173;
consistent with the TRA &#173;&#173; to resupply rapidly the ROC's
military weapons and munitions stocks. If China follows through
on threats to impose a naval blockade, the U.S. may have to supply
naval ordnance and replace ROC frigates that are lost. A naval
blockade also could lead to air battles, and the U.S. should be
prepared to advance delivery of F-16s and, more important, to
resupply combat missile stocks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by deploying
missile defenses. To deter China, the U.S. as soon as possible
should deploy not only theater missile defenses in Asia, but also
a national missile defense system to protect Americans. China's
willingness to use short-range nuclear-capable missiles to terrorize
countries in Asia was demonstrated by its missile tests 100 miles
north of Taiwan last July. Since then, Chinese officials reportedly
have told former Assistant Secretary Charles Freeman that China
may use conventionally armed missiles to terrorize Taiwan. Another
official stated that U.S. leaders &quot;care more about Los Angeles
than they do about Taiwan.&quot; Freeman reportedly viewed this
statement as a thinly veiled Chinese threat to use nuclear missiles
against the U.S. if it intervened to help protect Taiwan. Thus,
it is essential that the U.S. accelerate development and deployment
of theater anti-missile systems like the Navy's Upper Tier and
the Army's THAAD missiles. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats also make imperative the deployment of a national
missile defense system to defend Americans. As it threatens Taiwan
with missile strikes, China also may threaten the U.S. with nuclear
blackmail in the future. China is building up its nuclear missile
arsenal to include mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles.
A national missile defense system must be deployed to counter
this threat.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats against Taiwan are designed primarily to intimidate
the people on the eve of their first direct presidential election.
But they also stand as a challenge to the United States. Since
the 1950s, successive American Presidents have met this challenge
by ensuring adequate deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. But by reacting
timidly to China's military provocations in 1995, and even suggesting
that the U.S. would not come to Taiwan's assistance if attacked,
the Clinton Administration is undermining deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should begin immediately to reverse
this record of weakness. It should take steps to ensure that China
understands that the United States will not tolerate an attack
on Taiwan. Congress and the President should reaffirm the Taiwan
Relations Act, which will reassure Taiwan and warn China of U.S.
resolve, while urging both Beijing and Taipei to seek a peaceful
solution to their differences. If Beijing persists in its threats,
Washington should be prepared to deploy U.S. naval forces to help
deter Chinese military action against Taiwan. In the worst case,
if China does attack, the U.S. should be prepared to resupply
ROC military forces. Washington also must not rule out using U.S.
forces in Asia to help defend Taiwan.<BR>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.

<b>Total&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $1.8 billion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.
<BR>

<P>
<b>1. AmeriCorps&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $427 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<P>
<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<P>
<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

on February 24, 1996, proves once again that Fidel Castro will
never allow real economic and democratic reforms in Cuba. The
Castro regime is lying when it claims that the downed aircraft
were inside the 12-mile territorial limit recognized by international
law. The first aircraft shot down was approximately five miles
north of Cuban airspace, and the second was at least 16 nautical
miles north of Cuban airspace. Four American citizens were killed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As usual, the Clinton Administrations rhetoric was sharp, but its initial actions were timid.  In fact, the President did not get tough with Castro until it became clear that there was strong bipartisan support in Congress for immediate tightening of the economic sanctions against Castro.  As a result, on February 28, 1996, the Administration and Congress finally reached agreement on a new version of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (H.R. 927, the "Libertad" bill) that is much tougher than the House and Senate versions passed last fall.  The new provisions include:
<p><ul>
<li> A section that gives the weight of law to all executive orders and regulations regarding Cuba, thereby ensuring that the economic embargo against Cuba cannot be lifted by presidential order unless there is a democratic transition in Cuba without Castro.
<p>
<li> The mandatory denial of U.S. visas to anyone -- corporate officers, principals, or shareholders -- who acquires or uses American-owned property confiscated in Cuba by the Castro regime.
<p>
<li> The inclusion of Title III, allowing U.S. citizens to use American courts to sue foreign companies and individuals who buy confiscated property in Cuba.  This was not in the bill approved by the Senate last fall.  However, to win Clintons support, congressional negotiators agreed to language that gives the President the authority to waive the implementation of Title III for six-month periods.  Since the waiver can be renewed, this means that Title III could be delayed indefinitely.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Administration and Congress hailed the compromise package as the toughest bill ever passed to bring about the demise of Castro.  However, while passage of the "Libertad" bill is a major step forward, Castro's regime is not likely to be very impressed.  In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force. Specifically, the U.S. government should:


























<P><ul>
<li><b> Announce that the U.S. will enforce international laws in the region.</b> This means that Cuba's so-called Air Defense Zone ends
at the 12-mile limit established by international law, not the
24th parallel as claimed by the Castro regime. The U.S. should
make clear to Cuba that any more attacks against civilian aircraft
or boats outside Cuba's 12-mile territorial limit will prompt
an immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces.
To make sure Castro gets the point, U.S. warplanes should patrol
the Florida Straits below the 24th parallel and should respond
to any provocation by Cuban air, sea, or ground-based forces both
immediately and forcefully. A similar policy was pursued with
regard to Libya. In February 1986, U.S. Navy aviators shot down
two Libyan MIGs threatening them in international airspace over
the Gulf of Sidra.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Inform Castro that a new refugee crisis will be considered a
hostile act against the national security of the United States.</b>
The Castro regime has agreed to abide by the immigration act signed
in 1995 between the U.S. and Cuba. This agreement stipulates that
up to 20,000 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s will be issued visas
annually, that the Castro government will not permit any new mass
departures by sea of illegal Cuban immigrants, and that any Cubans
intercepted at sea by U.S. naval forces will be repatriated to
a Cuban port. The U.S. should insist that all aspects of this
agreement be respected by all parties. <BR>

<P>
<li><b>Ban all cash remittances to Cuba from the U.S.</b> This undoubtedly
would affect many Cubans who depend on regular remittances from
their relatives in the U.S., but it also would deprive the Castro
regime of a source of hard currency that now totals over $500
million a year.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by American citizens.</b> This prohibition
should include journalists, academics, and business people and
should be extended to include visits by way of third countries.
Similarly, Cuban journalists, academics, and other professionals
should not be granted visas to visit the U.S. until the Castro
regime allows independent Cuban professionals and opposition leaders
the same travel privileges it allows its communist apparatchiks.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that U.S. countermeasures are aimed at Castro, not the
Cuban people.</b> Radio and television broadcasts to Cuba on Radio
Mart&iacute; and TV Mart&iacute; should be expanded to inform
the Cuban people that U.S. economic sanctions are directed not
at the Cuban people, but at Fidel and Raul Castro. To undermine
the Castro regime's efforts to rally the support of the Cuban
people with anti-American communist propaganda, the U.S. should
launch a vigorous, sustained effort to inform them that when Castro
leaves power, the U.S. will lift the trade embargo, quickly restore
Cuba's most favored nation status, and remain committed to supporting
the economic and democratic reconstruction of Cuba. To make sure
the broadcasts are beamed into Cuba, U.S. aircraft with broadcasting
equipment should be stationed permanently in the international
skies over the Florida Straits to break the Cuban government's
jamming efforts. Any aggressive acts against these aircraft by
Cuban forces should be countered immediately by American Navy
and Air Force units patrolling the area.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Impose tight controls over the activities and movements of Cuban
officials in the U.S.</b> Efforts by the Castro regime to spread its
lies and propaganda in the U.S. should be banned. If the regime
does not allow democratic and human rights groups to meet freely
and openly in Cuba, and does not allow Americans to participate
in such meetings, the U.S. should not allow Cuban officials to
participate in any similar events within the United States. Moreover,
any Cuban official who violates this restriction should be expelled
from the U.S.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that the U.S. opposes activation of the nuclear reactor
in Cuba.</b> The U.S. should make clear to Castro that America will
not allow Cuba to build and operate a nuclear reactor on the island,
even if the reactor is to be used only for electrical power generation.
Since 1991, construction of a nuclear reactor near Cienfuegos,
about 130 miles east of Havana on Cuba's southern coast, has been
stopped by a lack of funding to complete the project. Three-quarters
of the construction needed to finish the project has been completed.
The plant is not the same design as the Chernobyl reactor; it
more closely matches safer ones built in East Germany during the
Cold War. However, these plants were shut down by West German
officials after unification because of their poor safety record,
and the unfinished reactor in Cuba has been built with faulty
rods and shoddy materials. If completed, Cuba's reactor could
pose a broad safety risk to U.S. lives and property in Florida
and the U.S. Southeast Coast.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<Font size="+2">A</font>merica is entering a great age of social 
entrepreneurship, rivaling the private organizational creativity of 100 years ago. The mid-to-late 19th and 
early 20th centuries saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Scouts movement, the Carnegie libraries, the 
NAACP, thousands of colleges and universities, and countless other private organizations. As Americans 
turn away from reliance on Washington, they are once again applying Yankee ingenuity by building 
private institutions to address our great cultural crises. Already we are seeing new experiments such as 
privately funded voucher programs that enable poor schoolchildren to escape inadequate public schools, 
organizations that seek to rehabilitate prisoners through religious conversion, and groups such as Promise 
Keepers that aim to instill responsibility among fathers and husbands.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Here are some practical ideas for improving life from some of 
America's most visionary thinkers. We asked each contributor to describe an institution he or she hopes 
will be created or expanded over the next 20 years.

<b><i>Police Training for Youth</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I always knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: I always 
wanted to be a cop. Growing up in Boston, I admired the police and the responsibility they took for others. 
From my earliest years, when police officers helped me across the street on my way to school, they were 
strong role models. It was a natural thing for me to emulate them.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a lot of kids today, it's not so simple. Many kids are 
alienated from the police, and their peers reinforce the alienation. Instead of seeing cops as assisting 
people, they see them as authority figures to be defied. Before many young people mature and finally 
realize that they'd like to have police careers, they already have police records. It's a tragic waste of kids 
who could have made good, even great, police officers. It's also a big problem for society because -- as 
demographers warn -- the late 1990s will bring an increase in the youth population and a likely rise in the 
crime rate.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For all these reasons, I have a dream of developing a youth 
police career path to provide the children of New York City with police role models in their developmental 
years. By exposing kids to positive interactions with police, the career path would help keep them focused 
and directed in their teen years and simultaneously ensure the police department of a stronger field of 
candidates from which to choose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Although we would continue to reach into elementary schools 
with antidrug programs, the official police youth career path would begin with kids in their early teens, 
who could attend a youth academy for six weeks in the summer beginning at age 12. The academy would 
familiarize them with the police department and heighten their interest in police careers while giving them 
a strong dose of antidrug and antigang education. The NYPD ran a successful pilot youth academy in 
Brooklyn last summer with 150 attendees, and we've raised the funds, from private and government 
sources, to enroll a thousand attendees from all over the city this summer.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the youth academy, we would recruit kids into the next step in a youth career path -- the Law 
Enforcement Explorers, a division of the Boy Scouts of America, open to young men and women ages 14 
to 21. Now established in 66 of the New York City police department's 97 precincts, transit districts, and 
housing service areas, the NYPD Explorers serve about 2,000 young people with a program of character 
building, citizenship training, and physical fitness. 

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While participating in the Explorers, young people could also 
attend a specialty high school for students interested in policing, fire fighting, and other public-safety 
careers. A public-safety high school, now in the early planning stages, would show young people how their 
academic work builds toward their desired careers and use examples from police and other public-safety 
agencies as teaching tools. It would also surround them with like-minded students with similar goals, 
exerting a very different and more beneficial kind of peer pressure.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NYPD is raising the qualifications for police officers this 
year, requiring candidates to have 60 college credits and to have reached the age of 22. In a continuation of 
the youth career path, students attending colleges in the City University system could serve as police 
cadets, a police internship offering college credits for working in unpaid, part-time positions with the 
NYPD. The department would also assist cadets in finding part-time paying jobs in the private security 
industry or in the New York City school security system, both of which have had difficulty in recruiting 
quality personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In either capacity, cadets could practice the skills of projecting 
authority, mediating conflicts, and defusing potentially violent situations. Another advantage of using them 
in the school security system -- which Mayor Giuliani is planning to place under the direction of the NYPD 
in the near future -- is that these young security guards would serve as role models to the next generation of 
young people. Unlike the cadet program we have now -- which provides stipends to 320 cadets a year out 
of city and federal funds -- this program would earn its own way. By the time the cadets were ready to 
enter the police department, they'd have a significant work history, college background, and police 
training. They would probably require less training at our police academy, and would certainly be better 
prepared for the discipline and lifestyle of police work. Our academy would thus build a police force from 
a better base of candidates.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Peer pressure leads many young people astray. In some of the 
more impoverished neighborhoods, just hanging out on the street corner can be a career path straight to 
crime. Through the police youth career path, we would offer the kids the opportunity to hang out with us. 
If we capture them early, it can make all the difference in the world. The kids get a focus and a goal, 
private security and school security get better employees, and the city gets a much better crop of candidates 
for police officers. The department would have a larger pool of minority candidates and a larger pool of 
candidates who live in the city. The very group -- teenagers and young adults -- that is predicted to cause 
all the law-enforcement problems in the late 1990s can begin to be part of the solution. In my dream, 
everybody wins.

<b><i>A Great-Books Junior College</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My idea is to create a new one- or two-year junior college for 
bright students (or even not-so-bright students) to earn the education they did not receive in high school 
and won't get in college. Actually I heard this idea first from Hillel Fradkin of the Bradley Foundation. But 
it's a good one, and I think it can work.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I begin with reference to a resource of which I am painfully 
aware: a cohort of unemployed Ph.D.s of (academically) conservative bent who are well educated in the 
works of great authors. To these political philosophers could be added others in history, literature, 
languages, science, and mathematics to teach a curriculum encompassing all that is necessary and 
fundamental and currently neglected or perverted in higher education.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This junior college would draw inspiration partly from disdain 
for political correctness and dislike of the educationists' notion of "self-esteem." But it would also be 
devoted to the love of learning and powered by the enthusiasm of youth. Its graduates could go on to name 
universities with prestigious degrees, football teams, and alumni associations. At these institutions, most of 
them now tired and corrupt, they would be welcomed -- or at least tolerated -- as something fresh, new, and 
strong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American education today is perhaps too weak even to resist 
its chosen enemies -- those who believe in quality. A new institution like this would serve a need and make 
a point. All it requires, really, is an entrepreneur.

<b><i>"Pick Up Your Room"</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This one is going to be tricky. I dream of seeing the revival of 
the institution of childhood. That would mean: Children would be taught to clean up their rooms before 
they started on the environment. Their ability to keep domestic peace would be valued over their opinions 
on world peace. A 12-year-old would own a gun only to hunt squirrels. The streets would be safe for 
children to play outside, unwatched, until dusk. They could get into scrapes with other kids without 
activating a battalion of police and social workers. Girls would be left alone to have tea parties if they 
wished, and boys to play with war toys.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the schools, teachers would be more concerned about a 
child's grades than his self-esteem. Sex would never be considered "safe." Television, even -- or especially 
-- public television, would never be considered educational. Children would address their teachers -- and 
all adults -- as Mr. and Miss, or as "Sir" and "Ma'am," and not, like impertinent phone solicitors, by their 
first names.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, a revival of the institution of childhood implies a 
revival of the institution of parenthood. Mothers and fathers might by tired, nagging, grumpy, and 
uncomprehending -- but they would be present. A baby sitter would once again be called a baby sitter and 
not a "caregiver." During the day, she would sit in furry slippers in the living room, watching soaps. She 
certainly would not be expected to hold degrees in Early Childhood Education, because nobody would 
imagine that a baby sitter could substitute for parental love, attention, and discipline.

<P>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As I said: It's going to be tricky.

<b><i>A Dream That Won't Die</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is not a new one. It is now 40 years old. It is a 
dream of institutional change that will enable parents to choose the schools their children go to. It is a 
dream of a private educational industry that can  compete on equal terms with our present system of 
elementary and secondary schooling -- a governmental monopoly dominated by the teachers' unions for the 
benefit of its officials and members, not of the students.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, a parent who chooses to send his child to a private 
school is required to pay twice for his child's schooling -- once in the form of taxes and once in the form of 
tuition. This imposes a heavy burden on lower income classes and ensures that only the well-do-to are free 
to choose. We can and should remedy that inequity by allowing students who choose to go to private rather 
than public schools to receive scholarships or vouchers equal to a substantial fraction of what the state 
would have been required to spend.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No institution in our country is as technologically backward as 
schooling. We school children today just as we did 200 years ago: A teacher in a classroom instructing a 
group of students. Some schools have added computers but, in the main, have not made effective use of 
them. If we opened the gate to widespread competition, we would enjoy a dramatic change in technology. I 
cannot predict what that change would be, any more than one could have predicted the consequences of 
breaking up AT&T's monopoly on telephone service, or of inventing an elementary personal computer in a 
garage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, a widespread scholarship system of the kind I 
describe would open the door to an influx of innovative enterprises offering different kinds of schooling to 
attract customers. Faced with competition, the public schools would have to improve or close down. No 
doubt some would be unable to stand the heat, but others would rapidly improve. The result would be a 
large, creative, highly developed, private educational industry that offers schooling for every taste, plus a 
vastly improved but somewhat smaller public-school system. A widening gap between the earnings of less 
skilled and more skilled workers threatens our social cohesion; an improvement in the quality of schooling, 
especially for lower-income families and the so-called underclass, would make a major contribution to 
closing that gap.

<b><i>Private Science Funding</i></b>

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The visionary institution builders of the last century 
bequeathed us not only orphanages and schools but observatories and research universities; not only 
institutions to uplift the unfortunate but also ones to explore the universe. Since the end of World War II, 
however, science has become dependent upon government as a funder and direct employer. The results 
have been mixed: We've enjoyed a tremendous expansion of knowledge and suffered the inevitable 
corruption spawned by the bureaucratic process, which favors the cautious, the well-known, and the 
politically connected.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, government is beginning to lose its quasi-
monopoly on scientific funding. Since the explosion of commercial opportunities in the biological sciences, 
Wall Street has become a major source of research money. Meanwhile, the new fortunes of our age, and 
some philanthropic innovators, are creating models for 21st-century scientific philanthropy.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most striking example may be the privatization of the 
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) since Congress defunded it in 1993. With money from such 
technology entrepreneurs as David Packard and William Hewlett (founders of Hewlett-Packard), Paul 
Allen (Microsoft), and Gordon Moore (Intel), the reborn Project Phoenix continues to scan the skies with 
radio telescopes, seeking signs of life.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Quite unlike bureaucracies, the rich are quirky. Their tastes in 
science may be eccentric -- witness the experiment in living known as Biosphere II. And as the MacArthur 
Foundation's "genius grants" demonstrate, they may endow trendy leftism along with innovative, cross-
disciplinary science and true iconoclasm. Such is the trade off we tolerate in exchange for dispensing with 
the application forms, the lobbying, the disciplinary boundaries, and the scientific conservatism of 
government grantmaking.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wealthy benefactors often have a personal interest in what 
they fund. Michael Milken suffers from prostrate cancer. His millions have energized the search for a cure, 
thanks to quick-turnaround grant-making -- a total of $25 million -- and another $4 million in philanthropic 
"venture capital" to create a consortium for pooling resources and data. I hope we shall see many more 
such experiments.

<b><i>Metropolitan Home</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our fragmented metropolitan areas have come to resemble 
battlefields where national corporations, developers, county planning boards, historical societies, 
environmental lobbies, and neighborhood groups slog it out. City planning nowadays means staking out 
one's own turf and keeping interlopers at bay, be they Wal-Mart, the builders of affordable housing, theme 
parks, or simply development in general. Some have proposed federal regulations to mandate regional 
quotas for housing or to force metropolitan cooperation. The last time we attempted top-down city 
planning was in the 1960s. These disastrous, federally funded renewal programs bulldozed neighborhoods 
and erected acres of public housing -- much of which is now dysfunctional. That is not the way.

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps the last successful effort to improve American cities 
was the nationwide movement for civic amelioration during the first two decades of this century. The 
movement was spearheaded by business leaders, municipal politicians, social reformers, and architects, and 
found its chief impetus in the American Civic Association, founded in 1903. If only we could find the will 
-- and the spirit -- to develop a civic association for the 1990s.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is not about "saving the cities." Our old, decaying urban 
areas are just part of the problem. Nor is it about recreating a lost urban past. We must first recognize that 
our new metropolitan way of life will take us in new directions. A revived civic association could provide a 
vision for an urban future that seems to be missing today. It would also encourage dialogue among the 
warring metropolitan factions. I propose a national organization with local chapters, bound by the principle 
that only citizens acting locally have the power to improve their surroundings. Communities -- unlike 
markets -- don't just happen; they have to be earned.

<b><i>A Capitalist Labor Movement</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most important private institution created by American 
society in the early decades of the 20th century was the American labor movement. The greatest 
institutional need in American society as the 20th century ends is for a new labor movement.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though the phrase "cold war" entered the English language after 
World War II, a cold war between democratic capitalism and totalitarian communism had begun decades 
before World War II and lasted for decades after it. Capitalist society won that war for political and 
military as well as economic reasons, but to the extent that victory can be stated in economic terms, it was 
the victory of capitalism's private labor movement over communism's worker state. Communism was never 
militarily defeated, and the hunger in the former communist states for Western-style political democracy is 
moderate. But eventually the most repressive regimes in history were overwhelmed by worker demands for 
the abundance enjoyed by the West.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, the condition of Western workers is in steady 
deterioration for reasons that the early labor movement would be incapable of addressing. Capital is 
organized across national boundaries; labor is not. In an unequal contest, labor grows more disorganized 
and weaker in the West, most especially in the United States, with each passing year. Wages stagnate, 
benefits are eliminated, the work week lengthens, safety conditions worsen.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, capital scours the world for the cheapest, most 
disorganized, most easily exploited labor -- including child labor, prison labor, and even outright slave 
labor. Unless this deterioration can be arrested, we may see once again the desperate conditions that in the 
late 19th century made the worker state seem a reasonable alternative.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What would a new capitalist labor movement -- private, just as the 
first one was private -- look like? I don't know, but thanks to mutual funds and pension plans, stockholders 
and workers are increasingly the same people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new stockholders have not found a way to collectivize 
and mobilize their capital on behalf of themselves as, simultaneously, labor. If they could do this, they 
might be seen as creating a new kind of labor movement. The strike would not be the tool of choice for this 
labor movement; but if the movement could impose its will in other ways, the middle class that the first 
labor movement played so large a part in creating might begin to recover from its current, precipitous 
decline.

<b><i>Hand Up for Homeless</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bill Williams was living in the alleys of Long Beach this time 
last year. He was well educated and had exceptional verbal skills, but used his "smarts" to do little jobs 
until he had enough money to buy his drugs for the day. He would "zone out," promising himself that 
tomorrow he would change. This went on for three years.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, one day he called "Info Line" and was told about 
P.A.T.H. (People Assisting the Homeless) in West Los Angeles. He lied about having been drug free for 30 
days and was admitted to Phase I of P.A.T.H.'s residential program.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today he is an account executive at a publication called 
Senior Life. He has his own apartment and drives a company car.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today Bill Williams and hundreds like him are hard-working, 
taxpaying members of society. Why? Because representatives from churches, synagogues, and the business 
community met 10 years ago and decided that they would try to do something to help the growing numbers 
of homeless people gravitating toward the affluent Westside of Los Angeles.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Residents of the P.A.T.H. home-site are required to seek 
employment immediately. They are also obliged to keep the building clean and do their own laundry; in 
return they occupy a room in a newly remodeled building -- a safe and cheerful environment. A tight 
spending constraint limits them to a bus pass and $10 a week for incidental expenses.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Members of the P.A.T.H. community have recently learned to 
write resums, contact potential employers, and acquire computer skills at P.A.T.H.'s Job Access Center 
located in the same building.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While at P.A.T.H., men and women (and children over four) 
live with others who are also determined to change their lives. Peer pressure and support, a small but caring 
staff, an executive director with a "staff sergeant" approach and confidence that "tough love" works -- all 
these contribute to a rehabilitation/success rate that exceeds 90 percent. P.A.T.H.'s board of directors raises 
half its budget in the private sector, and possesses the courage and vision to make P.A.T.H., as one resident 
called it, the "Rolls Royce of homeless programs."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who started P.A.T.H. had a dream. Prompted by 
the needs of the community, they decided to help people who had a chance to return to the mainstream. 
Other communities could emulate P.A.T.H. There are many other folks like Bill Williams who need a hand 
up, not a handout.

<b><i>Venture Capital for Charter Schools</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Suppose you believe in the continuing importance of public 
education but deplore the heavy hand of centralized school bureaucracy and reject the Progressive-era 
vision of "the one best system." What do you do? One answer is charter schools -- described by education 
historian Diane Ravitch as "semi-autonomous, public entities that are freed from most bureaucratic rule and 
regulations by state and local authorities in return for a commitment to meet explicit performance goals."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nineteen states now have laws authorizing charter schools, 
and hundreds have come into existence. Still, it's hard to get them launched; high start-up costs discourage 
all but the hardiest parents, teachers, and nonprofits. Here as elsewhere, lowering the barriers to 
entrepreneurship would pay rich dividends in the future.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to see private institutions emerge in every city to 
provide seed money, on a competitive basis, to local coalitions willing to plan and execute new kinds of 
public schools. The tax code should permit tax credits, up to a limit of (say) $100, for contributions to these 
institutions. Foundations would be important players. I wouldn't rule out public-sector contributions to 
these institutions -- but only in the form of one-time endowments.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fledgling Fund for New York City Public Education, 
while not exactly in this mold, illustrates the possibilities. Of an applicant pool of about 175 would-be 
educational innovators, according to the New York Times, "at least 10 will be awarded start-up grants of 
about $125,000 each, paid in installments over three years." Many others will get technical assistance. And 
dozens of new coalitions, catalyzed by the possibility of early assistance, may choose to proceed even 
without it.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While the debate over vouchers rages across the ideological 
battlefront, can't we come together around the modest but important goal of liberating entrepreneurial 
energy within the public-school sector?

<b><i>A College for My Children</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inevitably, my most cherished dream involves my three children.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to believe that by the time they're ready for college 
(the oldest is now nine) there might be a college worth attending, without threatening their sanity and 
decency with the current mania for politically correct lies. There's simply not enough time for my kids to 
count on the sweeping changes that are desperately needed in virtually all the institutions of higher 
education in this country. But we do have a chance to capture (or even to create) one elite college or 
university as a haven and an example.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To accomplish this, traditionalists and conservatives must 
organize and pool their resources. Last year, when Yale University arrogantly returned a $20 million gift to 
Lee Bass because that donation would have required a focus on Western civilization as uniquely worthy of 
attention, I decided that my alma mater could henceforth do without my own modest contributions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Instead, I would like to combine those resources with funds 
from thousands of other disillusioned university alumni who want to establish an alternative to the trendy, 
libertine, left-wing hegemony of the Ivy League. It's time that loyal graduates of Harvard and Stanford (not 
to mention Vassar and Amherst) woke up to the fact that their admirable and instinctive support for 
institutions that once nurtured them involves not only a tragic waste of money, but the continued 
endorsement of the most destructive forces in American life. Corporations must also recognize that their 
huge contributions to elite educational institutions are funding attitudes and activities that undermine the 
very survival of the free-enterprise system.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those who dissent from the prevailing statist and relativist 
pieties should assemble their resources and use that power to steer one selected institution in a more 
positive direction. Maybe $20 million wasn't enough to influence Yale, but let's try raising the ante, and 
focus on a somewhat smaller target -- say, for the sake of argument, Dartmouth or Williams (two gorgeous 
campuses!). It should be possible at least to install a new administration at an appropriate campus that 
would mobilize the forces of the market and offer a first-class conservative/moderate alternative to the 
prevailing folly. With 30 or 40 elite institutions hewing to an identical left-wing line, wouldn't one 
university, positioned self-consciously toward the right, enjoy an instant competitive advantage, attracting 
the finest students and faculty? And speaking of faculty, if corporations could be persuaded to endow 
chairs generously, think of the intellectual dream team that might be assembled under one academic roof. 
Perhaps one could lure away the brilliant fellows of <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> (or AEI or Hoover 
or Cato) for a few years of inspired teaching. How about Bill Bennett as president? For key academic 
positions, you could choose Sowell, Stelzer, Bork, Wilson, Kristol (any Kristol), Himmelfarb, Steele, 
Gilder, Williams, Blankenhorn, Whitehead, Elshtain, Arkes, or any number of other intellectual luminaries. 
It's my dream, but you're more than welcome to play the game of filling in the blanks.
<p>
	The remarkable achievements of little Hillsdale College -- in remotest rural Michigan, with only 
1,200 students and no graduate school -- give some indication of the potential for this scheme. Under the 
inspired leadership of President George Roche, Hillsdale has pursued a courageous conservative path, 
refusing all government aid and exerting surprising national influence. It is also earning a constantly 
improving reputation for academic excellence. If no established "big name" campus can be successfully 
coopted, with priceless assets of atmospheric mystique and proud traditions (which are being trashed every 
day), then the resources accumulated for that purpose might well be pumped into the Michigan institution 
to enable it to step boldly into the academic major leagues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Looking at higher education today, there's an obvious 
opportunity. It makes no market sense for every elite institution to target students and professors with the 
same liberal values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By the same token, it makes no market sense for every TV 
network, or news division, or movie studio, to target precisely the same consumers of popular culture. 
There should be room for more wholesome, more conservative alternatives, and money to by made by 
offering them -- but that's another dream. . . .

<b><i>Public-Private Job Training</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If, as President Reagan said, "the best social program devised 
is a job," then those without jobs, or without the skills that employers demand, need some help to acquire 
those skills and join productive society. We need programs that work with the private sector to provide 
well-constructed and economical training in job skills. The best example of this that I know of is "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG grew out of the successful "Jobs for Delaware's 
Graduates" (JDG), a program I created in 1979 while governor of Delaware. JDG, a nonprofit partnership 
charged with preparing, counseling, and placing high-school seniors in career jobs, was so successful that it 
spawned JAG for the purpose of spreading Delaware's success throughout the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having helped 175,000 young people, JAG today is one of the 
largest organizations of its kind, and one of the most successful. Ninety percent of the at-risk young people 
enrolled in JAG graduate from school, and within nine months, the proportion that has found a job, enlisted 
in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or training is 80 percent -- 30 percentage points 
above the results for non-JAG youths with similar profiles. JAG achieves these results at a cost of just 
$1,200 per participant, less than one-third the average cost of similar programs around the nation. The 
taxes paid by the participants upon joining the workforce more than pay for the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG works because it is overseen by and responsible to the 
private sector, because its leaders are accountable for results, and because the young people themselves 
must meet the employability standards of businesses and take charge of their lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Supporting America's youth, reducing the cost of social 
programs, and protecting the future base of our taxpayers are good, sound, conservative principles. As we 
approach the 21st century, "Jobs for America's Graduates" puts these principles to work.

<b><i>Report Cards for Schools</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Colin Powell went to public school in the Bronx. Like so 
many other Americans, he owes his start in life to that great institution, free public education. But today, 
not all schools give kids enough chance to succeed. At some public schools in the Bronx, textbooks are in 
such short supply that children have to share in class, and afterward the books are collected and sent down 
the hall to another waiting class. Are spending cuts to blame for the shortage? No.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From 1980 to 1993, for example, spending on New York City 
public schools increased 148 percent, even though the number of students increased only 3 percent. Even 
after taking inflation into account, New York City spent 37 percent more per pupil in 1993 than in 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spending on central administration grew almost five times as 
fast as spending for regular classroom teaching. Too much of our education funds went for bureaucrats, not 
books; administrators, not educators; red tape, not learning aids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The problem is not merely citywide, it is statewide: From 
1980 to 1993, school enrollment in New York declined by 9 percent, but spending shot up by 142 percent. 
School districts spent more and more and taxed local residents again and again. Yet many teachers have to 
reach into their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is not to spend more, but to spend more wisely. A 
school report card would help parents and taxpayers hold school boards accountable for how our scarce 
education dollars are spent and how well students perform. School boards should be required to publish 
one annually on every school under their purview, with figures on spending per pupil and students' 
performance on standardized tests. Parents and taxpayers have a right to know how their schools stack up 
and whether their education dollars are producing results.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	School report cards should be a new addition to an important 
American institution -- public school. Parents, taxpayers, and teachers need to hold school boards and 
elected officials accountable for spending, so that scarce education dollars are used wisely to give every 
child a chance in life.

<b><i>Faithful Professions</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Writing of Americans in the early 19th century, Tocqueville 
observed not that they were great institution-builders nor that they were great organizers, but that they had 
mastered the "science of association," which he thought necessary to the maintenance of civil society itself. 
He chose the term "association" carefully, for it invokes not just the structure through which individuals act 
together, but also the very act of coming together and, for Tocqueville especially, the community of 
opinion and sentiment that collective action at once depends upon and helps to form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I note this because for each of my "dreams," the need is 
clearer than the institutional or organizational means of addressing it. First, I think that achieving peace in 
our current culture wars depends on transcending the hostility toward religion that now seems entrenched 
in the secular professions: law, medicine, journalism, teaching. As a first step, perhaps like-minded 
individuals within the ranks of each profession would associate, dedicated to informing their professional 
activities with the witness of their religious faith. Whether or not such association begins among members 
of the same church or denomination -- though the movement might be stronger if it does -- it must become 
ecumenical, or federative, if it is to succeed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My second hope is that society reestablish respect for the 
vocation of mothers and dissolve the pernicious, ubiquitous social pressure upon mothers to leave their 
children with someone else and go make money. Here the organizational means to the end seem even more 
elusive -- a "Home Makers" on the model of "Promise Keepers" doesn't quite seem fitting -- although the 
freedom of mothers to nourish and nurture requires fathers to resume their duty to provide and protect. 
These tasks involve in no small part recovering the wisdom once embedded in tradition now abandoned, 
and then bringing that wisdom to life in contemporary circumstances. In this, the current wave of 
institution-building differs from the Progressive urge to remake society in the then-clear light of modern 
science, but it also recalls in a way the task that faced Tocqueville's Americans as they marched across an 
untamed continent, bringing civilization as they knew it to a savage land.

<b><i>Motor Trend for Schools</i></b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Twenty years from now, the failures of government-run 
schools will be so obvious that America will have either moved to a voucher system or else be in the 
process of doing so. Yet there are no final victories in politics, so friends of educational choice must work 
over the next 20 years to create a civic infrastructure to nurture this new design for freedom. All Americans 
-- not just parents -- ought to be able to trust that fraud in the educational marketplace will be punished, 
and that educational incompetence will be identified, so that parents can choose to take their children 
elsewhere. Yet because the workings of the invisible hand are so alien to education, voluntary nonprofit 
groups simply must be part of this process.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Inspired perhaps by Margaret Thatcher's prochoice reforms, 
the British government publishes "League Tables," which rate school performance nationwide. Such 
watchdogging can be useful, but the experience of "Goals 2000" in the past six years reminds American 
conservatives that politicians can abuse or even invert any assessment function left in their control.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So America circa 2016 will need a range of nongovernmental 
entities rating schools' performance by various criteria and publicizing their findings. For years, Americans 
have relied on Consumer Reports to help them evaluate everything from potholders to pickup trucks. And 
Money and Motor Trend, to name just two magazines, have both carved out commercial niches for 
themselves as guides to investments and automobiles, respectively. Yet because education will always be 
more than just a commodity, those who would lead America to a renaissance of citizenship should 
encourage religious, fraternal, and neighborhood groupswhether or not they themselves choose to 
participate in the voucher-driven education marketto issue their own report cards on school performance.

<b><i>Group Homes for Welfare Moms</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way to reform welfare, as I suggested in <i>The 
Dream and the Nightmare</i> in 1993 and in a series of articles since, requires the creation of a new 
institution -- a national network of communal hostels, or group homes, for welfare mothers and their 
children. Such hostels would focus on the welfare of children, not the job prospects of young women. The 
hostels would provide structured, caring environments for nurturing citizens with consciences and the 
ability to learn. By the time today's underclass children are in Head Start, let alone school, it's very late to 
begin teaching the cognitive and moral categories that are learned in early childhood, that families 
normally teach, and that underclass children don't adequately acquire. Without mastery of these categories, 
it is hard to think, to apply yourself, and therefore to learn.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The hostels should have rules of conduct for the mothers who 
live there, to help them get control of their lives, but above all to ensure the order and structure children 
need. In the same vein, the hostels should require mothers to take daily workshops in child rearing to learn 
some of the basics that young underclass women often don't know: that babies cry because they have 
needs, not because they are "bad"; that children need to be talked to and responded to, not ignored and not 
hit, if they are to grow up able to function as members of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No doubt such a system will discourage many unmarried 
women unable to support babies from having them -- a worthwhile result. No less important, the smaller 
number of babies born under such circumstances, despite all of society's discouragement, will get a fair 
chance to grow up happy and productive citizens. However sweeping this reform, it must be weighed 
against today's dreadful welfare system, which condemns millions of children to grow up with so much 
human talent unawakened, lost to themselves and to society.

<b><i>A Religious Reawakening</i></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most of our nation's great problems stem from a decline in 
morality. A string of unbalanced federal budgets nearly four decades long reflects a moral failure to live 
within our means. A rapidly growing $5-trillion national debt evinces the immorality of one generation 
imposing an unpardonable burden on future generations to pay for what essentially amounts to bread and 
circuses. The pretense of the charity of the welfare state represents our immoral struggle to live at the 
expense of others. Part and parcel of this welfare state is the intergenerational extortion of the young and 
yet-to-be-born by older Americans through Social Security and Medicare. Then there is the politics of 
"entitlement" that has spawned unprecedented dependency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governments cannot patch up the public and private 
imprudence that scars the modern American landscape. The ameliorative action government can take is to 
eliminate those programs and laws that have undermined traditional values and morality. Just as language 
evolved intrinsically, without government direction or control, so did moral or ethical standards. Honesty, 
restraint, self-reliance, and social cooperation evolved as standards because they produced greater 
tranquillity and generated more wealth than their counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much of our moral code has religious roots. Government 
attack on religion, under the contrivance of adhering to the "Establishment Clause," has played an 
important role in the decline of morality. It is religious teachings that bolster the moral standards against 
lying, treachery, deceit, fornication, adultery, confiscation, and instant gratification. Religion promotes 
loyalty to family, friends, and community. Marxists and those in America who see the state as supreme find 
moral relativism far more friendly to their agenda than the absolutism of religion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream of an American moral reawakening will reduce 
both the size and scope of problems we now call on government to solve. The problems that remain will be 
dealt with more compassionately through family, social organizations, and community as they were for 
most of our history.

<b><i>Work Requirements for Public Housing</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is that sometime soon, the billions of dollars 
invested in public-housing bricks and mortar will be transformed into the sites of regenerated central-city 
working neighborhoods. There is reason to believe we have the ability to bring about such a change. Right 
now, although not a desirable place to live for most families, public housing embodies a large public 
subsidy to each family who benefits from it, equal in many instances to the monthly AFDC cash grant 
itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But although the cash value of a public-housing subsidy 
makes it a boon of sorts, free or almost free housing fosters an attitude that one's apartment unit, and by 
extension the surrounding project, are not worth the effort of maintaining standards. Destructive behaviors 
by residents and those in the surrounding community reinforce and reflect this attitude.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I envision reforms to require work as a condition of living in 
public housing, either in the private sector or in a community-service job to improve one's housing site or 
perform other neighborhood building activities. In the welfare-reform field, we have discovered the power 
of universal work requirements and expectations. In the current environment, individuals improving their 
lives through work are isolated and demoralized by those in the larger dependent environment around 
them. But public-housing sites have the potential to create a controlled physical space where expectations 
of work are enforced. For the formerly idle, enforced work initially may not be pleasant, but at least 
everybody will find themselves in the same boat.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in March, residents of Milwaukee's largest public-
housing project will receive welfare payments only in proportion to required work completed; over time, 
this work requirement will be a condition of their lease as well. Fashioning work requirements to improve 
and build urban communities of the future will be our major challenge.

<b><i>New TV Shows</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, I propose two television productions. One would be 
called America's Legal Nightmares, and would expose myriad real-life instances of citizens persecuted by 
the state -- by the EPA, for example, or by Child Protection Services. The second, American Stories, is 
Michael Medved's companion idea; this program would celebrate individuals who have transcended 
personal hardships.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, before we can launch any systematic efforts to develop 
private charity, we must establish a reliable, independent referee of charities' effectiveness and reliability. 
The few organizations that track private charities lack the resources to follow any but the largest ones. 
When they evaluate a charity's finances, they must rely on its own accounting, for which the rules are 
notoriously lax and potentially misleading. We need to establish explicit financial reporting standards for 
501(c)(3) public charities and fund organizations both to evaluate and rate them by Marvin Olasky's 
criteria of effective compassion, and disseminate these findings, perhaps on the Internet.

<b><i>A Revival Parallel to the Evangelicals</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a> 
wrote, culture arises from the cult. Nonreligious people can be good people, as many a Stoic proved. But 
there never were very many Stoics. Human nature being what it is, most people need a religious foundation 
for their morals, if their morals are to be sound. Only the Transcendent has power enough to overcome 
their natural inclination to "do their own thing."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It follows that if America's culture is to be rescued from the 
sewer into which it has fallen, we need a revival of religion. In theory, a number of religions offer a sound 
moral basis; it should be no surprise that the Confucian cultures of East Asia believe we could learn some 
things from them. But it is difficult to envision Confucianism or another non-Christian religion suddenly 
sweeping America. For reasons of history, if a religious revival is to happen here, it will be Christian. The 
choice is that or nothing.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a revival has in fact been under way for some time, 
spearheaded by the Protestant Evangelicals. They have done fruitful work, and the fact that there is any 
resistance at all to the destroyers of our culture is largely their doing. However, much of the citizenry 
remains beyond their reach. For many reasons, these people are uncomfortable with either the Evangelical 
message or the Evangelical style. No one is at fault for this; it is a fact of life that people differ.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I dream of an effort parallel to the Protestant Evangelical 
revival, not in competition with it. Both would be aimed at the unchurched, not each other.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The new effort would be led by a real new order; a new religious 
order, similar to older orders such as the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and the like. It would be liturgical, 
apostolic, and sacramental, but it would not be part of any of the four churches with those characteristics 
(the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and orthodox remnants of the Anglicans and Scandinavian 
Lutherans). It would be supported by all of them, it would draw from all of them, and it would be 
recognized as legitimate by all of them. But the key difference is that it would not require anyone to join 
any organization to partake of a liturgical and sacramental religious life led by clergy who were part of the 
apostolic succession. In our sad times, it is probably necessary to say that this new order would adhere 
rigorously to the creeds and the doctrines of the Church as laid down and universally accepted before the 
split of 1054 a.d. And it would preach and practice, within the limits of human frailty, traditional Christian 
morals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It would dismiss with complete disinterest all the turf fights, 
jurisdictional squabbles, historic slights, and other ephemera that stand between the liturgical, apostolic, 
and sacramental church and people hungry for that church. It would thus bolster the sound elements, not 
only within our own culture, but in other nations as well.

<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a>: States That Benefit Most from a 17% Flat Tax<br>
<a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a>: Comparison of Average Household Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<br>
<a href="fyi86a2.gif">Appendix 2</a>: Comparison of Total Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and under a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With support from many presidential candidates and a ringing endorsement from the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, the idea of a flat tax has captured the imagination of long-suffering taxpayers. This support should come as no surprise. The current system, which penalizes work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship, imposes nearly $200 billion of compliance costs on the economy and corrupts the political process.<sup>1</sup>  By contrast, a flat tax would spur growth while treating taxpayers equally. Moreover, a properly designed flat tax also would provide much-needed tax relief. As <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates, the benefits of the flat tax to individual taxpayers would be considerable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The <a href="fyi86t1.gif">table</a> compares how individual income taxpayers will fare if the current system is replaced by a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>2</sup>  Such a reform proposal would tax individual wage and salary income at a 17 percent rate and would apply the same rate, at the business level, to all interest earnings, dividends, capital gains, and other non-labor income.<sup>3</sup>

<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Besides the rates and deductions, the biggest difference between the flat tax and today's code is the way the flat tax treats income from savings, equities, appreciated capital assets, and estates. Flat tax proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model, such as the <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">Armey-Shelby</a> bill, do not double-tax savings or estate income, since the principal used to create such income streams already has been taxed and, in the case of interest income, reflects in part the level of taxes paid by financial institutions. Dividends and capital gains also are not taxed at the individual level, because taxes are paid at the business level on the income that creates dividends and produces appreciation in the value of capital assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, for example, that Connecticut's per household tax liability drops by $1,856 under a flat tax of 17 percent. The 17 percent flat tax saves New Yorkers filing individual income tax returns almost $10 billion, and the total individual tax bill in South Dakota falls by 38 percent. Appendices 1 and 2 present <a href="fyi86a1.gif">average</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">total</a> tax savings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is important to note that these tables argue only that average tax liabilities and the total tax bill will be reduced under a flat tax of 17 percent, not that all taxpayers will see their taxes reduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics of the flat tax have complained that it is not possible to reduce everyone's taxes and still have a tax system that produces about the same amount of federal revenue as the current one does. They are right, of course. Generally, lower taxes on individuals are made possible by two factors. The many proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model,<sup>4</sup> for example, would cause a shift in the tax burden to corporations. These higher taxes, needless to say, ultimately are borne by individual workers, consumers, and shareholders, but the actual payment of the tax takes place at the corporate level.<sup>5</sup>  The second reason individuals will enjoy dramatically lower tax payments is that sponsors of the legislation want to reduce the amount of money the government takes out of the private sector. Cutting federal spending over a seven-year period, for example, would enable Congress to reduce tax rates. The flat tax, in other words, is designed both to cut taxes and to reform the system to make it fair. To avoid higher deficits, the lower level of revenue collections would be offset by spending savings and the additional revenues generated by stronger economic growth.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS THE FLAT TAX?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p><ul>
<li> Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-sized forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
<li> Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes.
<p>
<li>Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With so much interest in replacing today's unfair tax code with a system that rewards productive behavior, ends special-interest lobbying, and forces everyone to play by the same rules, policymakers and other interested parties have been clamoring for more details about the impact of this proposed reform. The state-by-state figures demonstrate the amount of tax relief individual taxpayers will realize if the 17 percent flat tax proposed in the Armey-Shelby bill for the 1994 tax year is enacted into law.
<p>

<b>A Note on Technical Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The "current" tax liabilities in <a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report their labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor from business income makes comparing the current tax system to a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Appendices <a href="fyi86a1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">2</a>. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> and Appendices 1 and 2 are based on income tax records contained on the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 155,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use, and the data for tax year 1991 are the most current data available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heritage adjusted the state-by-state estimates of current and flat tax liabilities drawn from the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991 by multiplying these estimates by the total change in the CPI-U between December 1991 and December 1994. Adjusting our 1991 estimates by the CPI-U produced 1994 estimates that were within 0.6 percent of actual collections. We chose December 1994 rather than December 1995 as our terminal point because estimates for annual federal revenue collected through the income tax are not particularly sound until June of the next year. It also is worth noting that the Public Use File for 1994 is not yet available.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since the Cold War ended, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization has been in the midst of an identity crisis. When it lost the Soviet threat in the early 
1990s, the Atlantic alliance went on a search to redefine itself. There have been many stops on this 
inchoate journey of redefinition. The Bush Administration used NATO forces, structure, and 
modus operandi to build a framework for the coalition that defeated Saddam Hussein in the Persian 
Gulf War. Since President Clinton took office, NATO has gone in even more directions. Between 
1993 and 1995, NATO acted as a combat subcontractor for the United Nations in the former 
Yugoslavia, implementing and enforcing a "no-fly zone" over Bosnia and providing close air 
support to U.N. peacekeepers. Now, of course, NATO is involved in an ambitious peace 
enforcement operation in Bosnia:  a mission for which NATO was not originally designed and in a 
country that is not a member of the Atlantic alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has traveled far from its original mission of 
deterring a Soviet attack on Western Europe. It stands to reason that it should do so, NATO 
planners maintain, because the original raison d'etre of the alliance -- the Soviet threat -- has 
disappeared. What is needed, they argue, is to make NATO more up-to-date and more relevant to 
solving messy conflicts like Bosnia. Peacekeeping and "out-of-area" military operations (whereby 
NATO becomes involved in conflicts outside the treaty area) are supposed to save NATO from 
irrelevance. Unless NATO adapts to new circumstances, they aver, it will wither away and become 
extinct.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These advocates of a trendier NATO have it backwards. 
Unless NATO returns to its core mission, it will not survive. That mission is to preserve the 
freedom and security of Europe as a whole -- to prevent the general conflagration of Europe -- and 
not to put out every brushfire that breaks out in every corner of the continent. Put in the parlance of 
the strategist, NATO's core mission is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or 
bloc of powers which strive to deny the continent of its overall freedom and security.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That mission -- preserving the basic security condition of 
Europe -- is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War. Moreover, it is especially important in 
defining the American role in European security and NATO. The U.S. has a vital interest in the 
freedom and security of Europe regardless of whether a hostile attack is imminent. Who is to say 
whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe ten or twenty years 
from now?  It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest 
in the basic security condition of Europe. If even a potential threat to that interest exists, the U.S. 
must be prepared to deter major power aggression and defend European security and freedom. It 
makes no sense for America to leave Europe and return, as it did in the last two world wars, only 
when Europe is in flames and the threat is practically on America's doorstep. It is far better to keep 
100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send 1 million GIs to fight a European war 
that broke out in America's absence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The more NATO drifts away from this core mission, the 
less likely it will survive in the long run. It will not work to create new roles and missions for which 
the alliance is poorly suited and in which the U.S. is reluctant to become involved. Military make-
work will cause the interests of alliance members to diverge and will accelerate the demise of the 
alliance. If peacekeeping and other crisis management operations take NATO too far afield of its 
core mission, the cohesion of the alliance will be diluted and the U.S. will lose interest over time. 
Getting NATO involved in "out-of-area" operations for their own sake will not do the trick either. 
Having a baby to save the marriage is neither good family practice nor a sound basis for military 
strategy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. It needs to refocus on 
its core mission of ensuring that peace and freedom in Europe as a whole are not threatened by a 
hostile power. The greatest threat to NATO's cohesion today is the possibility of failure in 
Bosnia.<sup>1 </sup>  No other issue has such a potential to tear NATO apart -- not the debate over 
NATO enlargement or disagreements about how to handle the Russians. If NATO trips up today, it 
will not be over a disagreement concerning its core mission, but over some tangential but 
seemingly urgent problem (like Bosnia) which Europeans and Americans mistook as being 
fundamentally and strategically important to the security and freedom of Europe as a whole.
<p>
<b>Why NATO? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO countries need to explain to their peoples why 
NATO is needed regardless of what happens in Bosnia. American leaders in particular need not 
only to articulate more clearly to a skeptical public why NATO should exist, but also to establish 
clearer principles for when the U.S. should or should not become involved in Europe's wars. In 
addition, leaders should make an effort to define how America will become involved in other 
European security affairs. This will promote a clearer and more sensible division of labor that can 
be understood by Americans and Europeans. Accomplishing these tasks would give NATO 
direction and purpose. There are three reasons why NATO should exist. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. This is vitally important to the freedom and security 
of the United States. A Europe dominated by any power hostile to America, her interests, and her 
values would be a direct threat to the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States itself. 
America fought two world wars and sustained over 40 years of a Cold War military commitment to 
prevent Europe's domination. It should be no less committed to this goal today, even though the 
immediacy of the threat has diminished.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is a strategic insurance policy. Insurance exists to 
protect against catastrophe, no matter how remote the threat may be. Because the cost of 
catastrophe is so high, people are willing to pay insurance premiums to protect them in case it 
strikes. Even when the likelihood of a household fire is remote, most people still take out fire 
insurance because the cost of a fire is so devastating, and far greater than the cost of the premiums.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So it is with NATO. The threat today in Europe is not as 
great as it once was, but neither are the premiums. One hundred thousand troops deployed in 
Europe today is far more economical, both in blood and treasure, than the cost a world war would 
impose on America tomorrow. Twice this century, Americans have seen what happens when fire 
sweeps over Europe. Anything that would prevent such a catastrophe would be well worth the 
price. Indeed, for this reason, NATO is even better than insurance. It actually helps to prevent 
catastrophe. That makes it a double bargain. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A major 
power threat to Europe would cause economic disruption that would be devastating to U.S. markets 
and economic stability. The U.S. economy is greatly dependent on the economic stability of 
America's principal trading partners, and access to trade and resources in Europe is a vital 
American interest. Europe is America's second largest trading region and accounts for billions of 
dollars in two-way trade per year. Many millions of jobs in the United States are directly dependent 
upon American trade with Europe and European investment in the U.S. The prosperity of America 
depends in large measure on a free and prosperous Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. While NATO ultimately is an 
alliance of collective defense, it also is a functional vehicle for promoting democracy and freedom 
in Europe. It is not only practically important from the standpoint of providing stability in Europe, 
but it has a moral component as well. NATO is an organization of democratic states and a reflection 
of America's identity in the world, an anchor for American values both abroad and at home. This 
stability, born of political freedom and economic prosperity, should be brought by NATO to 
Central Europe, a region historically characterized by political instability.
<P>
<b>When Should America Become Involved? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It is not enough to know that America should remain in 
the NATO alliance. The far more pressing problem is to know when and under what circumstances 
U.S. combat troops should or should not become involved in a range of military operations in 
Europe. In order to have a coherent strategy and promote a sensible division of labor in Europe, the 
U.S. should adhere to some basic guidelines. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. The main mission of the U.S. armed forces in 
Europe should be to prevent Europe from falling victim to a hostile hegemonic power. Thus, 
America's main military mission is collective defense -- to protect NATO member states from a 
major power threat. While the U.S. should never rule out participation in less threatening scenarios 
or turn its back on out-of-area operations, in general it should concentrate its military efforts on 
achieving NATO's core military mission. This will lend definition and purpose to NATO and the 
American role.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. As a rule, if U.S. forces duplicate the efforts of European 
allies that can provide the same capabilities, the European forces should get the nod. The United 
States is NATO's military leader because of its unique and powerful military capabilities. It is not 
just another European military power; it is a world power with many strategic commitments. A 
significant U.S. military role in NATO must be guided by the singular capabilities that America can 
bring to bear.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The use of large numbers of American combat forces should make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. If the American people perceive an American-led NATO 
chasing peripheral security crises with the reluctant participation of prosperous European allies, 
public support for NATO will erode quickly. The U.S. military role in NATO must be a unique and 
decisive contribution towards the core mission of the alliance.
<p>
<b>Enlarging NATO. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Expanding the Atlantic alliance to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would enhance NATO's capability to perform its core 
mission of defending the basic security condition of Europe. The profound geopolitical security and 
stability this will bring to Central Europe far outweighs the technical and financial difficulties of 
limited enlargement. To do this, the Clinton Administration must stop dragging its feet. Clinton has 
taken the exclusive counsel of his fears and has given too much weight to complaints from 
Russians who oppose NATO enlargement. The President has given Russia a <i>de facto</i> veto 
and has used the Partnership for Peace plan as little more than a bureaucratic delaying tactic. 
Clinton needs to act now by making a political commitment to these four Central European states 
and demonstrating the same kind of vision and courage that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President George Bush showed in pressing for German unification in the face of Soviet opposition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act. To spur the President to 
revitalize NATO, the Congress needs to act. The Clinton Administration has not done a good job of 
giving NATO a sense of purpose and mission in the post-Cold War era. The Congress should 
consider passing a NATO Revitalization Act that not only spells out the reasons for the American 
people about why the U.S. should be involved in NATO, but also clearly defines the strategic role 
of the U.S. in fulfilling NATO's core mission of collective defense. This Act also should define the 
principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, thereby urging the Europeans to take 
more responsibility for peacekeeping and other marginal military missions. Finally, it should call 
expressly for the rapid inclusion of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in NATO 
and substantial modification of the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program.
<p>


<b>NATO'S IDENTITY CRISIS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has proven to be 
the most effective security alliance of modern times. Its stated aim was to "safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage and civilization of [its] peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty and the rule of law."  The treaty signatories also sought to "promote stability and 
well-being in the North Atlantic area" and were "resolved to unite their efforts for collective 
defense and for the preservation of peace and security."<sup>2 </sup>  That NATO achieved these 
goals with small loss of life in the face of an adversarial and expansionist Soviet Union was truly 
remarkable. Underpinning this success story was the enormous and expensive political and military 
commitment made by America to NATO, a commitment that did not waver during the many crises 
of the Cold War.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is the ironic fate of alliances that their success ultimately 
can spell the end of their existence. Such is the case with NATO, where the moment of the 
alliance's greatest triumph contained within it the seeds of the identity crisis that now threatens its 
viability and even its existence. The demise of the Soviet Union brought calls for a "peace 
dividend" the world over. Politicians and strategists proposed a restructuring of alliance 
commitments, defense requirements, and security architecture to meet the more unpredictable but 
less apocalyptic threats of the new world disorder. The American public demanded that its 
politicians focus on troubles at home. The 1992 presidential campaign was about "the economy, 
stupid," and foreign policy issues dropped out of the immediate consciousness of 
America.<sup> 3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the meantime, NATO has struggled for a post-Soviet 
identity that can inspire its members to remain completely committed. It is still not clear that this 
can be accomplished in the absence of a clear and present danger that would cause the interests of 
all NATO members to converge. Consequently, the struggle to find a new identity for the alliance 
has been marked by an inchoate and inclusive program of NATO enlargement (further muddled by 
the Partnership for Peace program), a dabbling in combat support to U.N. peacekeeping, a proposal 
to refocus NATO on the Mediterranean and the implicit threat of nationalist Islam, and the out-of-
area peace enforcement operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;None of these operations has served to inspire solid 
support for NATO from the American public and Congress. While a majority of Americans (56 
percent) support America's basic commitment to the alliance, public support for the American role 
in NATO's Bosnian intervention has peaked at around 40 percent.<sup>4 </sup>  In addition, while 
support for NATO is stable in Congress, the Bosnian mission has met strong congressional 
opposition in both the House and Senate. Many congressional leaders question the utility of an 
American-led alliance that created a supposedly vital American interest in Bosnia, an area of 
marginal strategic interest for the United States. Indeed, President Clinton used American 
leadership and credibility in NATO as the chief justification for the American role in Bosnia. 
NATO became the end in itself, no longer an appropriate means to the relative end of preventing a 
major power threat to Europe. 
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR A WORKABLE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States needs alliances of all sorts in an 
interdependent world. Economic alliances allow the U.S. to remain the number one trading nation 
in the world and sustain American prosperity at home. Political alliances ensure that America is 
involved in decisions the world over that may influence the peace and prosperity of the United 
States. Military alliances give America partners in fighting her enemies and defending her interests, 
thereby lessening the costs to the U.S. in time of war and peace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. has many national interests throughout the world, 
but not all are equally important. The principal task of American statecraft is to discriminate among 
these interests, set strategic priorities, and choose policy options commensurate with their 
importance. Such an approach distinguishes among vital national interests, important interests, and 
marginal interests.<sup>5 </sup>  Naturally, America has a vital national interest in defending the 
physical territory and airspace of the United States and ensuring the safety and well-being of 
Americans abroad. To protect these vital interests, the U.S. should be willing to wage war if 
necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, the U.S. has vital national interests that lie 
beyond American shores. For both political and economic reasons, it is in America's vital national 
interest that Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf are not dominated by a hegemonic power or 
bloc of powers. It is also in America's vital national interest that the U.S. have unimpeded access to 
foreign trade and natural resources. American prosperity overwhelmingly depends on the stability 
of international markets and free trade regimes. Political scientist Benjamin Schwarz has written 
that:
<p><blockquote>
	Economic interdependence dictates security commitments. As long as world politics 
remain what they have always been, Europe and East Asia will be potentially 
unstable. And as long as U.S. prosperity is understood to depend upon the stability 
of those regions, the United States must pacify them. America's worldwide security 
commitments are a truly permanent burden.<sup>6 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, Schwarz and many others also recognize that 
this permanent burden ultimately could turn into a "wasting proposition."  America, without a 
coherent strategy, and in order to sustain its prosperity, will run itself ragged trying to preserve the 
stability of the entire world. Its engagement in world affairs therefore must be selective. The U.S. 
must set clear priorities that allow it to use its political capital and military forces for the tasks that 
most matter to America. If the U.S. tries to do everything, it will overextend itself and accomplish 
nothing.<sup> 7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid becoming the world's policeman, the 
U.S. must operate within security alliances. These alliances must preserve the conditions necessary 
for American prosperity, and must do so by "stretching" American resources through an intelligent 
definition of America's exact role and principles for sharing burdens with allies. These alliances 
must unequivocally lay out the roles that make the most sense for America and her goals abroad. 
NATO, in particular, needs to be refocused to avoid being drawn into an expensive "wasting 
proposition" that the American people will not support.
<p>

<b>WHY NATO?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most military alliances in the world can only hope to 
attain the level of political and military credibility enjoyed by NATO. However, in order for NATO 
to sustain public and congressional support in the U.S., its fundamental purpose must be refocused. 
American leaders should explain exactly why NATO is critical and should define America's basic 
role in the alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are three principal reasons why the U.S. should be a 
member of NATO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. The U.S. has been a major European power 
throughout the 20th century, intervening in three world wars (two hot and one cold) to prevent a 
hostile power or bloc of powers from dominating the continent. An American commitment to this 
basic security condition of Europe is an insurance policy that works to prevent another great power 
war in Europe. The premiums that America pays on this policy are commensurate with the benefits. 
A focused and clearly defined policy will ensure this balance is retained. In fact, the costs of these 
premiums have dropped tremendously since the end of the Cold War. In 1989, the United States 
military had over 313,000 servicemembers permanently stationed in Europe. That number is now 
down to 100,000.<sup>8 </sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with any insurance policy, the cost of being insured 
through NATO is far less than the cost of not being insured at all. A major power threat to the 
political freedom of the European continent was the condition that inevitably drew the U.S. into the 
enormously expensive campaigns of World Wars I and II and the Cold War. It is far better to have 
100,000 troops peaceably deployed in Europe now than have to commit a million later to fight a 
war that broke out in the absence of the one power that could guarantee the core security condition 
of Europe:  Less expensive to live as lodgers now than as liberators later. Even the most superficial 
and cursory look at modern history supports this view.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A U.S. 
commitment to the collective defense of Europe is necessary to preserve the economic prosperity of 
America. The system of international trade upon which American prosperity depends is predicated 
on free, stable, and orderly political conditions. In 1993, Europe was America's second largest 
customer, taking 31 percent of American exports. It also was the U.S.'s second largest supplier, 
providing 29 percent of imports. While the U.S. runs a large trade deficit with Asia, it has relatively 
balanced trade with Europe. More important, almost 50 percent of direct American investment 
abroad is in Europe, and over 60 percent of direct foreign investment in the U.S. comes from 
Europe. Finally, and closer to home, nearly 3 million Americans are employed in the U.S. by 
European-owned firms, and another 1.5 million American workers are supported directly by U.S. 
exports to Europe.<sup> 9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A great power threat to Europe would cause the wholesale 
disruption of the European economic order. The stability of world markets and international trade 
depend on a stable and thriving Europe. The United States cannot afford to cut itself off from the 
world market. Neither could the U.S. long sustain its economic growth if Europe as a whole were to 
enter an economic crisis born of insecurity or protracted instability. America's very standard of 
living depends on stable international financial and commodity markets, of which Europe is a 
critical element. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. America's defense of Europe 
through NATO strengthens America's values and identity as a nation. NATO is a community of 
democratic nations. It is based on a common set of ideals that originated in European thought but 
have become uniquely American. Helping to secure these ideals in Europe anchors the values of 
freedom and democracy at home, giving them a larger life on the world stage, and by so doing 
deepens their roots in America's own political culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to reinforcing these ideals and values, 
American commitment to NATO serves as a solidly practical vehicle for expanding democracy and 
freedom. NATO represents not only a "zone of peace and security," but a "zone of democracy" as 
well. Democratic systems and market economies produce free and prosperous societies and are 
stabilizing forces that serve to lessen tensions and prevent the conflicts NATO is intended to deter. 
While the main mission of NATO, as a defensive alliance, is not to crusade for democracy, it must 
be recognized that democracy is both a cause and effect in NATO. An alliance of free and 
democratic nations that wish to preserve their political and economic systems, NATO provides the 
security and stability in which democracy and economic prosperity can flourish.
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these compelling reasons for American 
involvement in NATO, the American public will not support such a commitment if it is not 
supported by a clear and coherent military strategy. A commitment that does not discriminate 
between situations where American power is necessary and those where it is merely a substitute for 
that of reluctant Europeans will cause the American people to balk at an expensive transatlantic 
responsibility. A recent poll by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy 
Attitudes shows that over 70 percent of Americans believe the United States should work 
principally through alliances or coalition structures to relieve America of some of its security 
burden. More conclusively, 71 percent of Americans said the U.S. is playing the role of world 
policeman "more than it should be."<sup>10 </sup>  Americans want multilateral security structures 
that make sense for America. This means working through military alliances, not the United 
Nations. Americans want the U.S. involved in alliances where the U.S. role is clearly understood, 
the burden is shared, and American participation is essential for success.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans need to understand clearly the criteria that 
determine the American role in NATO and NATO's role in Europe. In the identity crisis that has 
characterized NATO's search for a post-Cold War role, many new or revised missions have been 
entertained and questions raised. Should NATO operate only in its traditional area of operations, or 
should it consider out-of-area missions?  Should NATO concentrate on traditional notions of 
military deterrence and warfighting, or should it engage in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and 
military operations other than war?  Should NATO extend its nuclear guarantee to new members or 
associate members? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These questions are based on the search for relevant and 
viable missions that would justify the existence of NATO in the absence of a threat to its core role 
as a defensive alliance. As guidelines for determining the future American role in NATO, they 
completely miss the point. The U.S. role in NATO, a fundamentally American alliance, should be 
determined by principles of engagement, not by geographic parameters or mission types. Stating 
that the U.S. will undertake NATO operations only in certain areas or will not participate in certain 
types of missions unnecessarily limits American flexibility. Instead, the American role should be 
considered through guidelines that point the way to a successful and sensible role in 
NATO.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. NATO's mission is collective defense, not 
collective security. Collective defense seeks to tie many nations to a collaborative effort in 
defending their territory. It is inherently limited, focused, and reactive in its political nature. The 
missions of collective defense are straightforward and focused:  defend members from outside 
attack. Collective defense seeks to deter through military strength and defeat an aggressor when 
deterrence fails. Collective defense organizations cannot afford to do anything except succeed 
spectacularly. Any other result amounts to failure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Collective security arrangements are different from 
collective defense. They seek to provide a forum through which members can organize cooperative 
responses to security problems, especially those below the threshold of war. Collective security 
missions can include many quasi-military efforts such as humanitarian intervention, support for 
nation-building, peacekeeping, and peace-enforcement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States already is involved in a collective 
security organization in Europe, and it is not NATO. It is the 54-member Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Established in 1973, the OSCE has become increasingly 
institutionalized since the end of the Cold War. It is an organization that can act as a forum in 
which the nations of Europe can coordinate and integrate their common efforts towards preserving 
peace and stability. Along these lines, it has undertaken very limited fact-finding, sanctions-
monitoring, and observation missions in the former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Ukraine, Albania, and even Chechnya.<sup> 12</sup>  However, the OSCE is viewed largely as a 
toothless talking-shop. There is too much disparity among its members to institutionalize the 
military resources and structures needed for more significant military operations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The failure of the OSCE and the United Nations (another 
collective security organization) to deal competently with problems like Bosnia has thrust NATO 
into the picture. In short, events are taking NATO down the road to becoming something it never 
was:  a collective security organization. By default, not design, NATO has been consigned to fill 
the collective security gap in Europe. This means that NATO might become involved in even more 
ambiguous security missions like Bosnia. As it does so, it will find that the inevitable divergence of 
opinion over these operations will dilute its unique and formidable cohesion. NATO drew its 
strength from its core identity, which united all members. A lack of focus on its principal mission 
of collective defense will continue to weaken the alliance. As one U.N. scholar recently recognized, 
"NATO's biggest advantage over the UN, historically, has been agreement on some clearly defined 
defensive purposes, whereas the UN has an almost infinite range of responsibilities."<sup>13 </sup> 
 Using NATO for contentious collective security missions will only serve to erode that unique 
advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. public and Congress will not support an 
American-led alliance running hither and yon from one media-generated crisis to another and 
lacking criteria for distinguishing the roles of America and its European allies. The U.S. should 
refocus its role in NATO on the core mission:  to prevent a major power threat to Europe by a 
hostile power or bloc of powers. While U.S. participation in NATO peacekeeping operations 
should not be ruled out, it should be undertaken only if participation affects NATO's core mission 
or some other vital U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. The United States is the only military superpower in the 
world today. It has an enormous edge in intelligence-gathering systems, military technology, and 
the size, lethality, and professionalism of its armed forces. No other nation alone, and few 
combined, can challenge the combined air, land, sea, and space-based military capability of the 
U.S. But while America's military capabilities are enormous, they also are thinly spread. The Soviet 
threat has collapsed, but global U.S. military commitments remain. The U.S. military has been 
reduced by over one-third since the end of the Cold War and has been greatly strained in trying to 
honor its commitments with such a reduced force. This situation is made worse by the defense cuts 
imposed by the Clinton Administration -- cuts that underfund President Clinton's own strategy by 
some $150 billion over five years.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since American military forces are stretched thin, the U.S. 
must deploy them only when their capabilities and effect are unique. As a rule, America should not 
duplicate the efforts of the European powers. If an American infantry battalion is needed to balance 
a NATO force on paper, but does not make a unique contribution to the force, it should not be 
deployed in place of a similar European unit. The United States is not just another European power; 
it is a world power with unique capabilities and a unique role in European security. The division of 
labor in NATO military operations should be based on this premise. The intention is not to help the 
U.S. shirk mundane tasks, but to ensure that the American public see clearly that, to paraphrase 
Lyndon Johnson, "American boys aren't dying where French boys should."  The intention of an 
intelligent division of labor in NATO is to preserve, at all costs, the fundamental American security 
guarantee to Europe. To do that, Americans must be convinced that every NATO nation is pulling 
the wagon in the best way it can, and is not merely along for the ride. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does this mean that America would lose its leadership role 
in NATO, consigning itself to a specialist's role in the alliance?  Not at all. The U.S. need not match 
the Danes infantry battalion for infantry battalion to exert its leadership. At times the U.S. may need 
to deploy a large American combat formation in order to exercise its leadership in a NATO 
coalition of forces, even if the French, British, or Germans can match the size and type of 
contribution on paper. This is a unique contribution because it demonstrates the seriousness of the 
U.S. military commitment in a way that air, sea, or support forces cannot. A leader reserves his 
talents, time, and resources for important tasks that only he may be able to accomplish. It is good 
teamwork, but not always good leadership, for a leader to duplicate the efforts of others to the 
detriment of his unique responsibilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The last principle that should guide American military operations in NATO is that the 
American contribution should be decisive. The American military effort must make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. Ultimately, American support for a rich and prosperous 
NATO alliance cannot be sustained if the American public and Congress see that the basic security 
condition of Europe can be guaranteed without the United States. If that is the case, it is time for the 
United States to come home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States military contribution should push the 
effort over the top. In some cases, this may mean the limited deployment of special capabilities that 
dramatically enhance and multiply the effectiveness of a European-dominated coalition. For 
example, the U.S. may wish to deploy intelligence, logistics, air, sea, and specialized combat 
support units to assist a European effort in out-of-area peacekeeping. In the core missions of 
NATO, the U.S. may need to dominate the force structure, base its operations on American 
command and control structures, and take the lead in determining strategy and operations. This was 
the arrangement in the Persian Gulf War. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics might argue that this distinction robs the United 
States of a leadership role in day-to-day European events and reserves U.S. influence for some 
cataclysmic battle for Europe's future. Once again, this presents a narrow reading of the principle of 
a decisive role and discounts the role that competent American leadership can play in Europe. The 
United States can exercise American leadership in NATO and European security affairs in many 
ways. American diplomacy, political influence, and economic tools all can be decisive in conflicts 
outside of a great power threat to Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, randomly deploying American military forces 
on peripheral missions in order to "fill out" a European force structure and "preserve American 
leadership" will erode American support for NATO. It traps the U.S. into having always to "lead" 
in even the most marginal operations, because European security systems have no other viable 
alternative. In a recent address to Congress, President Jacques Chirac of France seemed to support 
this line of reasoning, stating that reform of NATO would "enable the European allies to assume 
full responsibilities, with the support of NATO facilities, whenever the United States does not wish 
to engage its ground forces."<sup>15 </sup>  America leads in NATO because of the conditions that 
leadership engenders, conditions that must be favorable to the United States. Leadership is not an 
end in itself.
<p>


<b>EXPANDING THE EUROPEAN ZONE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The immediate enlargement of NATO to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would bring a level of stability and security to Central 
Europe that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history. In short, it would expand 
the zone of peace and freedom that NATO has provided for Western Europe for almost 50 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, those who take a skeptical view of NATO 
enlargement raise questions about provoking Russia and drawing a "new Iron Curtain in Europe."  
They also point to the technical and financial difficulties involved in military integration and 
NATO interoperability. Other critics maintain that the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have 
not yet shown a sustained commitment to free market economies, democratic political institutions, 
and civilian control of the military.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The naysayers of NATO enlargement are making the same 
mistakes that opponents of German reunification made in 1990. At that time, it was widely thought 
that the Soviet Union would never accept a unified Germany. At most the Soviets might accept a 
long-term plan for confederation within a neutral Germany.<sup>16 </sup>  Among the many dire 
warnings that came from the Soviets was the prediction by then Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze that "Europe could come again to ruin on German soil."  British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and French President Franois Mitterand were adamantly opposed to German 
unification; many Germans balked at the tremendous costs to be borne by the West German 
taxpayer; and even after the reunification plan was announced, Soviet President Gorbachev warned 
the U.S. that a reunified Germany in NATO would be an absolutely "unacceptable shift in the 
balance of power."<sup>17 </sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten months later, in October 1990, reunification was fact. 
More significantly, the reunified Germany was not some neutral European entity, but a leading 
NATO member. What was unthinkable to the world less than a year before was neatly 
accomplished due to the driving leadership and vision of President George Bush and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. A comprehensive strategy was undertaken adroitly by these two leaders. President 
Bush in particular put forward a three-part plan which ensured that Germany would not work issues 
in isolation from the Soviets, that the Soviets would not feel forced into a corner, and that a unified 
Germany must be a full member of NATO.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This courageous approach should have been adopted for 
NATO enlargement from the beginning. In fact, the window of opportunity for bringing a 
guarantee of peace and stability to Central Europe is rapidly disappearing. The Clinton 
Administration has dragged its feet on NATO enlargement, taking the exclusive counsel of its fears. 
The Administration had hoped that the soft line on NATO enlargement would encourage Russian 
democratic reforms and make enlargement "easier" in the future. In essence, President Clinton has 
given Russia a veto over how, when, and where NATO will enlarge, ostensibly to gain Russian 
cooperation in Bosnia and stop a hard-line trend that already has occurred and is getting 
worse.<sup> 18</sup>  However, it is clear that being soft on NATO enlargement has not stopped 
the Russian drift away from democratic reforms. The election results in the Russian Duma and the 
appointment of hard-liner Yevgeny Primakov as Russian Foreign Minister should give notice that 
the trend is most likely in the other direction.<sup>19 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs a plan to admit Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia as soon as possible. The first pillar of this plan would offer full 
membership for these countries. To be sure, there will be technical difficulties, and these countries 
will put a financial burden on NATO. However, the costs are far outweighed by the greater 
geopolitical good of NATO enlargement. Full NATO membership for these Central European 
countries will bring them a security and stability they have never known.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A purely military line that distinguishes NATO from non-
NATO should stop for the time being after the admission of these four countries. As with German 
reunification, Russia must be convinced that while she has no veto, she is a partner in Europe and 
her security concerns are a consideration. Limited NATO enlargement will make it clear that 
enlargement is not intended to encircle Russia with an adversarial alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To reinforce this point, NATO must modify the 
Partnership for Peace program (PFP) by dropping its membership provision. Other useful aspects of 
PFP, such as association through defense cooperation, should be retained. PFP offers an official 
association with NATO and the implicit guarantee of full membership. However, it also perpetuates 
a damaging myth:  that NATO eventually can include every part of the former Soviet Union 
(including Russia). Such a move is unsound for several reasons. Admitting all the PFP states to 
NATO would dilute the cohesion of NATO as a focused alliance of collective defense. A NATO of 
some 40 nations, including Russia or other former Soviet Republics, would be a collective security 
organization as unwieldy and ineffective as the OSCE or U.N. NATO cannot be all things to all 
people; if it attempts to do so, it will lose the unique and formidable cohesion that makes it the most 
functional military alliance in existence.
<p>

<b>TOWARD A REVITALIZED NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has failed to develop a sound 
strategy for NATO. Lacking a practical vision for America's role in Europe, President Clinton has 
taken the alliance in dangerous directions. If the present course is not changed, it could threaten the 
survival of the alliance. To give NATO badly needed focus in the post-Cold War era, Congress 
needs to step into the breach opened by the President's failure to articulate a coherent NATO 
strategy. Congress should consider, as an amendment to the FY 1997 Defense authorization bill, a 
NATO Revitalization Act that:
<p><ul>
<li>Spells out America's vital national interests in Europe, explains the reasons for America's 
participation in NATO and the U.S. strategic role, and states that NATO is a political insurance 
policy that ensures Europe will not be dominated by a hostile power or bloc of powers;
<p>
<li>Defines the principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, states that any 
significant American combat force commitment to a NATO operation must be firmly grounded in 
NATO's core mission of collective defense, and recognizes that U.S. forces must make a unique 
and decisive contribution to NATO military action;
<p>
<li>Encourages the Europeans to take lead roles in addressing marginal and peripheral security 
problems while guaranteeing an active U.S. support role in these endeavors; 
<p>
<li>Offers immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia 
and drops the implicit guarantee of membership for other countries in the Partnership for Peace 
program.
</ul><P>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is an American alliance. It is a tool that America 
needs to defend its vital national interests in Europe. It does not need charity work in the form of 
attempting to reinvent itself as a pan-European alliance of collective security. NATO protects the 
political freedom and economic prosperity of the United States, and serves as an effective means to 
this end.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. In the absence of a 
clear and present danger to Europe, it has lost its focus. It has tried to become relevant by 
embarking on military make-work programs for the United Nations, and now on its own behalf. 
These diffuse efforts have diluted NATO's cohesion and caused U.S. public support for the alliance 
to erode.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and 
preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe. It will enhance this support by laying out 
principles guiding U.S. military action in NATO. These criteria will serve to put forth a clearly 
understood and sensible division of labor in NATO that will keep the alliance strong. This strong, 
cohesive, and focused NATO must undertake limited enlargement to extend the zone of peace, 
security, and freedom to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. This will enhance 
NATO as an alliance of collective defense. Forestalling enlargement and failing to refocus NATO 
will, at best, turn the alliance into an incohesive and emasculated collective security organization 
that bears no resemblance to its robust predecessor.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel long has sought a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors, and has made great progress since the landmark 1991 peace conference in Madrid. It signed a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 and concluded a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. But negotiations with Syria have proceeded at a glacial pace. One of the major obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations has been Syrian insistence on recovering the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, without ironclad security guarantees that Syria would not use the Golan as a staging area for aggression against Israel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has tried to bridge the negotiating gap by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor compliance with any agreement, but it has resisted congressional calls to examine the wisdom of such a commitment, claiming that a public debate would be premature. Administration officials contend that the details of a peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights have not been worked out and a final commitment has not been made. However, Defense Secretary William Perry, after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on January 8, confirmed the Clinton Administration's long-standing offer to provide U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor the Golan Heights. Although Perry had said last September that the U.S. "should be willing" to contribute forces that would facilitate a peace accord, he recently firmed up the U.S. offer by proclaiming, "we are prepared to do that."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress Should Hold Hearings.</b> Now that Secretary Perry has explicitly made this offer, Congress should hold hearings to examine the potential costs and benefits of this commitment. It also should press the Administration to reconsider its risky plans to enter such an open-ended peacekeeping operation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Administration has resisted congressional scrutiny of the Golan peacekeeping question, arguing that it could complicate efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. While this may be true, the Administration would be wise to gauge congressional support for a possible Golan peacekeeping operation now, rather than risk having an agreement unravel later due to congressional disapproval.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has its own reasons for debating a Golan peacekeeping commitment sooner rather than later, as underscored by the recent experience in Bosnia. The rapid pace of developments in the Bosnian peace negotiations greatly limited congressional debate, with U.S. troops being deployed to Bosnia only 11 days after the November 21, 1995, signing of the Dayton peace accords. While the pace of Syrian-Israeli negotiations is likely to be slower, Congress must address the Golan peacekeeping issue before, not after, the Israelis and Syrians negotiate a deal if it wants to avoid being presented with another diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i> by the Clinton Administration.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel is a sovereign state, and it is Israel's prerogative to negotiate whatever diplomatic arrangements it finds necessary to assure its security and promote peace. Washington should actively support efforts to build a just and lasting Arab-Israeli peace.<sup>2</sup>  But when America is asked to ensure the implementation of an agreement which entails obvious risks to American peacekeepers, the U.S. Congress has a right and duty to examine the risks and benefits of such a commitment, as it would do with any other peacekeeping commitment.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Congress examines the Golan Heights peacekeeping issue, it should bear in mind that American troops should not be involved in such a mission. There are five reasons for this conclusion.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing U.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula. Unlike the American troops assigned to the multinational peacekeeping force on the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai since 1982, peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be sandwiched between two large armored forces in a much smaller area. Moreover, Syria historically has been much more hostile to the U.S. than has Egypt, which is now a U.S. ally. Thus, a Golan peacekeeping operation would be much riskier.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. U.S. peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be close to southern Lebanon, which is a major staging area for numerous terrorist groups that oppose Arab-Israeli peace.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. An American presence on the Golan will constrain Israel's military options more than Syria's and will sap Israel's self-reliance. In the long run, this could strain U.S.-Israel relations.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. A small force will be unable to defend itself against possible terrorist or Syrian military attacks, while a large force will be a major drain on active U.S. Army forces.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. Other countries can play the same peacekeeping role. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, comprised of troops from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland, has been deployed on the Golan for almost 22 years to monitor the 1974 Syrian-Israeli Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under no circumstances should the U.S. promise foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. The prospective recovery of the Golan Heights and peace itself are Syria's peace dividends. Moreover, the U.S. should remember that it has important national interests to advance regarding Syria that go beyond brokering a Syrian-Israeli peace agreement. Congress must prevent the Administration's preoccupation with the peace process from obscuring American interests in halting Syrian support of terrorism, promoting Lebanon's independence from Syrian domination, ending Syrian subversion of Turkey, halting drug smuggling in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, and isolating Syria's ally Iran.
<p>

<b>THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Golan Heights comprise some of the most strategically significant terrain in the world. Occupying its high forward slopes gives Israel line-of-sight surveillance of Syrian military movements and electronic communications. Electronic intelligence-gathering facilities in the Golan provide early warning of threatening developments in the plains southwest of the Syrian capital of Damascus, or in south Lebanon. Control of the Golan also provides Israel, a small country, with something it badly needs:  a buffer zone to give it strategic depth. Before losing the Heights in 1967, Syria used its commanding position on the Golan to bombard the Israeli settlements in the nearby Galilee region. Highly lucrative agricultural and tourist sites around the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) now are safe. Finally, the Golan highlands form a watershed that supplies approximately 30 percent of Israel's water. Dominating the Golan watershed means potential control of this vital freshwater resource. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For these strategic reasons, most past Israeli governments, whether led by the Labor or Likud parties, have not been willing to withdraw from the Golan, which the Israel Defense Force (IDF) captured in a bold and courageous operation in 1967. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin began direct negotiations with Syria under American auspices after his June 1992 election, but declined to specify how far Israel would withdraw on the Golan until Damascus made clear what kind of peace and security arrangements it was willing to make. Syria's Hafez al-Assad broke off the talks in July 1995, insisting on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights. After Rabin's November 4 assassination, his successor, former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, dropped Rabin's insistence that security arrangements be dealt with first.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Peres used his December 12, 1995, speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress to appeal to Assad to resume the talks. Assad agreed and the talks were revived on December 27. Two rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks already have been held at the Wye Plantation in eastern Maryland, and a third round began on January 23. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has offered to undertake open-ended shuttle diplomacy between the two countries to bridge the still-wide gaps. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though Israel is eager to make peace and maintain the momentum generated by the diplomatic breakthrough with the Palestinians reached in Oslo in 1993, many Israelis are deeply concerned about the potential threat to their security if the IDF withdraws and the Syrian army moves back onto the Golan. The position of the Peres government is that the benefits of a deal with Syria outweigh the risks and that Israel must deal now, while the opportunity exists, and while Israel is in a position of strength. But most Israelis nevertheless believe that only extraordinary security guarantees can make the return of the Golan to Syria acceptable. 

<p>
<b>FIVE REASONS TO REJECT U.S. PEACEKEEPING IN THE GOLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One possible guarantee is the deployment of U.S. troops on the Golan, either as part of a multinational operation or alone, and either in a pure "peacekeeping" role or as a kind of tripwire to hedge against renewed hostilities from Syria. This possibility has been a matter of speculation in Washington for over two years. The Clinton Administration has aggressively discouraged congressional consideration of the issue, maintaining that it is premature to address the issue of an American peacekeeping force on the Golan.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Secretary Perry's January 8 statement indicating that the U.S. is prepared to deploy a Golan peacekeeping force has considerably undermined this argument. Congress soon must consider the implications of a U.S. peacekeeping deployment on the Golan, or it will find itself reacting to a diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>, as in Bosnia. While examining the Golan peacekeeping issue, Congress should bear in mind five reasons that the U.S. should reject a U.S. peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing mission on the Sinai Peninsula. U.S. and Israeli officials often cite the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which monitors compliance with the security arrangements in the Sinai peninsula, as a model for an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan. The MFO, created in 1982 to monitor compliance with the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, is composed of three battalions of troops from Colombia, Fiji, and the U.S. and a Civilian Observer Unit staffed with American personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, however, would operate in a markedly different geographic, military, and political environment. Rather than being deployed in a vast, empty desert far from the main bodies of the opposing military forces, Golan peacekeepers would be stationed in a constricted area, sandwiched between large armored forces in positions that would quickly become important military objectives if fighting were to break out. Unlike the remote, sparsely populated Sinai, the Golan also would be a more hospitable operating theater for terrorists based in neighboring Lebanon or among civilians living in the Golan Heights. Finally, Hafez al-Assad's Syria today is a far cry from Anwar Sadat's Egypt. Not only has Syria supported terrorists that have killed Americans and provoked military clashes with the U.S. in Lebanon in 1983, but Assad is extremely unlikely to become a reliable U.S. ally in the future, unlike Sadat's Egypt.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much depends on the details of an Israel-Syrian treaty. If an agreement leads to the removal of a standing Syrian mechanized army within 40 kilometers of the Golan, then U.S. troops, as in the Sinai MFO, might play a useful role in monitoring or verifying compliance with the treaty. But if large Syrian forces remain deployed close by and a significant potential security threat remains, then a mere monitoring mission makes little sense. In essence, the U.S. force would be serving as a deterrent or tripwire to prevent Syria reverting to the use of arms.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There also are major questions about size, composition, mission, and command and control of the Golan force. An MFO-like monitoring force would be small and lightly armed. But a small, light force would have difficulty protecting itself from terror attacks emanating from Lebanon, let alone a Syrian military offensive. Therefore, a U.S. peacekeeping force in the Golan would have to be large enough to deter attacks from any source and defend itself. In other words, it must be a large combat formation, configured for possible combat, with appropriate rules of engagement. But a large force, such as an armored or mechanized infantry brigade, would be costly and a drain on the U.S. military presence in more important regions such as Europe or South Korea.<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. Unlike the Sinai MFO, Golan peacekeepers would be vulnerable to significant terrorist threats. They would be stationed close to southern and eastern Lebanon, the staging area for some of the world's most dangerous terrorists, including Hezbollah, the militant pro-Iranian terrorist group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups operating in Lebanon have a history of attacking Americans. They will have even more reason to use terrorism to disrupt an American-brokered peace agreement that they violently oppose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Syria itself is one of the chief exporters of international terrorism.<sup>3</sup>  Assad repeatedly has used terrorism as an adjunct of foreign policy in inter-Arab politics, in Lebanon, and against Israel. He also supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in 1983-1984. Given his success in helping Hezbollah to drive U.S. peacekeepers out of Lebanon in 1984, Assad may try a similar strategy in the Golan if he decides to seek their removal. Even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, however, Iran, Iraq, and Libya could support Lebanon-based terrorist proxies against U.S. forces in the Golan. Since U.S. troops will be a lightning rod for terrorism, particularly due to American brokering of a Syrian-Israel peace accord, a Golan peacekeeping operation should not be manned by Americans.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. A peacekeeping force is supposed to be a neutral, honest broker, but maintaining a neutral stance is likely to have a negative political, military, and psychological impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. This would be particularly true if the U.S. maintains strict neutrality with respect to Israel and Syria in the implementation of any agreement. At a minimum, sharp differences of opinion are likely to arise concerning compliance issues and the interpretation of Syrian activities along the border. Deeper strains in the bilateral relationship could occur if Israel concluded that the peacekeeping forces were turning a blind eye to Syrian violations of the peace treaty or if Washington concluded that Israel was overreacting to minor or ambiguous Syrian violations. It should be remembered that American participation in the 1982-1984 multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon led to considerable friction with Israel and at one point an American Marine officer brandished a pistol to halt the advance of an Israeli tank.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A U.S. presence on the Golan also will sap Israeli self-reliance. Because Syria adamantly rejects allowing Israel to maintain early warning facilities in the Golan as an infringement on its sovereignty, Israel is likely to become more dependent on U.S. spy satellites and aircraft. The U.S. presence also will put a brake on Israeli military operations in the event of conflict with Syria or terrorists in Lebanon. Their presence will constrain Israel's military options, possibly depriving Israel of the opportunity to launch a preemptive military strike if a Syrian attack was imminent. Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked. They are likely to constitute only a marginal military deterrent to Syria and they will be unable to provide adequate early warning to Israel.<sup>4</sup>  The real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the U.S. will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts. This is dangerous because it could engender a false sense of security that could lead Israelis to take more risks in peace negotiations with Syria than they otherwise would take.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. The U.S. cannot afford to commit an ever-larger proportion of its declining active duty forces to worldwide peacekeeping operations. Sending U.S. troops to Haiti and Bosnia already has depleted America's strategic reserve and could jeopardize American interests by stretching U.S. forces thin around the world. It should be remembered that the peacekeeping commitments to Haiti and Bosnia, and now possibly on the Golan as well, were made in addition to the existing military alliance commitments in Europe and Asia -- and even as the Clinton Administration is trying to cut the defense budget even further.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For a Golan peacekeeping mission to be credible, it would require the commitment of a large force consisting of at least a heavy brigade, roughly 5,000 troops. To maintain a long term deployment of this force, three brigades would have to be dedicated to the mission:  one on deployment, one recovering and retraining after returning from the mission, and one training and preparing to deploy on the mission. This is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength, a prohibitively high burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission. If the U.S. is suddenly faced with conflict in other regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula, the forces on the Golan could be sorely needed to protect vital U.S. national interests.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to diverting troops from other, more important missions, an open-ended peacekeeping mission on the Golan will reduce the military effectiveness of troops available for other missions. Troops returning from the Golan will need many months of retraining to regain the warfighting skills that atrophied during their peacekeeping deployment.<sup>5</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American Golan peacekeeping commitment also would entail considerable financial costs, and could drain away hundreds of millions of dollars from the defense budget. Congress already has scaled back the U.S. contribution to the Sinai MFO budget, cutting it from $80 million to $74 million in fiscal year 1988. Similar budgetary pressures could undercut a Golan MFO, even if other nations contribute to the costs of the operation.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. If peacekeepers are needed to monitor a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, they should not be Americans. An American peacekeeping presence would be a lightning rod for terrorism, would drain the U.S. defense budget unnecessarily, and would strain Israeli-American relations. Other countries are willing and fully able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces. After all, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has deployed peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to blocking an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights, Congress should press the Clinton Administration to:
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Rule out foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. To make it clear that no U.S. aid will be forthcoming to sweeten a Syrian-Israeli deal, Congress should pass a resolution opposing U.S. foreign aid to Syria. The reward for peace is peace, not billions of dollars of bribery. America's aid to Egypt, a country which did not launch terrorist attacks against Americans, came after the 1978 Camp David accords and in the context of the Cold War. Egypt switched sides and left the Soviet orbit to become a reliable American ally. Syria has no Soviet card to play. The U.S. must allocate its increasingly scarce foreign aid resources to long-term friends and not use foreign aid as a reward to Syria, a long-standing adversary. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Maintain pressure on Syria to halt its support of terrorism. Damascus supports over one dozen terrorist groups, including many Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The U.S. should push Syria relentlessly to expel these Palestinians from Syrian territory and Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory, crack down on Hezbollah in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and cooperate with the U.S. in breaking the back of international terrorist groups. There can be no genuine peace as long as Syria maintains ties with terrorists. Congress should ensure that the war against terrorism remains a high priority of U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, Syria should not be removed from the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism unless Damascus halts its support for terrorism. Syria should not be removed from the list merely as a reward for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights is not needed. It would not significantly reduce the military risks that Israel would run in returning the Golan to Syrian control. The U.S. cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit. Nor should it seek to downplay the significant military risks attendant on returning the Golan Heights to Syria. If Israel decides to do so, that is its prerogative, but it should do so without the implied commitment represented by a U.S. tripwire on the Golan. There are many other nations that would be willing to provide peacekeeping forces, if that is necessary.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress must open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another <i>fait accompli</i> like Haiti or Bosnia. Now that Secretary of Defense Perry has confirmed that a U.S. commitment of some sort exists, it can no longer be deemed "premature" for Congress to discuss the issue.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The bottom line:  Syria gets more out of a peace agreement with Israel than does the U.S. and therefore should be willing to pay more for it. Washington should push Assad to acquiesce to America's agenda and not get bogged down in more narrow peace negotiating issues. The U.S. must not jeopardize important national interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic.

<b>INTRODUCTION<sup>2</sup></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By extolling freedom of religion in the schools, President Bill Clinton has raised the level of debate on the importance of religion to American life.<sup>3</sup>  The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America has always been a religious country. "Its first Christian inhabitants were only too anxious to explain what they were doing and why," explains historian Paul Johnson. "In a way the first American settlers were like the ancient Israelites. They saw themselves as active agents of divine providence."<sup>4</sup>  Today, he adds, "it is generally accepted that more than half the American people still attend a place of worship over a weekend, an index of religious practice unequaled anywhere in the world, certainly in a great and populous nation."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of religious practice is prayer: Americans pray even more than they go to church. According to a composite of surveys, 94 percent of blacks, 91 percent of women, 87 percent of whites, and 85 percent of men regard themselves as people who pray regularly. Some 78 percent pray at least once per week, and 57 percent pray daily. Even among the 13 percent of the population who call themselves agnostics or atheists, some 20 percent pray daily.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When policymakers consider America's grave social problems, including violent crime and rising illegitimacy, substance abuse, and welfare dependency, they should heed the findings in the professional literature of the social sciences on the positive consequences that flow from the practice of religion.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, there is ample evidence that:<p><ul><li> The strength of the family unit is intertwined with the practice of religion. Churchgoers<sup>8</sup> are more likely to be married, less likely to be divorced or single, and more likely to manifest high levels of satisfaction in marriage.
<p>
<li> Church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability and happiness.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion helps poor persons move out of poverty. Regular church attendance, for example, is particularly instrumental in helping young people to escape the poverty of inner-city life.
<p>
<li>Religious belief and practice contribute substantially to the formation of personal moral criteria and sound moral judgment.
<p>
<li> Regular religious practice generally inoculates individuals against a host of social problems, including suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, and divorce.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion also encourages such beneficial effects on mental health as less depression (a modern epidemic), more self-esteem, and greater family and marital happiness.
<p>
<li> In repairing damage caused by alcoholism, drug addiction, and marital breakdown, religious belief and practice are a major source of strength and recovery.
<p>
<li> Regular practice of religion is good for personal physical health: It increases longevity, improves one's chances of recovery from illness, and lessens the incidence of many killer diseases.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overall impact of religious practice is illustrated dramatically in the three most comprehensive systematic reviews of the field.<sup>9</sup>  Some 81 percent of the studies showed the positive benefit of religious practice, 15 percent showed neutral effects, and only 4 percent showed harm.<sup>10</sup>  Each of these systematic reviews indicated more than 80 percent benefit, and none indicated more than 10 percent harm. Even this 10 percent may be explained by more recent social science insights into "healthy religious practice" and "unhealthy religious practice."<sup>11</sup>  This latter notion will be discussed later -- it is seen generally by most Americans of religious faith as a mispractice of religion. Unfortunately, the effects of unhealthy religious practice are used to downplay the generally positive influence of religion.<sup>12</sup>  This both distorts the true nature of religious belief and practice and causes many policymakers to ignore its positive social consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Religious practice appears to have enormous potential for addressing today's social problems. As summarized in 1991 by Allen Bergin, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, considerable evidence indicates that religious involvement reduces "such problems as sexual permissiveness, teen pregnancy, suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism, and to some extent deviant and delinquent acts, and increases self esteem, family cohesiveness and general well being.... Some religious influences have a modest impact whereas another portion seem like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy.... More generally, social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>13</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor Bergin's summary was echoed two years later by nationally syndicated columnist William Raspberry: "Almost every commentator on the current scene bemoans the increase of violence, lowered ethical standards and loss of civility that mark American society. Is the decline of religious influence part of what is happening to us?  Is it not just possible that anti-religious bias masquerading as religious neutrality is costing more than we have been willing to acknowledge?"<sup>14</sup>  Other reviews<sup>15</sup> also list the positive effects of religious belief and practice in reducing such problems as suicide, substance abuse, divorce, and marital dissatisfaction. Such evidence indicates clearly that religious practice contributes significantly to the quality of American life.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given this evidence, <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress should:</b><ul>
<p>
<li> Begin a new national debate to help renew the role of religion in American life;
<p>
<li> Ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the evidence on the beneficial effects of religious practice in the relevant social science literature and report its findings to a national commission formed to promote the consideration of religious practice among U.S. citizens;
<p>
<li> Fund federal experiments with school choice that include religiously affiliated schools;
<p>
<li>Pass a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that data on religious practice are useful for policymakers and researchers as part of the public policy debate; and
<p>
<li> Mandate a census question on religious practice. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious practice in America.
<p>
</ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The President should:</b>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Appoint judges who are more sensitive to the role of religion in public life, with the Senate ensuring that such is the case by ascertaining the stand of judges on matters of religion and its relationship to the Constitution;
<p>
<li> Direct the Bureau of the Census to record levels of religious practice in the census for the year 2000 (time is running out for preparation of the census questionnaire); and
<p>
<li> Issue a directive to all federal agencies making clear that cooperation between government entities and the social, medical, and educational services of faith-based organizations does not violate separation of church and state.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The U.S. Supreme Court should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Review the decisions in which it has changed the laws of the land by changing commonly held beliefs regarding the Constitution and religion and send to Congress those that should have been the object of legislative action rather than judicial reinterpretation.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>America's religious leaders should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Be much more assertive in emphasizing the contribution of religion to the health of the nation and in resisting efforts to minimize religion in public discourse;
<p>
<li> Make clear to their congregations that they are contributing not only to their own welfare, but also to the well-being of the nation by their regular attendance at religious worship;
<p>
<li> Take special care of the religious formation of children, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence, when they are most likely to lose their religious faith;
<p>
<li> Recognize that the church in the inner city, especially the black church, has a vital role to play in helping its people escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty; and
<p>
<li> Encourage education leaders, social scientists, and social policy practitioners to rely more on religious belief and worship to achieve social policy and social work goals.
</ul><p>

<b>RELIGION AND HAPPINESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since Aristotle outlined the goal of a sound civil order in his <i>Politics</i>,<sup>16</sup> social and political scientists and social psychologists have been particularly interested in what makes human beings happy. Happy people tend to be productive and law-abiding. They learn well, make good citizens, and are invariably pleasant company. It turns out that the practice of religion has a significant effect on happiness and an overall sense of personal well-being. Religious affiliation and regular church attendance are near the top of the list for most people in explaining their own happiness<sup>17</sup> and serve as good predictors of who is most likely to have this sense of well-being.<sup>18</sup>  Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who attend religious services regularly.<sup>19</sup>  Those pursuing a personal relationship with God tend to have improved relationships with themselves and with others.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A large epidemiological study conducted by the University of California at Berkeley in 1971 found that the religiously committed had much less psychological distress than the uncommitted.<sup>21</sup>  Rodney Stark, now of the University of Washington, found the same in a 1970 study: The higher the level of religious attendance, the less stress suffered when adversity had to be endured.<sup>22</sup>  Similarly, in a longitudinal study of 720 adults conducted by David Williams of the University of Michigan, regular religious attendance led to much less psychological distress.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, David Larson, adjunct professor at the Northwestern and Duke University Schools of Medicine and president of the National Institute of Healthcare Research, completed a systematic review of studies on religious commitment and personal well-being. He found that the relationship is powerful and positive; overall, psychological functioning improved following a resumption of participation in religious worship for those who had stopped.<sup>24</sup><p>
<b>RELIGION AND FAMILY STABILITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a growing consensus that America needs to pursue policies aimed at re-strengthening the family. The beneficial effects of religious worship on family stability clearly indicate one way to help accomplish this. Professors Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry of Brigham Young University's Department of Sociology sum up earlier research<sup>25</sup> on the quest by young people for meaning and love: "Research on love clearly indicates that for many, love in the social realm cannot clearly be separated from love that contains a vertical or a divine element.... Young people see love as the central aspect of the meaning of life; they believe that religion is still important in helping form judgments and attitudes."<sup>26</sup>  Their conclusion: "Family and religious institutions need to be studied simultaneously in our efforts to understand the human condition better."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Middletown," one of the century's classic sociological research projects, studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and for the third time in the 1980s. Based on the latest round of follow-up research, Howard Bahr and Bruce Chadwick, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, concluded in 1985 that "There is a relationship between family solidarity -- family health if you will -- and church affiliation and activity. Middletown [churchgoing] members were more likely to be married, remain married and to be highly satisfied with their marriages and to have more children.... The great divide between marriage status, marriage satisfaction and family size is... between those who identify with a church or denomination and those who do not."<sup>28</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Four years later, Professor Arland Thornton of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan likewise concluded from a Detroit study of the same relationship that "These data indicate strong intergenerational transmission of religious involvement. Attendance at religious services is also very stable within generations across time."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"With striking consistency, the most religious among us [as Americans] place a greater importance on the full range of family and friendship activities," concluded a Connecticut Mutual Life report in 1982.<sup>30</sup>  A group of Kansas State University professors reached the same conclusion: "Family commitment is indeed a high priority in many American families and it is frequently accompanied by a concomitant factor of religious commitment."<sup>31</sup>  In yet another study conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, professors Nick Stinnet of the University of Alabama and John DeFrain of the University of Nebraska sought to identify family strengths. From their nationwide surveys of strong families, they found that 84 percent identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.<sup>32</sup>  It should be noted that the same pattern appears to hold for African-American families: Parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidelines.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Marital Satisfaction.</b> Couples with long-lasting marriages indicate that the practice of religion is an important factor in marital happiness. Indeed, David Larson's systematic reviews indicate that church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability.<sup>34</sup>  Others have found the same result.<sup>35</sup>  Twenty years ago it was first noted that very religious women achieve greater satisfaction in sexual intercourse with their husbands than do moderately religious or non-religious women.<sup>36</sup>  The <i>Sex in America</i> study published in 1995, and conducted by sociologists from the University of Chicago and the State University of New York at Stonybrook, also showed very high sexual satisfaction among "conservative" religious women.<sup>37</sup>  From the standpoint of contemporary American media culture, this may appear strange or counter-intuitive, but the empirical evidence is consistent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Divorce and Cohabitation.</b> Regular church attendance is the critical factor in marital stability across denominations and overrides effects of doctrinal teaching on divorce. For instance, black Protestants and white Catholics, who share similarly high church attendance rates, have been shown to have similarly low divorce rates.<sup>38</sup>  Furthermore, when marital separation occurs, reconciliation rates are higher among regular church attendees, and highest when both spouses have the same high level of church attendance.<sup>39</sup>  Findings on the other end of the marital spectrum reinforce the point: A 1993 national survey of 3,300 men aged 20-39 found that those who switch partners most are those with no religious convictions.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, cohabitation before marriage poses a high risk to later marital stability,<sup>41</sup> and premarital cohabitation is much less common among religious Americans. "The cohabitation rate is seven times higher among persons who seldom or never attend religious services compared to persons who frequently attend," writes David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research. "Women who attended religious services once a week were only one-third as likely to cohabit as those who attended church services less than once a month."  Furthermore, "If the mother frequently attended religious services, both sons and daughters were only 50 percent as likely to cohabit as adult children whose mothers were not actively religious."<sup>42</sup>  Rockford Institute President Allan Carlson summarizes the pattern: "Social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>43</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is that too many social scientists have failed to appreciate the significance of research on the relationship between family and religion. As another researcher of the same period concludes, "We may have underestimated this 'silent majority' and it is only fair to give them equal time."<sup>44</sup>  The centrality of stable married family life in avoiding such problems as crime,<sup>45</sup> illegitimacy,<sup>46</sup> and welfare<sup>47</sup> has become indisputable. If such a stable family life is linked closely to a lively religious life, as these studies indicate, then the peace and happiness of the nation depend significantly on a renewal of religious practice and belief.
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In public health circles, the level of educational attainment is held to be the key demographic predictor of physical health. For over two decades, however, the level of religious practice has been shown convincingly to be equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As early as 1972, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health found that cardiovascular diseases, the leading killers of older people, were reduced significantly in early old age by a lifetime of regular church attendance. By contrast, non-attendees had higher mortality rates for such other diseases as cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, and arteriosclerosis, in addition to other cardiovascular diseases and even suicide.<sup>48</sup>  Research on mortality patterns among the poor confirmed a decade later that those who went to church regularly lived longer.<sup>49</sup>  Since then, other studies have reinforced this general finding.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Blood pressure, a key factor in cardiovascular health, is reduced significantly by regular church attendance, on average by 5mm of pressure.<sup>51</sup>  Given that reducing blood pressure by 2 to 4 mm also reduces the mortality rate by 10 to 20 percent for any given population,<sup>52</sup> a reduction of 5 mm is a very significant public health achievement by any standard. For those over 55 years of age, the average decrease was 6 mm. Among those who smoked -- a practice that increases blood pressure -- regular church attendance decreased the risk of early stroke by 700 percent.<sup>53</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor are the health benefits of religious commitment confined to the cardiovascular system. In 1987, a major review of 250 epidemiological health research studies -- studies which examined the relationship between health and religion and measured such additional outcomes as colitis, cancers of many different types, and longevity measures -- concluded that, in general, religious commitment improves health.<sup>54</sup>  A 1991 study of two national samples<sup>55</sup> also concluded that the degree to which people prayed and participated in religious services significantly affected their health status, regardless of age.<sup>56</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In what must be one of the most unusual experiments in medical history, Dr. Robert B. Byrd, a cardiologist then at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School, conducted a random-sample, double-blind study of the effects of prayer -- not <i>by</i> the patients but <i>for</i> the patients -- on the outcome of cardiac surgery. The study was published in 1982. None of the patients knew they were being prayed for, none of the attending doctors and nurses knew who was being prayed for and who was not, and those praying had no personal contact with the patients before or during the experiment. Outcomes for the two sets of patients differed significantly: Those prayed for ha
d noticeably fewer post-operative congestive heart failures, fewer cardiopulmonary arrests, less pneumonia, and less need for antibiotics.<sup>57</sup>  To date, this study has not been replicated, though the intriguing results challenge the academic and medical community to verify or disprove them.<p><b>RELIGION AND SOCIAL BREAKDOWN</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion has beneficial effects on behavior and social relations: on illegitimacy, crime and delinquency, welfare dependency, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, depression, and general self-esteem.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Illegitimacy.</b> One of the most powerful of all factors in preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief. Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births, their effects,<sup>58</sup> and the huge social and economic costs to national and state budgets, this should be of major interest to policymakers.<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has long been known that intensity of religious practice is closely related to adolescent virginity and sexual restraint and control. This general finding, replicated again and again,<sup>59</sup> also holds true specifically for black teenage girls,<sup>60</sup> the group with the highest teen pregnancy rates among all demographic subgroups.<sup>61</sup>  Reviews of the literature demonstrate that, nearly without exception, religious practice sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse.<sup>62</sup>  The reverse is also true: The absence of religious practice accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex. This is confirmed in numerous studies,<sup>63</sup> including a 1991 analysis of the federal government's National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.<sup>64</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The impact of religious practice on teenage sexual behavior also can be seen at the state level: States with higher levels of aggregate religiousness have lower rates of teenage pregnancy.<sup>65</sup><p
>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an important study published in 1987, a group of professors from the Universities of Georgia, Utah, and Wyoming found that the main cause of problematic adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes is not only family dynamics and processes, as previously thought, but the absence of religious behavior and affiliation. They further concluded that healthy family dynamics and practices are themselves caused to a powerful degree by the presence or absence of religious beliefs and practices.<sup>66</sup>  The same results also hold true in international comparisons.<sup>67</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with drugs, alcohol, and crime, the religious behavior of the mother is one of the strongest predictors of the daughter's sexual attitudes.<sup>68</sup>  It also has long been known in the social sciences that daughters of single mothers are more likely to engage in premarital sexual behavior during adolescence.<sup>69</sup>  These mothers are more frequently permissive in their sexual attitudes, and religion for them has less importance than it has for mothers in two-parent families.<sup>70</sup>  These findings also have been replicated.<sup>71</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The religious practices of parents, particularly their unity on religious issues, powerfully influence the behavior of children. Thus, for policymakers interested in reducing teenage (and older) out-of-wedlock births, the lesson is clear: Religious belief and regular worship reduce the likelihood of this form of family breakdown. One faith-based sex education course that included both mothers and daughters, for example, was aimed specifically at reducing the teenage pregnancy rate. The results were notably successful: Out-of-wedlock births among the at-risk population were almost eliminated.<sup>72</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime and Delinquency.</b> A review of the small amount of research done on the relationship between crime and religion shows that states w
ith more religious populations tend to have fewer homicides and fewer suicides.<sup>73</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A four-year longitudinal, stratified, random-sample study of high school students in the Rocky Mountain region, published in 1975, demonstrated that religious involvement significantly decreased drug use, delinquency, and premarital sex, and also increased self-control.<sup>74</sup>  A 1989 study of midwestern high school students replicated these findings.<sup>75</sup>  Similarly, young religious adults in Canada were found in a 1979 study to be less likely to use or sell narcotics, to gamble, or to destroy property.<sup>76</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What is true for youth is also true for adults.<sup>77</sup>  Religious behavior, as opposed to mere attitude or affiliation, is associated with reduced crime.<sup>78</sup>  This has been known in the social science literature for over 20 years.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In research conducted in the late 1980s -- controlling for family, economic, and religious backgrounds -- a research team from the University of Nevada found that black men who eventually ended up in prison and those who did not came respectively from two different groups: those who did not go to church, or stopped going around ten years of age, and those who went regularly.<sup>80</sup>  This failure of faith at the onset of adolescence parallels the pattern found among those who become alcoholics or drug addicts. Clearly, the family's inability to inspire regular religious worship among emerging young adults is a sign of internal weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare Dependency.</b> In his classic study <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Max Weber, the preeminent German sociologist of the first half of the 20th century, demonstrated the connection between religious practice and financial well-being among Protestants. Other work on the same theme shows that this is not confined to Protestants, but that it applies across a longer period of history and across denominational lines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This link between religion and prosperity has important implications for the poor. In 1985, for instance, Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that:
<p><blockquote>
	[Church attendance] is associated with substantial differences in the behavior of [black male youths from poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhoods] and thus in their chances to "escape" from inner city poverty. It affects allocation of time, school-going, work activity and the frequency of socially deviant activity.... It is important to recognize that our analysis has identified an important set of variables that separate successful from unsuccessful young persons in the inner city. There is a significant number of inner city youth, readily identifiable, who succeed in escaping that pathology of inner-city slum life.<sup>81</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ongoing studies by Professor Ranald Jarrell of the Department of Education at Arizona State University West show the power of religious belief and practice in encouraging a spirit of optimism among socially at-risk but advancing children. The subjects are students at the De La Salle Academy, an independent school in the upper west side of Manhattan serving primarily poor inner-city black and Hispanic middle school children who show substantial academic promise. Within this group, the highest concentration of pessimists is found among students with the lowest attendance at church. Those who attend church weekly or more frequently, on the other hand, exhibit the following profiles:
<P><ul>
<li> They are more optimistic about their futures;
<p>
<li> They have better relationships with their parents;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to have serious and realistic goals for their futures;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see the world as a friendly place in which they can achieve, rather than as a hostile world with powerful forces arrayed against them; and
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see themselves as in control of their own futures, whereas those who do not attend church are more likely to see themselves as victims of oppression.<sup>82</sup></ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the best national sample for tracking the development of America's youth from the late 1970s, clearly indicate the difference regular religious practice makes for those who grew up in poverty in the 1970s and 1980s. Among those who attended church weekly in both 1979 and 1982, average family income in 1993 was $37,021; among those who never attended church in 1979 or 1982, however, average family income in 1993 was $24,361 --  a difference of $12,660.<sup>83</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other studies also show that growing up in an intact family correlates significantly and positively with future earnings.<sup>84</sup>  However, the NLSY data show that regular religious practice benefits both those who grow up in intact families <i>and</i> those who grow up in broken families. The other differences remain, but the positive impact of religion on both groups is evident.<sup>85</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Alcohol and Drug Abuse.</b> The relationship between religious practice and the moderate use or avoidance of alcohol is well documented,<sup>86</sup> regardless of whether denominational beliefs prohibit the use of alcohol.<sup>87</sup>  According to general studies, the higher the level of religious involvement, the less likely the use or abuse of alcohol.<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Persons who abuse alcohol rarely have a strong religious commitment.<sup>89</sup>  In their study of the development of alcohol abuse, David Larson and William P. Wilson, professors of psychiatry at Northwestern University School of Medicine, found that nine out of ten alcoholics had lost interest in religion in their teenage years, in sharp contrast to teenagers generally, among whom interest in religion increased by almost 50 percent and declined by only 14 percent.<sup>90</sup>  Robert Coombs and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine found that alcohol abuse is 300 percent higher among those who do not attend church.<sup>91</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Drug and alcohol use is lowest in the most conservative religious denominations and highest in non-religious groups, while liberal church groups have use rates just slightly lower than those for non-religious groups. But for all groups, religious commitment correlates with absence of drug abuse.<sup>92</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, involvement in any religious denomination or group generally decreases the level of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance. Among traditional American religions, Mormons have the highest denominational association between religious doctrine and drug avoidance; they also have the most restrictive proscriptions against drug use. On the other hand, Roman Catholics have the highest alcohol use rate; their religion condemns the abuse of alcohol but does not proscribe its use.<sup>93</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Attendance at church and related religious activities has special significance for drug use among teenagers. In a 1985 study of young girls aged between 9 and 17, less than 10 percent of those who reported attending religious services weekl
y or more often indicated any drug or alcohol use, compared with 38 percent of all those studied.<sup>94</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The parental attitude to religion also is important in dealing with alcohol use. A 1985 study indicated that if the mother and father have deep, competing differences toward religious belief and practice, their children are more likely to use or abuse alcohol than are children whose parents do not differ on matters of religion. Conversely, if their parents' religious beliefs and practices are similar, children are far more likely to abstain from alcohol or to drink with moderation.<sup>95</sup>  Almost three decades before these findings, Orville Walters, then a research fellow at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas, found that alcoholics who came from religious backgrounds tended to have mothers who were highly religious but fathers who were more non-religious.<sup>96</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For over four decades it has been known,<sup>97</sup> and replicated,<sup>98</sup> that alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are much more likely to seek help and treatment. Indeed, Alcoholics Anonymous, the major organization combating alcoholism in America, has known for over half a century that the most effective element in its program is its religious or spiritual component.<sup>99</sup>  David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research notes: "Even after alcoholism has been established, religion is often a powerful force in achieving abstinence. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) uses religion, invoking a Higher Power to help alcoholics recover from addiction."<sup>100</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Paralleling the research on alcohol addiction, an early review of studies of drug addiction found a lack of religious commitment to be a predictor of who abuses drugs.<sup>101</sup>  Many more recent studies replicate this finding.<sup>102</sup>  As in so many other research studies, the best 
measurement of religious commitment is frequency of church attendance: "Overall church attendance was more strongly related to [less] drug use than was intensity of religious feelings."<sup>103</sup>  This is true for both males and females. According to Jerald G. Bachman of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, "Factors we found to be most important in predicting use of marijuana and other drugs during the late 1970's remained most important during the early 1980's. Drug use is below average among those with strong religious commitments."<sup>104</sup>  The more powerfully addictive the drug being considered, the more powerful is the impact of church attendance in preventing its use.<sup>105</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In results almost identical to those for alcoholics, researchers at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a section of the National Institutes of Health and the nation's premier drug abuse research facility, found in their interviews of narcotic addicts that "the addict had neither current religious preference nor a history of attending religious services.... In addition... the addicts' fathers were much less involved in regular or frequent religious practices, than were a parallel group of control fathers.... Religiously, the mother was far more involved than her husband, the difference in regular religious participation between the addict's parents being twice that for the control's parents.... Religiously, the addicts were significantly less involved in reading the Bible, and praying."  They also had far more frequent loss of interest in religion during adolescence.<sup>106</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Louis A. Cancellaro of the Department of Psychiatry at the Veterans Administration in Johnson City, Tennessee, writes that, "Like their fathers, addicts are less religiously involved than their normal peers, and during adolescence, less frequently make decisions either to become more interested in religion or to commit themselves to a re
ligious philosophy to live by."<sup>107</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992: "[The] role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>108</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Suicide.</b> The practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide, both in the United States and abroad.<sup>109</sup>  In fact, the rate of church attendance predicts the suicide rate better than any other factor (including unemployment, traditionally regarded as the most powerful variable). Those who attend church frequently are four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend. Conversely, the national decline in church attendance is associated with a heightened suicide rate; fluctuations in church attendance rates in the 1970s paralleled the suicide rates for different subgroups: whites, blacks, men, and women.<sup>110</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steven Stack, professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University, in a landmark 1985 study on the demography of suicide has found that "Families and religion change together over time.... As the importance of the domestic-religious institutional complex declines, the study finds a rise in the rate of suicide, both for the general population and for the age cohort at the center of the decline, the youth cohort."<sup>111</sup>  In another, earlier study, Stack broke new ground in finding that the effect of unemployment in causing suicide is greatl
y diminished when religious behavior is factored into the equation.<sup>112</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In inter-state comparisons, higher levels of church attendance are associated with lower rates of suicide.<sup>113</sup>  The same holds true in international comparisons.<sup>114</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Depression.</b> Religion appears to reduce the incidence of depression among those with medical problems. For instance, University of Michigan Professor of Sociology David Williams conducted a randomized survey of 720 adults suffering from leg and hip injuries in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1990. Those who attended religious services regularly were less depressed and less distressed by life events than those who did not. This finding held across age, race, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and religious affiliation. Religious affiliation alone did not have these effects, but religious behavior did.<sup>115</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Younger people also tend to experience fewer of the anxieties of growing up if they are religious. For instance, both male and female Texas high-schoolers found that religious beliefs gave meaning to their lives and reduced the incidence of depression among them.<sup>116</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Self-esteem.</b> The absence of self-esteem weakens the personality and puts the person at greater risk for crime, addictions, and other social maladies.<sup>117</sup>  In all religious denominations, psychological weaknesses decrease as religious orthodoxy increases.<sup>118</sup>  Among college students, for instance, the practice of religion was shown in 1969 to have a positive effect on mental health;<sup>119</sup> students involved with campus ministries were much healthier and made much less use of mental health services.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, self-esteem is linked to a person's image of God. Those with high self-esteem think of God primarily as loving, while those 
with low self-esteem think of God primarily as punitive.<sup>120</sup>  This was observed by Carl Jung, one of the most influential pioneers of modern psychology and psychotherapy: "Among all my patients in the second half of my life... there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given their followers and none of them has been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook."<sup>121</sup>  Other evidence exists that people with a religious commitment, whether young or old, who become emotionally or psychologically distressed are much more likely to seek help.<sup>122</sup><p><b>UNDERSTANDING "INTRINSIC" AND "EXTRINSIC" RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent advances in the investigation of religious behavior have led social scientists to distinguish between two distinct categories or orientations: "intrinsic" and "extrinsic."  Intrinsic practice is God-oriented and based on beliefs which transcend the person's own existence. Research shows this form of religious practice to be beneficial. Extrinsic practice is self-oriented and characterized by outward observance, not internalized as a guide to behavior or attitudes. The evidence suggests this form of religious practice is actually more harmful than no religion: Religion directed toward some end other than God, or the transcendent, typically degenerates into a rationalization for the pursuit of other ends such as status, personal security, self justification, or sociability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The difference between these two forms of religious practice have implications for future research and for the interpretation of all research on religious practice. There is a radical difference between what religious people know to be conversion of the spirit or heart and simply conforming external behavior for its own sake, or for benefits derived from religious behavior.<sup>123</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;William James, professor of psychology at Harvard University in the early 1900s and a pioneer in the psychological study of religious behavior, was the first to make the social science distinction between the two forms of religious practice. Gordon Allport, his successor at Harvard in the late 1960s, concluded: "I feel equally sure that mental health is facilitated by an intrinsic, but not an extrinsic, religious orientation."<sup>124</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The two orientations lead to two very different sets of psychological effects. For instance, "intrinsics" have a greater sense of responsibility and greater internal control, are more self-motivated, and do better in their studies. By contrast, "extrinsics" are more likely to be dogmatic, authoritarian, and less responsible, to have less internal control, to be less self-directed, and to do less well in their studies.<sup>125</sup>  Intrinsics are more concerned with moral standards, conscientiousness, discipline, responsibility, and consistency than are extrinsically religious people.<sup>126</sup>  They also are more sensitive to others and more open to their own emotions. By contrast, extrinsics are more self-indulgent, indolent, and likely to lack dependability. For example, the most racially prejudiced people turn out to be those who go to church occasionally<sup>127</sup> and those who are extrinsic in their practice of religion.<sup>128</sup>  These findings have been replicated<sup>129</sup> in a number of different forms.<sup>130</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;T
he contrasting effects show up in college students. Intrinsically religious students tend to have internal locus of control, intrinsic motives, and a higher grade point average.<sup>131</sup>  By contrast, a 1980 study indicated that extrinsically religious students were more dogmatic and authoritarian, less responsible and less motivated, had less internal locus of control, and had a lower grade point average. Intrinsically religious students were found to have a greater concern for moral standards and to be more conscientious, disciplined, responsible, and consistent, while the extrinsic were more self-indulgent, more indolent, and less dependable.<sup>132</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, intrinsics are less anxious about life's ups and downs, while extrinsics are more anxious. Further, the religious beliefs and practices of intrinsics are more integrated; for instance, they are more likely to worship publicly as well as pray privately. By contrast, those who pray privately but do not worship publicly tend to have a higher level of general anxiety -- a characteristic of extrinsics generally.<sup>133</sup>  In an ironic set of findings on anxiety about death, extrinsics fared worst of all: worse than intrinsics and worse than those without religious beliefs.<sup>134</sup>  From a purely social science standpoint, the intrinsic form of religion is thus good and desirable, and the extrinsic form is harmful. Religious teachers, without being utilitarian, would agree.<sup>135</sup>
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a tension between practitioners of social science and religious belief.<sup>136</sup>  Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, write: "From the work of Freud and others, much of the early history of the social sciences is characterized by the expectation that involvement in and reliance upon the religious institution will be associated with people who have a low sense of personal well-being."<sup>137</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is repeated evidence that much the same hostility to religion -- a hostility at variance with the attitude of the vast majority of Americans -- persists among members of America's professional elites.<sup>138</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen L. Carter, professor of law at Yale University, points out that "One sees a trend in our political and legal cultures toward treating religious beliefs as arbitrary and unimportant, a trend supported by rhetoric that implies that there is something wrong with religious devotion. More and more, our culture seems to take the position that believing deeply in the tenets of one's faith represents a kind of mystical irrationality, something that thoughtful, public-spirited American citizens would do better to avoid."<sup>139</sup>  However, the available evidence renders such opposition unreasonable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor David Larson of Duke University Medical School draws attention to similar biases in the mental health professions. Consider <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, the standard reference manual for the classification of mental illnesses, which essentially defines the practice of psychiatrists, clinical psychology, and clinical social work and is central to the practice, research, and financing of these professions. In the third edition, religious examples were used only as illustrations in discussions of mental illness, such as delusions, incoherence, and illogical thinking. The latest edition has corrected this bias.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider also the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, one of the most widely used of all psychological tests. In the MMPI, all the positive religion-connected traits -- self-discipline, altruism, humility, obedience to authority, conventional morality -- are weighted negatively. Thus, to choose the self-description "I am orthodoxly religious" is to detract from one's mental health standing. Conversely, several traits that religious people would regard as diminishing themselves, at least in some situations -- self-assertion, self-expression, and a high opinion of oneself -- are weighted positively.<sup>140</sup>  The latest editions of the MMPI have removed the biased items.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite this general hostility among social science and mental health professionals, the empirical evidence shows religion to be a very powerful and positive part of everyday life. Patrick McNamara, professor of sociology at the University of New Mexico, explains the difference between social scientists and religiously affiliated people generally: "Sociologists tend to see concern for personal challenge -- e.g. to get one's own moral life in order -- as somehow secondary to social challenge or the effort to identify and criticize those socioeconomic structures that inhibit the individual's own group from attaining a fuller human existence."<sup>141</sup>  McNamara continues: "In [the] typical social science analysis, the demands of the inner life are neglected and personal agency and autonomy exercised in the choice to examine one's own life and put it in order according to an internalized ethic of repentance... is not acknowledged."<sup>142</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the attitude of many professionals, Gallup surveys continue to indicate that one-third of the American people regard religious commitment as the most important dimension in their lives. Another third regard religion as a very important, though not the single most dominant, factor in their lives.<sup>143</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Totally secular approaches to many issues -- public policy, psychotherapy, and education -- use an alien framework for this two-thirds of the population. The plain fact is that religion plays a powerful role in the personal and social lives of most Americans. It is a role that should be understood clearly by the professions, by policymakers, and by the media.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From many other areas of social science research -- family dynamics, group dynamics, marital dynamics -- positive reciprocal relationships with others are known to be powerful across a host of areas similar to those reviewed in this paper: stress, ability to relate with others in general, productivity, and learning, to name just a few. The core of the religious commitment is an intention to have a positive relationship with another Being, a transcendent and therefore all-available Being. Viewed in this fashion, the documented effects of religious commitment are not mysterious, but an extension of the effects which we know arise from positive relations between human beings. Thus, the findings on religion fit with the general corpus of what is known about relationships from the existing body of social science research.
<p>

<b>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The evidence indicates strongly that it is a good social policy to foster the widespread practice of religion. It is bad social policy to block it. The widespread practice of religious beliefs is one of America's greatest national resources. It strengthens individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol addiction, crime, and delinquency. No other dimension of the nation's life, other than the health of the family (which the data show also is tied powerfully to religious practice) should be of more concern to those who guide the future course of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original intent of the Founding Fathers was to bar the establishment by the federal government of a state-approved religion, not to bar religion from the operations of the state. Thomas Jefferson made this distinction very clear in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (January 16, 1786):
<p><blockquote>	
We, the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief: but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.<sup>144</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;George Washington summed up the importance of religion to the new nation with particular eloquence in his farewell address:
<p><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness -- these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice?  And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;'Tis substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?<sup>145</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A policy can be friendly to the general practice of religion, and to the many different faiths in a pluralistic society, without in any way implying the establishment of a particular religion. Federal policies encourage many other institutions: the marketplace, education, medicine, science, and the arts. Even religion itself is explicitly encouraged by the tax treatment of contributions to religious institutions. It makes no sense, therefore, not to encourage the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation. Congress and the President can help to accomplish this by acting decisively in at least six specific areas:
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the Senate in particular, should lead a new national debate on the renewed role of religion in American life. With his recent guidance to school administrators on prayer in school, President Clinton has opened the national discussion. The Senate once was the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It is time for it to take up that role again on the relationship between the practice of religion and the life of the nation, on the health of America's families and the content of its culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America needs a major national debate on the true role of religion in a free and pluralistic society. For many decades, the once-prominent place of religion in society has been eroded. Religious leaders, who should be in the forefront of moral and spiritual renewal, have been cowed into a strange timidity. Americans of religious belief should not be bullied into believing that in all things related to the public good, religion is to remain off limits. The constitutional freedom of religion does not mean the constitutional barring of religion from the public square.
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that data on religious practice are important to the nation, to policymakers, and to the research needed to inform the public debate. The gathering of data that touch on religious practice often is blocked in research on social issues funded by the federal government.<sup>146</sup>  Because government funds a huge proportion of the nation's funded social research, this has a chilling effect. But the relationship between religious practice and the social issues under investigation by government, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime and delinquency, addiction, economic dependency, medical and psychiatric problems, and learning capacity, should be explored. A sense-of-the-Congress resolution would remove the excuse that it is not permissible for federally funded research to touch on this aspect of life.
<p>
<li> Congress should mandate a census question on religious practice. The census for the year 2000 ought to ask about frequency of attendance at church or synagogue. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious worship in the United States. Also, many of the annual sample surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census would be significantly better informed if similar information were gathered in those surveys.
<p>
<li> Congress should commission research on the relationship between regular church attendance and social issues. This research should focus on the social issues which continue to increase the burden borne by the American taxpayer, including crime, drug use, health of the elderly, out-of-wedlock births, and poverty.
<p>
<li> Congress should fund federal experiments with school choice that include choice of religiously affiliated schools. To deny financial support to parents who cannot afford to send their children to religiously oriented schools is to deny such education to those children who may need it most and confine it to those rich enough to afford it. The United States of America and the now-defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the only major modern states to deny funding to faith-based schools.
<p>
<li> The President should appoint, and the Senate should confirm, judges who are sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Religion should not be crowded out of every activity in which government is involved. And yet, this is precisely what has been happening for the last 30 years as government has encroached more and more on virtually every area of American life: family, school, and marketplace. This does not make sense for any society -- and it has weakened ours.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Columnist William Raspberry has put his finger on the problem. In his historic majority opinion in the 1947 <i>Everson v. Board of Education</i> case (330 U.S. 1), notes Raspberry, Justice Hugo Black wrote that government is forbidden to "pass laws which aid any religion, aid all religion, or prefer one religion over another." 
<p><blockquote>
	The first and third elements in the Black proscription seem to me to jibe with the "establishment" clause of the Constitution. The middle one suggests that the only proper position of government is hostility to religion -- which seems to be the prevailing view among civil libertarians and a majority of the Supreme Court.<sup>147</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This calls to mind the words of the late William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal of Supreme Court Justices, who wrote in the 1950s:
<p><blockquote>
	We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. [When] the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, [it] respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.<sup>148</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate should ask all future candidates for federal court appointments to clarify their opinions regarding both the role of religion in the life of the body politic and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this problem is far too important to be left to government. America's religious leaders and individual citizens also must act:
<p><ul>
<li> They must draw attention to the enormous and beneficial effects on society of the true practice of religion. As leaders of the nation's religious communities, they should assert their right to be regarded as critical in the nurturing of stable marriages and healthy families. Religion performs the foundational work that ensures the success of secular society's other four basic institutions: family, school, marketplace, and government.
<p>
<li> They must emphasize the need for religious formation. While the social works of mercy carried out by religious congregations will be needed more and more to repair the damage from the breakdown of the family, only a religious institution can give a religious orientation to those who are searching for answers to the mysteries of human life: love and suffering in birth, marriage, family life, and death. Religious beliefs help the individual acquire central organizing principles for life and an understanding of God. Aided by this sense and these principles, an individual can avoid the unnecessary suffering that stems from bad choices and attain the benefits that flow from good choices followed steadily through life. Today, schools are forbidden to participate in this critical work. Only religious leaders can provide this all-important service to society.
<p>
<li> They must take special care of the religious formation of children at risk of losing their faith in God, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence. The empirical research indicates that there is a critical stage in the development of young adults, from around ten years of age through later adolescence, during which they decide whether they will engage in the religious dialogue of searching for ultimate truths and meaning. The young adolescent who turns away from religion at this stage may well lose his anchoring in the community and is at greater risk for a host of problems that can subvert his personal happiness for a lifetime. Increased attention to this aspect of religious ministry will yield great benefits to the nation. Of particular concern to public policy leaders are the problems that plague America's inner cities: out-of-wedlock births, addiction, and crime. These neighborhoods need the benefits of religious belief and practice. They are "mission" territories that beckon loudly.
<p>
<li> They must use the ability of inner-city churches, especially black churches, to help low-income African-Americans escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty. Many religious leaders, with the best of intentions, have concentrated on the material aspects of their work, forgetting that the most powerful help they can give is in the spiritual dimension, and that this has a significant effect on material well-being. Regular church attendance will do more to help a child get out of poverty than anything else the religious leader can provide. And it will transform the community if most people can be persuaded to become church members.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The available evidence clearly demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most significant social problems, some of which, including out-of-wedlock births, have reached catastrophic proportions. Furthermore, it is available to all, and at no cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America is at a crossroads. Political leaders as diverse as President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich all have articulated popular concerns and fears about the level of the breakdown of American society.<sup>149</sup>  Almost simultaneously, Americans are becoming aware of the fundamental contribution that married family life and regular religious practice can make to preserving that society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the sake of the nation's future health, it is time to redirect public policy so that these two vast resources, instead of being weakened further, can be rejuvenated and encouraged. Many of the goals of social policy and social work can be attained, indirectly and powerfully, through the practice of religion. None of this invalidates education or social work, which operate at a different level of the human condition. However, as demands for social work outstrip (and give every indication of far outstripping) social work resources, it is good to know that the practice of religion is a powerful ally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion is good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency, drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Founding Fathers, in their passionate love of freedom, promoted the freedom of all Americans to practice their religious beliefs, but Congress and the courts have crowded religion out of the public square. It is time to bring it back. Religious practice can and should be factored into the planning and debate on the nation's urgent social problems. Americans cannot build their future without drawing on the strengths that come to them from the practice of their religious beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The widespread practice of religious beliefs can only benefit the nation, and the task of reintegrating religious practice into American life while protecting and respecting the rights of non-practice -- rights that, despite persistent demagoguery on the subject, remain totally unthreatened -- is one of the nation's most important tasks. Academics of good will can do much in this area, and history will look kindly on those who help America achieve this wonderful balance.

<li>The benefit of the intrinsic practice of religion certainly be obvious to most ordinary Americans. But in research results, many of the deleterious effects of the extrinsic practice of religion wipe out many of the benefits of intrinsic practice when adherents of both are mixed together in the same piece of research. Most religious research to date does not measure or differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic practice of religion. Despite this shortcoming, the studies cited up to now do not distinguish between these types of religious practice, yet show a very positive outcome. This poses a number of important research issues, chief among them whether this is because there are only a few extrinsics among those who go to church most frequently. For researchers and those who commission research, there is an obvious need to measure whether the person's practice of religion, when it is present, is more intrinsic or extrinsic. Fortunately, a simple validated scale has been developed to measure the person's religious motivation. See Dean R. Hoge, "A Validated Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale," <i>Journal for Scientific Study of Religion</i>, Vol. 11 (1972), pp. 369-376.
<li>    In the view of this author, that tension arises from the effort of the social sciences to contain religion within the canons of the social sciences. However the canons of religion transcend these canons, and therefore cannot be reduced to the dimensions of any of the social sciences, though every social science can describe some facets of religious behavior.

<li>The Gallup survey (Religion in America 1985) continues to indicate that religious commitment is avowed by one-third of Americans as the most important dimension in their lives and that, for another third, religion is considered to be very important (but not the single most dominant) factor. <i>Religion in America: The Gallup Report, Report No. 236, 1985</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Religion Research Center, 1985) quoted in Alan E.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The vast expanses of the former Soviet Union harbor oil and gas riches which will be crucial in fueling the global economy in the next century. The huge oil reserves, estimated at over 25 billion barrels, under the Caspian Sea and in the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are similar to those in Kuwait and larger than those in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Control over these energy resources and export routes out of the Eurasian hinterland is quickly becoming one of the central issues in post-Cold War politics. Like the "Great Game" of the early 20th century, in which the geopolitical interests of the British Empire and Russia clashed over the Caucasus region and Central Asia, today's struggle between Russia and the West may turn on who controls the oil reserves in Eurasia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The world now faces a choice between the cooperative exploitation by the East and West of natural resources or a wasteful struggle that could cost a fortune in blood and treasure. Regional conflicts in the Caucasus and Central Asia threaten to deny Western access to the vital oil and gas reserves the world will need in the 21st century. The wars in Chechnya, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in Georgia were started or exacerbated by the Russian military, and the outcome of these wars may determine who controls future pipeline routes. Moscow hopes that Russia will. Powerful interests in Moscow are attempting to ensure that the only route for exporting the energy resources of Eurasia will pass through Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs to ensure free and fair access for all interested parties to the oil fields of the Caucasus and Central Asia. These resources are crucial to ensuring prosperity in the first half of the 21st century and beyond. Access to Eurasian energy reserves could reduce the West's dependence on Middle East oil and ensure lower oil and gas prices for decades to come. Moreover, oil revenues can boost the independence and prosperity of such Newly Independent States (NIS) as Azerbaijan and Georgia. For example, through production royalties, Azerbaijan could generate over $2 billion a year in revenue from its oil fields, while Georgia could get over $500 million annually from transit fees. With these new-found oil riches, non-Russian republics in the region would depend less on Russia, both economically and militarily. Independent and self-sufficient former Soviet states, bolstered by their oil revenues, would deny Russia the option of establishing a <i>de facto</i> sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two pipeline routes in Central Asia are under consideration. The first would allow oil to flow from the Azerbaijani Caspian Sea shelf to the Black Sea coast. The second would transport oil from the giant Tengiz oil field, developed by the U.S.-based Chevron corporation in Kazakhstan, in a westerly direction toward Europe and the Mediterranean. Western governments and oil companies participating in the Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani pipeline projects<sup>1</sup> face a choice: Will a neo-imperialist Russia (aided and abetted by Iran) dominate the development of Eurasian oil and its exports, or will Russia be an equal and fair player in the region with Turkey, the three Caucasian states (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), and possibly Iran?  The U.S. should respect the right of Russian companies to bid for the exploration and transport of oil and gas in the region. However, the West has a paramount interest in assuring that the Caucasian and Central Asian states maintain their independence and remain open to the West. Otherwise, Moscow will capture almost monopolistic control over this vital energy resource, thus increasing Western dependence upon Russian-dominated oil reserves and export routes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves in Central Asia, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the Newly Independent States in Central Asia.</b> The U.S. should try to prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). To achieve that end, it should endeavor to ensure that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other Newly Independent States receive a fair portion of the oil revenues from the region. Moreover, the U.S. should strengthen bilateral and multilateral political and military cooperation with these states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil and gas companies should be allowed to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equitable basis with other countries in the region. That is their right. Forming partnerships with Western oil companies could turn the Russian business sector into an ally of the West. However, domination by military means should be rejected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> Thus far, the West has focused mainly on settling the crisis in Bosnia, relegating the Caucasus region to the back burner. Now that a Bosnian settlement has been reached, the U.S. should endeavor to settle the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The OSCE would be a useful vehicle for pursuing these goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian geostrategic ambitions and Iranian-style religious militancy pose long-term threats to the Muslim societies of the region. These threats can be countered by helping to create free market economies, respect for the rule of law, and a civil society that respects democracy and political pluralism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> Absent a new oil pipeline, more potentially hazardous oil shipments will pass through the already clogged Bosphorus Straits. Oil tanker fires like the one in 1994 can block international shipping through the Boshporus for days, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage and threatening the lives and health of local citizens. The U.S. should support a pipeline route through the territory of Georgia and Turkey that will bring oil from Eurasia to a Mediterranean port such as Ceyhan in Turkey.
</ul><p>

<b>WARS ENDANGERING OIL TRANSIT ROUTES IN THE CAUCASUS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The War in Chechnya.</b> One of the main goals of the Russian attack on Chechnya in December of 1994 was to ensure control of the oil pipeline which runs from Baku, via Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the Russian city of Tikhoretsk. The pipeline ends at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, designed by Russia to be the terminal for the proposed Kazakh and Azerbaijani pipelines.<sup>2</sup> In addition, Grozny boasts a large refinery with a processing capacity of 12 million tons per year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During its brief self-proclaimed independence under President Jokhar Dudayev from 1991 to 1994, Chechnya illegally exported crude oil and refined products worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. The rebel government worked closely with corrupt politicians in Moscow to obtain export licenses. Partly to cut off this activity, Russia launched a massive but covert military action in the fall of 1994 to support opponents of Dudayev. In 1994, Dudayev turned to radical Islamic elements in the Middle East and Central Asia for support. This exacerbated the religious aspect of the conflict between the Muslim Chechens and Christian Orthodox Russians. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overt military action began on December 12, 1994, when the Russian army marched on Grozny, destroying Chechnya's capital city by brutal aerial, tank, and artillery bombardment. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, and more than 300,000 have become refugees. Hostilities continue, with hostage-taking crises erupting in July 1995 and January 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Drama in Georgia.</b> Another conflict affecting potential oil routes is occuring in the Caucasus republic of Georgia. Russia wants to prevent oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan from going the "Western" route through Georgia to Turkey. Moscow's support of civil strife in Georgia is directly connected to its goal of perpetuating conflict in the Caucasus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1991 through the end of 1993, Georgia was in the midst of a bloody civil war which pitted the supporters of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia against each other. Political violence became chronic. Eventually, the defeated Gamsakhurdia either committed suicide or was murdered under mysterious circumstances in 1993. But even after his victory over Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze faced challenges from warlords and militias. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In exchange for crucial Russian support, Shevardnadze finally was forced to join the CIS in October 1993, a move he had bitterly opposed. When he attempted to read a press release announcing this step, Russian diplomats took it out of his hands and gave him a Moscow-authored text to read. Such was the degree of independence enjoyed by Shevardnadze at the hands of his Russian patrons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1995, Moscow brought pressure on Shevardnadze not to build a pipeline for Azeri oil through Georgian territory. The Georgians wanted to bring oil to the Georgian port of Supsa (between Poti and Tbilisi), from which it then would be exported by tanker to Turkey. However, the Russians demurred. Soon after Shevardnadze refused to cancel the pipeline plan, he was injured in an assassination attempt when a car bomb exploded next to his vehicle on August 29, 1995. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shevardnadze has insisted repeatedly that Russia was behind this attempt on his life. The suspected culprit -- Shevardnadze's security chief, Igor Georgadze -- has escaped to Russia and continues to threaten Shevardnadze's life.<sup>3</sup>  Shevardnadze demanded that the Russians extradite the suspect, and the Russian Prosecutor General's Office issued an order for his arrest. However, the Russian Interior Minister refused the extradition, and Georgadze is still at large. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Fighting in Abkhazia.</b> Another dangerous conflict is smoldering in Abkhazia, a breakaway region in Georgia. The bitter war in Abkhazia, which began in 1992, has claimed over 35,000 lives. It was precipitated by the Russian military backing the Abkhaz separatist minority against the Georgian government in Tbilisi.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One purpose of the Russian intervention was to weaken Georgia and curb Turkish and Western influence in the region. But more important was the Russian goal of controlling access to oil. By acting as it did, Russia gained <i>de facto</i> control over the long Black Sea coastline in Abkhazia. Moscow also was protecting the Russian Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse and moving closer to the Georgian oil exporting ports in Poti, Supsa, and Batumi. In August 1995, Georgia's beleaguered President Shevardnadze agreed to place four Russian military bases on Georgian soil, thus assuring Russia's control of the oil exporting routes via the Black Sea coast. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Russia became entangled in Chechnya in 1994-1995, and word of Chechen commando training camps operating from Abkhazia spread, Moscow began to show less support for the Abkhaz rebels, who are allies of the Chechens. But Russia also has refused either to close the border with Abkhazia or to deny the separatist government in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, financial and military support. Shevardnadze had hoped that this would be a Russian <i>quid pro quo</i> for his agreement to permit Russian military bases on Georgian territory.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict.</b> Yet another bloody war affecting potential oil pipeline routes is occurring in Nagorno-Karabakh, a small, largely Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The enclave of Karabakh sits astride a potential oil route from the Caspian Sea to Turkey. Populated mainly by Armenians, Karabakh was put under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction in 1921 after Stalin negotiated a treaty in the Transcaucasus between communist Russia and Turkey. Strife between the mainly Christian Armenians and Shi'a Muslim Azerbaijanis broke out in 1988. Full-scale war erupted in 1992, with the Armenians demanding complete independence for Karabakh or its absorption into Armenia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cease-fire negotiated in May 1994 has been holding. The Armenians in Karabakh have proclaimed an independent republic, which Azerbaijan refuses to recognize. Thus far, Azerbaijan has suffered political and military defeat at the hands of the Armenians, losing one-fifth of its territory since the collapse of the Soviet Union. One million people, mostly Azerbaijanis, have become refugees as a result of the war. The Azeri capital of Baku has seen the government change three times since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has supported the Armenians and the Azeris intermittently. In 1992, Moscow proposed that Russia become a guarantor of peace in the region, promising to send in 3,000 peacekeepers, but was rebuffed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security group in Europe.<sup>4</sup>.  The OSCE "Minsk group," which consists of Russia, the U.S., Turkey, France, Sweden, and Italy, has been charged with finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict but thus far has met with only limited success. Under Western pressure, Moscow has agreed to a multilateral OSCE peacekeeping force for Karabakh. However, this force has yet to materialize, and there is still no peace agreement between the warring parties. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Azerbaijan: Key Oil Region.</b> The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is important because of the immense oil reserves controlled by Azerbaijan. Since the late 19th century, the oil in Azerbaijan has played a key role in the economies of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union, as well as in the global energy market. International business interests, such as the Nobel and Rothschild families, and even conquerors like Adolf Hitler have all vied at different times for control of Azerbaijan's oil. Even after 100 years of Russian imperial and Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan still has some of the largest reserves in the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At stake today is a $6 billion, 4 billion barrel Caspian Sea shelf petroleum deal between Azerbaijan and a consortium of large international oil companies.<sup>5</sup>  Put simply, Russia opposes the deal. The Russian oil company Lukoil is part of this international consortium, but other Russian oil interests felt excluded, and the Russian foreign and defense ministries have come out squarely against the arrangement. In addition to demanding that at least 25 percent of the deal go to Russian firms (Lukoil gets only 10 percent), Moscow wants full control of the oil exports. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Caspian Sea oil deal was facilitated first by President Abulfaz Elchibei, who was overthrown in June 1993 by former Azerbaijani KGB Chief and Brezhnev Politburo member General Heydar Aliev.<sup>6</sup>  While Elchibei was considered pro-Turkish, Aliev had a reputation for being pro-Russian. It was Aliev who signed the oil agreement in September 1994. On October 9, 1995, the Azerbaijani International Oil Consortium (AIOC) announced that "early" oil (approximately 80,000 barrels a month) would be split between two pipelines. The northern line would go to the Russian port of Novorossiysk (via unstable Chechnya) and the western line to the Georgian port of Supsa in two separate pipelines. This was a compromise decision supported by the Clinton Administration and aimed at placating Moscow, but it failed to do so. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite his attempts to accommodate Russia, Moscow apparently considers Aliev too independent. Therefore, the Kremlin is backing Suret Husseinov, a warlord who reportedly has good connections with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.<sup>7</sup>  Between 1993 and 1995, four unsuccessful coups were attempted against Aliev, reportedly with Moscow's support. Russia also is playing the ethnic separatism card against Aliev, bolstering the national movement of the Lezgin minority in the north of Azerbaijan and the movement of the Talysh minority in the south. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Aliev has proved himself to be a tough survivor. Although Azerbaijan has joined the CIS, he has managed to resist the pressure to deploy Russian military bases or troops on Azerbaijani soil. However, Moscow probably can outwait Aliev, in the meantime fostering instability in Azerbaijan. Russia will attempt to block any large-scale production or exports of oil from Azerbaijan until such time as a more compliant man can be put in charge.
<p>

<b>OIL POLITICS AND RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM IN THE "NEAR ABROAD"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The main threat to the equitable development of Eurasian oil is the Russian attempt to dominate the region in a <i>de facto</i> alliance with the radical Islamic regime in Tehran.<sup>8</sup>  Russia benefits from instability in the Caucasus, where wars and conflicts undermine independence and economic development while hindering the export of oil from the region's states.<sup>9</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moscow has gone beyond words to establish its power in the Caucasus. The Russians are setting up military bases in the region in order to gain exclusive control over all future pipelines. Georgia now has four Russian bases and Armenia has three, while Azerbaijan is still holding out under severe pressure from Moscow. In addition, members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are required to police their borders jointly with Russian border guards, and thus are denied effective control over their own territory. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Attempts to Reintegrate the South.</b> The struggle to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia started in early 1992. While not a full-scale war, this struggle employs a broad spectrum of military, covert, diplomatic, and economic measures. The southern tier of the former Soviet Union is a zone of feverish Russian activity aimed at tightening Moscow's grip in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. The entire southern rim of Russia is a turbulent frontier, a highly unstable environment in which metropolitan civilian and military elites, local players, and mid-level officers and bureaucrats drive the process of reintegration.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin called for a re-examination of Russia's borders to the detriment of her neighbors, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For example, upon his return from a state visit to the U.S. in September 1994, Yeltsin reiterated Russia's "right" to conduct "peacemaking" in the "near abroad," to protect Russian speakers and to exercise freedom of action in its sphere of influence.<sup>11</sup>  These statements were echoed on numerous occasions by former Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other key policymakers in Moscow. In his September 1995 Decree "On Approval of the Strategic Policy of the Russian Federation Toward CIS Member States,"<sup>12</sup> Yeltsin outlined plans to create a CIS military and economic union. Some observers have termed this design an informal empire "on the cheap," a "sustainable empire" which is less centralized than the old Soviet Union.<sup>13</sup>  The aim of such an arrangement would be to ensure Russia's control of the oil and gas reserves in Eurasia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Competing political interests inside Russia's neighbors often prompt local elites to challenge the faction in power and to seek Moscow's support. For example, Russian oil chieftains in Kazakhstan and military commanders who are still in place in Moldova and Georgia naturally maintain close links with Moscow. Where it lacks troops on the ground, Moscow supports the most pro-Russian faction in the conflict, such as Trans-Dniestrian ethnic Russians in Moldova, the separatist Abkhazs in Georgia, warlords and former communist leaders in Azerbaijan, and pro-communist clans in Tajikistan. This is a classic scenario for imperial expansion. What is common to these conflicts is that without Russian support, the pro-Moscow factions (regardless of their ethnicity) could not have dominated their respective regions, and would be forced to seek negotiated and peaceful solutions. In each case, appeals by the legitimate governments of the Newly Independent States to restore their territorial integrity were ignored by Moscow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russian political elites have not overcome the imperialist ideology that inspired both pre-1917 and Soviet expansionism. For today's Moscow bureaucrats and generals, as for their predecessors in St. Petersburg prior to 1917, the turbulent southern periphery is a potential source of political fortunes, promotions, and careers. For Russian politicians in search of a grand cause, re-establishing the empire and paying for it with Eurasian oil revenues is a winning proposition, especially in the murky environment in the aftermath of imperial collapse. 
<p>

<b>KEY RUSSIAN PLAYERS IN THE GREAT OIL GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and security services are by far the most resolute driving force behind the restoration of a Russian-dominated CIS. They are playing a key role in ensuring Moscow's control over the pipeline routes. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall terminated, at least temporarily, confrontation with the West, leaving the Red Army's General Staff, the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and the former KGB desperately seeking new missions. The biggest of these new missions is to establish control over Caucasus and Central Asian oil, establishing a Russian sphere of influence in the process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control. Russian military activities over the last four years indicate an attempt to consolidate strategic control of oil sources and export routes in Eurasia. For example, the war in Chechnya blocked an important pipeline from Azerbaijan through Grozny, and the victory of the Abkhaz separatists, supported by the Russian military, further secured the Russian oil terminals in the ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse. In order to obtain an oil route in the region, Western exporters may be pressured to reach accomodations with the Russian generals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian intelligence services are also involved. The successor to the KGB's First Chief Directorate, now known as the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVRR) and led until January 1996 by KGB general and now Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov, published an important document in 1994 on Russia's policies in the "near abroad," called "Russia-CIS: Does the Western Position Require Correction?"<sup>14</sup>  General Primakov's staff argued that any attempt to integrate the CIS states into the global economy without Moscow's cooperation is doomed to fail. Russia already has effectively stopped Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani joint oil exporting ventures in their tracks. 

<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The states of the CIS's southern tier were coerced by Russia even before they declared their independence from the USSR. Moscow incited local pro-Russian factions, such as Abkhazians in Georgia, Armenians in Karabakh, and hard-line communist pro-Russian clans in Tajikistan, to challenge the independence and territorial integrity of these nascent states. The Russian military provided advisers, hardware, training, planning, and coordination for the military activities in these areas. As a result, hundreds of thousands have been left dead, wounded, or homeless. In addition, these violent conflicts blocked the transit routes to the West for Caspian and Central Asian oil. 
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN THE GREAT GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<sup>15</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Eurasian oil resources are pivotal to economic development in the early 21st century. The supply of Middle Eastern oil would become precarious if Saudi Arabia became unstable, or if Iran or Iraq provoked another military conflict in the area. Eurasian oil is also key to the economic development of the southern NIS. Only with oil revenues can these countries sever their dependence on Moscow and develop modern market economies and free societies. Moreover, if these vast oil reserves were tapped and developed, tens of thousands of U.S. and Western jobs would be created. The U.S. should ensure free access to these reserves for the benefit of both Western and local economies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to protect U.S. and Western interests in Eurasia and ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves of the region, the United States should:
<p><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the New Independent States in the region.</b> In cooperation with Britain, Germany, and France, the U.S. should prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern CIS. The West should not grant Moscow <i>carte blanche</i> in the "near abroad" in exchange for cooperation in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. should lead other Western countries in implementing programs that support independent statehood, free-market development, and the rule of law in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Central Asian states. Training for the civil and security services of these countries should be stepped up, and economic reforms, including privatization of industries and agriculture, should be continued. Moreover, sanctions on technical and humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan, imposed at the height of the Karabakh conflict, should be lifted to increase Washington's leverage in settling the conflict there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil companies should be assured of equitable access to the development of oil resources and pipeline projects. The strategic goal of the West should be the creation of a level playing field that allows Russian and Western corporations to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equal footing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If cooperation from Russia is not forthcoming, the U.S. should oppose attempts by the Russian security establishment to impose a single direction for the pipelines -- i.e., north, via Russian territory. This kind of geopolitical <i>diktat</i> would give Moscow an unacceptable level of control over the flow of oil to Western markets and would make the West vulnerable to Russia's political whims. The U.S. government should demand that Russia stop fostering conflicts in the area. At the same time, Washington should promise that the interests of Russian companies operating in the region will be taken into account in current and future oil consortia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> The OSCE has been charged by its members with settling the conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, and Karabakh. This authority is recognized by Russia. So far, the OSCE has not been successful. To become more so, the OSCE should step up efforts to bring together the leaders of the Newly Independent States and separatist ethnic groups so they can find acceptable political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The OSCE should assign senior politicians to mediate in order to prevent new conflicts, particularly between the Azerbaijanis and the Lezgin and Talysh minorities in Azerbaijan, or between the Georgians and the Adzhar minority. An OSCE-sponsored conference to promote minority rights in the Southern CIS would be in order. The U.S. and its allies should support the OSCE's efforts and initiate a bilateral dialog with leaders of the ethnic groups to assist them in finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> in their countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian ambitions and Islamic radicalism threaten the pro-Western orientation of regimes in the region. Economic development, support for basic human rights, and cultural affinity with the West are important to prevent a radicalization of Islamic politics in the region. An important ally in this regard is Turkey. The U.S. should support Turkey's bid for membership in the European Union. Turkish efforts have been sidetracked by the Europeans because of Ankara's crackdown on the Kurds last year. Washington should urge the Europeans to refrain from rejecting Turkish Westernizers and pushing the Turks into the hands of militant Islamists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> As an important U.S. ally and founding NATO member, Turkey has raised serious concerns regarding tanker exports of Eurasian oil through the narrow and twisting Bosphorus Straits. Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, would be endangered by the nonstop tanker traffic the exports of vast new quantities of Eurasian oil would require. 
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Straits today are one of the busiest maritime passages in the world. The shipping of more oil from Eurasia would clog the already crowded waterway. Recent accidents involving burning tankers prove that Turkish concerns are justified. Free access to shipping via the Straits was envisaged in the 19th century, when the volume of traffic was twenty times lower than today. Therefore, the safest (and cheapest) route for Eurasian oil, which is preferred by Western oil companies, is a large pipeline from the Caucasus via Turkey to the Eastern Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The struggle for Eurasian oil is a multifaceted game. It involves security, geopolitical, and economic interests not only Russian and Eurasian, but American and Western as well. In Russia, nothing less than democracy is at stake. If Russia pursues a cooperative engagement with the West in the Caucasus, it will strengthen its economic and political integration with the West. However, if it chooses to challenge the West and reverts to its old imperial ways, Moscow likely will become increasingly hostile toward the West in other areas as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The oil and gas reserves of the Caucasus and Central Asia are vital to Western geostrategic and economic interests in the 21st century. They have the potential to secure prosperity and economic growth bolstered by low oil prices. In addition, these resources are key to ensuring revenues and, with them, the sovereignty of the Newly Independent States. In addition, the wealth brought by oil can fuel both economic and democratic development in the Caucasus and Central Asia, fostering the independence and freedom of countries which serve in turn as an obstacle to potential Russian imperial expansion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and political establishment is attempting to impose a sphere of influence on the CIS and secure control of the region's oil. If a hardliner wins the Russian presidential elections in June 1996, these efforts may redouble. A major campaign to assert influence in the Russian "near abroad" would be a setback for U.S. interests. In addition, control of the Caucasus and Central Asia would allow Russia geographical proximity to, and closer cooperation with, the anti-Western regimes in Tehran and Baghdad. Together, an anti-Western Russia, Iran, and Iraq, if they desired, could pursue a common interest in driving up the price of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To counter this prospect, the U.S. and the West need to convince the Russians to approach the oil question in Eurasia as an economic, not geopolitical, opportunity. The U.S. should reassure Russia that its companies will be included in future economic ventures in the region. Russian companies alone do not have the technological and financial resources to develop the hydrocarbon reserves of Eurasia. They will need Western oil companies to do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To become richer, Russia needs American and Western help. To foster peace and stability in Eurasia, America needs Russian help. A <i>modus vivendi</i> can be reached only if Russia accepts that the principles of free markets, democracy, and state sovereignty take precedence over the outdated geopolitical practices of the past century.

<h2>Good Samaritan Awards</h2> The Acton Institute for the Study
of Religion and Liberty is a nonprofit educational institute that
explores the moral dimensions of a free society. Last year the
institute established its Good Samaritan Awards to honor and encourage
the moral and practical advantages of private charity. From nearly
700 applicants, Acton recently honored 10 leading models of effective
private charity, both secular and religiously based. Each winner
received a $1,000 grant; three finalists will soon be chosen by
a national panel of judges and awarded cash grants of $10,000

<B>The Value of Victorian Virtues</B>
<br><I>The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values</I> by
Gertrude Himmelfarb (Knopf)<br>
 Maybe it's not so bad being a Victorian
moralist after all. True, writes Himmelfarb, the Victorians could
be stuffy, self-absorbed moralists. But it is equally true that
they acted &quot;on behalf of the poor, whom they sought not only
to assist materially but also to elevate morally, spiritually,
culturally, intellectually.&quot; The distinction provides a crucial
lesson for contemporary welfare reformers. The Victorians are
moralists in the sense that they believed in virtues-qualities
of character and morality that were desirable for every citizen
in a civilized society. Late-20th-century America no longer believes
in virtues, Himmelfarb writes, but has substituted for them the
notion of values-preferences that are relative and subjective.
One result is a welfare system that delivers services to the poor
but dares not address their deeper moral or spiritual needs. &quot;We
have so completely rejected any kind of moral principle,&quot;
Himmelfarb writes, &quot;that we have deliberately, systematically
divorced poor relief from moral sanctions and incentives.&quot;
The discrepancy between Victorian virtues and modern values has
produced vastly different outcomes. As it entered the 19th century,
England was caught in the teeth of industrialism, capitalism,
secularism-features of modernity responsible for the social upheaval
America is now experiencing. But the Victorian ethos was grounded
in the Christian traditions of Evangelicalism and Methodism, along
with their secular counterpart, Utilitarianism. The result? &quot;At
the end of the 19th century,&quot; she writes, &quot;England was
a more civil, more pacific, more humane society than it had been
at the beginning.&quot; Two social indicators: Between 1845 and
1900, illegitimate births in England fell from 7 percent of all
births in 1845 to less than 4 percent by 1900, while the rate
of serious crime declined by almost 50 percent.<P>
<B>The Economics
of Trust</B><br><I>Trust: The Social Virtues &amp; The Creation of Prosperity</I> by Francis Fukuyama (The Free Press)<br>
 Fukuyama argues
that America's greatness comes from a spirit of individual liberty
balanced by &quot;a rich network of voluntary associations and
community structures to which individuals have subordinated their
narrow interests.&quot; America in the past was as group-oriented
as Japan and Germany, Fukuyama writes, and this trait accounts
for the dominance of these countries in the international marketplace.
Only societies with a high degree of social trust can create the
flexible, large-scale business organizations needed for successful
competition in the global economy. The crucial difference between
America and the two other nations is that social cooperation here
was not enforced through emperors or kaisers. In America, strong
community emerged in the absence of a strong state. America's
economic future is now endangered by the rapid depletion of its
social capital. Fukuyama argues that the dominance of rights-based
liberalism, the rise of violent crime and civil litigation, the
collapse of the family, the decline of neighborhoods, churches,
unions, and charities, and the breakdown of shared values are
destroying Americans' ability to cooperate with each other. It
is no accident, he suggests, that those ethnic groups with the
highest degree of internal trust are economically the most successful.
He cites the importance of Asian-American rotating credit associations
that count on family members and business associates to honor
their debts. The author explores &quot;the paradox of family values&quot;:
While families in America are &quot;too weak to perform their
basic task of socialization,&quot; in some societies families
&quot;are too strong to permit the formation of modern economic
organizations.&quot; In Chinese, Italian, and French societies,
Fukuyama suggests, family members trust each other completely.
But intense distrust of outsiders precludes civic or political
life outside the family, and nearly all economic organizations
are family-based. Most giant corporations are government-run,
because unrelated people don't trust each other enough to work
together.<P>
<B>Building Blocks</B><br>
<I>Building a Community of Citizens:
Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> Don E. Eberly, ed. (University
Press of America)<br>
 The 23 essays that make up <I>Building a Community
of Citizens: Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> explore the
condition of America's civic life and endeavor to identify the
ideas and policies required for social renewal as America moves
into the next century. The work seeks to define the unique American
&quot;creed&quot; that will inform this renewal: &quot;If Americans
are to build a community of citizens,&quot; Don Eberly argues,
&quot;they will have to do so within, not outside of, the American
philosophical tradition.&quot; Many of the contributors see that
tradition in the ideas of the American founding, including justice
and limited government as well as equal opportunity and responsible
freedom. These ideas remain, as Heather Higgins puts it, the &quot;cultural
building blocks&quot; of America's future. Edward Schwartz (among
others) would include Tocqueville's concept of civil society and
mediating institutions. In the political sphere, &quot;governmentalism&quot;
must be replaced by active citizenship and revitalized political
institutions. The political party, according to Colleen Sheehan,
was supposed to be &quot;the most encompassing and decisive expression
of our common republican opinion and civic character.&quot;  In
the cultural sphere, relativism must be replaced by strong families,
personal morality, and religious faith. Unless America &quot;respects
and protects&quot; the relationship between religion and public
life, writes Os Guinness, &quot;both American religious liberty
and public discourse will he handicapped.&quot;

<br><I>Loving
Your Neighbor: A Principled Guide to Personal Charity</I> Marvin
Olasky, ed. (Capital Research Center)<br>
 Culled from <I>Philanthropy,
Culture and Society</I>, the 12 practical essays in this book
illustrate the virtues and pitfalls of personal charity. The book's
premise is that government welfare and the &quot;upstairs&quot;
philanthropy of wealthy foundations fail because they aim to meet
only the physical needs of the poor. Through factual reporting,
the writers show small-scale, &quot;downstairs&quot; charities
that do more good by urging the needy to change their conduct
and attitudes. As the title implies, the book also emphasizes
the centrality of religion in transforming lives. But even small,
religious charities can forget some of the &quot;basics of successful
philanthropy: think small, and think of souls rather than bodies.&quot;
Some charities err in relying on one charismatic leader; others
imperil their religious character by accepting government or foundation
funding with strings attached. The writers draw key lessons from
successful programs as well as from those that have gone awry.
Gerry Wisz investigates one New York soup kitchen's evolution
from merely offering meals to the homeless to encouraging personal
responsibility. Frederica Mathewes-Green shows how volunteer-run
pregnancy care centers in Maryland enable low-income women to
bring their babies to term by offering them shelter, clothing,
and comfort. Marvin Olasky examines a Texas charity that sacrificed
its success by purging its spiritual qualities to secure government
funding. Dan McMurry recounts how competition for grants among
charities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, led them to create a pauper
class to justify their existence. Olasky concludes that &quot;poverty-fighters
should commit themselves to helping only those . . . who are willing
to work hard and change their life-styles.&quot; <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>A Second Look at Habitat</B><br>&quot;It's
Time to Take Habitat for Humanity Seriously&quot; by Howard Husock<br>
<I>City Journal</I>, Summer 1995. Conservatives treat Habitat for
Humanity lightly, writes Husock, because of its affiliation with
former president Jimmy Carter. But Habitat is fast becoming the
biggest homebuilder in America and offers a program that draws
on conservative ideals. The organization builds modest new houses
in the belief that low-income families will maintain orderly neighborhoods
if they own their own homes. To qualify, a low-income applicant
must meet rigorous standards of responsibility. A prospective
owner must participate in the construction of his home. Habitat
then offers the owner an interest-free mortgage. The owner must
also help build someone else's home, and his house is repossessed
if he defaults on the payments. The result, in many cases: Safe,
clean neighborhoods and low-income homeowners with pride and a
stake in an orderly and prosperous community. All of the money
used in Habitat's construction projects comes from private sources. <I>Manhattan

<B>Foundation Fossils</B><br>&quot; Philanthropical Correctness&quot; by
David Samuels <I>The New Republic</I>, Sept. 18 &amp; 25, 1995<br>
Although their assets have tripled in the last 25 years, Samuels
contends that America's philanthropic foundations have become
irrelevant to public policy. The foundations that once funded
the discovery of the polio vaccine and the expansion of our public
library system cannot boast such lofty achievements today. Samuels
cites four reasons. First, rather than fund programs that offer
practical solutions to failures in education, welfare, and crimefighting,
these foundations fund multicultural programs designed to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance.&quot; Second, these
foundations give more money to liberal advocacy groups like the
Children's Defense Fund than they give to university research.
Third, foundations no longer subject grantees to independent scholarly
review but rely on foundation bureaucrats with little policy expertise.
Finally, these foundations suffer from inbreeding and parochialism.
Nearly 40 percent of foundation CEOs are hired from within the
nonprofit sector, 30 percent from within their own foundations.
The result: chronic myopia. Obsessed with multicultural concerns
and hamstrung by stale thinking, our leading foundations pay little
attention to our society's most pressing issues.<I>The New Republic -- tel:

<B>Wilsonian Liberals</B><br>&quot;Liberalism's
Lost Tradition&quot; by Fred Siegel &amp; Will Marshall <I>The New Democrat</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
Writing in the Democratic Leadership
Council's house magazine, Fred Siegel and Will Marshall assure
Democrats fearful of obsolescence that one tradition within liberalism
might accord with America's repudiation of New Deal statism. Woodrow
Wilson's &quot;New Freedom&quot; liberalism took aim at the concentration
of power in turn-of-the-century corporate America by curbing trusts.
Siegel and Marshall suggest that today's Democrats should direct
this ideological animus toward our centralized federal government.
During the 1912 presidential contest between Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt, they note, Roosevelt was supported by both corporate
moguls and social workers. These odd bedfellows were united in
a &quot;common condescension&quot; for the common man. Wilson
criticized paternalism, argued against social planning by either
corporate monopolies or by a large, interventionist federal government,
and championed individual and economic liberty. Siegel and Marshall
urge today's Democrats to tap into this lost &quot;anti-statist
but radically democratic&quot; tradition by breaking the federal
government's monopoly over public decisionmaking and resources. <I>Democratic Leadership Council -- tel: 202-546-0007, fax: 202-544-5002.  <P>

<B>Drafted
Volunteers</B><br>&quot;Charity Begins at School&quot; by Chester E.
Finn Jr. &amp; Gregg  Vanourek <I>Commentary</I>, Oct. 1995 <br>
Government
by the people or people by the government? Hudson Institute Scholars
Finn and Vanourek assess mandatory community service in our schools.
Finn and Vanourek oppose &quot;compulsory-service learning&quot;
because it confuses political action with community service and
hence promotes projects with an ideological cast. In Cecil County,
Maryland, students earned credit for lobbying the county government
to maintain its recycling program. Furthermore, mandated volunteer
service is itself an oxymoron that obscures the virtue of true
voluntarism. And who's to say which student projects meet service
requirements? In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a high-school student
was denied her diploma because the time she spent volunteering
in a nursing home and for Meals on Wheels was not school-directed
service. Finally, the authors claim that mandatory service threatens
church-based and private-sector volunteer work. In the near-term,
mandatory service monopolizes the time children might otherwise
devote to private-sector charity, and it discourages private-sector
voluntarism in the long-run by teaching children that voluntarism
is no more fulfilling than writing lab reports and meeting paper
deadlines. <I>Commentary -- tel: 212-751-4400, fax: 212-751-1174.</I>

<B>Vo-Tech
Strikes Out</B><br>
&quot;The President's Apprentices&quot; by Jonathan
Marshall  <I>Reason</I>, March 1995 <br>
Faced with declining wages
for high-school graduates, the Clinton administration has embraced
school-to-work programs. But Marshall argues that students put
through the paces of vocational training are no better off in
the long-term than students who go the strictly academic route.
A recent National Assessment of Vocational Education study reports
that graduates of vocational education in California are employed
at the same rates and earn about as much as general track graduates.
In fact, according to a Labor Department report released last
year, many male graduates of vocational education actually earn
less than those who have graduated from traditional high school
programs. The central difficulty seems to be that graduates of
vocational education often do not obtain jobs that match their
training. In Germany, where most trained bakers work for Ford
Motor Company, only half of German apprenticeship graduates work
in the fields in which they were trained. Consequently, some studies
show that students might do better to delay career choices until
they gain more work experience and until they can better direct
their career training. The bottom line: Inefficient, vocational
education provides no quick fix to the falling wages of low-income
Americans. <I>Reason Foundation -- tel: 310-391-2245, fax: 310-391-4395.</I>

&quot;Why Koreans Succeed&quot; by Heather Mac Donald <I>City Journal</I>, Spring 1995 <br>
Mac Donald assures us that
the American dream is alive and epitomized by Korean-American
grocers in New York. Their success, she argues, is fueled by the
same factors that have enabled other immigrant groups to succeed:
hard work, an emphasis on education, and strong community ties.
Some of these factors manifest themselves in distinctly Korean
ways. Korean communities form gaes, or communal savings pools,
to provide interest-free loans to budding businessmen. And many
Korean children boost their academic achievement by attending
a hagwon or &quot;prep school&quot; after school and on weekends.
But Mac Donald warns that America has grown economically and culturally
hostile towards Korean entrepreneurship. New York City requires
grocers to pay 14 different taxes and obtain numerous licenses;
Koreans also endure race-based boycotts and racial crimes. Consequently,
Korean immigration has slowed to a trickle and some are returning
home. Urban America will suffer if Korean entrepreneurship is
stifled. By introducing stable and successful businesses to low-income
neighborhoods in New York and Los Angeles, Koreans have spearheaded
urban renewal. Many Koreans are still committed to building successful
businesses here. Will we let them? <I>Manhattan Institute -- tel:

<p><B>Hired Off the Streets</B><br>&quot;From
Underclass to Working Class&quot; by James L. Payne  <I>The American
Enterprise</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
The Dallas branch of the Industrial
Labor Service Corp. (ILS) proves that the invisible hand can be
a helping hand. ILS, Payne reports, is the largest employer of
temporary laborers in Dallas. It hires from among Dallas's down-and-out.
ILS pays these workers $4.70 an hour but charges companies $7.50
an hour for their services. ILS uses the difference to provide
its workers with lodging, breakfast and lunch, transportation,
and tools, and it makes a profit of 17 cents an hour per worker.
Unlike most private charities touted by conservatives, ILS is
primarily profit-driven. It does not demand its &quot;clients&quot;
change personal habits and attitudes as many faith-based charities
do. But, Payne reports, laborers find ILS benevolent (it provides
lunch out of generosity, not a desire to raise productivity).
And they also learn the lesson of exchange-you have to give something
to receive something-that many charities try to instill by demanding
behavioral or spiritual change in exchange for material aid. Payne
warns that &quot;working halls&quot; like ILS are threatened by
the news media and the government, which accuse them of exploitation. <I>American

<B>Black Christian Schools</B><br>
&quot;The
New Exodus&quot; by Joe Maxwell <I>World</I>, April 15, 1995<br>
In 1954,
Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for the integration
of public schools. Many black families abandoned Christian schools
in favor of integrated public education. Forty years later, Maxwell
reports, blacks are returning. Nearly 10 percent of African-American
children from kindergarten to fifth grade attend private schools,
up from 3.8 percent in 1968. Maxwell argues that black parents
appreciate the discipline and the unambiguous moral education
their children receive at these schools. They are happy that their
children are required to wear uniforms, that the school environment
they send their children to is drug-, gang-, and violence-free,
and that prayer is an essential component of their children's
school day. The revival of black Christian academies is hardly
the result of separatist sentiment. Their main agenda is providing
excellent Christian education. The rise of such schools is an
indictment of poor public education. In the words of one supporter,
&quot;How many more generations of black children's education
are we going to allow to be destroyed . . . by an incompetent,
costly, self-serving government education establishment?&quot; <I>World -- tel:

<B>Mormon Charity</B><br>
&quot; Work, Not Welfare
in the Mormon Church&quot; by Ralph Hardy <I>The American Enterprise</I>,
Sept./Oct. 1995 
<br>Sixty years ago, at the dawn of the welfare state
and its &quot;culture of dependence,&quot; the Mormon Church built
its own welfare program on the principle of individual responsibility.
At the center of this system lies the &quot;bishops' storehouse.&quot;
Akin to a discount retailer like Price Club, it warehouses foodstuffs
and other essentials. At times throughout the year, Mormons volunteer
their labor on farms that supply the storehouse. Mormons also
fast on the first Sunday of every month, and the money that would
have been spent on skipped meals is used to purchase items for
the storehouse. When a Mormon bishop determines that a truly needy
individual or family has no other means of support, such as relatives
in another state, he may offer food and supplies from the church's
storehouse. In exchange, recipients are usually required to perform
some service for the church community and to search for employment,
with the church's help. Hardy argues that his church's system
is one antidote to the maladies of our current welfare system.<I>American

&quot;New
Kids on the Block: The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&quot; by
Martin Morse Wooster <I>Philosophy, Culture and Society</I>, June
1995 <br>
After being mugged on a Bronx street in 1981, businessman
Steve Mariotti wondered why bright inner-city kids would risk
their futures for the paltry $10 they stole from him. Mariotti
wanted to help at-risk children learn how to calculate risk and
reward for legitimate ends. Because schools often do not give
students the practical skills and work habits that lead to success
in business, Mariotti established the National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in 1986. Today, NFTE operates
in nine urban centers, including New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia.
Its budget has grown from $600,000 in 1991 to $5.5 million today,
thanks to charitable contributions from foundations and other
sources. And what does this money buy? Student entrepreneurs are
given business cards, a $10 bank account, $50 for start-up costs,
and the opportunity to read the Wall Street Journal once a week.
With this start, students build their own small businesses and
learn about profit, loss, finance, marketing, negotiation, and
customer service. Greg Blair sells trading cards. Regina Jackson
markets the jewelry she makes. Low-income minority students are
the target of this program. In Washington, D.C., nearly all of
the approximately 250 students who participate in NFTE are low-income
African Americans. Consequently, the textbooks used in NFTE classes,
one of which is co-authored by Mariotti, profile the entrepreneurial
successes of formerly disadvantaged minorities. Wooster's reporting
is choc-full of heart-warming anecdotes garnered from his visits
to NFTE programs in D.C. schools. He concludes that NFTE fills
a valuable niche: It is the one program that actually shows inner-city
youth a path to success different from one littered with violence
and despair. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax:

<B>Welfare as We Will Know It</B><BR>&quot;Ending the Welfare State, Pts. I and II&quot; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
April &amp; May 1995 <BR>
In this two-part series, 14 leading conservatives
propose alternatives to the welfare state. David Forte wants to
bolster private charities by offering taxpayers a 110 percent
tax deduction for charitable contributions. William Tucker thinks
that for every hour a person spends doing volunteer work, he or
she should be rewarded with a tax credit equal to his or her regular
earned income per hour. Charles D. Hobbs suggests making working
more profitable than welfare by subsidizing private-sector employment
for welfare recipients. George Liebmann argues that we should
model day care in the U.S. after the British, who rely heavily
on parent-organized and volunteer-run cooperative playgroups.
Michael Tanner urges that adoption be eased by lifting restrictions
on transracial adoption, terminating the custodial rights of biological
parents whose children have been in foster care for a year, and
by ending funding formulas that encourage states to keep as many
children as possible in the foster care system.  Michael Novak
argues that teen moms should be blocked from setting up independent
households, while Elizabeth Fox-Genovese advocates placing them
and their children in maternity homes. The proposals assume that,
absent welfare, the private-sector holds the answers to our social
problems. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>Pope John Paul II on Democracy</B><P>
Democracy cannot be sustained
without a shared commitment to certain moral truths about the
human person and human community. The basic question before a
democratic society is: &quot;How ought we live together?&quot;
In seeking an answer to this question, can society exclude moral
truth and moral reasoning? Can the Biblical wisdom that played
such a formative part in the very founding of your country be
excluded from the debate? Would not doing so mean that America's
founding documents no longer have any defining content, but are
only the formal dressing of changing opinion? Would not doing
so mean that tens of millions of Americans could no longer offer
the contribution of their deepest convictions to the formation
of public policy?   Every generation of Americans needs to know
that freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having
the right to do what we ought.        -- Baltimore, Md., Oct. 8,

<B>Sen. Bill Bradley on Civil Society</B><br>
What both Democrats
and Republicans fail to see is that the government and the market
are not enough to make a civilization. There must also be a healthy,
robust civic sector-a space in which the bonds of community can
flourish. Government and the market are similar to two legs on
a three-legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society,
the stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital
America. . . .  We also have to give the distinctive moral language
of civil society a more permanent place in our public conversation.
The language of the marketplace says, &quot;Get as much as you
can for yourself.&quot; The language of government says, &quot;Legislate
for others what is good for them.&quot; But the language of community,
family and citizenship at its core is about receiving undeserved
gifts. What this nation needs to promote is the spirit of giving
something freely, without measuring it out precisely or demanding
something in return.        -- speech, National Press Club, Feb.

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>

</center><p>

	The first act of an incoming president is to "solemnly swear (or affirm)" that he will "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."  In judging prospective candidates for the presidency, it is therefore important to examine whether they interpret the Constitution properly. To help voters with this determination, <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> asked the following question of the principal presidential candidates still running as of November 1995: "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" We publish responses from Senators Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, and Dick Lugar; Governor Lamar Alexander, and Representative Robert Dornan. (President Bill Clinton, Patrick Buchanan, Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes were invited to participate but did not respond by our deadline.) 
<p><hr><p>


<a name="dole"></a><b>Senator Bob Dole</b><br>
<i>The Establishment Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.dole96.com">Dole for President Home Page</a><p>
	Perhaps no provision of the Constitution is more misunderstood today than the First Amendment as it applies to religion.
<p>

	The most basic misunderstanding is that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment demands that any reference to religion must be absolutely cleansed from our schools and other public institutions. A second misunderstanding is that anyone who wants our public institutions to show more respect for the religious faith of the American people is really plotting to impose a particular religious viewpoint on those with different beliefs.

<p>	A good part of the blame for this confusion lies with the Supreme Court of the United States. Years ago, the Court cast aside the original meaning of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which forbids the establishment of an official state religion or policies favoring one religion over another. In its place, the Court has erected a variety of confusing formulas -- the Lemon test, the endorsement test, and others -- that invoke the Constitution to support the proposition that religion must be purged from public life. Using such tests, the Supreme Court has banned the display of the Ten Commandments in any public school, even for educational purposes.


<p>
	Unfortunately, misguided school administrators and teachers in some areas of the country have also wrongly embraced the idea that all references to religion in school settings are unconstitutional. Among the results of this misreading of the First Amendment:

<p><ul>

<li>Teachers have been disciplined for wearing a cross as personal jewelry and for reading their own Bible during break periods.<p>

<li>Two Texas third-graders were prohibited from wearing T-shirts depicting Jesus -- though Power Rangers and Barney were just fine.

<p>


<li>Many communities have banned holiday crche displays from public buildings and parks, even where 
they have been set up by private civic groups.


<p>

<li>Some schools have banned religious songs at choir concerts, as well as Christmas carols, and even Christmas trees.
<P>

<li>Students have been told they may not talk about God to classmates, and teachers have rejected religious artwork and reports on "my hero" where the students took the politically incorrect decision to write about Jesus.
</ul><p>


	In fact, studies by the National Institute of Education, People for the American Way, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State have all confirmed that references to religion's role in American life and history have been systematically stripped from textbooks and curricula.
<p>

	A fair reading of the historical record, however, shows that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to protect religious liberty, not strip religious expression from all public institutions. As Professor Stephen Carter writes: "[T]he metaphorical separation of church and state originated in an effort to protect religion from the state, not the state from religion. The religion clauses of the First Amendment were crafted to permit maximum freedom to the religious."

<p>	After all, it was the first Congress -- which passed the Bill of Rights and sent it for ratification to the states -- that opened each day's session with a prayer led by a chaplain. This practice continues today. And 24 hours after it voted in favor of what is now the First Amendment, the Congress considered a resolution proclaiming a national day of thanksgiving. Indeed, if the Supreme Court itself really adhered to the view that the government must divorce itself from religion, then it would not open every one of its sessions with the appeal, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."

<p>	There are some hopeful signs that the confusion surrounding the First Amendment's Establishment Clause is now beginning to clear up. Earlier this year, in a close, 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a public university can deny funding to a Christian student newspaper while financing student publications generally. It now appears that there are at least five justices who believe that religious expression is entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of expression.

<p>	To say that our public institutions should accommodate religious speech is not to say that the state should impose official prayers and punish students who do not participate. That's certainly not my position. Nor is it the position of Jay Sekulow, Pat Robertson's counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, who has said, "We don't want to see a return to the pre-1962 situation, with a teacher leading a class i
n prayer."

<p>	At the same time, we simply do not accept the view that the Constitution commands that religion be erased from whatever government touches. This view misreads the First Amendment and distorts history.
<p>

<a name="gramm"></a><b>Senator Phil Gramm</b><br>
<i>The Takings Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.gramm96.org">Phil Gramm for President Home Page</a>

<p>
	When considering the most "underappreciated" element of the Constitution, anyone who sees what is going on everyday across this country as I do will respond immediately, "the Fifth Amendment." Well known for its protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment also contains a clause that protects private property, a building block of the American foundation. The Takings Clause is a quintessential constitutional shield, artfully and specifically rejecting the idea that government officials can seize property without compensation, regardless of what public good they intend to accomplish.

<p>	Unfortunately, we are facing a threat to the right to own property that our Founding Fathers could never have imagined. In America in 1995, two consenting adults can engage in any kind of consensual behavior with total constitutional protection -- except owning private property  and engaging in commerce and business. Over and over again -- every day all across America -- people are having their private property taken without compensation -- by way of the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulation, and a host of other "regulatory takings." Property values are being reduced and land is effectively being taken to promote objectives that society considers good, but for which society refuses to pay. In fact, we have a president today whose interior secretary has suggested that private property may even be outdated in the modern world!

<p>

	If government takes your property or restricts its use, you should be compensated. On this issue there can be no compromise. Private property is the foundation of our freedom, and I will defend it as vigorously as the freedom of speech and freedom of religion. As president, I will work hard to protect private-property rights and to bring the Fifth Amendment back into the family of the Bill of Rights on behalf of the people who own property, till the soil, and produce the goods and services in our country.

<p>	The most pressing constitutional issue facing our nation, however, involves a matter not actually enshrined in that great document. I am referring to the need for a Balanced Budget Amendment. I introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution on my first day in Congress and have worked hard to pass it ever since. But, as surprising as it may be to some of my colleagues, this debate did not begin with my tenure in Congress.

<p>	Through the course of American history, we have amended our Constitution 27 times, but haven't yet had the political will to fix the only thing Thomas Jefferson found wrong with the document. Jefferson was this country's Minister to France during the writing of the Constitution, and when he was first shown the document, he had a proposal for one change. In a subsequent letter to John Taylor, Jefferson recorded that proposal:

<p>	"I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article taking from the government the power of borrowing."

<p>	So the present controversy is not just a debate over a balanced budget amendment, but a debate on the Jefferson amendment. It is also a debate about the future of America and a potential seed of its destruction. We need a contract between the government and the people that binds Congress with a chain that cannot be broken. The genius of the Const
itution is that it rules out of bounds actions that the people have determined that they do not want Congress to take. Read the first words from the Bill of Rights in our Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances."

<p>	The American people were clear about the grievances they wanted redressed in November 1994. In the most decisive election since 1932, the people said to their government, "Stop the taxing. Stop the spending. Stop the regulating." To do that, they supported the Contract With America, a key element of which is a balanced budget amendment. But we haven't given the people what they want yet. We have not fulfilled a promise we made.

<p>	The Constitution was written because people did not trust the government. With Congress's failure to honor its promises, act responsibly, and be accountable for its actions, there is much for the people not to trust. 
<p>

<a name="lugar"></a><b>Senator Dick Lugar</b><br>
<i>Enumerated Powers</i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.html">Lugar for President Home Page</a>
<p>
	Virtually every clause in the Constitution has been used -- even tortured -- to justify a variety of causes. What deserves more emphasis in political discourse, however, is the spirit of what the Constitution set out to do generally: to assign to the federal government specific tasks and the powers to carry them out, and to reserve all else to the states or the people. This intent is most clearly articulated in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution.


<p>
	The aim of the Constitution's Framers was clear enough: to create a strong, but limited, national government. Having first decided to omit a list of specific limits (or "negatives," as the Framers called them) on the national government's authority, the Framers then agreed in principle to accept them as the first amendments to the new Constitution. The first eight amendments impose specific limits on the power of government, both at the national and state levels. All serve the same end: restricting the scope and power of government. Lest there be any ambiguity, the Ninth Amendment makes clear the presumption that rights belong to the people: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." And the Tenth Amendment makes clear the boundaries that this places on the national government: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>	In a way, it might be said that these provisions were not so much "amendments" to the Constitution -- in the sense of replacing existing provisions or adding new features -- as clarifications of the Constitution's underlying intent. The Framers were no libertarians; they set out to create a strong national government with powers sufficiently robust to accomplish its functions. This is especially true in the realm of national security, where powers are largely reserved to the national government. That which the federal government should do, the Framers believed, it should do well.

<p>
	But that which the federal government should not do and cannot do well, it should not do at all. The modern departure from this philosophy is largely responsible for the lack of confidence that Americans now express about their government. As the national government has expanded its reach into virtually every sphere of Americans' lives, it should not be surprising that the volatility of voter preferences and discontent with government have increased. The passions of individuals and groups are inflamed on all sides of issues that are not properly within the sphere of the federal government.

<p>	Take the recent debate over funding formulas and federal "strings" on welfare block grants. It is well and good that states and localities should administer their own social welfare programs. They are closer to the people and, on the whole, they will do a better job than the federal government. This is surely consistent with the intent of the Framers.

<p>	But why should the federal government be the tax collector for the states' programs? Why, for example, should citizens of Iowa or New Hampshire or any other state send their money to Washington, only to have it returned -- after bitter fights over allocation formulas and conditionsto run their own programs? Wouldn't it make more sense for states to raise the funds to pay for the programs they establish?


<p>
	In this regard, I have proposed to eliminate the federal income tax (and the 16th Amendment, which makes it possible) and replace it with a national sales tax collected by the states. National and state sales taxes can coexist perfectly well and, after a brief time, are likely to come into conformity with one another. Once this occurs, the federal government could reduce its sales tax, and allow the states to raise the funds for their own programs. Gone would be monetary transfers to Washington; gone would be formula fights; and gone would be federal strings. And limited federal government would be here to stay.

<p>	The Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution offer much needed guidance. If we were to ask whether each new proposed program, as well as many existing programs, represent legitimate tasks of the federal government, our answer would often be "no," and we could start to fashion a more efficient federal government. We would also discover that properly limiting federal government would raise its public standing commensurately.

<p>	In speaking of the amendment process, James Madison says in The Federalist No.49, "As every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything." A society that appeals to its national government to attend to all things -- including those for which it is not suited -- will find that that same government loses the veneration of the people in political discourse. That cannot be the goal of true friends of limited government.
<p>

<a name="lamar"></a><b>Lamar Alexander</b><br>
<i>Presidential Powers</i><br>
<a href="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar">Alexander for President Home Page</a><p>

	One section of our Constitution distinguishes the United States from virtually all other countries: Article II, the description of the role and powers of the president. The president is the only figure in our government whose oath of office is actually written in the Constitution. He is the only person who is elected by and represents all of the people. Yet, today, it is the president whose power and authority is most in decline.

<p>	The reasons for the decline are obvious. Even at the outset of his administration, when Bill Clinton's own party controlled both Houses of Congress, nearly all his actions undermined the strength of the presidency. He has retreated from campaign promises (the middle-class tax cut, a balanced budget), sown disaffection among his own supporters (gays in the military, health-care reform), dragged the White House into embarrassing scandals (Travelgate, Whitewater), and zigged and zagged on foreign policy (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).

<p>	But the presidency has also suffered from the rise of the legislative branch, especially since the elections of November 1994. This development is unusual. While the Congress has often had energetic leaders, it is rare in the modern era to see the national agenda set by the legislative branch rather than the executive.

<p>	Setting the national agenda may be the single most important function of a president. A strong president is someone who can focus on the two or three most urgent needs facing our country, develop a strategy to deal with them, and then convince at least half the country he's right. President Carter, by contrast, tried to involve himself in virtually every policy matter. President Clinton has done the same. The result has been an unfocused, and consequently weak, presidency. I am convinced that much of Ronald Reagan's effectiveness as president came from having three clear goals -- lower taxes, less government, and strong defense -- and spending all eight years of his presidency pursuing them.


<p>
	A careful reading of the Constitution shows that Article II provides the president with the tools to set the national agenda. He is the commander in chief and he is responsible for the conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. He can pick his own cabinet and appoint the chief officers of the government. He can select candidates for the federal bench. Through the careful use of the veto, he can reject whatever competing ideas the Congress tries to impose on the nation. All of these instruments of executive power can make for a strong president who helps chart the nation's course.

<p>	Again, President Clinton provides us with the best example of how the misuse of these powers leads to a weak executive. President Clinton's role as both commander-in-chief and the executive responsible for the conduct of foreign policy has done nothing to persuade America that there is a steady hand on the tiller. The result has been a Congress all-too-eager to usurp the president's prerogative in making foreign policy, whether it is in trade matters or the deployment of troops in Bosnia. A strong executive, as the Constitution implies, must make foreign policy, and resist congressional encroachments.

<p>	Our current situation is often ascribed to President Clinton's "inexperience" in foreign policy matters. Of course, it is not unusual for a president to arrive at the White House without a detailed knowledge of foreign affairs. But it is alarming to have a president who apparently doesn't know anyone else who does. Here we see President Clinton's ineffectual use of the power of appointment. The bureaucratic in-fighting among the State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Council personnel at the start of the Clinton presidency was a sign of the chief executive's inability to put together a first-class team that could work together. Joycelyn Elders and the series of bungled nominations at the Justice Department further eroded our confidence in the president's judgment. More recently, President Clinton's threats to veto a balanced budget amendment and the Republican Medicare plan seemed like pure political posturing rather than prudent use of executive power. These actions weakened both the president and the office of the presidency.

<p>	To be sure, there are many other aspects of our Constitution that receive too little notice: the Ninth and Tenth Amendments; the 22nd Amendment that created term limits for the president (the precedent for Congressional term limits); and the two alcohol amendments that tried to impose national legislation where local ordinances had proven more effective.
<p>
	But today we are on the brink of electing the first president of the next century. It would be worthwhile for all students of the Constitution -- not to mention all candidates for president -- to reexamine Article II. Used the way our Founders intended, Article II will help a strong, agenda-setting president committed to a limited central government achieve his goals.
<p>

<a name="dornan"></a><b>Representative Robert K. Dornan</b><br>
<i>"Government by Judiciary"</i>

<p>

	James Madison wrote that if "the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the Nation . . . be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable [government], more than for a faithful exercise of its powers." I couldn't agree more.

<p>	Seventy years of liberal activism, defined as opposing Madison's sentiment, have undone the original intent of the Framers. But no single point of judicial activism has done more harm to our nation than the doctrine of "incorporation"  in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights. In one fell swoop, the majesty and wisdom of the Tenth Amendment -- not to mention every doctrine of liberty upon which this nation of states was founded -- came crashing down.
<p>

	Our national penitence for the gross and evil sin of slavery has taken its toll on our every public institution. We fought a civil war, the bloodiest of all American wars, in large part to shed the physical chains of slavery protected by states' rights. We could have used surgically precise remedies to eventually bring closure to this historic tragedy without savaging the very liberties we insisted we were defending; instead we ignored the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and attempted a solution -- government by judiciary -- that fell way off the mark. In our earnest attempt to stop injustice from hiding behind the shield of states' rights, we threw the baby out with the bathwater. And, politics and power being what they are, "absorption" gave way to "incorporation."

<p>	Government by judiciary is perhaps the severest price our nation has paid for slavery. Through "incorporation" in the Fourteenth Amendment, the voice of the people (Congress and state and local governments) is patronized by "benevolent" judges, manipulated by strident ideologues, and mortgaged for generations by monied special interests. If the courts are, for all practical purposes, a "continuous constitutional convention," then how does our democracy differ from past oligarchies?

<p>	It is no small irony that this abrogation of federalism, our ultimate response to slavery, has brought on the second crushing evil to beset our nation: abortion. Only a judiciary that felt it had free rein to invoke "penumbras" within our Constitution could be so sick with power as to legalize mass extermination of our most innocent and defenseless citizens, our pre-born. Millions of pre-born children have been cruelly and brutally slaughtered -- a toll more horrific than any other holocaust -- because a simple majority of only nine men, ruling on behalf of 50 separate state constitutions, held that the Constitution, somewhere and somehow, contains a paramount right to privacy . . . and that "incorporation" dictates that this "penumbra" apply to the states.

<p>
	Every great social question in which the U.S. Supreme Court has weighed its opinion is the spawn of incorporation. Again, by what force of irony have our earnest attempts to rectify the problem of slavery ultimately given birth, not only to an even greater national sin in abortion but to a brood of contentious national issues that federalism was designed to pacify?

<p>	Consider, for instance, the charged issue of prayer in public schools. Any person with half a brain recognizes the insurmountable social problem of maintaining one collective way of publicly expressing our national adherence to the benevolent hand of God. And yet, precisely in response to public prayer -- contention that is completely natural and expected -- a simple majority of only nine unelected rulers told all of us that because one collective way of public prayer is not compatible with national cohesion, then no public prayer will be allowed. The doctrine of incorporation gives the Court this prerogative to rule in this manner.

<p>
	Every thinking American schooled in our national heritage -- all except a majority of the robed nine -- knows the intrinsic secular benefit from publicly acknowledging our Creator. Allowing and even encouraging public-school children to formally and vocally acknowledge their Creator impresses upon each of them a fundamental doctrine of Americanism -- that inalienable rights come from a Creator and not from man.

<p>
	Hence, these rights cannot be justifiably taken from them by men and their governments. How else can we more effectively impress this powerful message on the minds of rising generations? Incorporation states that we need not even try.

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy -- Heritage</title>
<body><center>

<h3><i>WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS
WOULD MEAN TO THE ECONOMY</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
and<br>
John S. Barry<br>
Economics Research Assistant<br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Presentation to Senate Republican Conference<br>
November 15, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="#graphs">Graphs and Charts</a>
<p>
Using a generally accepted and widely regarded model of the U.S. economy, we found that balancing the federal budget between 1996 and 2002 while cutting taxes caused the economy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
<p>
<i>Specifically, according to the simulation, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:</i>
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product grows by $10.8 billion more than under current law in the year 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 though 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.4 percent in the conventional mortgage rate.  This means that a balanced budget with tax relief would save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<P>
<li>The additional construction of 104,000 new family homes over the next seven years.
<p>
<li>The additional sales of 600,000 automobiles over the next seven years worth $10 billion.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index.
<p></ul>
	The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting company, to reach these conclusions. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates are consultants to many government agencies including the Office of Management & Budget, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Labor, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Council of Economic Advisors.
<p>
	Heritage made no changes to the Meyer model except to reset federal spending levels to mirror those contained in the Congressional Budget Resolution of May and to reduce tax rates that capture tax policy changes defined by the Senate Finance Committee.  We explicitly continued the assumption of the Meyer model that the Federal Reserve would not act to stimulate the economy in the face of slower than expected growth.  Had we allowed the model to use the assumption of a more active Federal Reserve, all of the numbers reported below would have been significantly higher.
<p>
Specifically, we assumed:
<p><ul>
<li>Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare and Medicaid follow those in the budget resolution.
<p>
<li>Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs.
<p>
<li>All other spending -- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief and other provisions of the Senate tax package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.
</ul><p>

<p>
<center><a href="chart13.gif">Competing Deficit Reduction Plans:</a></center>
<P>
"President Clinton has developed two official budgets over the past year.  The first one, issued in January, 1995, was never intended to balance the budget over the next decade.  The second Clinton budget, issued in June 1995, was said to reach a balance in 2005.  However, as this graph shows, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the President's second budget will never actually balance the budget.  In contrast, the Congressional Balanced Budget Plan of 1995 reaches a balance in 2002, according to the Congressional Budget Office."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart14.gif">GDP in 2002....</a></center>
<p>
"Balancing the budget and cutting taxes over seven years produces $10.8 billion more in Gross Domestic Product.  The red bar below shows the level of Gross Domestic Product, a measure of all the final sales within the United States, that is forecast in the year 2002 if nothing is done to balance the budget or lower taxes.  The blue bar shows that a higher level of GDP can be expected in 2002 with a balanced federal budget and tax cuts."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart5.gif">Additional Consumption Expenditures From A Balanced Budget</a></center>
<p>
"One result of a balanced budget with tax cuts is some $66.2 billion more in consumption expenditures that the American people, not the government, are able to spend on everything from groceries to houses."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart7.gif">Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment With A Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a></center>
<p>
"This graph shows that a balanced budget with tax cuts will allow companies to build more factories and buy more machinery:  $88.2 billion more.  This increased spending represents lasting investments, primarily in the manufacturing sector."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart8.gif">Additional Business Investment in Computers.....</a></center>
<p>
"Another advantage of a balanced budget with tax cuts is that businesses will be able to invest in computers.  This will allow American workers to be more productive and in turn make American companies more competitive."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart12.gif">Additional Investment in Durable Goods....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts means that Americans will be spending $66.2 billion more in consumption.  This graph shows that a large part of that additional spending will be for producers' durable, things like microwaves, air conditioners, and other appliances.  In other words, a balanced budget with tax cuts will allow Americans to invest in lasting, household goods."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart11.gif">Additional Purchases of New Automobiles....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts means that Americans will be able to purchase about $10 billion worth of new automobiles over the next seven years.  That means that about 600,000 new automobiles will be built and purchased."
<hr><P>
<center><a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates.....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts could lower interest rates.  Over the next seven years a balanced budget with tax cuts might lower rates 0.5% below what they are expected to be without a balanced budget.  This 0.5% decrease means that a home borrower of $100,000 would save about $10,000 over a thirty-year mortgage."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts.....</a></center>
<p>
"Lower mortgage interest rates means that more people will be able to afford a house.  A balanced budget with tax cuts could lead to the construction of nearly 104,000 new homes over the next seven years.  This means not only new homes but also more good-paying construction jobs."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart10.gif">Inflation.....</a></center>
<p>
"Perhaps most importantly, a balanced budget with tax cuts would likely lower the rate of inflation by almost a full percentage point.  Thus, prices will not rise as quickly.  This is most beneficial to senior citizens and younger people who are living on a fixed income."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart_3.gif">$500-Per-Child Tax Credit Worksheet</a></center>
<p>
"The Congressional Balanced Budget Plan of 1995 includes a $500 per child tax credit.  This tax credit will help more than 28 million American families raising 51 million children.  To most families $500 would help pay one months mortgage payment or rent."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart2.gif">$500-Per-Child Tax Credit Benefits Middle Class Most</a></center> 
<p>
"Contrary to what most people have been saying, the $500 per child tax credit benefits mostly middle and lower class families.  In fact, 96 percent goes to families making below $100,000 per year."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart1.gif">Income Taxes</a></center>
<p>
"This graph shows that the $500 per-child tax credit benefits those at lower incomes more than the wealthy.  In fact, about 3.5 million families would have their entire income tax burden eliminated by the $500 per-child tax credit."

<title> PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID A. KEENE -- ACU</title>

<body>
<CENTER>Prepared Statement of David A. Keene, Chairman<br>
<b>The American Conservative Union</b><br> 
<P>
Before the Subcommittee on
Commerce, Justice, and State<br>
The Judiciary, and related agencies of the Appropriations Committee<br>
 of the United States Senate

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH"="30%"><P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.  Let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to testify before you this morning.
<P>
My name is <A HREF="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a> and I am Chairman of the American Conservative Union.  The ACU has for more than 30 years served as the grass-roots lobby for the conservative movement.  Our nearly one million members have been interested in and involved in the debate over whether the Legal Service Corporation can be reformed or whether it should be eliminated as a delivery vehicle for legal services to disadvantaged Americans since the mid-seventies and feel very strongly that the entrenched interests in control of the corporation make it very unlikely that any meaningful reform is even possible.
<P>
Sometimes a program that has gone off the tracks becomes so entrenched and resistant to reform that it has to be eliminated.  The LSC is such a program.  It will do no good to cut off a few branches . . . you must go to the root problem, bite the bullet . . . and start over.
<P>
The Legal Services Corporation was, as you know, established in 1974 to take over the programs then housed within the Office of Legal Services in the Office of Economic Opportunity or OEO.
<P>
You will hear various versions of just why the LSC was established, but as you consider the question of extending its funding, I would urge you to consider that the Nixon Administration had been urged to establish such a quasi-governmental corporation by the Ash Commission in 1971 as "a first step toward reprivatization of what has traditionally been a function of the private sector."
<P>
The LSC has, in fact, developed into something quite different employing via grants and contract thousands of attorneys who have become dependent upon government largesse both for their income and as a means of allowing them the freedom to pursue an agenda that has very little to do with providing individual legal services to those who cannot otherwise afford to go to a lawyer.
<P>
It must be admitted that most of those who came to dominate the new corporation as well as a sizable number of those who fought first to establish it and later to defend it have no desire at all to "reprivatize" the provision of legal services within our society.  Rather, they sought a permanent home for their activities with a guaranteed source of funding free of even the minimal oversight they had faced at OEO.
<P>
And . . . as history has shown . . . the interests that quickly came to dominate the new corporation have a far, far different view of its role in our society than did most of those who voted to establish it.
<P>
Many in Congress who voted in 1974 to establish the LSC did so in the belief that through the corporation they would be giving individual Americans without the wherewithal to afford private lawyers access to the legal system that they might otherwise be denied.  They envisioned a small army of idealistic men and women utilizing LSC grants to help poor families fight unfair evictions or avoid consumer rip-offs.
<P>
Since 1974, however, the LSC has spent millions of dollars on quasi-legal political activity designed to "organize" and "empower" the poor as a group or class . . . money that might better have been used to serve individual clients.  The mission as those running
LSC has seen it is to transform American society by changing laws and governmental policies affecting what they tend to see as their constituencies.
<P>

Partisan and ideological disputes between Congress and the White House have allowed the LSC more than independence they made it unaccountable to anyone.  And this has allowed the interests that came to dominate it to take total and complete control . . . . A case in which the inhabitants were truly given control of the asylum.
<P>
There are no doubt good men and women working within the LSC framework who do see their mission as the members of Congress who voted to establish the program saw it.  I have no doubt that these men and women are out there serving the legitimate needs of individual clients.
<P>
We can applaud the work of these people while recognizing that the LSC has gone off the tracks in pursuing an additional mission that Congress has an obligation to halt.  The simple fact is that the LSC's major impact has not been in serving these clients, but in funding a network of activists dedicated not to helping clients function better within the framework of our society, but to changing that society.
<P>
The question is not whether the policy goals LSC grantees have sought are good or bad . . . or how much time they spend pursuing it, but whether Congress ought to be funding an effort to undermine the authority of the states and to influence public policy at all levels.
<P>
Private citizens have every right. . . indeed they may often have a moral obligation . . . to organize and work for policy changes that they hope will lead to the kind of society in which they want to live . . . and in which they want to raise their children and grandchildren.
<P>
But that is far, far different from saying that they have a right to tax money to finance such activities.
<P>
The funding of the LSC has amounted to little more that the channeling of tax money to men and women with an ideological, political agenda and allowed them to use that money to pursue that agenda.
<P>
Let's be clear.  Congress has no business funding such activities.
<P>
Senator Hollings said earlier this morning that the proper way to achieve such change is not through the course, but through the Congress . . . and he is dead right.
<P>
There is a legitimate question as to whether Congress should be funding even the provision of individual legal services . . . those services which the Ash Commission so correctly described as traditionally a function of the private sector.
<P>
The question of whether the private sector can accomplish this task will be debated in and out of Congress . . . and should be.
<P>
But that debate . . . however it is resolved . . . should not influence your vote on the continuation of the LSC.  As constituted with its network of grantees, contractors, alumni and friends the LSC cannot be reformed or limited to these arguably legitimate functions.
<P>
Instead, you must abolish it . . . reduce its funding to zero, send those who have perverted its original purpose and misused the tax money you have provided them packing . . . and start over.
<P>
If this Congress truly believes that tax monies should be used to provide legal assistance to those without  the funds needed to gain access to the civil justice system, you should design a system that will accomplish this goal, but don't think for a minute that the Legal Services Corporation can or will help you in the effort.
<P>
It's something you are going to have to do on your own.
<P>
Thank you.

	<i>Announcing A Public Campaign Against
	Select Day-Time Television Talk Shows</i><P>
	October 26, 1995<P><hr width="35%"></center><P>


First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman.  Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea.  It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure -- public pressure -- on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<P>
Earlier this year, <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Senator Lieberman</a> joined <a href="/empower/pr1026d.html">C. DeLores Tucker</a> of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc.  Today, we turn our attention to television.  Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television -- the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas.  Most of the criticisms are justified.  But this is not the worst of it.  The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified.  In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.  
<P>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment.  But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<P>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics.  The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men -- well, you get the idea.    
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about.  We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee.  The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency.  They are at the bottom of the television barrel.  Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it.  So here we are.    
<P>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed -- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote; and to petition men and women of good will -- producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers -- to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<P>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs?  In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust.  Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality?  Do the sponsors think not?  If so, why not?  
<P>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.  What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid.  This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift.  We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.  
<P>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about.  So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine.  We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.      
<P>
Let me conclude with a personal note.  Joe Lieberman is a Jew.  I am a Catholic.  Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image.  And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves.  Finally, what we are talking about is human dignity, the dignity of God's greatest creation -- and whether or not we still believe in it.
<P>

                                                                   <P>

When I joined with <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026.html">Delores Tucker</a> to speak out against the vile rap music that Time Warner was helping to produce, I was trying to give voice to the thousands of people I represent in Connecticut who are angry about the degradation of our culture and <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html"> the messages</a> the media is sending to our children.
<P>
The people I talk to in Connecticut are part of a revolution that is beginning throughout the country, <i>a movement that might be called the revolt of the revolted</I>. A growing number of Americans are sickened by the morass of sex, vulgarity and violence that increasingly dominates our electronic media; and they are disgusted by what they see as the entertainment industry's abandonment of basic standards of decency, as if anything goes. The result is <i>an increasingily debased culture that rejects, rather than retlects the basic values that most Americans share</i>.
<P>
This anger is felt most deeply by parents. I can't tell you how many mothers and fathers I've talked with who <i>look at the media not as a source of information or entertainment, but as a threat to the well-being o f their children</I>. These parents feel like they are locked in a struggle with powerful forces outside of their control to 'shape their children's values, a struggle; they feel they are losing.
<P>
Bill Bennett and I are back today to focus attention on one of the worst parts of America's entertainment culture -- the daytime television talk shows. There are more than 20 nationally syndicated talk programs on the air this fall, many of which can be seen here in the Washington area, as this chart displays. Afl er watching a number of these shows, and-learning more about the behavior of their hosts and producers, <i>it is clear that talk is indeed cheap, and too often demeaning, exploitative, perverted, divisive, or, at best, amoral</i>.
<P>
Those are strong words, but it is difficult to exaggerate the willingness of some of these shows to parade any and every pathology and dysfunction into our living rooms. The nation caught a glimpse of what these shows are about last March, when a guest on the "Jenny Jones" was set up to meet a gay secret admirer, and responded by killing that admirer with a shotgun. To show you just how extreme these programs are, in a few minutes we will display a videotape showing some typical segments.
<P>
For now I would call your attention to the article from Electroriic Media that we have made available. This diary of a 20-day period during the February sweeps documents how sex saturates these programs, the more bizarre the better. Just look at some of the titles; "I Use Sex to Get What I Want"; "Sex Caught on Tape"; "Mom's Dating a Boy Toy" and "Get Bigger Breasts or Else?'.
<P>
As you will see, there's good reason why many people call these shows pornographic: during the February sweeps, viewers were treated to at least five different shows that focused heavily on porn: among them, "Rolanda" showcased porn stars reuriniting with their first loves; "Jenny Jones" had men confronting their girlfriends who want to be porn stars; and "Richard Bey" pitted "Housewives vs. Strippers."
<P>
Why should we be so concerned about the content of these shows? One of the most compelling reasons is that millions of children and voung teens are watching trashy talk TV on a daily basis. In fact, according to one report, children aged 2 to 11 comprise six percent of the national viewing audience for talk shows, which translates to 650,000 kids alone regularly watching "Ricki Lake," one of the worst offenders.
<P>
There is no real scientific evidence available yet documenting the impact these shows have on young viewers. But a number of psychologists, child development specialists and media experts have voiced serious concern about the dangers posed by these shows. The constant confrontations and emotional violence children see on talk shows teach them a perverse way to solve personal problems, and suggests to them that is the way normal adults behave. Also, because of the powerful appeal of the sexual messages being sent to young viewers, these shows have enormous potential to act as the worst kind of sex educators.
<P>
But the impact of these programs extends far beyond children. Trashy TV talk shows are wildly distorting our perceptions of what are normal and acceptable forms of behavior, adding to the alreadv overloaded cultural dictionary that is helping. in Pat Alovnihan's words. to define desiancy down. The fixation these shows have with the dysfunctional, and the way in which those pathologies are treated, is having a "destructive" effect on the nation's mental health, according to mental health professionals Jeanne Heaton and Nona Wilson, the authors of "Tuning in Trouble." The "driveby pyschology" dispensed by so-called experts and the hosts themselves serves to mislead people into believing that serious mental health problems can be cured with platitudes and the psychobabble that is so commonplace on talk TV.
<P>
The proliferation of perversion on daytime television is affecting our entire society by the example it sets, pushing the envelope of civility and morality in a wav that drags the rest of the culture down with it. It is a vicious circle, fueled by the competition among talk show hosts to be the most sensational, and one with no apparent end in sight.
<P>
We do not want to demonize any one show, to overstate their influence, or to argue that these programs are destroying America as we know it. What we do want to get across is that taken as a whole, and combined with the obscene gangsta rap music kids are listening to, the hyperviolent videogames they're playing, as well as other television shows and movies, these talk shows are surely contributing to the loss of values, and the moral decay that so many Americans are concerned about. 
<P>
Much as we did with Time Warner's involvement with Interscope records, we are launching this campaign today to impress upon the major companies who are producing the bulk of the daytime talk show the damage trash TV talk is doing, and to call on them to exercise the greater responsibility. These corporations [include] a number of communications titans, including Gannett Newspapers, Paramount, Fox, Time Warner, CBS, Columbia-TriStar Studios, and the Tribune Company.
<P>
As we have said many times before, <i>we are not calling for censorship, simply better citizenship</I>. We want to remind these producers that they are members of a larger community, to which they have certain obligations. We also want to remind them- that because of their stature and their power their decisions carry weight. They can and should do-better, and that is our appeal.
<P>                                                                                 <P>

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Labor -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><br>
Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1058<br>
October 19, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor (DoL) has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government. Created in 1913, DoL is currently responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. This proliferating body of legislation and regulation covers a wide range of workplace activities for nearly 10 million employers and well over 100 million workers, presenting a barrier to the formation of firms and their ability to create jobs.1<p>The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. If implemented, such reforms could save America's taxpayers $10.5 billion from 1996 to the year 2000 alone. The primary objectives of this effort should be to: 
<p><ul>
<li> Reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety; 
<p>
<li> Improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
</ul><p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing this Cabinet-level department and moving certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
The Department of Labor's programs are organized into seven main functional areas: <p>
1) Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES),
<p>
2) Job Training Programs,
<p>
3) Workplace Health and Safety,
<p>
4) Private Pension Protection,
<p>
5) Employment Standards,
<p>
6) Economic Statistics, and
<p>
7) Labor Union Oversight. 
<p>
UI and ES form the largest functional area, accounting for around 75 percent of DoL's budget (set at $25.5 billion for FY 1995). The next largest budget function, Job Training Programs, accounts for around 20 percent. 
<p>
Examining these seven areas reveals that the administration and enforcement of American labor laws can and should be reformed, both to achieve the department's underlying objectives of workforce protection, including workplace health and safety, and to reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations. To do this, Congress should take the following steps:
<p><ul>
<li> <b>Devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services to the states.</b> This would enable states to decrease the duration of unemployment, reduce payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution should include the Veterans Employment Service, labor market information projects, the one-stop career system concept, and the administration of unemployment insurance. Congress also should repeal the Federal Extended Benefit program and provide incentives for states to overhaul and integrate their employment services with a view to reducing the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance. Any remaining federal administrative functions should be transferred to the Treasury Department. 
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant.</b> Congress should combine these programs, including the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, Indian and Native American Employment and Training, and Youth Fair Chance, into a block grant attached to the new welfare block grant recently passed by Congress. This would eliminate a maze of categorical programs and provide states the flexibility they need to develop programs that effectively reduce welfare dependency. States should be required only to focus these resources on means-tested job placement assistance and conduct control group evaluations of their effectiveness. Federal target and categorical requirements should be removed. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant.</b> This new block grant for job placement assistance and training would include such things as dislocated worker programs, School-to-Work programs, and Adult Technology Learning programs. Even the Department of Labor recognizes that a block grant would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars.2  The determination of target groups should be left to the discretion of the states. Because the effectiveness of today's training programs is questionable,3 total funding for this block grant should be cut by 50 percent and frozen until scientific studies can prove they are effective. In carrying out these studies, states should be required to have at least one ongoing control group evaluation on programs funded from the block grant. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).</b> This reform is needed to "refocus the [federal] responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."4  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.5  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,6 to maintain and continually improve workplace safety. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner. Congress also should spin off the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined by a department subject to political influence.  
<p>
<li><b> Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration.</b> Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across three departments.7  Combining the agencies responsible for this oversight would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. In addition, Congress should spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, fund the PBGC separately, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.8 <p><li><b>Repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations.</b> Congress should streamline labor regulation by eliminating the heavy burden of outdated or restrictive rules. This means, for example, nullifying Executive Order 11246 and related affirmative action regulations affecting federal contractors and subcontractors; eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP); repealing the Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act, as well as Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; reforming the Fair Labor Standards Act; and strengthening the Portal to Portal Act of 1947. Congress then should transfer all remaining functions of the Wage and Hour Division to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li><b> Combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau within a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics.</b> A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. It also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Statistical functions of other departments also should be housed within the new bureau to ensure that the government's data collection efforts are insulated from politics.
<p>
<li><b> Close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (Striker Replacement).</b> Government promotion of high-performance workplaces actually serves only as corporate welfare and a training subsidy for unions. These activities already are conducted in the private sector through business associations and unions. Congress should transfer labor union oversight and investigative functions, including those in the Office of the Inspector General, to the Justice Department. 
</ul><p>
The 104th Congress has held a number of hearings and introduced a variety of bills to reform and update America's labor laws, and it continues to reassess dozens of labor policy issues that have been neglected for years.9  This year's budget process also has provided Congress with a vehicle for reform. Aside from reforming and consolidating job training programs, the Administration's proposed budget did little to "reinvent" DoL. President Clinton proposed to raise the department's budget authority by over 14 percent and its full-time staff by 304.10  Congress appropriately rejected the President's budget and is proceeding with its own plan to reform the administration of federal labor policy through the budget process. <p>The House recently voted to reduce FY 1996 DoL discretionary spending by 13.8 percent. It also instituted several important reforms. For example, the House budget prohibits funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, prohibits the issuance of two unnecessarily burdensome OSHA regulations on ergonomics and fall protection, and bars DoL from promoting "economically targeted investments" (ETIs) by private pension plans. The House also is planning to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
The Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to reduce DoL discretionary spending for FY 1996 by 12.6 percent. Although the Senate's DoL budget prohibits implementation of the striker replacement executive order, it does not contain the House's OSHA regulatory provisions or the prohibition on promoting ETIs. Differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out in conference committee.
<p>
As the following study demonstrates, the U.S. Department of Labor has gone far beyond its original mandate to become a burdensome and feared regulatory agency that presents significant barriers to creating jobs and increasing real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace requirements makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy of American business. Congress should do what the Clinton Administration promised but failed to do -- reform this overgrown and intrusive bureaucracy. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor was created by Congress in 1913 in response to pressure from organized labor. Its goals, according to the statute, were to "foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage-earners, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."  Initially, DoL consisted of four bureaus transferred from the old Department of Commerce and Labor:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly the Bureau of Labor), the Bureau of Immigration, the Bureau of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau. These bureaus reflected the department's original focus:  collecting information and publishing reports on employment, wages, and working conditions; reviewing the effects of immigration on the job market; and monitoring the use of child labor.
<p>
In 1918, during World War I, Congress established the War Labor Administration (WLA) to insure adequate industrial production and foster labor peace in defense production industries. The WLA set policies on wages, hours, and working conditions. It recruited women and minorities to work in defense industries. It also sought to encourage better workplace race relations, promote worker safety and health, and address other employment-related problems that might hinder war production. Although Congress moved quickly after the Armistice to end its activities, the WLA's initiatives embodied ideas of the Progressive movement that later would spawn the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, and War on Poverty. 
<p>
What began as primarily an advocacy, educational, and administrative department over time became a regulatory and enforcement agency. Since 1918 Congress has expanded DoL's regulatory functions considerably, often because of political pressure from social reform movements or organized labor. For instance: 
<p><blockquote>
	During the 1920s, in response to the women's suffrage movement, the Women's Bureau was added to promote the status of and job opportunities for women. DoL also implemented the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 that ended U.S. free immigration policy by imposing a quota system. 
<p>
	Confronted with the depression of the 1930s, Congress passed several laws to protect workers from economic change. The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted explicitly to protect white unionized workers on federal construction sites from competition by low-skilled nonunion workers, chiefly blacks and Hispanics. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Act established the Unemployment Insurance system. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandated a minimum wage, overtime requirements, and child labor restrictions.
<p>
	In the late 1940s, DoL underwent many organizational changes. Its immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the postwar years, the failure of DoL to mediate a wave of strikes prompted Congress to transfer the department's labor conciliation functions to the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and veterans' reemployment rights became DoL's responsibility as the Defense Department was scaled back. In 1959, concern over the influence of organized crime and other union abuses led Congress to pass the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to oversee the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions.
<p>
	In the early 1960s, unfounded concern about the impact of technology on the labor force, combined with the War on Poverty, resulted in passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Ten years later, spending on federal job training programs was increased significantly by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 reduced the enormous cost of CETA but did not improve the effectiveness of federal job training programs. 
<p>
	Since the 1960s, pressure from the civil rights movement has led to a variety of equal employment opportunity laws and redundant presidential executive orders to protect certain groups of individuals -- women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly -- such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Executive Order 11246 as amended.11<p>	In the 1970s, DoL's regulatory and enforcement role expanded dramatically with passage of the landmark Occupational Health and Safety Act and again when responsibility for mine safety and health was transferred from the Department of the Interior. 
<p>
	Concern over the negative impact of federal trade policies on workers prompted Congress to pass the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act in 1974. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was enacted in 1988 to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to workers and their communities. 
<p>
	During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress has enacted various employee benefits and protections, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.

Since 1960, the expansion of federally mandated benefits and worker protections has begun to take its toll on business formation and job creation.12  In 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, legally required benefits accounted for 32 percent of all benefits paid to workers on an hourly basis.13  Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are shifted largely to workers in the form of lower real wages.14  Further, the increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to businesses of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.15  Although well intentioned, these requirements add to the cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, and how long to retain that worker. The rise in nonwage labor costs is important because it is one of the forces leading employers to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.16<p>Ironically, organized labor has been so successful in persuading Congress to legislate matters that once were the province of collective bargaining that they have nearly driven themselves out of business. And with each Congress, Washington has placed more and more requirements and restrictions on employers and the labor market.17  This growing regulatory burden has made DoL inspectors as feared as IRS auditors and most small businesses very cautious about hiring additional workers.<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>Today's labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed since most of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. Only a fundamental rethinking of DoL and its functions can lead to the formulation of a proper and truly effective federal labor policy. The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
<p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by eliminating the DoL as a Cabinet department. Certain key national functions should be carried out by sub-Cabinet agencies or transferred to other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
<b>I. REFORM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE.</b><p>
Over two-thirds of DoL's budget is consumed by the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.18  This program has two main objectives:  to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to recently unemployed workers, and help stabilize the economy during recessions. The UC program is financed by a Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) of 0.8 percent19 of the first $7,000 in wages and state unemployment insurance taxes that average 0.9 percent of total wages. The revenue raised by FUTA is used to administer Unemployment Insurance (UI) and maintain a system of Employment Service (ES) offices. Portions of FUTA revenues also fund the federal half of the Extended Benefits Program and federal loans to depleted state accounts. State UI tax revenues fund state UI benefit payments and the state half of the Extended Benefits Program. At the end of fiscal 1995, state accounts in the UI Trust Fund had a balance of $35.6 billion. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, any positive balance in the UI Trust Fund is used to fund other federal programs. General revenues are used to fund federal unemployment benefit programs and allowances such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. 
<p>
When the UC program was enacted in 1935, Congress intended that it be a federal-state partnership. The federal government was to set broad parameters, provide adequate and equitable funding for state administration, and oversee state law and operations to ensure compliance and conformity. The states were to be responsible for carrying out the program while complying with all federal laws and regulations, as well as their own state requirements. However, the federal government has used the state conformity process to convert the basic program philosophy into a more acceptable ideology and frequently upsets the balance of administrative funding and workloads by dictating that states absorb the costs of administering additional programs.20<p>Over the past decade, federal budget constraints have had a detrimental effect on services provided to unemployed workers by the state UI system and ES offices. Even though FUTA revenues collected for UI and ES administration have been more than sufficient, Congress continues to extend the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax on jobs and limit UI and ES administration appropriations.21  This masks the true size of the federal deficit. The federal government actually uses the UI system to fund programs that lead to longer periods of unemployment for workers22 and unnecessarily high payroll taxes. This is contrary to the primary purpose of the UI system23and reduces real wages.24<p>The UC program should be reformed to limit the federal role, as Congress originally intended, and to restore responsibility and accountability to the states. Studies show that states can decrease the duration of unemployment and thereby reduce payroll taxes and increase jobs.25 <p>What Congress Should Do:<p><b>Devolve financing and funding for the UI system and Employment Service to the states. </b><p>Congress should repeal the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax and increase the FUTA offset26 from the current 90 percent to 100 percent if a state conforms with federal law. States should be allowed to collect one UI tax for administration and benefits. Each state would be responsible, and accountable, to employers for UI payroll tax dollars and for the administration and effectiveness of the UI/ES system. Receipts from the single state UI tax should be deposited into each state's UI account, maintained by the Department of the Treasury. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Wagner-Peyser Act and amend FUTA to require states to establish public employment offices in labor market areas designated by state legislatures. </b>
<p>
Each state should have the flexibility to deliver job placement assistance in ways that meet the needs of its employers and job seekers. However, states should be required to ensure reasonable access to services for workers and to register for work all eligible claimants who are not temporarily laid off. Reform must provide incentives for states to explore ways to integrate employment services and reduce the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. These incentives should include opening up the job placement assistance offered through the state ES offices to private competition and other UI experiments.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the federal extended benefit program and the federal extended unemployment compensation account (EUCA). </b>
<p>
Funds in the EUCA should be transferred to state UI accounts based upon each state's relative share of covered employment. The 1992 amendments that made it easier for states to trigger extended benefits (EB)27 should be repealed. The 1992 change made it easier for states to qualify for extended benefits and encouraged individuals to stay on unemployment benefits even when jobs were available. By basing the trigger for extended benefits on a state's total unemployment rate rather than its insured unemployment rate, Congress also broadened considerably the number of those who can qualify for extended benefits. Those who argued for this change claimed that basing benefits on the insured rate meant that many of the unemployed were not receiving benefits and that the program therefore was not working as intended. But, as pointed out at the time by Labor Department officials, this gap between the number of people who were unemployed and the number collecting benefits is normal and is an intended purpose of the program.28<p><b>Eliminate the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), which is used to loan money to insolvent state UI accounts. </b>
<p>
 Funds in the FUA come from a portion of the FUTA payroll tax on jobs.29  The federal government uses the FUA to provide loans to states that have depleted their UI accounts during severe recessions. When the FUA is not being used for state loans, the surplus that builds up is used to fund other government programs and amounts to a tax on jobs to reduce the deficit. At the end of September 1995, there will be a $7.4 billion surplus in the FUA. The FUA should be eliminated and its funds transferred to state UI accounts. States that deplete their UI accounts should be able to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury rather than from a surplus account maintained to offset the federal deficit.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and the Local Veteran Employment Representative Program and amend FUTA to incorporate the veteran preferences already in Title 38 of the U.S. Code (Veterans Benefits). </b>
<p>
The administrative efficiency of ES offices could be improved significantly by repealing barriers to the integration of veterans' services with other employment services. As the Vice President's National Performance Review noted in calling for the removal of barriers,30 DoL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service provides for state-employed, federally funded employment specialists to serve veterans in local state employment service offices. However, staff are legally prohibited from helping non-veterans. "So, if a local office is crowded with non-veterans," points out the NPR, "these specialists cannot help out -- even if they have no veterans to serve."  Employment Service staff would be used more efficiently and the public better served by eliminating this requirement.
<p>
<b>Eliminate Trade Adjustment Assistance. </b>
<p>
This program funds payments for unemployment benefits, allowances, and training costs to workers affected by foreign trade imports under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA). In addition, the TAA provides for payment of similar benefits to workers adversely affected by NAFTA. As well intentioned as this may be, workers who can prove they lost their jobs because of foreign competition or NAFTA should not receive government benefits that exceed the assistance available to those laid off due to domestic competition.31  In any case, the department's own auditors have concluded that the TAA has not worked as intended, and the new NAFTA-TAA program likely will meet the same outcome:  Instead of providing retraining help, the TAA program has turned into a compensation program.32  Funding for these ineffective programs should be eliminated.<p><b>Permit state legislators to determine ES administrative budgets, payroll taxes, and UI benefits under limited federal guidelines. </b><p> The UI system is an experience-rated and employer-paid payroll tax. It was set up with specific objectives and a designated tax as its funding source. Federal proposals to combine the funding sources for the ES program and job training programs are unwise. Job placement services have different goals, populations, and outcomes from those of training programs. ES offices are supposed to get unemployment claimants back to work quickly, thereby ensuring that employer taxes are as low as possible. Job training programs often do not share that objective. Suggesting that FUTA payroll tax funds be used for anything other than paying unemployment benefits and funding state job placement assistance is merely a backdoor way to introduce a payroll tax for training. Devolving ES funding removes the potential for Congress to dilute the mission of the system and divert funding for other purposes.
The limited federal guidelines should include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>	The single state UI tax for both administration and benefits should be experience rated.
<p>
<li>	Funds should be used only for program administration and weekly benefits and should be capped at levels necessary for proper and efficient administration during periods of high unemployment.
<p>
<li>States should be required to continue cooperative and financial contracts to administer the interstate benefit program.
<p>
<li>	Federal funding for the administration and payment of federal employee UI benefits, military separations, and disaster unemployment programs should be deposited in state UI accounts as needed.
<p>
<li> Federal oversight should be limited to determining whether state laws conform with federal requirements.
</ul><p>
<b>II. CONSOLIDATE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANTS.</b><p>
The current maze of discretionary job training programs accounts for another substantial portion of DoL's budget. Many DoL programs overlap programs in other departments. The General Accounting Office has identified 163 employment training assistance programs across the federal government, spending about $20 billion per year.33  Moreover, "this fragmented system wastes resources and confuses and frustrates clients, employers, and administrators."  For FY 1995, thirty of these programs, totaling $5.8 billion, were funded through DoL.34  The Employment and Training Administration, the primary DoL agency responsible for job training programs, is run by 1,529 employees and accounts for 50 percent of DoL's discretionary budget.35<p>President Clinton, as part of his "Middle Class Bill of Rights" initiative, has proposed significant funding increases in his FY 1996 budget.36  For example, DoL proposed to increase funding for the School-to-Work program by 63 percent and funding for the One-Stop Career Center program by 100 percent. But the Clinton Administration also agrees that federal job training programs are fragmented, overlapping, and lack accountability. Part of the President's initiative is to consolidate and reform 70 job training programs. 
<P>
Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must first ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work?37 <p>Job training programs, although well intentioned, have not raised the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter what happens when individuals neglect their first 12 years of primary education.38  The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much too late. What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening curricula, and completing high school. Reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform federal job training programs. The House recently passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (H.R. 1617), introduced by Representative Howard McKeon (R-CA). The Senate also recently passed the Workforce Development Act of 1995 (S. 143), introduced by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS). Although both bills improve current law by consolidating some of the federal job training programs into state block grants and increasing accountability, major changes need to be made in conference.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Consolidate more programs into the block grants.</b>
<p>
S. 143 consolidates only around 80 of the 163 federal employment and training programs and reduces spending by 15 percent. H.R. 1617 consolidates even fewer programs. H.R. 1617 does not include Job Corps, the most expensive federal job training program, or vocational rehabilitation programs. S. 143 marginally reforms Job Corps, but does not consolidate it in the state block grant. However, S. 143 does include vocational rehabilitation programs. 
<p>
 Congress can improve both bills by consolidating the Job Corps, vocational rehabilitation, and the Senior Community Service Employment program into the state block grant.
<p>
<b>Provide maximum flexibility to the states in designing their programs. </b><p>
Overly prescriptive federal requirements should be removed. State and local elected officials are in the best position to allocate block grant funds. There is tremendous diversity among and within the states. What Washington prescribes as the solution for problems in urban areas often does not fit well in places like Utah or Vermont. Prescriptive solutions and fixed allocations of funds will work in some places, but will also be the worst possible solution in many others.39  State and local workforce development boards should be optional, not mandatory. Continuing School-to-Work activities also should be optional and not mandatory.<p>Further, states should have the discretion to transfer funds between the welfare and job training block grants for the purpose of implementing work requirements and job placement assistance programs. This would provide additional flexibility to states and eliminate micromanagement by the federal government. 
<p>
<b>Strengthen accountability with control group evaluations.</b>
<p>
Each state should have at least one control group evaluation of its job training programs ongoing at any given time. Such scientific evaluation should be conducted by using experimental and control groups chosen by scientific random assignment and, at a minimum, should determine whether job training and job placement programs effectively raise the hourly wage rates of individuals receiving training through such programs. Each state should report annually on the status and results of its control group evaluations.
<p>
The addition of state control group evaluations would quickly build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job training programs. Few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluation.40  As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."41  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training. Historically, performance measures and benchmarks have been the more common but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. The findings from performance measure methods, particularly the negative ones, have been easily manipulated and explained way. Without a requirement for rigorous, control group studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>
<b>Scale back the labor market information system.</b>
<p>
Initial labor market information system (LMIS) activities should be restricted to conducting a feasibility study, developing LMIS options, and estimating the cost of those options. The current LMIS provisions in both H.R. 1617 and S. 143 immediately plunge the federal and state governments down an untested and expensive path that may not be feasible. Further, mandating states to create a LMIS at the substate level for which no data current exist will be extremely expensive. The initial information for the labor market information system should be restricted to data readily available from the Census Bureau and other federal and state agencies.
<p>
Further, employers should not be mandated to provide any information. All employer provided information on job openings, application procedures, employment requirements, wages, benefits, and hiring patterns should be strictly voluntary. Any information supplied by either individuals or employers should also be immune from the legal process and should not, without the consent of the individual or employer, be used for any judicial or administrative proceeding. 
<p>
<b>III. REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY.</b>42<p>Although Congress intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.43  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards.44  Significant reform is required to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health and "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."45  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review correctly recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely, given the federal budget situation. A new approach is required to increase workplace health and safety and balance the budget. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. 
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.46  In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA and MSHA spending by 8.9 percent. The House recently voted to increase funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 19.2 percent while reducing overall OSHA and MSHA spending for FY 1996 by 12.5 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 5.0 percent funding decrease for OSHA compliance assistance and a 3.1 percent overall reduction. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively uses the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Significantly reform OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is implemented. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Reform OSHA's regulatory process. <br>
Because OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.47  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. Development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>
<li>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.<br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces, but the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health. 
<p>
<li> Give first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.<br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.<br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.48  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p></ul>
<b>Merge the Mine Safety and Health Administration with a reformed OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.49  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
<p><ul>
<li> Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the memoranda of understanding that currently exist between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
<li> The Heritage Foundation estimates that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.50  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need to write two separate health regulations for the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p></ul>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.51  Each underground mine will be inspected thoroughly at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of inspecting mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>Establish the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency that functions as a national safety and health standard-setting agency. </b>
<p>
Establishing health and safety compliance programs can be extremely costly and complicated. For employers operating in multiple states, where requirements vary from state to state, developing compliance programs can be almost impossible. There is no justification for different requirements in different states. The risk posed by certain hazards may vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace, but not from state to state. Therefore, different states do not need different requirements. National workplace health and safety standards should be developed exclusively at the federal level.
<p>
National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined in a department that has been, and continues too be, subject to political influence. Independence and objectivity are crucial. The potential costs and benefits are too high for politics to play any role. The "new" OSHA should be a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. Its members would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The board would be responsible for standards promulgation, oversight of a peer-review process, and issuance of compliance directives. It also would report its activities to Congress twice a year and be subject to congressional oversight hearings.
<p>
<b>IV. REFORM PRIVATE PENSION PROTECTION.</b>
<p>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in employee pension plans that provide workers with retirement benefits promised by their employers. The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is the DoL agency that administers and enforces ERISA. ERISA protects the integrity of assets by requiring administrators of private pension and welfare plans52 to comply with strict fiduciary responsibility standards.53  It also requires administrators to provide participants with easily understood summaries of their plans, to file those summaries with PWBA, and to report annually on the financial operation of plans and the bonding of persons charged with handling funds and assets. Jurisdiction is shared by the PWBA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Generally, PWBA has authority over Title I of ERISA,54 the IRS has authority over Title II,55and PBGC has authority over Title IV.56
<p>
PWBA is responsible for overseeing 720,000 pension plans and 4.5 million health and welfare plans in the private sector. ERISA-covered private pension plans cover over 88 million working Americans and their dependents and hold approximately $2 trillion in assets. Over 100 million workers are covered by employer-sponsored health and welfare plans. Three-quarters of PWBA's $65 million budget and 582 FTEs (full-time equivalent employees) is dedicated to enforcement focused on compliance with fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. PWBA audits plans and conducts criminal and civil investigations. In 1993, the government carried out 6,033 investigations. 
<p>
President Clinton proposed to increase PWBA's budget by 17.1 percent. The House recently voted to reduce PWBA's FY 1996 spending by 7.5 percent and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a 5.2 percent reduction. The House budget bill also prohibits the Department of Labor from promoting economically targeted investments with respect to private pension plans covered by ERISA. It specifically prohibits both the implementation of last year's PWBA Interpretive Bulletin and the funding of any Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse. The Senate Appropriations Committee deleted this House provision.
<p>
The primary focus of ERISA legislation this year is health insurance reform. In the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) has introduced the ERISA Targeted Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 995), which would provide for health insurance portability, increased participation, improved plan solvency, and other consumer protections for workers. Senator Kassebaum has introduced the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028), the provisions of which are a subset of H.R. 995. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee.
<p>
A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions have been introduced in Congress. The most comprehensive bill, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 (H.R. 2037 and S. 1006), has been introduced by Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator David Pryor (D-AR). These identical bills would create alternative methods for satisfying nondiscrimination provisions, repeal the family aggregation provision, repeal 5-year income averaging for lump-sum distributions, repeal the $5,000 exclusion of employees' death benefits, simplify the method for taxing annuity distributions under certain employer plans, and target access to pension plans for small employers.
<p>
The House has passed H.R. 1594, introduced by Representative John Saxton (R-NJ), to place restrictions on the promotion of economically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit plans by the Department of Labor and other federal agencies. A similar bill (S. 774) has been introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL).
<p><blockquote>
	Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. Transferring PWBA to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. Combining PWBA with HHS also would be a good first step toward privatizing Social Security.57
</blockquote><P>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Abolish the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse.</b>
<p>
In 1994, DoL established the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse (ETIC) to provide information on investment opportunities to pension plan managers. This program is DoL's way of encouraging pension plans to invest in areas of the economy that bureaucrats and politicians feel are underfinanced by private capital markets. It is misguided and jeopardizes the safety of pension plan assets.58  Tax dollars should not be used as another form of corporate welfare to market public investment choices to pension plan managers. If an investment, public or private, provides a good opportunity to pension plan managers, they will allocate plan funds accordingly. 
<p>
<b> Eliminate the Office of Inspector General's independent investigative authority.</b>
<p>
The experience and expertise for investigating fraud and abuse involving employee benefit plans reside in the PWBA. The existence of competing enforcement authorities within the DoL creates confusion and leads to duplication of effort. In recent years, PWBA has increased its efforts to bring criminal cases. As a result, PWBA investigators not only have expertise regarding how plans operate, but also know how to work criminal cases.
<p>
<b>Remove ESOPs from Title I (fiduciary standards) of ERISA.</b>
<p>
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are hybrid benefit plans with two often competing goals. They are designed to increase employee ownership in companies and thereby improve productivity. They also are treated as retirement plans, with participants allowed to defer taxes on the value of their stock until it is withdrawn at retirement. Although ESOPs are governed by ERISA's fiduciary rules, several tax code sections give them special treatment not available to other retirement plans. Because the nature and financing of ESOPs are not always compatible with ERISA's rules, PWBA has struggled to accommodate ESOPs under the rules without damaging the fiduciary requirements that generally work well for other retirement plans. The result has been confusing and complicated rulings and legal standards. Congressional intent clearly has been to foster employee ownership. Trying to incorporate ESOPs into an Act designed to protect retirement income will only undermine this goal.
<p>
<b>Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to the Social Security Administration, spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance. </b>
<p>
This would combine the agencies responsible for oversight of public and private retirement programs and result in more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a semi-independent, wholly owned government corporation modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and guided by a board of directors. Congress should fund the PBGC separately and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.59 
<p>

<b> V. ELIMINATE OBSOLETE WORKPLACE STANDARDS.</b>
<p>
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) administers and directs programs under a variety of federal labor laws and executive orders. The Wage and Hour Division: <p><ul>
<li>Administers and enforces federal minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act; 
<p>
<li>Determines prevailing wage rates for federal contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts;
<p>
<li>Registers farm labor contractors and enforces worker protections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; and
<p>
<li> Enforces provisions and restrictions of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. </ul>
<p>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs administers and enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended, which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in hiring. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers the three basic federal workers' compensation laws:  the Federal Employees Compensation Act, Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and Black Lung Benefits Act.
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's major labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but America's labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. The heavy burden of outdated and restrictive workplace rules reduces job opportunities and real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and requirements now makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers and is one of the forces leading employers to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor. 
<p>
The House of Representatives recently voted to reduce ESA's FY 1996 spending by 12.2 percent.60  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 9.9 percent reduction. Both bills prohibit funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, and the House plans to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
A number of bills to reform America's labor laws also have been introduced in Congress.61  The House recently passed the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act (H.R. 743) to allow employers to create employee involvement committees. A similar bill (S. 295) has been introduced in the Senate by Nancy Kassebaum.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Nullify Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all affirmative action provisions in federal law.</b>
<p>
Executive Order 11246, as amended,62 and its implementing regulations prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity for protected groups. Contractors must develop a written plan covering each of their establishments that includes remedial steps to correct underutilization of available women and minorities.
<p>
Federal contractors and subcontractors already must comply with existing civil rights laws without the executive order. Laws requiring non-discrimination in employment are enforced through agencies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice. There are other, more equitable ways to expand employment opportunities for all Americans without requiring preferential hiring simply because individuals belong to certain groups. In addition, the regulations to implement Executive Order 11246 impose 20.4 million hours of paperwork (9,795 full-time, year-round workers) on federal contractors and subcontractors, the single largest DoL paperwork requirement.
<p>
A recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action concluded that "the federal government can no longer make decisions based on the race of the individual except when there is a compelling governmental interest."63  Concurring, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction."  Further, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."
<P>
<b>Repeal the Davis-Bacon and related Acts and the Service Contract Act.</b>
<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs.64  Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded. This year's budget process may be the only real opportunity to put an end to this Depression-era law that contributes to racial discrimination, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If only the facts were at issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would be repealed. However, repeal is threatened once again by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve their generous subsidies. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American workers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<p>
The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost of federal service contracts by as much as $500 million per year and, like Davis-Bacon, creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled entry-level workers, who tend to be poor and minorities. DoL has long been criticized for the way it operates under this law. Despite two amendments,65 the SCA continues to suffer from statutory ambiguity, administrative problems, arbitrary requirements, and capricious enforcement.66  The General Accounting Office has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's "inability to administer the act efficiently and effectively" and because "it is impractical, in our opinion, to make 'prevailing wage' determinations under the act in a consistently equitable manner."67  Outdated by extensions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to service workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic burden that should be repealed.
<p>
<b>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options.</b>
<p>
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers. However, in today's economy where both parents likely are working, its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than help. The FLSA deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home. For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 35 hours one week  in order to attend a child's parent-teacher conference, in exchange for working 45 hours the following week, either must forgo five hours of pay or have an employer willing to pay overtime the second week. Congress should extend to private workers the same freedom that federal employees have -- flextime -- and enable employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options to their workers.68  
<p>
<b>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions on the ability for employers to create employee involvement structures.</b>
<p>
Employee involvement (EI) structures are a way to involve workers in business operations to improve productivity, safety, and customer service. Under current law, however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly legal between employers and employees are those that occur in traditional collective bargaining arrangements. Employers can listen to their nonunion employees but cannot respond to their views without risking litigation and significant legal costs. Further, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations noted that the most legally vulnerable EI structures are "those that take a broader, more systemic approach to participation that the evidence suggests have the greatest long-term, positive effects on economic performance."69  Congress should reform the National Labor Relations Act to exempt EI structures formed to address issues of quality, productivity, safety, and customer service.  
<p>
<b>Transfer immigrant worker oversight and enforcement functions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</b>
<p>
In the late 1940s, DoL's immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then, the federal government has shifted some of its immigration responsibilities to employers70 and added new DoL enforcement requirements.71  Responsibility for immigration policy once again is fragmented. Transferring DoL's immigration functions to the INS would combine the responsibility for federal immigration programs in one agency and facilitate more efficient immigration policy coordination.
<p>
<b>Transfer any remaining ESA programs to more appropriate departments or sub-Cabinet agencies.</b>
<p>
Legal enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act should be transferred to the Justice Department. Responsibility for federal workers' compensation laws and black lung benefits -- both primarily health-related income assistance programs -- should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Responsibility for all employment discrimination complaints should be consolidated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
<b>VI. GIVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.</b><p>
The American statistical system is one of the most decentralized data-producing systems in the world. Eleven specifically statistical federal agencies spend more that $1 billion annually. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has found more than 70 individual agencies spending more than $500,000 a year for statistical activities and estimates that the federal government spent at almost $2.7 billion in FY 1994 for statistical operations.72
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary federal data-gathering agency in the broad field of labor economics and prices. It has no enforcement or regulatory functions and operates somewhat independently from DoL. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data relating to employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor market. It also publishes data on consumer and producer prices and workplace health and safety. Most of the data are collected by voluntary surveys conducted by the BLS and the Bureau of the Census, or on a cooperative basis with state agencies.
<p>
Change is needed. The current structure of the federal statistical system is inefficient and ineffective.73  The problems with the U.S. statistical system result directly or indirectly from fragmentation across the federal government. The system has neither the advantages that come from centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong coordination of a decentralized system. As currently organized, it will be hard-pressed to meet the data demands of a technologically advanced and increasingly global economy.
<p>
The House recently voted to reduce BLS spending for fiscal year 1996 by 1.3 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 6.1 percent reduction. Both bills double the amount appropriated for revising the consumer price index (CPI).
<p>


What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Transfer the BLS into a new sub-Cabinet Bureau of National Statistics along with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</b>
<p>
Consolidating the Census Bureau, the BLS, and the BEA in a centralized system is "the most effective solution to the problems of the federal statistical system."74  A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. The BNS also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Incorporating the Bureau of Economic Analysis into the BNS is essential if the new bureau is to influence priorities for the broad array of statistical information required for the national income and product accounts. Reforming the system will assure a much better use of the tax dollars currently being spent on statistics.
<p>
Three major concerns need to be addressed. 
<p>
1) The BNS should be run by an independent Board of Directors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a fixed term similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
<p>
2) To ensure that the public's response to voluntary surveys is not jeopardized, the BNS should be given complete legal confidentiality for all information collection activity. Data sharing arrangements with other agencies, for statistical purposes only, could be maintained under carefully controlled procedures approved and administered by the BNS Board.
<p>
3) Any administrative savings should stay within the agency to improve the quality and quantity of the nation's statistical information. Providing accurate information to the public and their state and local representatives is an important function of the federal government. 
<p>
<b> VII. ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE.</b><p>
The Office of the American Workplace (OAW), created in 1993 by Secretarial Order, is responsible for administering and directing discretionary workplace programs that encourage the development of "high performance" workplaces.75  OAW also is responsible for administering statutory programs to certify employee protections of various federally sponsored transportation programs, overseeing the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions, and assisting unions in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently has assigned OAW the task of implementing President Clinton's executive order prohibiting the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors. 
<p>
OAW carries out these functions through two offices:  the Office of Workplace Programs (OWP) and the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). In FY 1995, of OAW's total budget authority of $31.4 million and 400 employees, $7.4 million went to OWP and $24.0 million to OLMS. For FY 1996, the President requested $41.8 million, or 33 percent more. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have voted to eliminate OWP and transfer OLMS to DoL's Employment Standards Administration. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Workplace Programs. </b>
<P>
In addition to setting up a clearinghouse for information on high performance workplaces, OWP provides funds to unions to train labor leaders on what constitutes a high performance workplace. However well intentioned this may be, the federal government should not subsidize businesses and unions to teach them about the concept of "high performance" workplaces. This is more appropriately a function of business associations, chambers of commerce, and labor unions themselves. It is corporate and union welfare and should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Labor-Management Standards.</b>
<p>
Nor should American tax dollars subsidize unions to "assist" them in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. These functions should be eliminated, the number of full-time equivalent positions in OLMS should be reduced significantly, and OLMS field offices should be eliminated. The investigative and union oversight functions of the office should be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Department of Justice.76
<p>
<b>Repeal Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. </b>
<p>
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration Act of 1964 gives public transit the most restrictive labor environment in America. To receive federal funds, local public transit agencies must pay employees up to six years of severance pay if their jobs are eliminated as a result of efficiency improvements. No other workers enjoy such special privilege. Should public transit agencies pursue service improvements that lead to fewer workers, their mandated 13(c) liability can surpass the federal funds they receive.77  Although many local governments are trying to improve their public transportation systems through competitive contracting and allowing private sector suppliers to operate, Section 13(c) discourages or blocks these efforts. 
<p>
Section 13(c) also adds to public transit costs and discourages efficiency by giving labor unions special privileges. Before a public transit agency can receive a federal grant, DoL must certify that special protective arrangements for local transit workers have been made. DoL generally interprets this to require negotiation of special labor agreements between the public transit agency and its union.
<p>
Public transit agencies want desperately to improve service and lower costs. At the same time, however, unnecessarily high labor costs make them unable to withstand a long period without federal funding. Section 13(c) has created this "Catch 22" for most public transit authorities and should be repealed. 
<p>
<b> VIII. STREAMLINE DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT.</b><P>
The Departmental Management (DM) appropriation provides funding for a number of different programs that manage, set policy, and oversee its implementation at DoL. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Solicitor's office, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Civil Rights office, and the Women's Bureau.
<P>
In FY 1995, DM's total budget authority was about $155 million and 2,548 employees. Over half the budget, $82 million, went to legal services and adjudication, and $26 million went to executive direction. For FY 1996, the President requested $173.1 million, or almost 12 percent more. The House recently voted to reduce DM spending for FY 1996 by 13.2 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 7.6 percent reduction. The House substantially downsized the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, noting in its report that the bureau's activities are primarily discretionary and could be carried out by the Office of the Trade Representative or the State Department. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), the Women's Bureau, the Civil Rights office, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. </b>
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Women's Bureau, Civil Rights office, and National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee either duplicate existing federal functions or perform unneeded functions. 
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs coordinates the Department's international responsibilities, including relations with international organizations, estimating the impact of trade proposals, and ensuring compliance with worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law. These functions duplicate those carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.
<p>
The purpose of the Women's Bureau is to promote "the welfare of wage earning women and [seek] to improve their working conditions, to increase their efficiency and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."78  The mission of the Department of Labor, including the Secretary, is to promote the employment opportunities of all Americans. There is no need for a separate bureau devoted to women, just as there are none devoted to other minorities, such as African Americans, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. 
<p>
The Civil Rights office ensures compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other regulatory nondiscrimination provisions in programs receiving financial assistance from DoL, and promotes equal opportunity in these programs and activities. It also makes sure that all Department of Labor employees and applicants are treated equally. There should not be a separate appropriation for this activity within the department. All agencies within DoL should ensure that their programs are carried out in a nondiscriminatory manner. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against by the department can file complaints under existing laws enforced by the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
Despite what federal officials may think, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee is not a necessary federal function. After funding for job training is consolidated into state block grants, the states should be given the option of setting up their own committees, in the event they decide that such committees would be useful, and funding them out of their block grants.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but U.S. labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. Further, proliferating workplace legislation and DoL regulations to enforce them present a significant barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs, as well as to increases in real wages. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws, and this means a fundamental rethinking of both the Department of Labor and federal labor policy. 
<p>
The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department. If the recommendations in this study are implemented, $10.5 billion can be saved for the taxpayer from 1996 to 2000.
<p>
	Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Labor does not fit this description. Administering unemployment insurance, three-quarters of DoL's budget, is a state function and should be devolved to the states as a first step toward privatization. Ineffective federal job training programs should be consolidated into state block grants and rigorously studied. OSHA should be significantly reformed, combined with MSHA, and set up as an independent sub-Cabinet agency free from political influence. America's statistics would be improved by combining the BLS with the Bureau of the Census as another sub-Cabinet agency. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down. What remains of the Department of Labor, less than 2 percent of its budget, then could be transferred to more appropriate Cabinet-level agencies like HHS, Treasury, and Justice. There is no reason for these remaining functions to be conducted by an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

This study concluded that extending the duration of UI benefits from six months to one year will increase the mean duration of unemployment by four to five weeks. Examples of federal programs that increase the duration of UI benefits are the Extended Benefits Program and Trade Adjustment Assistance.<p>
<li>    In today's economy, the primary purpose of the UI/ES system is to move workers whose jobs are permanently lost into new ones as quickly as possible.<p>
 <li>   Daniel S. Hamermesh, "New Estimates of the Incidence of Payroll Tax," <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>, Winter 1979. Research on the incidence of taxation generally has concluded that payroll taxes are borne predominantly, if not completely, by labor in the long run through lower real wages.<p>
<li>    Bruce D. Meyer, " Policy Lessons from the U.S. Unemployment Insurance Experiments," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 4197, October 1992. The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded. <p>
<li>   The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent. However, employers in states with federally approved UI programs (all 50 states) may credit 5.4 percent (90 percent FUTA offset) against the 6.2 percent tax rate, making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent.<p>
 <li>   The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate (TUR) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate (IUR). The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI. The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state. Eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) have approved the use of TUR triggers.<p>
<li>    Benefits generally are paid to workers with substantial labor force attachment who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- not to workers who quit their jobs voluntarily, who were fired for cause, or who have had no recent employment, such as those who are entering or reentering the labor force. Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self-employed, certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers, railroad workers, and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits.<p>
<li>    FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) have reached their statutory limits. The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out. Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs.<p>

<li>    In its 1993 semiannual report to Congress, the Department of Labor Inspector General (OIG) discovered in a nine-state audit of the program that "After 19 years of operation, neither ETA nor the states know whether the TAA program is effective" in achieving its original goals of helping workers find suitable employment. The OIG found that only one in ten former participants "found new training-related employment that paid or had the potential to pay suitable wages."  Although the Act requires that participants enroll in approved training courses, " participants who did not wish to attend training were almost always granted waivers without losing entitlement allowance." <p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.2<p>	Despite its name, however, the Corporation does not use its budget (currently $400 million) to provide direct legal services to the poor. Rather, it distributes federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country. These grantees also receive another $255 million from lawyer groups, local and state governments, interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA), and private sources.3<p>	Unfortunately, taxpayer-funded legal groups, under LSC, engage in political, lobbyist, and cause-advocacy activities, often at the expense of providing real legal services needed by poor people.
<p>
	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias. Attorneys have promoted racial preferences and illegal immigration, and grantees are sufficiently politicized to become involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning on ballot referendum questions. For the past 30 years, the LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation, advocacy, and lobbying, it has caused an increase in local, state, and federal welfare spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and has effected the addition of millions of people to the welfare rolls.4  It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in other states. It even has engaged in actions -- litigating to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for example -- that harm the poor.<p>	During the 1980s, even though its budget was cut by Congress, the program survived an attempt by the Reagan Administration to eliminate it. Now, however, just as welfare itself is being debated in Congress, so is the LSC's future. Like the War on Poverty itself, the Legal Services Corporation has failed. It should be abolished.
<p>

<b>LEGAL SERVICES AS POLITICAL MOVEMENT</b>
<p>
	Legal Services sees itself as a "movement."5<p>	  According to its founders, its primary mission is not to meet the needs of individual poor people, but to achieve broader social change through "law reform."6<p>	  The Legal Services agenda is grounded in the belief that the "system" creates poverty; therefore, it is the system -- America's economic, political, and cultural institutions -- that must be altered. To this end, the LSC:
<p>
Attempts to effect a redistribution of income by litigating increases in transfer payments through class action suits against local, state, and federal governments;
<p>
Is at the forefront of the so-called rights revolution, litigating to promote "children's rights,"7 to protect aggressive panhandling,8 and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets;9 and
<p>
Engages in lobbying and political advocacy. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers," national in scope and organized around specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food,10 function as the legal arm of a host of social and political causes.<p>	The LSC says grantees handled 1.6 million matters last year. Supporters say allegations of ideological bias are without merit and that, due to sheer volume, it is inevitable that the program will become involved in some controversial cases. But a review of thousands of cases and news articles11clearly indicates that the LSC has never filed a major case opposed to the goals of the homosexual, feminist, or environmental movements or designed to help poor clients preserve the right to home schooling, defend the right to own firearms, stop the establishment of substance abuse facilities in their neighborhoods, or challenge any type of gender or ethnic quota.<p><b>AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY</b><p>	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. In affect, it takes public funds and transforms them into private funds, immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending.
<P>
	The LSC's unique structure, established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (drafted in part by Alan Houseman, a legal services movement theoretician) guarantees a lack of accountability. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation which makes grants to separately incorporated, private, nonprofit grantees, some of which make subgrants to other groups and to each other. An eleven-member board is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation,12 but has little actual influence over grantees and how they spend their grant money. Presidents Ronald Reagan and (to a lesser extent) George Bush appointed LSC critics to the board, but they were unable to effect any real reform. Moreover, by law, the LSC's budget is submitted directly to Congress. All the Office of Management and Budget can do is review it.13<p>	The LSC's status as a private corporation also exempts it from many provisions of the federal criminal code, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act, that apply to government officials. While it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act declares that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought to exercise oversight. They have been all but ignored. Since most grantees receive at least some funding from IOLTA funds and from state and local governments, they can claim that any restricted activities are not supported by LSC funds. The result:  Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy are ignored or circumvented.
<p>
	There is no way to confirm resource allocation claims because LSC attorneys do not keep time sheets. Attorney time is the most valuable asset in any law office, and timekeeping is absolutely <i>de riguer</i> at any private firm. Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of Legal Services lawyers.
<p>
	LSC lawyers do not report their cases to anyone outside their offices, and all client and case records are closed. This secrecy, based on invocation of attorney-client privilege, makes it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Legal Services attorneys. Moreover, there are no provisions for the waiving of this privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered.
<p>
	Because of these built-in problems, there is little information on expenditures, either per case or per type of case. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, Legal Services continues to ask for government funding without offering any detailed evidence of how it has used money already received.
<p>
	At present, the only way the LSC can track how grants are used is through a monitoring program involving on-site visits to programs by Washington-based staff. During the Bush Administration, about 125 visits took place annually, so the average program could expect a visit only once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, this largely ineffective program has been weakened to the point where only six monitoring visits took place last year.
<P>
	It makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman wrote in a 1984 history of the LSC, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."14<p><b>POLITICS AND SURVIVAL</b><p>	After the election of Ronald Reagan, even though the LSC supposedly is restricted in its ability to lobby Congress,15 officials directed a "survival campaign"16 that cost millions of dollars and mobilized thousands of Legal Services lawyers. This effort included such activities as training activists to lobby;17 transferring hundreds of thousands of LSC dollars to sympathetic outside organizations;18 orchestrating positive media coverage; and generating thousands of phone calls, letters, and visits to Congress.19  Some LSC offices were advised to have receptionists respond to potential clients by saying:  "I'm sorry but at this time we are unable to handle this kind of case. Due to the recent proposed federal cutbacks, we have had to reduce our caseload drastically. It would be unethical for us to take any cases.... "20<p>	An LSC grantee, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) became the "corporation in exile."  Having received no more than $72,900 annually in LSC support before 1981, NLADA received $2.2 million in late 1981. Staff members responsible for awarding the grants went on the NLADA payroll after leaving the LSC.21  This effort was known as "saving the rubies," a reference to the action of Czar Nicholas in sending the Russian Crown Jewels to Switzerland for safekeeping during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.<p>	In 1983, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee conducted oversight hearings on the survival campaign. Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) concluded that "The political abuses by LSC and many of its gr
ant recipients were not simply isolated anomalies. They were the business of Legal Services. They were committed on a national scale and were planned by key members of the LSC's national leadership."
<p>
	Also in 1983, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the LSC survival campaign had violated the law.22  This prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. In July 1984, Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott asserted that "the unauthorized activities of the Corporation, and many people associated with it, are uniquely reprehensible and beyond the scope of LSC's original mission" but that "notwithstanding these inappropriate, misguided, and abusive activities, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1913 as well as the federal theft and fraud laws -- for technical reasons -- were not violated by the lobbying activities involved here."23  Among these "technical reasons," of course, was the fact that LSC employees are not subject to laws that apply to federal employees.<p>	LSC grantees have sought to affect the composition of Congress through redistricting litigation. In 1989, the LSC board banned grantees from participating in redistricting cases, only to be sued by Texas Rural Legal Aid, California Rural Legal Assistance, and North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. A U.S. Appeals Court upheld the prohibition, "particularly in light of the Act's mandate to LSC to ensure that the legal services program remain free from partisan political involvement.... " According to Judge (now former White House Counsel) Abner Mikva, "we cannot conclude that LSC has no right to prohibit its grantees from engaging in partisan activities."24<p>	In addition to grants, the legal services infrastructure benefits from money litigated away from taxpayers. The National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas in 1993 to expand its child welfare system and won $314,107 in legal fees.25  Kansas Legal Services has charged clients up to $100 per hour for filing Social Security disability insurance cases, collecting almost $2 million in fees from money awarded in these actions.26<p><b>PROMOTING WELFARE DEPENDENCY</b>
<p>
	LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions in expanded welfare, AFDC,27 Medicaid, and food stamp benefits. Legal Services also has expanded welfare by seeking to nullify any "moral" conditions connected to its provision, such as a requirement for identifying the fathers of illegitimate children;28 by attacking citizenship29 and residency requirements;30 and by signing up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security disability insurance benefits.31  Western Massachusetts Legal Services (WMLS) has published a brochure advising lottery winners that they can stay on welfare by such devices as prepaying rent, buying a special gift, or taking a vacation.32  In 1994, WMLS filed suit to get Arthur Cooney back on welfare after he admittedly had spent the $75,000 he won in a 1992 lottery on drugs and gambling.33<p>	While the exact amount cannot be calculated, government spending for LSC litigation, advocacy, and lobbying has contributed significantly to the national debt. In 1973, former OEO Legal Services Director Earl Johnson, Jr., wrote that "A bare handful of lawyers, scarcely a footnote in the federal budget, has produced massive transfers of goods and services to the poor -- some from the private sector and some from the public treasury."34  Johnson pointed to the initial period between 1965 and 1972, when federal legal services cost the taxpayer a total of $290 million:<p><blockquote>	     [T]he welfare residency decision already has produced between $300 and $600 million added income for the poor, the 1968 man-in-house decision $400-$800 million, the 1969 and 1970 food stamp cases have thus far produced over $450 million in additional food stamp allotments, the prior hearing case over $200-$300 million. The California Medicaid suit saved $200 million in health services, the New York Medicaid case thus far has saved $367 million, and other actions undoubtedly have generated several million in additional income. Thus a total dividend in excess of $2 billion actually has been received by th
e poor since the beginning of the federal investment in legal services to the poor.35 </blockquote><p>		 Asserting that the program's "benefits" outweighed its "cost" by a ratio of 7 to 1, Johnson further calculated that since benefits were won in the form of entitlements, and therefore would continue many years into the future, the actual ratio was closer to 34 to 1.36<p>	Legal Services now seeks to protect earlier gains. To this end, LSC lawyers have responded to the 1988 Family Support Act, which allowed states to seek waivers from the federal government to experiment with welfare, by suing to obstruct or stop virtually every reform that has been attempted.
<p>
	In 1993, for example, Legal Services of New Jersey sued both the state and federal governments to prevent implementation of a cap on AFDC benefits designed to discourage illegitimacy.37<p>	In 1995, the Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI) filed a class action suit challenging Governor Evan Bayh's welfare reform plan, which includes a work requirement and benefit reduction for families that fail to get their children immunized or to send them to school.38  An LSOI-employed lobbyist organized opposition to the plan when it was before the Indiana legislature.39<p>	Legal Services also has sued to block welfare reform in California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Should Congress enact a serious overhaul of the welfare system, it is safe to assume that LSC lawyers will fight its implementation in the courts as well.<p><b>HELPING TO DESTROY PUBLIC HOUSING</b>
<p>
	One of the major problems in public housing today is drug-related crime. In Georgia, according to John Hiscox, Executive Director of the Macon Housing Authority (MHA), "One of the most difficult and persistent obstacles to removing drug-related, criminal activity from public housing has been Georgia Legal Services."  While it has never won a case, GLS routinely demands costly jury trials. The result:  The MHA's average legal cost for an eviction went from a few hundred dollars in 1987 to $8,000 in 1990. During the same period, its annual legal bill increased from $10,000 to $90,000.
<p>
	In 1989, Georgia Legal Services tried to prevent the eviction of Tina Burke, whose apartment was surrounded by gangs of young men and lookouts. During surveillance, police witnessed her presence during drug transactions in her apartment. But GLS maintained that she lacked knowledge of such transactions. In 1994, tenant Shon Scott was arrested after leaving a crack house two blocks from his residence. Along with a firearm and a beeper, he possessed 33 pieces of crack cocaine. He pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute. GLS fought Scott's eviction on the basis that his crimes did not take place on public housing property.40<p>	In New York City, the Legal Aid Society of New York went to court in 1994 to challenge the New York Housing Authority's plan to make it easier to evict drug dealers by cutting the process (which now can take as long as three years) to only three to four months. The Interim Council of Presidents, the organization representing public housing tenant groups, filed a brief in support of faster evictions. Tenants say they cannot sit out at night, let their children play after dark, or even visit others in their own buildings.41<p>	In Pennsylvania, when the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) attempted to evict a woman who allegedly was dealing drugs, loan sharking, and extorting money from other tenants, an LSC grantee filed a federal civil rights suit on her behalf and won on the grounds that the PHA had not given her adequate notice of the charges. Legal Services lawyers obtained $5,500 in legal fees. In 1993, another tenant set fire to her unit and the PHA won her eviction in state court. Legal Services filed a federal civil rights case and won a stay of the eviction. As of June 15, 1995, the case was still pending.42<p>	In Pittsburgh, Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has sued Northside Tenants Reorganization (NTR) repeatedly to prevent evictions of tenants responsible for drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. NTR is a tenant group which manages and owns its own low-incom
e housing. NTR Executive Director Harriet Henson and a building manager say they saw a tenant's boyfriend complete a heroin deal. "It took us two years to evict because NLS took us to appeal and appeal and appeal."43<p><b>UNDERMINING THE FAMILY</b><p>	Some Legal Services cases undermine the rights of parents. In 1994, notwithstanding a congressional ban on involvement in abortion litigation, the National Center for Youth Law (NCYL), co-counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, succeeded in overturning a 1987 California law requiring a teenager to seek the approval of a parent or juvenile court judge before getting an abortion. NCYL sought legal fees for 681 hours at $300 per hour from the state. It was awarded two-thirds of the amount it sought, pending eventual success before the California Supreme Court.44<p>	In another area, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law in April 1995 admonished Idaho parents about inviting police into their homes to search for drugs they suspected their children of using. The innovative Canyon County, Idaho, program is completely voluntary, and police make no arrests unless the drugs they find are especially dangerous or in large quantities.45<p>	Other cases also carry serious implications for adoptive parents. In 1993, for example, the Idaho Legal Aid Society (ILAS) sued to take a four-year-old child away from his legal parents. Karla and Leland Swenson had adopted a half-Sioux boy in 1989 when he was one-day old and were raising him on their dairy farm. ILAS claimed the boy should live with Indian relatives even though neither of his natural parents had sought custody. Representing the natural father's Indian sister, ILAS argued that a tribe's efforts to preserve its cultural integrity took precedence over the best interests of the child. The Swensons sold their home to raise funds to continue the legal fight.46<p>	In New Jersey, Somerset-Sussex Legal Services is seeking to take a one-year-old boy away from his adoptive parents because his natural
 father wants him back. Reverend Paul Rack and his wife adopted the baby in February 1994 when he was three weeks old. According to a letter circulated by community leaders in support of the Racks, the natural father is unemployed, has a criminal record, and already cannot support several other children.47<p>	In a third case, however, Legal Services fortunately did not fare well. Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Legal Services sued to get parental rights for the 16-year-old father of a child conceived by his rape of a 13-year-old. The rapist has a long criminal record and two other illegitimate children. In March 1995, the judge ruled against LVLS and criticized "misguided adults" for bringing the case.48<p>	Several LSC actions advance goals of homosexual activists. In 1993, James Cox and his male "partner" attempted to adopt a child. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services denied their application because Florida law prohibits homosexual adoption. The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation successfully sued, the state appealed, and the statute in question was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court on April 27, 1995.49  Legal Services of Greater Miami filed a brief in support of the ACLU Foundation's position in this case.<p>	In a similar 1994 case, Brooklyn Law School's Family Law Clinic, another LSC grantee, successfully represented a lesbian seeking to adopt her female "partner's" child. A Family Court ruled that a same-sex partner had the same rights as a stepparent for purposes of the adoption statute.50  In a 1989 case also attempting to equate homosexual relationships with the traditional family, the Legal Aid Society of New York and Community Action for Legal Services, Inc., filed amicus curiae briefs in state courts arguing that a "gay life partner" should have the same right as a spouse to remain in a rent-controlled apartment after the tenant's death. The New York Supreme Court agreed.51<p>	LSC lawyers even have attempted to secure legal recognition of a right to public housi
ng for minors. In a 1993 case, a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld federal requirements that public housing be leased to tenants at least 18 years old, and in 1991, Central Pennsylvania Legal Services sued the Reading, Pennsylvania, Housing Authority for refusing to lease a unit to an unemancipated and unmarried 16-year-old girl.52<p><b>PROMOTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</b><p>	The Legal Services apparatus has been equally active on issues pertaining to illegal immigration. When the voters of California passed Proposition 187 in 1994 to deny public benefits to illegal aliens, California Rural Legal Assistance, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other groups filed suit to stop its implementation.53  Prior to election day, LSC grantees campaigned against the measure. Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, told the media that "It's just a question of whether we have the time or the resources to lay Prop 187 bare."54<p>	The National Immigration Law Center (NILC), a Legal Services support center, sued the state of California over a 1992 law requiring those seeking emergency health services under Medi-Cal to disclose their immigration status. Legal Services attorneys contended that the law should be struck down because it would deter undocumented immigrants from seeking emergency services. The California Supreme Court rejected this argument in December 1994.55  The NILC also condemned Congress's insertion of a stipulation into the $9 billion earthquake relief bill last year prohibiting non-emergency aid to illegal aliens. The amendment denied illegal aliens access to home repair loans, disaster grants, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance, although it did allow them to collect emergency food and clothing.56<p>	The National Immigration Law Center also sued to force the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to stop asking resident aliens to pay $70 to renew green cards issued before 1978. The replacement program was part of an INS effort 
to end widespread document fraud. Legal Services claimed the $70 fee was excessive. A federal judge in Sacramento, however, disagreed and upheld the fee in November 1993.57<p>	This Legal Services activity extends even to the deportation of criminals. In Georgia, for example, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society attempted to halt the deportation of Cuban nationals convicted of committing serious crimes, including attempted murder and drug trafficking. Arriving in 1980 via the Mariel Boatlift, the Cubans committed these crimes while on immigration parole. After their release from prison, their immigration parole was revoked, and authorities subsequently placed them in detention to await return to Cuba. Atlanta Legal Aid lawyers said their detention violated their constitutional rights and international law. In 1993, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the petition.58<p>	In Massachusetts, Greater Boston Legal Services sued to stop the deportation of an alien resident who had been convicted of serious drug offenses. A Dominican woman was tried, convicted, and sentenced on four drug offenses that took place in 1982, including possession of and intent to distribute cocaine. Twelve years later, in 1994, a U.S. Court of Appeals let the deportation order stand.59  Another case involved the ability of the INS, under the 1986 Immigration Control Act, to deny residency to immigrants with one felony or three misdemeanors. In 1992, California Rural Legal Assistance sued the INS to stop the denial of temporary residency to immigrant agricultural workers with criminal records, arguing that this practice violated both the workers' Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Rules Procedure Act. In 1994, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the Fifth Amendment claims but upheld Legal Services' challenge on administrative grounds.60<p>	Two LSC grantees sued California's Department of Motor Vehicles for refusing to issue drivers' licenses to illegal aliens. As required by law, the DMV requires that all applicants provide proof of legal reside
ncy to obtain licenses. The National Immigration Law Center and California Rural Legal Assistance sued the DMV on behalf of several illegal aliens whose applications had been rejected. A state appeals court ruled that the "DMV is not only authorized but obligated" to deny licenses to illegal aliens.61<p>	In yet another California Rural Legal Assistance case, the organization in 1982 sued U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello for investigating allegations that unqualified aliens had been registered to vote. The purpose of this investigation was not to prosecute improperly registered voters, but to find out whether someone was deliberately signing up unqualified residents. CRLA sued Russoniello on the grounds that his investigation of Spanish-speaking residents was "invidious discrimination."  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument.62<p>	The extremes to which such litigation can be pushed may be indicated in a 1991 case. Two LSC grantees, Texas Rural Legal Aid and the Los Angeles-based National Health Law Program, filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to sue the McAllen, Texas, Medical Center because its security guards wore uniforms allegedly resembling those of Border Patrol agents. Legal Services said this discriminated against illegal aliens because it discouraged them from seeking care.63<p><b>PROMOTING RACIAL PREFERENCES</b><P>	The Legal Services apparatus certainly is no stranger to litigation that promotes racial preference. In 1978, LSC filed an <i>amicus</i> brief supporting the University of California's minority set-aside program in the famous <i>Bakke</i> case. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, declared the UC-Davis set-aside unconstitutional because it reserved places for minorities exclusively because of their race.64<p>	In a 1992 case, the outcome was somewhat different. The Cincinnati, Ohio, quota system, adopted in the 1970s, required that at least 18 percent of all fire personnel be minorities. To achieve this numerical goal, the fi
re division made it a practice to insure that at least 40 percent of all new recruits were minorities. White applicants who scored higher than minority applicants on the civil service exam but were rejected sued the city for reverse discrimination. A U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati's position and ruled that the white applicants' constitutional rights were not violated.65<p><b>HELPING CRIMINALS</b>
<P>
	In addition to litigating in behalf of criminals the government is seeking to deport, Legal Services lawyers have been active in behalf of domestic criminals. Starting in 1991, for example, Georgia Legal Services has filed petitions for the release of David Nagel from a maximum security mental hospital. Nagel was imprisoned for murdering both his grandparents by slitting their throats in 1981 when they refused to give him the car keys.66<p>	In Florida, Greater Orlando Area Legal Services in 1989 successfully sued the Orange County Jail to stop segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Infected inmates now are placed in the general prison population without notification to other inmates in order to insure their "privacy."  The suit was filed on behalf of 18 former inmates, most of whom were deceased when the case was settled in 1994. After four and a half years of litigation, a federal judge ordered Orange County to pay Greater Orlando Area Legal Services $81,500 in legal fees.67<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed. Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds. Most legal problems faced by the poor fall into several basic categories:  family, including divorce, custody, guardianship and child support; housing, including landlord/tenant controversies; financial, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and inability to pay bills; consumer; employment; and public benefits. While taxpayer funds are provided to Legal Services for the handling of individual cases, too great a portion of such funds are used to pursue class action suits and ideologically important test cases.
<p>
	Legal Services has helped to destroy the independence and dignity of poor people and to create a permanent underclass. Its activities undermine both the family and the larger community. For the sake of the American taxpayer -- and for the sake of America's poor -- it is time to abolish the Legal Services Corporation.

<h2>WHAT AMERICANS WILL PAY IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE: THE STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IMPACT</h2>

<b>By Robert E. Moffit, John C. Liu, and David H. Winston</b><sup>1</sup><br><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<hr><a href="wel-62mp.html">Index-Map of Supporting Data by Congressional District</a><br><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a></center><hr><P>Medicare's increasingly dangerous financial plight leaves Congress with only two options if the program is to continue providing health care to seniors:  either restructure and reform the program or significantly increase payroll taxes on America's businesses and working families. While payroll taxes technically are shared between employers and employees, in reality most taxes on business are shifted to workers in the form of reduced wages or compensation -- in some cases, even job loss. Thus, any new payroll tax to shore up the financially failing Medicare system will be another tax on America's working families.
<P>
Medicare's seven-member Board of Trustees, which includes President Clinton's Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, has determined that the Medicare Hospitalization (HI, or Part A) Trust Fund, which finances hospital services to the nation's elderly, will be insolvent in the year 2002. It urges "prompt, effective and decisive action" to address Medicare's financial condition. In the words of David Walker and Stanford Ross, the Board's two "public trustees" (private citizens), Medicare "is clearly unsustainable in its present form," and its reform "needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative."2<P>Several proposals have been advanced to restructure Medicare. Using a well-tested model for congressional reform, Heritage Foundation analysts have proposed transforming the current Medicare system into one that would look like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers. The FEHBP, unlike Medicare, is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition.3  This would allow Medicare enrollees to pick government-certified private insurance plans and, like retirees in the FEHBP, receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. Similar legislation is being considered on Capitol Hill.
<P>
Americans are beginning to understand that unless Congress restructures Medicare to preserve high quality medical services but at lower cost, Congress will have to cut the supply of medical services available to enrollees or significantly increase the HI payroll tax to avoid the bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund.4  With the notable exception of the 1989 repeal of the costly Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988,5 Congress has expanded, not deleted, Medicare's benefits and services. Its failure to reform the program means that Congress will likely resort to higher taxes on working families to cover Medicare's soaring costs. But given the gravity of Medicare's financial condition, particularly the threatened bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund, the level of taxation on workers and businesses that would be needed just to finance the program in its current form would be enormous, dwarfing even the Clinton Administration's tax hike of 1993, the largest single tax increase in U.S. history.
<P>
Taxpayers also should realize that in addition to any HI payroll tax, they will pay general taxes to maintain the solvency of Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services. Taxpayers already subsidize 71 percent of the cost of Part B's premiums. Unless Congress implements changes, the taxpayer's share will increase automatically to 75 percent on January 1, 1996. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the taxes required to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.6<p><b>Medicare's Payroll Tax.</b> Middle-class American families with children today surrender well over one-third of their income to federal, state, and local taxation. Federal taxation alone takes approximately 25 percent of this average family income.7  And among many families, federal payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare even exceed the federal income tax.8<p>Medicare's hospital insurance program currently is funded through a 2.9 percent federal payroll tax, divided equally between employers and employees with each paying 1.45 percent, except for the self-employed, who pay the full 2.9 percent. The imposition of an even higher Medicare payroll tax, like the imposition of a mandate on an employer to purchase health insurance for employees, is an additional labor cost on business.9  But business labor costs are largely passed on to workers in reduced wages, benefits, or even employment. Standard economic analysis confirms this well-known "pass through" effect of business labor costs on the wages of employees. A survey of the economic literature by Lewin-VHI, one of the nation's leading econometrics firms, indicates that for every additional $100 in mandated benefits an employer must provide for an employee, an average of $88 will be paid for in reduced wages.10<P>Today, the Medicare HI tax is still a relatively modest payroll tax. But over the years it has grown steadily to finance the hospitalization program, and it will get bigger if Congress cannot refor
m Medicare in a cost-efficient fashion. When the HI tax was first imposed in 1966, it was limited to the first $6,600 of taxable income per year. In the years since the enactment of the Medicare program, the maximum taxable amount has been raised 23 times.11  Through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), Congress, upon the recommendation of the Clinton Administration, repealed the legal limitation on taxable income as part of its major 1993 tax initiative This means that all earnings today are subject to the HI payroll tax.
<p>

<b>FINANCIAL INSTABILITY AND FUTURE TAX INCREASES</b>
<P>
As explained in the Medicare Trustees' Report, the "adequacy of the HI program's scheduled financing to support program costs in the future is examined under three alternative sets of assumptions:  low cost, intermediate, and high cost. The low cost alternative is a more optimistic set of assumptions from the standpoint of HI financing and the high cost alternative is a more pessimistic set of assumptions."12  Further, continues the Report, "[the] intermediate set of assumptions represents the Trustees' best estimate of the expected future economic and demographic trends that will affect the financial status of the program."  The analysis used in this study uses the intermediate assumption. The reality is that under any of the three assumptions, the HI Trust Fund will face insolvency in from six to eleven years. Because the current political environment has focused the debate in terms of "preserving the solvency" of the HI Trust Fund, long-term solutions are necessary. 
<P>
The Medicare trustees have outlined three possible scenarios for Congress should it choose not to reform the Medicare program and decide simply to raise the HI payroll tax. The options range from taking immediate action to various stages of delay. Naturally, if Congress fails to take immediate steps as suggested by the trustees, the required increase in the HI payroll tax will be higher in the future than it would be if they raised the HI tax immediately. Because the trustees believe that "prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary,"13 the analysis in this study centers around their estimate that the increase required to achieve long-term actuarial balance is 3.52 percent of taxable payroll.14<P>In order to achieve a long-term actuarial balance in the HI trust fund (permanent fiscal solvency),15 the Medicare trustees have stated that HI payroll taxes could be increased immediately or by a higher amount at some future time. If Congress opts to place the HI Trust Fund on a course towards permanent fiscal solvency through an additional increase in the percentage of taxable income, this will mean 3.52 percent in additional taxation, bringing the total HI payroll tax to 6.4 percent, divided equally between employers and employees.
<P>

<b>THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<P>
Using the Heritage Foundation health care simulation model (see appendix for technical specifications), Heritage analysts have computed both the magnitude and the wage effects, by state and congressional district, of an additional 3.52 percent HI payroll tax on workers throughout the country. This analysis represents a "snapshot" of the impact of the payroll tax based on 1993 earnings data, the most recent data generally available. It indicates the impact if the tax had been in effect in 1993. Given the general growth of earnings, total costs would be even greater if the new tax were levied in 1996 or thereafter. Assuming that such a tax increase went into effect, households would face serious financial consequences.
<P><ul>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #1:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would result in a total of $123.03 billion in new taxes levied on employers and employees in its first year of implementation.  Had the increase been in effect in 1993, the aggregate increase in taxes would range from $101.2 million on wage earners in Wyoming to a high of $7.74 billion on wage earners in California during the first year. Businesses in those states would face a similar levy. Other high tax states would include New York ($9 billion, split between employers and employees), Texas ($8 billion), and Florida ($5.9 billion). As earnings and payroll costs increase in future years, tax revenues also would increase.
<p>
Earners in different congressional districts in some cases would face heavy new tax burdens. In aggregate, the 14th district of New York would be hardest hit ($362,000 each on workers and employers), followed by the 29th district of California ($303,000).
<p>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #2:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would have a significant impact on employees' earnings, equal to a $115.6 billion loss in earnings if its effect had been felt fully in 1993. Since most of the payroll tax on employers in practice is passed through to employees in reduced earnings, the total impact on workers is larger than the increase in direct payroll taxes. On average, using an 88 percent "pass through," and had the tax increase been fully in effect in 1993, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would range from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. To put this in perspective, average wage earnings ranged in 1993 from $19,840 in Arkansas to $32,659 in New Jersey. Thus, the loss would not be insignificant for the average wage earner. Workers, on average, would experience a negative impact on their earnings exceeding $1,000 per year in both the District of Columbia ($1,052) and Alaska ($1,002). Other states in which the negative impact on workers' earnings would be substantial include Connecticut ($996), Massachusetts ($992), Maryland ($980), and New York ($954). This is based on 1993 earnings. In future years, the size of this cost to employees would increase proportionately with the increase in employee earnings compared with 1993.
<P>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #3:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would be larger than the tax increase of 1993. Enacted as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Clinton Administration's tax recommendations amounted to $262.5 billion over five years, the largest single tax increase in American history. But if Congress fails in its efforts to reform and restructure Medicare, and resorts to a 3.52 percent additional payroll tax to shore up the financially troubled hospitalization program, the HI tax increase could exceed it. According to the analysis conducted by the Medicare trustees, the revenues of such a payroll tax could reach $711.0 billion over just five years,16 almost tripling the huge 1993 Clinton tax increase.
</ul><p>

<b>WHY THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE EVEN WORSE</b>
<p>
If Congress fails to reform Medicare and resorts instead to a heavy new payroll tax to rescue the Part A Trust Fund from bankruptcy, even an increase as high as 3.52 percent, that new level of taxation on America's working families will still be insufficient to maintain the program in its current form. The reason is that the other part of Medicare, the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program (SMI, or Part B), will require an alarming increase in general tax support to continue paying for physician and outpatient services. While Medicare Part B, because of its design, is not threatened with financial insolvency, its costs are exploding. Over 70 percent of these costs today are borne by taxpayers. Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projects that taxpayers already will be spending $370.5 billion in taxes over the next five years, subsidizing 75 percent of the Supplementary Medical Insurance program.

<h2>APPENDIX</h2><br>
<b>COST CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS<br>
<p>

State-Level Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a><br>
<p>
The national aggregate of employee earnings was derived from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. These earnings are for 1993. The cost calculations assume the payroll tax increase had been in effect that year:  the normal growth in earnings means that the payroll tax and its associated costs would be higher in 1996 and subsequent years.
<p>
Due to the nature of self-reported income surveys, the CPS generally underestimates earnings. In order to compensate for this, we compared the CPS total with the national employee and proprietor earnings reported in the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i>  table on national income in 1993 (as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <i>Survey of Current Business</i>, April 1994) in order to develop a multiplier to adjust the CPS reported earnings.
<p>
After April 1986, all state and local employees were required to pay Medicare taxes. In 1991, however, the law was amended to allow those hired prior to that date to opt out. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that as of March 1994, 1.7 million workers were not covered by Medicare. Using the 1.7 million figure we removed those workers and their earnings from our totals based on the state-by-state distribution of state and local employees and their earnings in the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>.
<p>
Based on a survey of economic literature estimating the "pass-through" wage effect of employer mandates by health care econometrics firm Lewin-VHI, we assumed 88 percent of the cost of the additional tax to be passed to employee in reduced compensation.17  We also assumed that the pass-through had fully occurred. Therefore, we assumed the total cost of the additional Medicare tax to employees to be 88 percent of the business's share of the Medicare tax (about 1.56 percent) in addition to the 1.76 percent tax on wages paid directly by the employee. 
<p>
 Total cost to employees (direct and indirect pass through) was divided by the total number of wage earners who did not opt out to determine the average cost per wage earner by state.
<p>

<b>Congressional District Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="wel-62mp.html">Map-Index of Supporting Data</a><p>
To calculate the cost of the Medicare HI tax at the congressional district level, we used the 1990 U.S. Census STF-3D file in addition to our state-level findings, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> . The 1990 STF-3D file contains congressional district data, while the <i>Current Population Survey</i> data can be analyzed at the individual and state levels.
<p>
In order to account for increases in earnings that occurred 1990-1993, we compared the 1990 STF-3D numbers with the earnings for each state, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. We assumed that for each state, increases in wages were normally distributed within the state.
<p>
It also was necessary to remove from our analysis the earnings of those state and local employees exempt from Medicare taxes. To do so we again compared the distribution of state and local employees in congressional districts, calculated using the 1990 STF-3D numbers, with the 1994 CPS state-level distribution of earnings of the exempt 1.7 million state and local employees. As in the case of earnings, we assumed those state and local employees were normally distributed throughout the state's congressional districts. In addition, we did not account for state and local employee wage differentials between congressional districts.
<p>
The total number of households per congressional district also has changed since 1990, so we compared the total households from the STF-3D file with total households in the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> to calculate the number of households per CD in 1993. We determined the cost per household in our analysis; however, because this includes households with no income, the actual cost to households with income will be higher.

<HEAD><TITLE>1996 Convention Spotlight</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>

<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.

<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>



<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a>]</h5>

<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>
</center>


<h5>






[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-12-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]<p>


</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>

<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/dollar3.gif" align="left" alt="hundred dollar bill">


While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/library2.gif" align="right" alt="generic library scene">


If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.


<p>Good luck with your internship search.  If you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:njg9b@virginia.edu">email </a> me.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]</h5>







<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are despicable.  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these great defenders of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a draconian cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments wont change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nations leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<h2>The AFL-CIOs "Union Summer"</h2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly"> Text Only</a> ]</h5>








<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "todays profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the unions "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSCs <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the 96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEAs tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIOs president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeneys blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>Whats alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<html><title>Spotlight on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<h2><i>TH Spotlight on The Leader</i></h2>
</center>
Some say that true statesmanship is dead in America.  But sometimes there is an exception to the rule.  Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<br>
	I had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, I couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	I hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family College Costs -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #3:  
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS 
WOULD MEAN FOR FAMILY COLLEGE COSTS</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 77<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will allow families with children to save more money for higher education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress would mean: 
<p><ul>
<li> American families, over time, could save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public university today.
<p>
<li> An average student could save more than $414 over the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest rates.
</ul><p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting firm.<sup>1</sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>2</sup><p><b>INCREASED FAMILY SAVINGS FROM $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT</b><p>The high cost of a college education prices many families out of the higher education market or forces students and parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of college.<p>The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million families raising some 51 million children and could allow many families to save enough money to send their children to college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for each child's education. Thus, a family with two children would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child in family savings for education amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li> Five full years' tuition and fees at an average public university; 
<p>
<li> One full year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or
<p>
<li> More than the difference between the four-year cost of an average public university and the two-year cost of an average public community college.
</ul>
<p>
<b>LOWER STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES</b>
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates under the congressional balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit students with student loans. A student beginning his or her education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged half a percentage point below what is expected under current law:  a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year student loan.<sup>3</sup>  More young Americans will be able to afford a college education as a result of these savings. In addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer their education plans could enter college earlier, thus increasing their lifetime earnings.
<p>
Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. In essence, students would be able to purchase more education for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for such things as:
<p>
<ul>
<li> One full year of books and supplies;

<li> Two additional courses at an average public university; or

<li> About one-third the cost of a personal computer. 
</ul><p>

<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 percent per year.
<p>
The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation.
<p>

<p><ol>
<li> William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
<li>Laurence H. Meyer & Associates long has earned top honors for forecasting accuracy when compared against similar firms. In 1993, it won the "Blue Chip" forecasting award for the years 1989-1992. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates was ineligible for the award in 1994, but again was rated the most accurate forecasting firm in the United States.
<p>
<li>This is based on a student loan of $13,044, the average cost of a public university, at an initial interest rate of 8.25 percent. The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means a relatively smaller decrease in interest rates. Thus, the 0.5 percent decrease can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the potential savings to a student from lower interest rates.

<title>Lamar Alexander: Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Lamar Alexander: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Lamar Alexander has been Governor, University President and U.S. Education
Secretary.<p>
In 1978 he literally walked 1,000 miles across Tennessee to become its
Governor.  At the request of the U.S. Attorney, he was sworn into office three
days early to prevent the incumbent Governor from granting clemency to prisoners
the FBI believed had paid cash for their release.<p>
During his two terms as Governor, Tennessee grew jobs at twice the national
average, went from last to third in the production of new automobiles, from 48th
to 36th in average family incomes, and enacted the nation's only state program to
pay teachers more for teaching well.  When he left office, the state had fewer
government employees, a smaller debt, and the nation's fifth lowest tax rate.<p>
He and his family then moved to Australia to live for a while and he wrote
his third book, Six Months Off, about that experience.  In 1987 he and his wife,
Honey, helped found a company, Corporate Child Care Services, that today has
1,200 employees.  In 1988 he became President of the University of Tennessee. 
And in 1991 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him as President Bush's
Education Secretary.  During the summer of 1994, Alexander drove 8,800 miles
across the United States, staying with families in 38 states.  The book about
that drive, We Know What To Do, will be published this Fall.<p>
He is a country and classical pianist who has played on the Grand Ole Opry
and the Billy Graham Crusade.  He chaired the nation's governors, served as
co-director of Empower America, and founded the Republican Neighborhood Meeting. 
The Education Commission of the States and the National Collegiate Athletic
Association have given him their highest awards.  He lives in Nashville.  Lamar
and Honey have four children: Andrew, 25; Leslee, 22; Kathryn, 20; and William,
16.<p>

<title>Plan to Replace and Improve FDA Approval Process Unveiled -- PFF</title>

<h1>Plan to Replace and Improve FDA Approval Process Unveiled</h1>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
June 19, 1995<p>
Contact: Rick O'Donnell, (202) 484-2312</b></br>

<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation today introduced a plan to privatize many
functions of the Food and Drug Administration's drug and medical device approval
processes. The proposal would give experts at centers of medical excellence and
other private entities, licensed by the FDA, oversight of new products' movement
through the various stages of development.<p>

"This plan maintains our current high standards for safety and effectiveness, but
would expedite the process by which health-enhancing new products reach
patients," said Louis Sullivan, M.D., former Secretary of Health and Human
Services and chairman of the Foundation's Medical Innovation Project advisory
committee. "The experience of European countries has demonstrated that
non-government entities can play a very positive role in getting safe and
effective products to patients."<p>

The proposal, "The Future of Medical Innovation:  A New Approach for Bringing
Medical Products to Market," would separate oversight of the drug and device
approval process from the government's role in maintaining and enforcing legally
mandated safety and effectiveness standards. New private sector organizations,
certified by the FDA, would compete to offer a faster, lower-cost approval
process while ensuring that new medical products meet current standards.<p>

"Bureaucratic delays and political inertia have for too long prevented common
sense reform," said Jeffrey A. Eisenach, president of the Foundation.  "Every day
the current system stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths
and suffer senseless pain.  It's time to replace the current system with one that
makes sense for the 1990s and the 21st Century."<p>

Crafted by The Progress & Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think
tank, the study was released for public comment and will be refined and expanded
in light of additional findings. The study was researched and produced by a
working group whose members include:<p>

<ul>

Thomas Lenard, Ph.D., Senior Fellow and Director Of Regulatory Studies at the
Foundation<p>

Ralph A. Epstein, M.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and Professor of
Anesthesiology, University of Connecticut<p>

Robert Tollison, Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and Duncan Black
Professor of Economics, George Mason University<p>

W. Kip Viscusi, Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and George G. Allen
Professor of Economics, Duke University<p>

William M. Wardell, M.D., Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and President,
Protein Engineering Corporation and Wardell Associates International<p>

</ul>

"Many of our drug and medical device companies are able to offer products to
patients in Europe years before they ever receive FDA approval," said co-author 
Wardell.  "Not only does this cause needless suffering and death by denying
patients the benefits of effective medical technology, it hinders many of
America's major industries, thus slowing economic growth and job creation."<p>

The report proposes a new framework for bringing drugs and medical devices to
market, including:<p>

<ul>

<li>Decentralizing the product approval process to encourage innovation and reduce
costs and delays;<p>

<li>Making the approval process more predictable and less subject to bureaucratic
whim and delay; and,<p>

<li>Shifting the cost of the approval process from individual taxpayers to the
corporations that develop and market drugs.<p>

</ul>

"There is a widespread consensus on the part of industry, patient groups and
other observers of the FDA that substantial problems exist in the current system.
True reform requires a new institutional arrangement for bringing medical
products to market, not just tinkering around the edges," said Lenard.<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a non-partisan research and educational
organization dedicated to creating a positive vision of the future founded in the
historic principles of the American Idea, and to detailing the policies needed to
achieve that future.<p>

<title>How Congress's $245 Billion Tax Cut Repeals Just One-Third of '90 and '93 Tax Hikes -- Heritage</title>

<b>"I think I raised [your taxes] too much, too."</b><p>
<blockquote>		--President Clinton, October 17, 1995</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1: Tax Cut Only One-Third of Combined 1990 and 1993 Tax Increases</a><br>
<a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2: Government Will Still Get Too Much Revenue After Tax Cut</a><br>
<p>
President Clinton claims that the $245 billion seven-year tax cut supported by Congress is excessive. But it actually does not come close to eliminating the huge tax increase levied by the last Congress and is dwarfed by the level of tax hikes approved since Ronald Reagan left office. (See <a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1</a>) Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The increased tax burden caused by the 1990 and 1993 tax bills totals three times more than this year's proposed tax cut. Taxpayers will still be worse off compared with their tax burden in 1989. <p>

<li> This year's tax cut will reduce federal tax collections by less than 2.2 cents on the dollar. And that is the "worst-case" estimate that assumes no revenue feedback from higher growth stimulated by such things as the proposed capital gains tax cut.
<p>
<li> Even with the tax cut, tax revenues are projected to rise from $1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002, an increase of $463 billion (an average of $66 billion per year).
</ul><p>
	By any objective measure, the Administration's claim that the tax cut is too big cannot be justified. Set in proper context, these figures instead make a persuasive case that this year's tax cut should be considered a first step. Indeed, when lawmakers next year begin considering a flat tax, they should take whatever steps are needed -- including further limits on the growth of federal spending -- to ensure that tax reform is accompanied by tax reduction.
<p>
	<b>Undoing Damage from 1990 and 1993 Tax Hikes.</b> According to Congressional Budget Office figures, the 1990 tax increase was projected to increase revenues by 0.54 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The 1993 tax hike, America's biggest, was projected to raise revenues by a further 0.73 percent of GDP. The tax cut now being discussed, by contrast, is estimated to reduce tax collections by a scant 0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, CBO projections suggest that this comparatively modest tax cut at best will reverse only one-third of the damage inflicted by higher taxes in 1990 and 1993.<P>

	<b>No Revenue Shortfall.</b> As <a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, the CBO projects that federal tax collections will expand by more than $460 billion if the tax cuts are enacted. These estimates, incidentally, assume that there is no positive effect on the economy from lowering the tax burden. Needless to say, several measures in the proposal, such as reductions in the tax on capital gains, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and partial relief for those subject to the alternative minimum tax, will boost incentives to save and invest and therefore trigger higher wages for American workers. This increase in taxable income will offset some of the projected $245 billion tax cut.
<p>
	Even with the implausible assumption that the economy receives no benefit from lower taxes, the proposed tax cut will have only a tiny effect on revenues. Tax revenues still are projected by the CBO to rise by an average of $66 billion annually between 1995 and 2002. And of the $11.373 trillion in tax revenue the government is projected to collect over that period, the $245 billion tax cut will reduce that amount by less than 2.2 cents for every dollar.
<P>
	<b>The High-Tax Approach Has Failed.</b> The White House claims that lower taxes will be counterproductive. Before criticizing tax cuts, however, the Administration would be well advised to see how the redistributionist goal of higher taxes has backfired.
Tax rates on the "rich" were raised in 1990 and 1993. The result:  As opponents warned, upper-income taxpayers reduced the amount of income they reported.
<P><ul>
<li> The higher taxes from the "rich" from increased income tax rates in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to help boost total income taxes as a proportion of GDP. The result:  Income tax collections actually have fallen from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1989 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.
<p>
<li> Revenues grew by an average of 6.6 percent annually in the "tax-cutting" Reagan years, a rate of growth one-fourth higher than the 5.3 percent annual revenue increases under Presidents Bush and Clinton.
<p>
<li> The budget deficit was less than $155 billion in 1989 and was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in January 1989 to fall every year into the future if Reagan's policies were left untouched. Lawmakers instead imposed large tax hikes in 1990 and 1993. The result:  The deficit this year is $161 billion and now projected by the CBO to rise in future years.
<p>
<li> The tax increases in 1990 and 1993 were intended to spur the economy. The result:  A recession in 1990-1991 was followed by recovery and expansion well below historical averages for job creation and economic growth.
</ul><p>
	In the last five years, taxpayers have been burdened by two major tax increases. These tax hikes have failed to achieve their economic and income redistribution objectives. The result has been lackluster economic growth and persistent budget deficits. To help reverse this failed approach, Congress is preparing what is, in reality, a modest tax cut. The tax relief is only a fraction of the 1990 and 1993 tax increases, and taxpayers will see their tax bills decline by less than 2.2 percent compared to current law. But the proposed changes are at least a welcome step in the right direction of a tax code that would stimulate the economy.

<p><blockquote>
	"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be taken from another program."  Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

<a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Relationship Between Total Expenditures and Medicaid Spending, 1990-2002<br>
<a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a>: States With More Than 50% Increase in Medicaid Payments Supported by Their Own State Revenue, 1990-2002<br><p>
While attention recently has focused on the problems of the Medicare system, Congress shortly will try to tackle another health care financial time bomb in the form of Medicaid, the health care program serving the nation's poor. If significant reforms are not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to Medicaid. And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the rate for total state spending, states will be forced either to increase taxes or to divert money from other programs.
<p>
Medicaid is a state-administered program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
	The cost of Medicaid to the federal government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid costs will almost double by 2002.
<p>
	Although the financial impact on the federal government under current law is alarming, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid. States can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal rules requiring that certain levels of coverage be provided to certain populations.
<p>
	To examine the probable future budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend using certain assumptions to forecast the state share of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002. First, the Heritage analysis assumes no change in the current Medicaid program. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level Medicaid burden if Congress does nothing to reform this program. Second, where possible, a state's Medicaid spending trend is adjusted by expected changes in state economic activity, by forecasted changes in the eligible population, and by the trend in federal Medicaid transfers to the state.
<p>
	The forecasts for future state Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between historical Medicaid spending changes and fluctuations in the state's economic activity and Medicaid-eligible population. In four cases, however, the relationship was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in spending; these are identified with an asterisk on <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Table 1</a>. This table shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the states are to meet their projected Medicaid expeditures.
<P>

Highlights
<p>
	Between 1995 and 2002, if no reforms are enacted, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money on Medicaid. Total state Medicaid spending over this period is projected to be $1,730 billion, of which $1,042 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 19 percent of its revenues to the health care program.
<p>
	As <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the twelve-year period between 1990 and 2002.
<p>
	Some individual states will be particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $21.5 billion in new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $20 billion; Florida, $15.2 billion; Pennsylvania, $13.7 billion; and Texas $8.6 billion. If these states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $294 per year; New York, by $427; Florida, by $441; Pennsylvania, by $427; and Texas by $211.
<p>
	This rapid growth in the state's Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation infrastructure (see <a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state Medicaid spending that is growing at a rate of 11 percent, while total state spending should grow at an 8 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8 percent rate.
<P>
	Again, some states will be hit particularly hard. <a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a> shows those states that are forecasted to have increases in Medicaid spending from their own revenues that are greater than 50 percent.
<p>

Technical Assumptions
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the additional funds states would need to raise to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<P>
	We assumed no change in the current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. We used this as the basic structure of future Medicaid spending.
<P>
	These baseline forecasts of state Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher federal Medicaid program spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $98 billion over the period 1996 to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

<h3><i>THE COST OF NO MEDICARE REFORM:  WHAT INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT WOULD PASS ON TO CONSUMERS, INVESTORS, TAXPAYERS, AND WORKERS</i></h3>

Table 1 -- <a href="fyi67a.gif">The Impact of a 3.52% Medicare Payroll Tax by Industry</a><br>
Table 2 -- <a href="fyi67b.gif">The Impact of an Additional 3.52% Medicare Payroll Tax By Amount of Tax</a><br>
<p>
If an unreformed Medicare program is to be able to pay the hospital bills of today's workers when they reach retirement, industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors and consumers. In addition, workers will face additional annual costs of at least $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages. These costs will be the result of the additional payroll taxes, on top of current payroll taxes, needed to assure long-term fiscal solvency of the cash-strapped Medicare hospitalization trust fund if no reforms are enacted. The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience indicates that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation.1  Moreover, the cost of stabilizing the hospital trust fund is only part of the necessary burden if reforms are not implemented. To cover the rising costs of Part B, which covers physicians' costs, Congress would have to raise taxes even further.<p>The current financial status of Medicare is precarious. Without significant structural reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt. For Medicare to remain financially solvent and legally able to pay for hospital care for today's "baby boomers" when they retire, Congress needs either to find additional money for the hospital trust fund or to slow down its rate of spending.
<P>
<b>Trustees' Tax Options.</b> The seven members of Medicare's Board of Trustees have determined that the Medicare Hospitalization (HI, or Part A) Trust Fund that finances hospital services for the elderly will be insolvent by 2002. In addressing the tax question, the trustees have outlined three possible options to solve the financing problem if no structural reforms are enacted:  a short-term option of an immediate 1.3 percent additional payroll tax, needed to keep the hospital program solvent for 25 years; an intermediate option of a 3.52 percent payroll tax, needed now to make the hospital program permanently solvent; and a high-cost option of a 3.9 percent payroll tax, needed if no action is taken until the actual depletion of the Medicare trust fund in seven years.2  For purposes of econometric analysis, the authors of this study used the trustees' intermediate option of a 3.52 percent payroll tax, under which Congress, rather than adopt structural changes in the program, would keep Medicare basically the same and finance the same level of benefits and projected costs through tax increases. Under this scenario, the trust fund would be able to pay for hospital care for the foreseeable future, not just for the next 25 years.
Under this option, an additional tax of 3.52 percent of taxable payroll would be "shared" between employers and employees. According to earnings data by industry taken from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>, the total yearly cost of this additional HI payroll tax would have been $123 billion, or about two percent of Gross Domestic Product, had such a tax gone into effect in 1993. On average, using an 88 percent "pass through," and had the tax increase been in effect in 1993, the combined direct tax and indirect wage loss to employees would have been about $862 per employee, for a total cost to employees of $115.7 billion (out of the $123 billion).3<P>The amount of new tax not paid directly by employees or indirectly passed through to them would take the form of additional costs to customers and investors. The analysis delineates the impact by industry of a 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax. Overall, using the 88 percent "pass through" effect on employee wages and compensation, and had the tax been in effect in 1993, industry would have $7.4 billion to pass on to consumers and investors, rather than to employees. If the tax were imposed now, that number could be much larger because of the growth in earnings since 1993.
<p>
Retail trade, educational services, and public administration would be the hardest hit by such a tax, together shouldering nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers, and investors. The retail trade industry alone will have to pass at least $800 million on to customers and investors, with educational services and public administration passing on $542 million and $487 million, respectively.
<P>
Unlike the private sector, public-sector employers do not have the luxury of passing on costs such as additional Medicare payroll taxes to customers and investors. Taxes must be increased or programs cut to pay for whatever costs are not passed on to employees in the form of reduced wages and compensation. Moreover, taxpayers potentially could fund a larger share of the burden of the additional payroll tax than customers and investors in the private sector since government pay scales and contracts could restrict their ability to pass on additional costs to employees.
<p>
Table 1 -- <a href="fyi67a.gif">The Impact of a 3.52% Medicare Payroll Tax by Industry</a><br>
Table 2 -- <a href="fyi67b.gif">The Impact of an Additional 3.52% Medicare Payroll Tax By Amount of Tax</a>
<p>
<b>APPENDIX <br>
COST CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS</b><br>
<p>
<b>Cost of HI Tax by Standard Industrial Classification Code</b><br>
The national aggregate of employee earnings by industry was derived from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. These earnings are for 1993. The cost calculations assume the payroll tax increase had been in effect that year; the normal growth in earnings means that the payroll tax and its associated costs would be higher in 1996 and subsequent years.
<p>
Due to the nature of self-reported income surveys, the CPS generally underestimates earnings. In order to develop a multiplier to adjust the CPS-reported earnings, we compared the CPS total with the national employee and proprietor earnings reported in the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> table on national income in 1993 (as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <i>Survey of Current Business</i>, April 1994).
<p>
After April 1986, all state and local employees were required to pay Medicare taxes. In 1991, however, the law was amended to allow those hired before that date to opt out. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that as of March 1994, 1.7 million workers were not covered by Medicare. Using the 1.7 million figure, we removed the exempt workers and their earnings from each industry class based on the distribution of state and local government employees in each category according to the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>.
<p>
Based on a survey of economic literature estimating the "pass-through" wage effect of employer mandates by health care econometrics firm Lewin-VHI, we assumed 88 percent of the cost of the additional tax to be passed on to employees in reduced compensation. We also assumed that the pass-through had fully occurred. Therefore, we assumed the total cost of the additional Medicare tax to employees to be 88 percent of the business's share of the Medicare tax (about 1.56 percent) in addition to the 1.76 percent tax on wages paid directly by the employee. 
<p>
The cost of the HI tax to customers, investors, and taxpayers is the remaining 12 percent not passed through to employees.
<p>
Note on "Children."  The <i>Current Population Survey</i> classifies all wage earners under the age of 15 as "children."  Because these workers, who include such individuals as young farm workers, are not officially considered part of the labor force, the CPS does not collect specific industry information on these wage earners. The CPS, however, does not collect income data for wage earners under 15, and so in reality the wages identified by CPS for "children" category are the results of miscoding by CPS and actually accrue to wage earners aged 15 and above. These miscoded wage earners and their employers do pay the HI payroll tax on reported income. Thus they are included in this analysis under the separate, non-industry-specific category of "children" used by the CPS.

<p>
<b>INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODES</b><br>
There are 236 categories for the employed, with 1 additional category for the experienced unemployed. These categories are aggregated into 51 detailed groups and 23 major groups. Numbers in parentheses are the 1987 SIC code equivalent. "Pt" means part, "n.e.c."  means not elsewhere classified.

<title>FEHBP Controls Costs: Lessons for Medicare Reformers</title>

<h3><i>FEHBP CONTROLS COSTS AGAIN: 
MORE LESSONS FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS</i></h3>

	While Members of Congress wrestle with the problem of how to fix the nearly bankrupt Medicare program, they will not be worrying about the future of their own health care system. Even those Members planning to retire next year have no cause for concern. The reason:  Beginning on November 13 and running through December 11 of this year, these same Members of Congress, along with millions of federal workers, retirees, and their dependents, will have a unique opportunity to pick the private insurance plan and combination of health benefits they think best for them for next year. Retiring members will continue to enjoy this privilege. They can do this because they are enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular, 35-year-old, consumer-driven system with almost 400 private health plans competing nationwide. 
<p>
	<b>Broad Choice.</b> Unlike Medicare beneficiaries, who are locked into an inflexible government-standardized benefits package, these special Americans enjoy a broad range of consumer choice practically denied to all other Americans. For these enrollees in the FEHBP, there is even more good news:  Not only can they pick and choose from a wide variety of private plans, with a variety of prices and benefits, but they also can pocket the savings that result from wise choices. 
<p>
	<b>Cost Control.</b> While Medicare costs are soaring at 10.5 percent per year, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal agency that runs the FEHBP, recently trumpeted to Members of Congress and congressional retirees the good news that next year they can look forward to insignificant premium increases, and that many will see no premium increases at all. "Employees and retirees shopping for health care coverage in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for 1996," declares OPM, "will find a total average premium increase of only four tenths of one percent, compared to an average private sector premium increase of more than six percent over a comparable period."1  For this year, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent, and in 1994 they rose just 3 percent.<p>	<b>Government Help.</b> Under current law, the government contributes about 72 percent of the cost of the premium of any private plan that Members of Congress and congressional and federal retirees choose. If, in any given year, these consumers wish to keep their private plans, they do not have to do anything. If they wish to change their plans and get better value for their dollars, they may do so. Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees may wish to remain in more expensive plans because they think that a richer set of benefits or a more attractive combination of benefits is worth the cost to them. Next year, according to OPM, federal employees and retirees will see an average biweekly increase of just 44 cents for self-only coverage and only $2.25 for family health insurance coverage. Over 25 percent of enrollees will not experience any rate increase in 1996.2<p>	<b>Solid Information.</b> The federal government assists Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees with a financial contribution toward the purchase of their plan and with unbiased information on various plan offerings. This information is supplemented by helpful information from private-sector organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available to workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality, and price. For congressional and federal retirees, the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE), a major organization representing over 500,000 active and retired personnel, suggests the best plans for those needing specialized medical services. <i>Washington Consumers Checkbook</i> even rates plans according to comprehensive patient surveys to help FEHBP enrollees pick plans.
<p>
	While reforming Medicare, Members of Congress should keep in mind key lessons from their own experience in the FEHBP. 
<p>
	<b>LESSON #1: Consumer choice and competition control costs, even in an insurance pool comprised of older workers and a disproportionate number of retirees.</b> Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. Surprisingly, the FEHBP is not an ideal insurance pool, with a large number of younger, healthier workers cross-subsidizing a much smaller group of older workers and retired personnel. Instead, the federal workforce is significantly older than the private-sector workforce; the average federal worker is 43.8 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is 37.7 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily over the past several years. And while private firms are reducing and even eliminating retiree health benefits, approximately 40 percent of all subscribers in the FEHBP are retirees,3 helping to make the total insurance pool itself progressively older. Most federal retirees today have access to the Medicare system as a result of changes in the Social Security law in 1983, but approximately 200,000 still rely on FEHBP plans as their primary health insurance. Nonetheless, even retirees with Medicare coverage are more costly to the system than active federal workers. 
<p>
	The FEHBP has demonstrated a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent. 
<p>
	<b>LESSON #2: Federal workers and retirees would have enjoyed even greater personal savings in the FEHBP if Congress had guaranteed federal workers a defined contribution, indexed to inflation, instead of relying on the current government formula.</b> Today, the federal government contributes to the cost of each private plan chosen by Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees. The maximum dollar amount contributed by the federal government is set legally by a formula which requires OPM to calculate the government contribution on the basis of the average premium of the six largest plans in the program:  the "Big Six" formula. Current law also specifies that the federal government can contribute no more than 75 percent of the premium cost of any given plan. This means that, in any given year, the government's contribution will vary, depending upon the OPM staff's negotiating skills and the annual premium performance of the six largest plans in the program. One proposal advanced by Heritage scholars to reform the FEHBP, and also incorporated in this year's Congressional Budget Resolution, is to replace the Big Six formula with a clearly defined annual dollar amount for individual and family coverage.4 This is similar to the voucher proposal for Medicare now being considered by Congress. <p>	Future increases in that dollar amount would be based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Private plans competing directly for the dollars of federal workers and retirees thus would have a powerful incentive to offer attractive packages of benefits at a price at or even below the fixed dollar amount, thereby reducing the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increasing their savings even more. Competition among private insurance plans would intensify, and federal workers would get to pocket any difference between the defined contribution and the actual price of a plan. With the elimination of the existing 75 percent cap on the government contribution, workers who picked lower cost plans would not be penalized by any reduction in the dollar value of the government's contribution, and those who picked higher cost plans would not be rewarded by the government. 
<p>
	<b>Lost Compensation.</b> If the defined contribution rule had been in effect in recent years, federal workers and retirees generally would have done better financially than they do under the current formula. In any case where FEHBP's premium performance dipped below the Consumer Price Index beyond any other savings achieved through careful choice of plan, federal workers and retirees would have experienced a gain in overall compensation. For example, under the current formula, the maximum government contribution for 1996 will be $3,432.26 for family coverage and $1,599.26 for single coverage. Under the 1996 Congressional Budget Resolution establishing a defined contribution, the federal government's contribution would be $3,547 for family coverage and $1,587 for single coverage.5 <p>	Under such a defined contribution arrangement, federal workers and retirees would be able to pocket the difference between the defined contribution and the cost of any plan. Given recent premium performance, they would have fared better under a clearly defined dollar contribution over three of the last five years:6<p>	Such a change in FEHBP financing to establish clear and predictable increases in the government contribution would allow federal workers, retirees, and their families to take full advantage of any positive changes in the competitive market for insurance.
<p>
	Moving from a defined benefits to a defined contribution system would be a good deal for federal workers and retirees. Such a change also makes sense for the Medicare system. The FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs.

<center><h2>Debt Ceiling Politics:<br>
Economists and Investors React</h2></center>
<hr>
<center>[ <a href="#quotes">Skip Introduction</a> ]</center> <P><i>As congressional Republicans move toward passing a federal budget that cuts spending and taxes and balances the budget by 2002, Clinton administration officials warn of a government default if there is any delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling.  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has warned that a debt limit "crisis" could "interrupt Government operations,... generate uncertainty in the domestic and international securities markets, and increase the Government's cost of borrowing."  And White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta has accused congressional Republicans of "playing with fire" by rattling the financial markets with the specter of default.  But  financial markets look at the future, not the present.  In fact, leading investors and economists seem to be more concerned about the failure to bring federal spending under control than they are about temporary non-payment of debts.</i><P>

<h3><center>WHAT ABOUT</a> 
A "TRAIN WRECK"?</h3></center>
<ul>
"It would be tragic if delaying payments of interest and/or principal on U.S. Treasury obligations is needed to compel our Administration and Congress to achieve an agreement to balance the Federal budget.  The implications of even temporarily delaying these payments are broad, important, and profound.
<P>
However, let's not allow fears of temporary "market instability" to serve as an excuse for equivocating on spending cuts and entitlement reform.  Markets look at the future, not the present.  Despite widespread predictions that the Dow would drop "hundreds of points" at the onset of the Gulf War, it rose over a hundred points the first hour after bombing began.  The markets focused on the solution to the problem, not the bombing.  If the so-called train wreck occurs, the markets will focus on the eventual outcome.  If the markets believe the chaos will finally lead to decisive action, they will rise.  If the markets believe decisive action will not be forthcoming, they will decline.  Whatever the expectations, they will overwhelm disruptions  caused by the delay of these payments.  If decisive action is the end result, there will be no "black mark" on treasury securities; rather, lower government borrowing costs will be the result for years to come.
<P>
Be assured, we are not advocating the so-called train wreck.  Paying interest when due and principal at maturity on its securities is about as inviolate a commitment of the U.S. government as there can be.  As serious and deep as our differences are on how to achieve a balanced budget, they are clearly bridgeable.  An agreement which balances the budget and achieves long term entitlement reform is within our reach as a nation.  The true question is whether it is within the reach of our political leaders.  While such agreement should be achievable without default, from a financial market standpoint, the costs our economy will bear from a temporary default are less than the costs we now bear from the uncertainties about our budget outlook.  The costs of our political leaders failing to produce deficit reduction are greater than those of failing temporarily to pay interest and /or principal on U.S. Treasury securities.
<P>
Let us do neither.  Stop the nonsense and rhetoric.  Sit down and solve this thing for the good of America.  Now."</ul>

<ul>"...As for payments to U.S. debt holders, a potential default will be no more than a bump along the road to a balanced budget.  In 1987 and 1990, the government hit against the debt ceiling, and we heard the same apocalyptic rhetoric we hear today.  In 1985, as Congress and the Reagan administration were busy erecting the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings guillotine, the debt ceiling was reached, and default loomed.  Relying on a number of technical fixes, the Treasury Department was able to forestall actual default, but the uncertainty lasted more than a month.  Did the market implode?  Far from it:  Stocks actually staged a rally taking the S&P index to its then-all-time high.  There's a lesson in that earlier experience that holds true today:  The value of the debt investors buy depends on the dynamism of the U.S. economy -- not the fate of the U.S. government." -- <i>Wall Street Journal 10/13/95</i>

<ul>"Tying the statutory debt ceiling legislation to a major fiscal policy initiative is not new.  Of course, everybody knows that any technical 'default' or disruption would be the result of the game of political chicken rather than questionable economic soundness.  That is precisely why its impact on financial markets would be temporary and costless.  Presently, the pattern of moderate economic growth, vastly improving inflation fundamentals and the expectation that the Fed will lower its funds rate target to ease the restrictive stance of monetary policy, set the stage for further declines in interest rates.
<P>
Any disruption in the Treasury's auction schedule or delay in interest payments would not influence these fundamental determinants of lower interest rates.  The last time the debt ceiling legislation become embroiled in the fiscal debate -- in fall 1990-- financial markets were nonplused by the political game-playing, and interest rates declined continuously.  Financial markets reward credibility and responsibility of policymakers, both monetary and fiscal.  Is it possible that a 'default related' disruption would actually accelerate the decline in rates -- providing net long-run savings to taxpayers -- by raising the perceived probability of a quicker enactment of fiscal reform"?

<ul>"If Congress, or the American public is looking for an honest assessment of how the financial markets will react to this Budget Showdown, they need only review recent history of the world currency markets.  Increasingly, over the last few years, the currency markets have been acting as the world's credit-market-Cop.  The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of Congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S.'s credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the Crime Bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks.

<ul>"'Train Wreck'?  What Train Wreck?  Seriously, as President Reagan told Budget Director James Miller in 1986, 'Let's shut down the government and see if any one notices.'  In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes.  They are not worried about the government's short-term borrowing needs.  If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now.  Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue.  Tax policy makes the world go around.  Lower taxes mean lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices.  Higher taxes mean the reverse.  Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried.  Not only would that be bad news for the economy and the financial markets, it would also be bad news for Republicans.  They would lose big at the ballot box."

<ul>"I am confident that no default will occur even if the debt limit is not raised before November 15.  The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have many ways of preventing this from occurring.  Moreover, investors are sophisticated and know that even if a technical default occurs they will still be paid all that is due them shortly.  And even in a worse case scenario, in which a technical default raises borrowing costs slightly, this will be more than offset by the reduction in borrowing costs that will result from shrinking government spending and balancing the federal budget.  For these reasons, Congress should not allow the Clinton Administration's scare tactics to derail the first real effort in 25 years to get the budget under control."

<ul>"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and short-lived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reductions, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<h2>A People's Budget</h2>
<P>
By <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Eisenach">Jeffrey A. Eisenach</a></center><p>
<P>




	Congress is in trouble again.  Recent polls show people are less and less satisfied with its performance.  Indeed, according to a recent survey, only 35 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its job.
<p>
	Liberals would have us believe the problem stems from Republican efforts to "go too far" or "cut too much."  As ABC anchorman Peter Jennings put it, they believe the November election was nothing more than a  "temper tantrum."  People didn't really know what they were doing on November 8, the theory goes, and the more they now read about "draconian" cuts, the more they come to realize that balancing the budget, cutting Federal spending and -- worst of all -- getting some of their money back in the form of tax cuts, was just a childish fantasy.
<p>
	But a closer look at voter's attitudes leaves no doubt it's liberals who are fantasizing.   Many Americans who are dissatisfied with Congress say they want more cut from federal spending, not less.  Republicans may be in trouble, but if so it's because they are moving too slowly, cutting too little, compromising too much.  Republican Members went back to their districts for the August recess expecting to hear angry constituents complaining about program cuts.  Instead, they were told to keep at it; even on the contentious issue of Medicare, Members found most voters agreeing that the system needs major reform before it bankrupts the government.
<p>
	Managing their new majority is no picnic for the Republican leadership.  True, a majority of House Republicans are freshmen and sophomores, most of whom understand voters' want dramatic change.  But  four out of ten Republican Congressmen have been in Congress for six years or more, long enough to have a big stake in the status quo.  And while House Speaker Newt Gingrich wisely appointed a number of younger members to chair important committees and subcommittees, 57 of the 101 chairmen have been in Congress for ten years or more.
<p>
	And then there's the Senate, where the average age among Republicans is 58, and the average Congressional tenure (counting time in the House for those who served there first) is 10.2 years.  Virtually all of the leading Senate "moderates" are also old bulls -- Senators Cohen, Chafee, Jeffords and Hatfield have, between them,  served in Congress for 95 years!
<p>
	In <i>The People's Budget</I>, a recently released book I co-authored with former Perot pollster Frank Luntz and three others, we started out by asking what kind of Federal government Americans thought they were getting when they voted to end 40 years of Democratic rule. The answer:  They wanted to shrink the government in Washington by at least 25 percent, and most wanted it cut by fully one-third.
<p>
	Importantly, people were not necessarily anti-government -- just anti-Washington.  They wanted power sent back to them:  To the people, to local governments, and to the states.
<p>
	With that in mind, we designed a complete budget of the U.S. government, a budget that shrinks Federal spending as a proportion of the gross domestic product from its current level of more than 21 percent down to 15.7 percent, precisely the one-third cut most people said they wanted.  We do it by getting the Federal government completely out of areas where most people don't think it belongs (education, welfare, roads and sewers, etc.), by getting serious about cutting corporate welfare and other special interest spending, and by moving quickly to replace the obsolete Medicare program with a market-oriented system that will guarantee better care for the elderly at a much lower cost.
<p>
	All of this is possible with no smoke and mirrors.  We used the same conservative economic assumptions applied by the Congressional Budget Office, and didn't even count the savings in interest on the debt that would result from balancing the budget over seven years.
<p>
	By shrinking Washington's budget, our proposal would increase the family budget -- eliminating most Federal excise taxes (e.g. on gasoline, telephones and tobacco) and cutting income taxes 22 percent beyond what Republicans are now proposing.
<p>
	Most members of the Republican leadership support this kind of serious downsizing.  Speaker Gingrich has called our plan "a blue-print for replacing the welfare state," and Budget Committee Chairman Kasich even wrote the foreword for the book.  On the Democratic side, some members, like Mississippi Congressman Mike Parker, are to the right of many Republicans in supporting real change.  There just aren't enough of them.
<p>
	All the data suggests the voters are still where they were on November 8, looking for a Congress that will pass a "people's budget" that dramatically shrinks the government in Washington.  But the evidence is mounting that it's going to take one more election -- now barely a year away -- to reinforce the revolutionary troops voters sent to Congress last November.

<h2>A Budget for the People</h2>
<P>
By <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Luntz">Frank Luntz</a></center><p>
<P>

	Public opinion research -- polling -- is one of the critical devices by which the political class comes to know the hopes and dreams, the fears and concerns of the electorate. Although much maligned, it is, as Ben Wattenberg noted, one of America's three unique contributions to the practice of democracy.

<p>	As Congress begins the daunting task of balancing the Federal budget, what are the American people saying about the budget in dozens of national surveys and dozens of focus groups in all regions of the country?  They offer a single, definitive conclusion:  The American people consider the dramatic reduction and restructuring of the government in Washington to be far more than a fiscal necessity; they consider it a moral imperative.
<p>
	The imperative is to cut spending, not balance the budget. This is an important distinction.  The budget deficit is, to be sure, a symptom of Washington's lack of fiscal discipline. But most Americans do not regard eliminating the deficit per se to be an urgent priority.
<p>
	When people seek to explain why American society seems to be crumbling about them, they point fingers at Washington.  The Federal budget is not merely wasteful -- the public estimates that about 50 cents of every dollar goes up in smoke -- it is often injurious to the health of our nation.
<p>
	The electorate takes a collective look around and sees what 30 years of bloated budgets in Washington has built -- high rise ghettos, consigning the poor to live in cesspools of crime and drugs -- and it thinks, "not with my tax dollars you don't."  They see Washington subsidizing illegitimacy in the inner city and vile artistic contempt for religion in the comfortable suburbs, and they say, "this is wrong."
<p>
	Eighty percent of the American public thinks that declining individual morality and the breakup of the family presage a crisis that will be the dominant political issue into the new millennium.  What voters want is for the government in Washington to stop spending money that is destructive to American civilization.
<p>
	When we ask the public what they are looking for from Washington, they emphasize four key elements:  accountability, responsibility, simplicity, and common sense.
<p>
<UL><LI>Accountability to hold their politicians answerable for what they say and what they do. Accountability to hold the programs liable for what is promised.
<P>
<li>Responsibility, that involves sending programs back home because you can hold your Representatives more beholden when you can touch them and feel them, which you can do in local government but you can't do in Washington.
<P>
<LI>Simplicity, that involves everything from the tax structure to all the various programs that do the same thing over and over and over again in a bureaucratic maze.
<P>
<li>Common sense, to recognize that programs delivered into the South Bronx will not be the same type of programs that you would deliver in South Dakota. They want each line in the budget to pass this simple test:  Does it move us toward or away from a healthy society of high moral character -- would I impose it on my family and neighborhood?
</ul><p>
	These are the four elements voters want to see in the Federal budget currently being written in the House and Senate.  They are less interested in how much needs to be cut to balance the budget than they are that the government stop spending money on things it cannot do well.
<p>
	The new majority in Congress should craft a budget that the American people, and not Washington policy wonks and lobbyists, want. That is why I co-authored a new book, <i>The People's Budget: A Common Sense Plan for Shrinking the Government in Washington</i>, which we believe is the budget the American people would write for the federal government.
<p>
	Among the main features of this people's budget:
<p>
	The responsibility for designing, running and paying for state and local programs should be returned to the states and localities, where it belongs -- and where people can hold elected officials more accountable for producing results.
<p>
	This would allow the government in Washington to be nearly one-third smaller, as a percentage of GDP, than it is today -- down from 22 percent to around 15 percent of GDP.
<p>
	Taxes would be reduced, giving people the funds to take care of themselves and their families, and giving states and localities the tax base they would need to take on their new responsibilities.
<p>
	Medicare would begin the transformation from a 1960s "command and control" bureaucracy to a 1990s system of consumer choice.
<p>
	The Federal budget would be balanced, and the debt would begin to shrink rapidly relative to the size of the economy.  With Medicare saved from bankruptcy and the budget deficit finally eliminated, the foundation would have been created to deal with the looming crisis in Social Security.
<p>
	Although many pollsters like to discuss their methodologies with reverent and obscure scientific-sounding terms, what we do is not rocket science -- indeed it is much more an art than any kind of science. There is no great mystery to what the American people want from their political leaders at this junction in our history.  They want hope, and they hope that we can arrest the decline of our society's character by arresting and then reversing the growth in our government.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

consulting firm. He serves on the University of California Board of Regents and recently 
testified in favor of the California Civil Rights Initiative.</I></B>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>

<B>HERMAN CAIN <I>is the president and chief executive officer of Godfather's Pizza, with 
more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

<i>NEW YORK, JANUARY 12</i>
<hr>
<h2>This 'Liar' Business </h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>





I want in on the Hillary business, for reasons natural (that's where 
the action is) and unnatural (I am among those who think it important 
what language you use). The water she lives in had been getting hotter 
and hotter, and then a few days ago columnist William Safire of the 
New York Times ran his diagnostic fingers over the accumulation and 
concluded that Hillary Clinton is "a congenital liar." 
<p>
One winces a little on seeing the charge against her expressed in 
exactly that language. To begin with, we don't know -- do we? -- 
whether when she emerged from the womb shouting Beeeh! she knew very 
well that the situation called for her to shout Baaah! but as a 
congenital liar she could not avoid dissimulation. A liar being 
someone who somewhere along the line took to telling untruths, a 
congenital liar is someone who tells untruths because the truth simply 
won't come out of his lips. In the feud a few years ago between 
Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, kindled by Miss McCarthy's saying 
nobody could believe anything Miss Hellman said, Lillian complained, 
and Mary reiterated that everything Lillian writes is a lie, including 
"and" and "the." 
<p>
At that level, of course, charges and countercharges become polemical 
flourishes intended to titillate onlookers. They are no longer 
clinical distinctions between the truth and the non-truth. So by 
adding the qualifier "congenital," Mr. Safire gave away too much 
ground, and soon the whole country was seeing a smiling President 
telling a crowded press conference that, as President of the United 
States, he suffered under certain "constraints" which prevented him 
from dealing with Mr. Safire as he'd have done in private life. For 
those whose imagination wasn't keen enough to know just what that was, 
the White House press secretary Mike McCurry had given a hint. Citizen 
Bill Clinton would have poked Citizen Bill Safire in the nose. 
<p>
Now what seeps through all that stuff is, actually, some idea of what 
remains of the House of Chivalry. Not much. When that house was 
intact, you would never see a man seated in a bus while a woman was 
left standing. Any man who threatened publicly to poke another man in 
the nose wouldn't be noticed nowadays, on the grounds that that threat  was probably made in a crowded bar, where nobody heard or cared, or 
else it was made in a press conference announcing what the intention 
was of Mike Tyson to do to the challenger sometime in the future in 
Las Vegas. It is really surprising that the women's lobby didn't 
resent the language used by Mr. Clinton against Mr. Safire on the 
grounds that manifestly, it was sexist-talk. He wouldn't have said it 
if Mr. Safire's quarry had been a male. 
<p>
And so we arrive at the piquancy in this situation. Mrs. Clinton said 
a half-dozen things that weren't correct, most conspicuously that she 
hadn't personally insisted on firing the seven-man White House Travel 
staff. In fact, according to her ex-employee and Clinton pal Mr. 
Watkins, she did want them fired. 
<p>
But what fascinates is that this episode and a few others having to do 
with the nature of her relationship with the Madison Guaranty outfit 
invite the formal scrutiny of investigating panels and, theoretically, 
the courts themselves, because perjury is contingently involved. 
<p>
But the man who, if he weren't President, would poke Bill Safire in 
the nose, "lies," if that is the word for it, quite consistently. 
Anyone who has watched the tube over the past couple of months will 
have lost count of the frequency of Mr. Clinton's telling the people 
that the objective of the Republican Party's budget drive is to hurt 
the old, the homeless, the sick, the lame, the children, and the 
environment. If something is not true, and it is nonetheless affirmed, 
that gives us a lie, and the generator of that lie, is -- a liar? 
Forget the "congenital" business -- about which most of us don't know 
very much, since our memory reaches back only to when Mr. Clinton in 
the Sixties took marijuana but didn't inhale. How is it that 
politicians are shielded as they are? To get to the White House one 
promises one thing, does another. Or else reaffirms on Monday what one 
repudiates on Tuesday? Some would go so far as to guess that if he 
were simply "Mr." Clinton even then he wouldn't actually go to Mr. 
Safire's office and poke him in the nose. Clinton reserves such 
activity for larger bodies, like the Republican Party, or Congress, or 
the voters who vote for the wrong people. The voters who were lied to.

<html><Head><title>Buckley: Forbes's Rich Problem - 1/16/96</title></head>

<i>NEW YORK, JANUARY 16</i>
<hr>
<h2>Forbes's Rich Problem</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>






Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last November, that he would get anywhere tended 
to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy, yet here he is, 
running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday 
the other candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He 
escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by fellow Republicans, of 
course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>
He has split the conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm 
went after him lustily. This was in part a professional obligation 
(there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with 
Steve Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from 
Forbes's ads).
<p>
Forbes has of course been baiting Gramm in a television and radio 
campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. His complaint is 
that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays 
insufficient heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to 
supply-side policies. Gramm counters that you can't have effective tax 
relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes 
resists this, preferring to cite the prodigality of growth when the 
yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. It is a nice quarrel, and 
conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win. 
<p>
Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political 
scene are difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed 
Lamar Alexander to cope with. His company has a private airplane 
blissfully named Capitalist Tool. And his company has a gorgeous big 
yacht, which will take you around the world, if you press the right 
button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has examined 
the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, 
but the records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining 
them. The primary weight of their expense rests on the shoulders of 
the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>
There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing 
of great wealth. The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was 
relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing inclinations do not go in 
lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there 
were three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell 
Harriman was standard-bearer of the left wing of the Democratic Party; 
challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing of 
the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist 
fellow-traveler running on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen 
were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>
So that the Republican public, in a Republican primary, is not going 
to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve Forbes's wealth. It 
is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at 
the disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor 
souls who have to spend half of every day collecting nickels and dimes 
from house to house; but there is no indication that the public is put 
off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference 
between the cited popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people 
who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>
His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat 
tax would hurt the middle class, specifically, those who earn between 
$70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the first year, 
perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per 
cent, disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate 
income would mean a deficit, but one which, he vows, would soon 
disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. But of 
course the first thing done by the other candidates and their 
accomplices was to try to figure out how much less this would 
hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with what they 
figure out he paid last year. 
<p>
The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was justifiably inflamed 
at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for 
President of the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that 
will save the new President money on his income tax. The gentle Steve 
Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A 
rather convincing point: It doesn't really make sense to spend $20 
million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish one's tax 
payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the 
Hollywood movie whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered 
either of two alternative posts: Commissioner of Baseball, or 
President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his 
moustache, then said, "Which pays more?" 
<p>
Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.
<p>

<html><head><title>Buckley: Is There a God Behind Religion? - 1/19/96
</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>NEW YORK, JANUARY 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Is There a God Behind Religion?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


 

Most public discussion of religion has to do with earnest 
constitutional and political quarrels. Does the First Amendment 
prohibit the recitation of a public prayer in the public schools? The 
display of a crcche at Christmas? The display of the Ten Commandments? 
Then there are the derivative issues: Is the Christian Coalition 
dominating GOP politics? Do Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed have a 
stranglehold on the Republican Platform on the question of abortion? 
Homosexual marriages? Euthanasia?
<p>
Odd, but almost never does the discussion turn on religion itself. 
i.e., what is the excitement all about? If students heard a prayer in 
the public schools, or if religious sentiment crystallized against 
abortion, what is it all about? The public schools, for two 
generations, have proceeded without any notice taken of religion, as 
the Supreme Court has decreed. Interesting question, What about non-
public schools? Obviously one begins by excluding schools that are 
explicitly religious in orientation. One would expect that in the 
Catholic parochial schools, the Orthodox Jewish schools, the Episcopal 
schools, religion is an explicit factor. But what about others? There 
are 240 private boarding schools in America. What do they do? The 
Supreme Court isn't going to tell them what to do. They can worship 
the god Pan, if that's what the trustees decree. 
<p>
One doesn't know where to turn for an answer to that question: How 
does religion fare in the private non-denominational schools? But the 
mere inquiry provokes the curious mind to ask what is, one supposes, 
the primary question: Why?
<p>
A recent visitor remarks that attendance at her Episcopal Church has, 
in the past half-dozen years, increased by 100 per cent. Why? Is 
there, as we are here and there told, a religious "revival" in the 
offing?
<p>
Again: Why?
<p>
The anthropologists are there to tell us that it is in human nature to 
aspire for a spiritual life, even as it is in human nature to wish to 
exercise sexual appetites, and of course it is biologically necessary 
to appease hunger. The idea of the sociological set is, in effect, to 
say, There there, Mrs. Jones, we quite understand why you believe in 
God, etc., but kindly do so in a fashion that doesn't get in the way 
of public affairs, you know, like bicycle paths, or the diminishing 
supply of buffaloes. 
<p>
What surprises is the relative reticence of the religious community. 
In the United States, overwhelmingly, the Christian community. A 
politician running for office is prepared to say that he believes in 
school prayer because he insists that the Constitution does not 
prohibit school prayer. But ambient folkways prevent him from saying: 
I think Jesus Christ was divine and therefore I find the lessons He 
taught us illuminating and vital in affecting our lives.
<p>
Wow!
<p>
Does that make him an anti-Semite?
<p>
No no, Madam. He is an anti-Semite only in the sense that the patron 
of the Yankees is anti the Red Sox. Never mind the difference in the 
order of gravity, the point is that a Christian exercises his faith 
without believing that others' faiths are wrong, misled; even as, 
mutatis mutandis, the Yankee patron, always free to apostatize from 
his allegiance, nevertheless proceeds to demonstrate his loyalty. The 
Christian owes absolutely nothing more to other religions than a 
respectful toleration of them. The wonderful old saw about the inter-
religious conference in Tokyo fifty years ago is amusingly relevant. 
After the ecumenical blessing at the banquet, one participant turns to 
the pilgrim on his right. "My miserable superstition is Buddhism. What 
is your religion?"
<p>
It would be grand to hear public figures in the course of discussing 
this or that public or private question say, "Well on this matter, I 
am instructed, or try to be, by the New Testament, which, you know, 
tells us that greed is, well, you know, wrong. So is adultery. . . . I 
don't say I live up to the Christian calling, all I say is that I wish 
I did because I recognize it as truth."
<p>
There is no reason at all for the listener whose god speaks different 
tongues to object to the superordination of Christ over, say, Buddha. 
But the question before the house is: Why don't people say, more 
often, Yes, I love my country and my flag, and my God, but let me tell 
you Who my God is, and why what He has told me has for years and years 
given me comfort and fortitude and stimulated my love for -- yes, you, 
Madam. <p>

<title>Buckley: Has the WTO Threatened Us? -- 1/23/96</title>

<h2>
Has the WTO Threatened Us?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Well, it happened: the World Trade Organization ruled against an 
existing law, and people are up in arms. Candidates Dole and Buchanan 
have suggested that this is on the order of the British navy moving in 
to restore the crown as sovereign in U.S. affairs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here is the quarrel. Brazil and Venezuela, in recent months, attempted 
to bring into the United States what we might as well call "dirty 
oil," meaning that it is oil that contains a higher density of 
pollutants than is permitted by the Clean Air Act. So, we denied that 
oil access to the American market. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A suit was filed with the WTO by Brazil and Venezuela, which asserted, 
correctly, that the same quality of oil turned down at our frontier 
was in fact being pumped, sold, and burned within the United States. 
This is, plain and simple, discriminatory, and of course the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade exists in order to protest 
discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the United States has several defenses, none of them conclusive -- 
they are an attenuation of the violation rather than an excuse for it. 
It happens that the load of oil being permitted to market 
notwithstanding its high pollution content was something on the order 
of an exception. The franchise was given with a view to saving a 
considerable deposit of oil, on the understanding that the 
international standard would be invoked beginning in 1998. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now if one engages in a treaty of this kind there has to be an arbiter 
somewhere. The disarmament treaties of the Twenties and Thirties 
failed for many reasons, but one of them was that there was no 
effective tribunal to call attention to the violations of Germany, 
Italy, and Japan. For that reason, a court was set up, armed with the 
power to make a finding (subject to appeal) and to levy either a fine, 
if the situation was not rectifiable, or else compensation (to the 
wounded nation or industry). The court, having ruled against the 
United States, has not come through with a specified penalty, and in 
any event, this being the very first ruling the WTO has come through 
with, there is abounding procedural confusion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One source of the confusion is the motives and political interests of 
the people involved, directly and indirectly. Mickey Kantor is of 
course our trade representative. He is having a hell of a time. On the 
one hand, he very much wants to defend the environmental code approved 
by President Clinton, which means, No dirty oil. On the other hand, he 
desperately wishes to be outside the line of fire directed against 
those who tolerate an extra-national body telling the United States 
what to do. To date, Mr. Kantor has said that in fact the court is 
factually correct; that the court has no right, really, to rule on 
U.S. environmental laws; and that the United States will appeal -- 
probably. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the long perspective on the question is that the GATT treaty was a 
dozen years in formation, under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton 
Administrations, with the Congress as a prime mover. Our motives were 
simple: most trade discrimination in the world is against U.S. 
producers. We have, we thought, and thought correctly, more to gain 
than to lose by endorsing a court that could actually hand down 
rulings of the kind that free up trade. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan are talking about the hideous nature of an 
extra-national authority, and Mr. Buchanan even said that when he 
became President, the first thing he would do is repeal the GATT 
treaty. But the U.S. position is made difficult by the simple fact 
that a) we promoted and passed the GATT agreement (while avoiding the 
treaty requirement to come in with two-thirds of the Senate vote), 
endorsing b) a fact-finding body (the court) that would look into 
complaints and c) dispose of sanctions in the event a signatory was 
found guilty of discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We now have several alternatives. We can resign from GATT, which would 
be a long-term invitation to restricted trading; or we can pay the 
fine or compensation on the Brazilian and Venezuelan oil; or we can 
modify the Clean Air Act to exempt the privileged producer of the 
dirty oil. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What we can't do is argue that somebody took away our lollipop. We are 
a grown-up nation, and if we pulled a fast one at the expense of a law 
we ourselves promoted and ratified, then we should take the 
punishment. If ever the WTO engages in systematic anti-U.S. rulings, 
why it becomes simple. We pull out. But not before that happens.

<title>Buckley: School Uniforms?! -- 1/26/96</title>

<h2>
School Uniforms?!
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
One commentator dealt bravely with the seven general categories of 
national problems addressed by President Clinton and finished his 
appraisal with the sentence, "Why on earth does the leader of the free 
world have to concern himself with school uniforms?"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Well now, there are those who found that the most novel and 
potentially the most resonant sentence in the President's address. 
Flash ahead ten years, close your eyes, answer the question: "What was 
the highlight of President Clinton's State of the Union speech in 
1996?" Right, the answer will be: Oh, that's the speech in which he 
came out for school uniforms. . . . To say that was the "highlight" of 
the speech is of course to take liberties, consigning all else he said 
to generic political thought. The President declared in favor of 
health care, law and order, unity, growth, and husbandry. So does 
every candidate running for President. It was the school-uniform bit 
that caught the attention of the unwary, who asked first, What does 
Mr. Clinton know about school uniforms? and asked second, How is it 
that he intuits their importance?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not long ago a public-school teacher in New York City wrote to the 
Wall Street Journal a letter bristling with authenticity, relating 
that the foremost problem in the city's schools was: discipline. In 
the absence of it, she complained, practically nothing else is 
possible. What has been called the "hijacker's leverage" is operative 
here. Just as one terrorist can dictate the movements of a super-jet 
carrying five hundred passengers, so one unruly student can, for as 
long as he is able to keep it up, affect the climate of a schoolroom. 
In the late Sixties, one senior at Harvard appeared at the office of 
the president hours before the Commencement ceremony demanding that he 
be scheduled as a speaker during the ceremony. If not, he informed the 
stunned president, the ceremony would not proceed. A half-dozen noisy 
protestors, even in an assembly of two thousand, can make solemn 
processions impossible; as also, studious classrooms. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The head of Cardinal Hayes High School in New York made a point of it 
some years ago. That school -- formally a diocesan school although 
many of its students are of other faiths, 85 per cent of them 
minorities -- has arresting academic attainments; 85 per cent of its 
graduates go on to college, compared with less than 15 per cent in 
comparable public schools made up of identically endowed students. It 
is very important, the principal told his visitor, to insist on a 
school uniform. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why? one naturally wondered. Because, he said, the symbol irradiates 
several things. The first is that the student is a member of a 
regulated community. When you are in uniform, your dress bespeaks 
hierarchy. The symbol is very important. At Cardinal Hayes the 
students are simply not expected to be late in arriving at school, and 
punctuality is accepted as a part of the system: related, in a way, to 
the requirement that the students wear their simple grey jackets and 
pants, a shirt and a tie. On the question of disorder in the 
classrooms it is as simple as that there is no disorder in the 
classrooms. Defenders of the antinomian behavior of so many public-
school students confide to you that the reason for the success of the 
private schools is that they simply expel anyone who is in any way 
nonconformist. But such chaos-defenders run into statistics: 2 per 
cent of the students at Cardinal Hayes are expelled. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The maintenance of order, the minor conformity that issues from the 
wearing of identical uniforms, is always a latent problem because the 
schools deal with boys and girls who are going through their unruly 
period in life. The sociologist who some time ago remarked that a 
single broken and unrepaired window is an invitation to corollary 
shambles gave us all an epiphany. Of course it is true! we realize. 
Student unruliness is met in different seasons in different ways. At 
Eton in the 1830s the students outnumbered faculty by about 100 to 1, 
and the notorious Doctor Keate attempted to solve his problem by 
flogging a dozen students every day. We shrink from such measures, but 
ought to welcome civilized substitutes, and the school uniform is the 
beginning of wisdom in this field, and we say hurrah to the President 
for coming upon that insight.

<title>Buckley: Misfire On Drug Policy -- 1/30/96</title>

<h2>
Misfire On Drug Policy
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous 
spokesman is William Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on 
the matter of drugs its analytical powers simply decompose, as though 
the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an 
approach to the legalization of drugs made by seven writers (myself 
included) in this journal. To the title of the symposium -- "The War 
on Drugs Is Lost" -- the Council replies that that is most certainly 
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use 
by non-addicts. It declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The 
planted axiom of course is that that decline is owing to the war on 
drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the number of 
users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 
million? The use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and 
beginning even before that, the deleterious effect of cigarettes was 
so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave up smoking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If 
something is illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to 
the extent that it imprisons those who violate it, thereby 
hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That would seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the 
Council on Crime in America. In 1985, 811,000 arrests were made for 
drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made for drug 
offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. 
An effective law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of 
violators who have to be arrested. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested 
in 1994, how many drug users were not arrested? The Council informs us 
that there are more than 4 million casual users of cocaine (defined as 
people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't they 
been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million 
heavy (at least weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who 
violate the law from once a week, to every two weeks or so. How 
effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the big 
one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, 
and about 10 million who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? 
Does the Council on Crime in America really wish that they were in 
jail?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it sputtered 
forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited 
another Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire 
position on the drug war. We learn that only one criminal is jailed 
for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over one-half of 
America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in 
part, the prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve 
less than one-half their sentences, and the average murderer released 
in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a 
scruffy area of Indianapolis. "He drives up and down in the evenings, 
past anoraked figures who stand outside liquor stores and turn their 
faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people apart from drug 
dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the 
potholes freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: 
he reckons he has arrested one in five of these young men." City 
prosecutors "do not even bring charges against drug dealers until they 
have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found 
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. 
President Bill Clinton's call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds 
pretty hollow in Haughville."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such is overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding 
that the national increase in prison space is threefold since we 
decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a relatively new 
American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. 
"Prisoners pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no 
chairs or tables, so the men pace up and down like zoo animals or 
slouch upon the floor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what has the war done? It has made a mockery of an anti-drug law 
that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced violent felonies in 
pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do 
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless 
adolescents. It is a pity that men and women of the moral and 
intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug legalization as 
the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons 
for repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary 
among them to relieve non-drug users from the heavy load they bear in 
the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won the Hundred 
Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one 
hundred years?

<title>Buckley: The Problem of the Fatherless Child I -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child I
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The weekend paper ran a cartoon by Mike Smith of the North American 
Syndicate. In a sequence, the freckled little girl with long hair, 
reproduced eight times with eight balloons, tells us what she is 
thinking: "This is Cindy." "Cindy is 13 years old." "Which means she 
can't drink." "She can't drive." "She can't even buy cigarettes." 
"Which is all the better for the health and safety . . . of her 
daughter." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October, in this space, I designated the single-parent household, 
as so many others have, as the primary social problem in America. I 
meditated that since the steep rise in illegitimate births over the 
past thirty years (from 5 per cent to 18 per cent among whites; 25 to 
63 per cent among blacks) few ideas have crystallized on how to arrest 
a development that is afflicting one million children per year (they 
will in their lifetime -- mostly before they reach maturity -- run a 
600 per cent greater chance than children raised by two parents of 
life in poverty, criminal activity, addiction to drugs, illiteracy). 
The single novel idea, developed at systematic length, is that of 
Charles Murray, who in his book Losing Ground endorsed an end to 
public welfare as a disincentive to sexual promiscuity (and to sloth). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I asked readers to share with me their own suggestions on how to deal 
with the problem. The reply was overwhelming, over eight hundred 
letters, and I take this opportunity to thank them deeply and to 
apologize for the mechanical impossibility of acknowledging them 
individually.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no mistaking the anger out there. It tends to focus on that 
which is most palpable: The cost imposed on the individual whose 
sexual activity is conventional, by those who proceed to produce 
children who then become, in virtue of the father's absence and 
dereliction, charges to them. One mother writes that she thinks it 
wrong, somehow, that her daughter and son-in-law are postponing a 
family until their material fortunes improve, yet find themselves 
helping to pay for the support of other mothers who do not postpone 
motherhood until after they are married.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some who complain focus on the moral dereliction of the here-today 
gone-tomorrow sire, some focus primarily on the utilitarian question: 
What to do about people who misbehave in a world in which misbehavior 
is usually not defined in a moral context. It may be legal misbehavior 
to deny an opportunity for equal treatment to a minority 18-year old, 
but it is not legal misbehavior to deny equal treatment to an infant 
born out of wedlock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some do focus on the quite extraordinary insouciance of the young 
generation of studs. One lawyer from South Dakota who has heard "over 
seven hundred child-support cases" sends along a transcript (the names 
of the principals are blacked out), of an illuminating example.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The situation was as follows. The young defendant is brought in to 
answer for his failure to send the required check to the mother of two 
of his children. We learn that he has sired a third child by another 
woman, and his complaint is that he simply cannot earn enough money to 
satisfy the demands being made on him, and the court simply has to 
recognize this.
<p>
REFEREE: So you're saying that you're going to hide out from the child 
support obligation?
<p>
DAD: I would if need be.<p> 
REFEREE: You know it's possible that could be a felony?
<p>
DAD: Yes, I know that.
<p>
REFEREE: You, I assume voluntarily engaged in intercourse with each of 
those women, is that much correct?
<p>
DAD: Mm-hmm.
<p>
REFEREE: And the consequence was that on at least three occasions 
these women conceived and had children?
<p>
DAD: Yeah.
<p>
REFEREE: And that certainly isn't society's fault.
<p>
DAD: I never said it was.
<p>
REFEREE: You know, society's not treating you unfairly. You weren't 
required to have any children.
<p>
DAD: Well, I don't think it's, you know, up to society to not let me 
have a living at the same time, either. . . . There's got to be a 
compromise so the State can be happy and I can be happy too.
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Respondents were all but unanimous in asking the law to bear down on 
the fathers, mostly absent. Some suggest DNA tests immediately after 
birth, when more often than not the father shows up proudly, even if 
it is only for a few weeks: do a DNA on the baby and the father, to 
preserve perpetual evidence of biological responsibility. And then, 
not a few respondents ask, Why is it not criminal, the activity we 
speak of?

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child II
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
We pursue the social problem of one million children per year born 
into fatherless homes and review some of the letters from hundreds of 
readers who wrote in to make suggestions on how to deal with a problem 
that began its steep rise approximately in 1965. And many ask, Why 
ought it not to be a crime to father a child out of wedlock?
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed. It's a crime to drive when one has had too much to drink, 
though the statistical chances the driver will hurt somebody when his 
blood alcohol is 0.1 are less than that he will have hurt the child he 
sired. Two out of five black men in Washington, D.C., between the ages 
of 18 and 25 are in jail, on probation, or being prosecuted, in an 
area in which over 75 per cent of black children are born to an 
unmarried mother.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fair question.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several respondents remind us that there are laws against statutory 
rape. But the paradox is that if you have sex with a girl under 18 you 
can be jailed in most states, but if you have sex with a girl under 18 
who becomes pregnant, the organically required "rape" dematerializes. 
And over 30 per cent of the fatherless children are born to mothers 
under twenty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The indignation, resentment, and scorn came in profusely, and from the 
tenor of most letters one could discern that they were not written by 
censorious temperaments. A great many wondered what has happened to 
the primary sanction against illegitimacy in the past, which has been 
shame. Shame before God, yes, but also before the community. "She has 
to feel the pain of society's anger and disapproval of her 
irresponsible, selfish act. Pain hurts, there's a recoiling reaction 
to it." "Bring back the old stocks of the Puritan times . . . 
Wrongdoers could go to work and support their families but when not at 
their places of employment spend so many hours a day on public 
exhibition."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some call for compulsory national service for the father, penal in 
character . . . Yes, deny them what most desire intensely, a driver's 
license . . . Some would make the father the legal custodian of the 
child, taking the mother for special training.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several decry the failure of black leaders sufficiently to emphasize 
the terrible damage done by wanton sex. "If thirty years ago I were a 
Ku Klux Klan leader who would want to do major damage to blacks, I 
would invent the welfare system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many favor biological intervention. Norplants, vasectomies, tubal 
ligations. Many caution against the facile alternative of abortions, 
but some, including self-professed Catholics, argue that abortion 
under the circumstances is merciful . . . Why not move against the 
lubricity of the rock and roll culture, by such measures as advocated 
by Senator Dole? Or, "Establish public brothels in strategic areas 
where illegitimacy is most prevalent."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proffered approaches depended heavily on what respondents saw as 
the primary cause of the blight. The blame is, for some, primarily 
that of the government (welfare, lax law enforcement, the improper use 
of tax revenues). For others, the culture -- the movies, TV, rap 
music, pornography, ultra-feminism, divorce. And for others the 
evanescence of the idea of -- Sin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"There is only one solution, and you know what it is. The moral law of 
the Supreme Being." "The deterrents you outlined in your column? You 
called them the equivalent of Pentagon contingency plans to invade 
Switzerland: i.e., they're not going to happen. You're right. The sad 
fact is that the one major success the liberals have had is the 
destruction of the family during the last 30 years. What worked for 
the first 190 years in this country is no longer possible or even 
worth writing about. The family is the basic unit of our society and 
it has a cancer. And yet the components of the cancer -- illegitimacy, 
promiscuity, adultery, increased divorce, homosexuality -- are 
accepted as 'lifestyles' and even exalted. . . . "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I reiterate my thanks to the 800 plus who wrote in. The research in 
hand will be made available to any responsible researcher or research 
organization willing to bear the cost of reproduction.

<h2>
Oh No! Running for President?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as 
President of Russia. It is his duty to "consolidate all healthy forces 
and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war." That is quite a 
threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got 
around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of 
his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly 
surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long 
interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and 
U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so 
only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the 
revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. "Power is his ideology," 
he said, "his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. 
Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less." 
When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired 
(he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have 
been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered 
something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the 
thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the 
two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi 
Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running 
on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run 
on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, "Let's see if 
this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading 
France." Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of 
him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with 
Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or 
attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to 
Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain 
they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- 
they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no 
one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at 
low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal 
challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: 
"50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION 
WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV." He won handily.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. 
Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what 
the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was 
that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians 
were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. 
Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the 
Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of 
yesteryear. "We can't answer for the mistakes of the past."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter 
of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the 
repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. 
When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely 
correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it 
would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because 
free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already 
moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power 
will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are 
experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their 
fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious 
exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that 
economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a 
Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? 
We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super 
nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would 
be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, 
quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.

<title>Buckley: 'Ideology' On Our Mind -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>
'Ideology' On Our Mind
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The point has been made, most specifically by Washington Post 
columnist David Broder, that the principal candidates for President 
shrink from "ideology." Thus Mr. Clinton separates himself from the 
Gephardt wing of the Democratic Party, and Senator Dole allows a 
certain amount of water to pass between him and Newt Gingrich. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The whole matter of ideology both vexes and enlightens political 
thought. The word is used differently in political discourse. The 
average voter will seek some consistency, or appearance of 
consistency, in a candidate's platform. The philosopher scorns 
ideology because too often it overwhelms reason, prudence, philosophy. 
The word was French and came out of the crucible of the French 
Revolution, which was the bloody complement of the American 
Revolution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Senator Phil Gramm has generally been considered the most consistent 
of the conservatives running for the Presidency this year. If you 
believe A, that government activity ought not to replace non-
government activity except when required, you will believe B, that the 
government should not run the local pizza parlor. Ideology is a body 
of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an individual, 
a group, a class, or a culture (American Heritage Dictionary). But 
ideology is also "a set of doctrines or beliefs" that form the basis 
of a political, economic, or other system. If your position on a 
political question derives from a doctrine, then you are committed to 
subordinating your political position to your doctrinal position. 
Otherwise, you tend to wobble. Some wobbling is an aspect of political 
opportunism -- Senator Gramm in Iowa did not criticize federal 
subsidies of the ethanol program, which is a relic of the Department 
of Energy's extravagances. Sometimes it is an extra-ideological 
deference to reality (let the Federal Government help Los Angeles 
after its earthquake). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But then we begin to line up other political questions, to be 
scrutinized ideologically. And it is here that the word "presumption" 
is useful. If you believe A -- that the government should stay out of 
the way -- you believe this either dogmatically or empirically. Was it 
right to intervene in Somalia? No, if the undertaking was designed to 
transform Somalian culture -- we should know that this can't be done; 
we tried and gave up making the world safe for democracy. Yes, if the 
single objective was to prevent mass starvation. Presumptively, stay 
out. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about tariffs? Long ago, conservative doctrine shaped up in favor 
of free trade. This was, indeed, an extension of anti-government 
doctrine. A tariff is a tax paid by one American for the benefit of 
another American. But it is more than that, because it denies to the 
American consumer the advantage of competitive bidding, and 
derivatively deprives the foreigner of the wherewithal to patronize 
American production. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about educational vouchers? Conservatives will in almost every 
situation honor the supremacy of the consumer over the regulator, so 
that if Mrs. Jones wants that school for her child, not the public 
school, the conservative would seek to expedite the choice. . . . Is 
that question ideologically related to school prayer? Yes, it is: the 
state should not intrude its wishes, or its restrictions, in the 
culture of free men, freely associating with one another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Immigration? National independence? The state is by no means useless, 
as the anarchists insist. The state is a "natural" institution, and 
exercises its authority in matters that relate to the commonweal when 
these are clearly national concerns. The flow of immigration into a 
country is self-evidently the proper concern of the state inasmuch as 
only its agents can say Yes or No at the border. And the traffic needs 
to be regulated because there is a greater demand than supply. Mr. Fox 
Butterfield finished his memorable book on Communist China by quoting 
one Chinese who said that if the means to do so could be found, every 
Chinese would go to America to live. "Even the lamp posts would go." 
And sovereignty asserts a recognition that the world has yet to see 
(or even envision) a cultural unity that combines in acceptable 
priorities what we have called the American proposition.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, Mr. Clinton edges away from ideologues in his own party (every 
problem is a state problem, and every dollar earned is forfeit to the 
state's agenda), and Senator Dole tries to shape an ideologically 
lucid opposition that appeals both to voters whose dogma is 
conservative, and to those whose inclinations are conservative. It is 
tough going, as much an art as a discipline.

<title>Buckley: Buchanan And the GOP -- 2/23/96</title>

<h2>
Buchanan And the GOP
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even 
though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was 
nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator 
Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting 
President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon 
Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run 
for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his 
own party?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also 
held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax 
man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this 
or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the 
states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is 
also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against 
the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, 
to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the 
others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would 
repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. 
And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three 
would not. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as 
entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he 
is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. 
Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving 
public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same 
way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective 
indistinguishable?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona 
overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the 
United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, 
the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I 
do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John 
Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as 
often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like 
Churchill, to act as leader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. 
There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that 
the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a 
temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be 
lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were 
President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any 
more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately 
balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The 
go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for 
demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 
10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in 
Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not 
be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of 
dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan 
is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over 
how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace 
comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or 
less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in 
the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left 
just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in 
general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, 
securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of 
Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next 
twenty years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which 
the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to 
him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized 
moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a 
national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote 
against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory 
government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in 
their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes 
his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master 
cheerleader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the 
idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the 
necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires 
reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat 
Buchanan.

<title>Presidential Patter</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Presidential Patter</h2>
</center>
<hr>
New York, July 11 
<p>
<p>
There were about twenty people -- mostly men, four women -- engaged
in myriad activities, including law, banking, journalism, the academy.  
They have in common a bond to the conservative political enterprise  
which, to a not inconsiderable degree, is affected by their resolutions.  
And the evening's extemporaneous subject matter was the presidential  
race. 
<p> 
The rubric called for direct speech, freed of any obligation to diplomatic  
protocol. In that spirit, one commentator confessed his sense of security  
with Senator Dole. "I feel comfortable with opportunists, because I  
always know what to expect." Dole, most agreed, is scheduled to be  
nominated, the beneficiary of a Republican tradition that consummates  
the nomination of the front-runner. 
<p>
Bush led in 1988 and of course in 1992, and was confirmed by the  
Republican Convention. Reagan led in 1980, Ford in 1976, Goldwater in  
1964. By contrast, the Democrats make way for relatively obscure  
candidates. The polls reported that 2 per cent of the American people  
knew, in January 1972, the name of George McGovern: six months later  
he was nominated for President. The polls in January 1976 recorded 3  
per cent of the public knew the name of Jimmy Carter, and 12 months  
later he was inaugurated President of the United States. 
<p>
Such arrivals of the star in the third act tend not to happen in the GOP.  
Accordingly, Mr. Dole would need to slip up, something in which he is  
practiced, but not something he has done in the past few months, during  
which his campaign has revealed near-perfect professional performance.  
Another commentator opined that Dole might well suffer during the  
campaign, when his age might become visible. FDR was able to  
campaign in 1944 as if whole in mind and body, but this is not so easily  
done any more with the ubiquitous television cameras. And even without  
a slip, there will be some heavy breathing in the voting booths at the  
prospect of sending to the White House a man who would be 73 when  
inaugurated, 77 at the turn of the century. 
<p>
A participant took the floor to pass along something he situated at least  
half way between rumor and fact. He had been told (needless to say, by a  
reliable source) that Colin Powell would figure heavily in the politics of  
1996. 
<p> 
Just to begin with, whoever gets the presidential nod, Powell is almost  
certain to be invited to run for Vice President. If indeed Mr. Dole gets  
the nomination, Powell will feel a very strong impulse to serve him as  
Vice President, on the grounds that it is all but inconceivable that Bob  
Dole would run for a second term. In other words, Colin Powell would  
be inaugurated as President in January of 2001. 
<p>
Now on this subject, the commentator went on, his word has it that  
Powell will, as scheduled, proceed to do his book tour during September  
and October. But at the end of the tour, he will make a declaration of  
principles addressed unambiguously to the political scene -- and that set  
of political principles will be unambiguously conservative. That act will  
immediately make him a presidential candidate unless he rules himself  
out, intending to accept the Vice Presidency with Dole. We need to  
remember about General Powell -- or to teach ourselves, if we did not  
know it -- that he is the most spellbinding political orator since Reagan.  
"No one else comes even close to his amalgam of dignity, self- 
deprecation, firmness, and hope.'' 
<p> 
Still, whoever it is will need to contend with Bill Clinton. An observer  
began by reciting the disqualifications of the incumbent. "Just to begin  
with, he seems to have repealed the public bias against adultery." On  
every important position he has taken conflicting stands. He is scorned  
by the rest of the world, manipulated by his own staff, arrested in his  
thinking by any visiting shaman. "Still . . . He has the powers of  
Houdini. Throw him in the trunk of the car with eight chains bound  
around him, toss the car into the ocean, and before you know it, he  
comes bobbing up to the surface.'' 
 <p>
Even now, the observer continued, Clinton is substantially up over his  
ratings of a few months ago, and it is by no means certain that he will be  
swamped by the Republican nominee. Anything can happen, which is  
bad news for the Republic, and there is no insurance policy written to  
cope with this contingency.

<title>WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE MIAs?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>What to do about the MIA's</h2>
</center>
<hr> 
<b>New York, July 14</b>
<p>
<p>
Representative Randy Cunningham of California was a navy pilot during  
the Vietnam War. He was shot down. In recalling those days, in  
Congress last week, he broke into tears as he spoke of American soldiers  
who had died in his arms. He said that the Vietnamese had killed  
American prisoners and were withholding evidence to that effect. His  
conclusion: The recognition of the government of Vietnam "is not a  
political issue for me. This is right and wrong." 
<p> 
It isn't easy to talk back to such as Mr. Cunningham, certainly not if one  
has had no such experience of imprisonment by the Vietnamese. But  
then Senator John McCain was five and a half years a prisoner who  
endured torture. So was it with Pete Peterson of Florida. Bob Kerrey of  
Nebraska wasn't a prisoner, but in pressing the goals of war he won the  
Congressional Medal of Honor. John Kerry of Massachusetts won a  
Silver Star. And these four legislators support the recognition of  
Vietnam. 
<p> 
Whatever one's conclusion in the matter, we need, on meditation, to  
reject the suggestion that this is a moral question. The recognition of de- 
facto governments is the American tradition. Cuba and North Korea are  
exceptions, and the question is, do we want Vietnam to continue as  
another exception? 
<p> 
Here are the unspoken points in the controversy. 
<p>
1. There are no Americans alive who were put down as "missing in  
action.'' How do we know this? By the application of common sense.  
Since any live American soldier, captured between 1966 and 1975,  
surely wishes to return, why would he be kept in Vietnam? 
 <p>
If the Vietnamese kept hinting that a hundred Americans -- let alone  
1,618 Americans -- were going to arrive on a Boeing 747 the day after  
the United States handed over a billion dollars or whatever, the story of  
the MIAs would be comparable to the story of the Cubans caught by  
Castro during the Bay of Pigs invasion, or the Americans held hostage  
by Iran in 1979. Nothing is more useless than a dead hostage, and for  
that reason talk about the "whereabouts" of the MIAs should be  
restricted to talk about where they are buried. 
<p> 
2. If they are buried. Stories about the ferocity of the Vietnamese are not  
exaggerated, and when Congressman Cunningham is reduced to tears  
recollecting what the Vietnamese did, we can reasonably assume that his  
memory is exact. The Vietnamese killed a number of American  
prisoners. As a matter of fact, Americans killed some Vietnamese  
prisoners. And Americans killed a great many Vietnamese women and  
children in air raids. Wars animate the dark side of human nature, and  
although there is a difference between dropping a bomb on Dresden and  
executing soldiers at Katyn, no combating army is at all times governed  
by the models endorsed by international conventions. The American  
officer in charge of the Andersonville prisoner-of-war camp a century  
ago was hanged after the war because of his treatment of prisoners,  
13,000 of whom died. He was a Confederate captain, and his victims  
were American Unionists. We can't hang the malefactors in Vietnam  
because we lost the war. The short of it is that the Vietnamese don't  
know where all their victims were buried any more than the Argentines  
know where their victims -- dating back only 25 years -- were buried, in  
part because many of them were dropped from airplanes into the sea. 
<p> 
3. The Vietnamese government in recent months has been here and there  
cooperative in tracking down graves of dead American soldiers, but that  
government has not come forward with all the records it keeps. 
 <p>
Why is this so? 
 <p>
Almost certainly because those records would reveal that many  
Americans were in fact either killed, or permitted to die of starvation or  
of wounds. It should not surprise us that such records are tenaciously  
kept from view. And one wonders what is the nature of the satisfaction  
that bereaved wives and mothers would get from knowing that the man  
they loved, mysteriously missing since that day when he was captured,  
was in fact killed not in combat, but in detention? What would we have  
accomplished except the revival of bitterness and rage? And if we are  
dealing with the psychological question alone, do we really help the  
survivor by extinguishing hope, even hope forlorn? Would it satisfy those  
who have made all but a lifelong mission in search of her, to find the  
bones of Amelia Earhart?

<title>MURDER DOWN</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>MURDER DOWN?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
 New York, July 18 
<p>
<p>
The headline was wonderfully reassuring to this part of the world.  
"Murder Rate Plunges in New York City." There are corollary decreases  
in other crime -- robberies down 22 per cent, auto theft down 25 per  
cent. The question arises: Is this a statistical blip? If not -- if it is a  
genuine trend downward -- what are its causes? More jails? Less crack  
cocaine? A dulling of the criminal spirit? 
<p>
The optimists should read the essay in the July Atlantic Monthly by  
Adam Walinsky. For that matter, so should the pessimists. It is an  
eloquent and heavily informed overview of what has happened in the  
past three decades, and Mr. Walinsky wonders why America permitted it  
to happen. Everyone deplores the high rate of crime but there is nothing  
resembling a true mobilization to combat it. 
<p>
Here are the salient figures. In the 1960s, for every violent crime  
committed we had 3.3 police officers. In 1993, for every police officer  
there were 3.4 violent crimes. Consider New Haven, Connecticut. In  
1990, with its population down 14 per cent from 1960, its robberies had  
increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 per cent. In this perspective,  
the reduction of crime in New York is, however welcome, a mere fillip.  
And the figures on police stretch out to less than one-tenth the effective  
police power of thirty years ago. ". . . in another formulation, each police  
officer today must deal with 11.45 times as many violent crimes as his  
predecessor of years gone by." 
 <p>
We have a half-million police officers, and the proposal in the crime bill  
of Mr. Clinton was an extra one hundred thousand. How many  
policemen would we need to add in order to restore the same balance as  
in 1960 of police to violent crimes? Five million. 
<p>
Are we making any strides in that direction? Only in the private sector.  
One and one-half million security officers protect corporations, private  
residential areas, shopping malls. Good. But a lot of people spend their  
time outside privately protected areas, like the overwhelming majority of  
the American people. The Department of Justice estimates that 83 per  
cent of all Americans will be victims of violent crime at least once in  
their lives; about a quarter, victims of three or more violent crimes. 
<p>
Two out of five killers, Mr. Walinsky advises us, are undetected. These  
missing killers commit what the trade calls "stranger murders." The  
notion that crime is overwhelmingly a matter of passion is simply no  
longer arguable. And the chances of the stranger murderer getting away  
are 80 per cent. Walinsky quotes a New York Times description of Omar  
Rosario going to work in a grocery store, whose previous owner was  
murdered. "Rosario prepares for work by donning a bulletproof vest and  
sliding a 9-millimeter semi-automatic into his waistband. When a young  
man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the store, Mr. Rosario  
takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the pocket of his pants, his  
finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets him see the gun in his  
hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young man pulls a gun, he  
will be killed.''' 
<p> 
That's one way to go, but it hasn't had a large effect. In the last ten years,  
twice as many Americans were killed by strangers as were on the  
battlefield during the ten years we fought in Vietnam. In the black  
community the statistics are dire: One out of every 21 black men is  
killed, double the rate of American servicemen in the Second World  
War. "The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history  
but of this generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of  
government to create a welfare system that began the destruction of black  
family life. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality,  
celebrated license, and glorified fecklessness." 
<p> 
Adam Walinsky has for many years advocated a Police Corps, an ROTC  
that would offer four-year college scholarships to young people in return  
for four years of police service following their graduation. This is not an  
expenditure from which the Contract crowd should shrink. To begin  
with, it is to confirm the most solemn obligation of government, which is  
to provide for domestic security. "President Clinton has requested $261.4  
billion for defense against foreign enemies who killed fewer than a  
hundred Americans in all of last year. It would be silly to suggest that  
the Federal Government should not or cannot spend an eighth as much --  
2 per cent of even a shrunken federal budget -- to defend the nation  
against domestic enemies who killed more than 10,000 people who were  
strangers to them in 1994, and who will surely kill more in every year  
that lies ahead."

<title>Why Not ID?</title>
</head><center>
<h2>Why Not ID?</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 NEW YORK, JULY 25
<p>
Thirty years ago the philosopher/strategist James Burnham included a 
chapter in his book Suicide of the West in which he undertook to list 
the stands in public policy that distinguish the American conservative 
from the American liberal. For instance? Capital punishment: most 
conservatives are in favor of it, most liberals against. Gun control, 
the other way around. Many of the dividing points had to do with 
aspects of foreign policy during the Cold War, no longer relevant. If 
Mr. Burnham were alive and writing today no doubt he'd have included 
in his list strategic anti-missile defense. There is a Grand Canyon 
that divides conservative and liberal opinion on that subject.
<p>
We paleos (for "paleolithic conservatives": i.e., those of us who were 
conservative beginning way back in past geological eras) were weaned 
in a kind of anti-cyber, anti-computer tradition. Mr. Burnham listened 
with instinctive approval to a classmate who initiated the idea of a 
chain-letter from one friend to two friends to four friends to sixteen 
friends urging a quiet mutiny against numerical identification. The 
idea was always to misplace one digit in anything that requires 
absolutely accurate disclosure. A kind of quiet sabotage of the 
computer age, was the dream. If enough people wrote 123465 where 
123456 was the correct code, then the mighty house of Mainframe would 
come tumbling down.
<p>
It is in fidelity to that tradition that so many conservatives oppose 
any move toward an identification number. Professor Thomas Sowell of 
the Hoover Institution has written that "nothing polarizes the 
political Left and Right like the idea of a national identity card." 
The Nazis and the Communists and indeed the South Africans required an 
ID. Isn't that reason enough for free governments to shrink at the 
thought of it?
<p>
Not in my view. In the past three weeks I have three times been asked 
to give my Social Security number. Why? Presumably because no two 
people have the same Social Security number. When we were in the army 
and desired to get free postage, we were required to write our serial 
number on the envelope. When we travel abroad we are required to hand 
over our passports, each one individually numbered. In many situations 
the requirement is to show your driver's license, preferably in states 
in which your picture also appears on that license.
<p>
What then is the reason for such heated opposition to an 
identification number, as has been proposed by various congressmen 
anxious to do something about illegal immigration? The idea, as we 
understand it, is to develop an ID which can't be violated by the 
owner or duplicated by a black marketeer. Presumably what then happens 
is that the young man who asks for a job in a restaurant or at a 
construction firm is asked (under obligation of law) to show his ID. 
If he can't come up with it, he is deemed to be illegal, and doesn't 
get hired.
<p>
What's wrong with that? "Control is the name of the game for 
liberals," Professor Sowell writes, "even when they call it 
'compassion.' A national identity card would not only permit even 
greater government snooping into people's private lives, the 
information gathered would almost inevitably lead to more laws forcing 
more people to do more things the way the politicians want them done. 
It is a down payment on totalitarianism." Mr. Sowell sees a tunnel 
ahead, and the light at the end of it is the complete submission by 
the individual to the government.
<p>
We should concede this, namely that in totalitarian societies an ID is 
absolutely essential. The contrapositive, however, is not justified -- 
that every society that has an ID will become a totalitarian society. 
As noted, already there is an ID of sorts, done by Social Security. As 
a weapon against illegal immigration it is not reliable because it is 
very easy to get a Social Security card. But if a) it is a legitimate 
goal to regulate immigration, then b) the means to do this effectively 
should be there, and c) it would not appear to make sense to deny the 
government instruments that are not inherently cruel or indecent. To 
authorize an ID that merely proves you are who you say you are is not 
the same thing as to authorize a government enema or truth serum.
<p>
On such matters one thinks of George Gilder, the American conservative 
bard of the computer, whose threnodies remind us how much we owe to 
the computer, not least that it enables us, without further ado, to 
establish that we are Americans, entitled to the rights guaranteed us 
under the Constitution.

<title>The Susan Smith Case</title>
</head>
<center><h2>The Susan Smith Case</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
NEW YORK, JULY 28
<p>
<p>
The brother of Susan Smith asked the jurors what would be the point of 
sentencing Mrs. Smith to death -- hasn't there been enough tragedy in 
her family already? That statement did not resonate very widely 
because Mrs. Smith's family comprised the two boys she murdered, and 
an ex-husband who had already told the jury he thought she should be 
executed. And of course the point logically arises: If there is a law 
in South Carolina specifying execution for capital offenses, what 
capital offenses are we going to sub-specify as especially appropriate 
for execution?
<p>
Well of course no one disputes the sheer horror of the means by which 
Mrs. Smith elected to kill her children. Under the circumstances, the 
defense needed to go in a different direction from what the defense 
has done with O. J. Simpson. It needed to plead with the jury the 
awful aspects of her own life.
<p>
Newspaper readers are familiar with the details: the suicide of her 
father when she was 6, seduction by her stepfather when she entered 
her teens, a marriage that resulted in two sons followed by a divorce 
followed by a love affair with her boss alongside a love affair with 
her boss's son coextensive with sex with her stepfather. The reason 
for all of this, the defense explained, is the trauma of the suicide 
of her father and the fear she felt that to break away from her 
stepfather would be in the nature of renewing the wound that had left 
her fatherless at 6 -- and how are we doing, ladies and gentlemen of 
the jury, have we got you in the Menendez mood? You do remember the 
Menendez brothers, and how convincing it was that they really felt 
they had to empty their shotguns at their mother and father?
<p>
It pays, if only as an exercise, to credit the teleology of Susan 
Smith's mental development. Let us assume that the suicide of her 
father led her compulsively to submit to sex with her stepfather. Let 
us suppose that that driving compulsion to love copiously led her to 
leave her husband and take to her bed her boss, and then his son; that 
her anxiety for the continued sexual devotion of the son led her to 
interpret his statement that he would not marry a woman and take on 
the burden of two children to the perfectly logical conclusion that 
the children were an insufferable burden: that that led her 
compulsively to strap the two impediments onto the back seat of the 
car, and let it slide into the lake. A quite natural sense of self-
protection caused her to tell police of a black abductor who at 
gunpoint had whisked the children away. And then after nine days, as 
the circumstantial evidence tightened about her, she began to descry a 
noose. At that point she confessed.
<p>
Now the refinement of the McNaghten defense, which requires the 
prosecution to establish that the defendant knew the difference 
between right and wrong, would not appear to have applied. Mrs. Smith 
acknowledged to her ex-husband that she was "sorry" she hadn't 
accepted his offer to take the boys home with him.
<p>
What was fought over, in the jury deliberations, is really the 
question of capital punishment. 1) The gravity of the offense was 
established. 2) The defendant's knowledge that what she did was wrong 
wasn't doubted. In which case, 3) shouldn't she be sentenced to death?
<p>
The risk in capital prosecutions was of course highlighted by the 
Menendez verdict. The law, roundly stated, tells us that you may not 
kill another person except in self-defense. The Menendez brothers had 
no such excuse, but they were got off by a lawyer who mesmerized the 
jury into rogue theories of psychological compulsions.
<p>
Such arguments go to eristic legal lengths. Suppose we begin with the 
simple postulate that murder is aberrational behavior. Then the 
question -- under the handling of defense lawyers -- becomes: What 
caused such behavior? Mean parents? Suicidal fathers? Cruelty? Sex? 
Fear? -- the list is infinite because the postulate is fixed. It is 
that if somebody is murdered, it has to be that the murderer departed 
from the moral fixes that restrain other human beings. Accordingly the 
quest is for the cause of the misbehavior, and the only penological 
reason to keep the murderer in jail is to prevent him from doing it 
again.
<p>
It became, really, that all over again, a fight over capital 
punishment. "What happened to Michael and Alex is a tragedy," said the 
defense. "To strap Susan in a chair and send 2,000 volts into her in 
the name of justice -- "
<p>
He was interrupted by the prosecution, who reminded him that more 
humane means of execution had been authorized by the State of South 
Carolina. But the State of South Carolina might just as well abolish 
capital punishment now that Susan Smith has been spared.

It's interesting how many left feeling insecure when the subject of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms -- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way. For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another, he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick. Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world laughed at such presumption and the next 
thing we knew, the House of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt, the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered outdoors. 
<p>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her piece "The Loss of the Dodo"; led off by remarking that Newt was "sickeningly" cute; and ended by confessing her "distress" at the prospect of "the Speaker 
frolicking in the woods with a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses."
<p>
The "cute" business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having told a visiting witness that she was welcome to "come see my dinosaur." The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr. Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as "cute," so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<p>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, "If you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread" -- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria is a zone of France.
<p>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<p>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the Bohemian Grove, "the exclusive men's club in northern California. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old white rich 
guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women." 
<p>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical, what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<p>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes into the discussion she interrupted herself. "Would you be willing to talk 
about the Bohemian Club?"
<p>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about. . . .
<p>
"Well," Miss Stahl pressed, "what about this business of going around naked?"
<p>
I lowered my voice. "In the years I've been going to the Bohemian Club," I whispered, "I have seen men naked only in the shower, and now I'll tell you something in confidence." Her eyes hungered for my 
revelation. The camera whirred. "The Admissions Committee of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people who shower with their clothes on." Miss Stahl simply smiled, gamely. 
<p>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked? No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked business was sheer fantasy -- "It just doesn't happen." Perhaps Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<p>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice up her column than report facts, 
proving only that the antagonism to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

<h2>What About The 'Overclass'?</h2>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr. </i></a><hr>
</center>
<p>
<p>


<p>
<p>
The author Michael Lind was interviewed on the (indispensable) MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour and was questioned about some of the theses of his book The Next American Nation [reviewed this issue, p. 60]. One of these is that the United States is headed toward a "Brazilianization" 
of society, by which Mr. Lind meant that the affluent class is self-perpetuating and is sealing itself off from the rest of the country. How? By sending its sons and daughters to the most privileged 
colleges, taking refuge in private country clubs and mansions, intermarrying, and so on. The greatest entitlement in the hands of this overclass, said Mr. Lind, is the institution of the "legacy" in 
the primary colleges and universities. 
<p>
Interviewer David Gergen came up with a half-dozen super-prominent men in American political life who had not attended the fancy colleges. Furthermore, 45 per cent of top chief executives either dropped out of college or graduated from a second- or third-category college. How did 
Mr. Lind account for that? Oh. Well, he wasn't saying that meritocracy was dead in America, in fact it is more pronounced than it was in the nineteenth century. It just isn't meritocratic enough.
<p>
It is a very old complaint, that which is leveled at the wealthy and their progeny. It certainly attracted the attention of Andrew Carnegie, who favored a 100 per cent inheritance tax. The current 
federal estate tax is very high -- 60 per cent; 80 to 85 per cent on money left to grandchildren, beyond the generation-skipping allowance. The federal estate tax doesn't yield all that much revenue (the 1995 
estimate is $15.6 billion, or 1.2 per cent of total federal receipts) and definitive studies haven't been done -- because they can't be done -- to measure the economic impact of the high taxes. We do not know how many industrious and inventive Americans switch into overdrive instead of continuing to chug-chug up the hill to accumulate more to leave their children and grandchildren. The avoidance of taxes is a primal urge, like sex and patriotism and religion, and lighthearted redistributionists are well counseled to be aware of this, though when the jacobinical fever rages, people don't care whether they are stifling production with their taxes. All that they care about is that 
the Haves shall have less. 
<p>
On the matter of the "legacy" to entry into fancy colleges, Mr. Lind is on insecure ground again. It is true that at the margin, the practice goes on. But it is very far from being comprehensive. Twenty-
five years ago the admissions director of Yale University got into serious trouble with the alumni after several years' application of what very nearly amounted to an anti-legacy policy, during which he 
reduced to 13 per cent (from about 18) the sons of Eli admitted.
<p>
The question was raised, For what reason are alumni expected to give funds to their alma mater? Yes, perhaps, as a measure of gratitude for education and experiences received. And yes, because they wish their alma mater to continue to retain fine scholars. But first-rate scholars are going to be teaching somewhere -- they don't have to teach at any one university. At about that time (the Sixties), 
Professor C. Vann Woodward, the distinguished Southern historian, was lured away from Johns Hopkins by Yale at considerable expense. This move did not further "education": the kids are as bright at Johns Hopkins as at Yale; and anyway, professors at that level are hired primarily to write books and teach graduate students.
<p>
To contribute to Yale to make it possible for Vann Woodward to move there traces to a perfectly understandable pride, tribal in character, in maintaining in first-rate condition the university to which the 
alumnus hopes his son or daughter will one day be admitted. Mr. Lind's thesis isn't really persuasive unless somebody comes up with Animal House students congestively present at Yale or Harvard or Stanford. That won't happen because such folk don't, pace Lind, get admitted. No alumnus is going to yell, whatever his contributions to his alma mater, if his son is turned down after coming in with a combined SAT score in three digits.
<p>
An old bark, an old tree, bringing to mind that the problem in Brazil is that they don't behave as we do.

<title>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</title>
</head>
<center><h2>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</center></h2>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
William F. Buckley Jr, New York August 4th
<p>
Harry Truman was not an ambiguist, just to begin with. And in any 
case, important declarations are usually summary. "I do," is all that 
is necessary in answer to the question, "Do you take this man for your 
lawfully wedded husband?" When asked for final approval to drop the 
atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Harry Truman, in Potsdam, scribbled out in 
longhand, "Suggestion approved. Release when ready." It seems a 
millennium since the idiomatically similar order was given by Admiral 
Dewey to the captain of his flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay in 
1898: "You may fire when you are ready, Gridley." Truman authorized 
the non-platonic beginning of the nuclear age, at the convenience of 
the commander of a bomber squadron on the 39-square-mile island of 
Tinian.
<p>
Time magazine did a good job last week in describing the elements of 
the contest between East and West that was finally detonated at Pearl 
Harbor, and a harrowing account of the terrible bloodiness of the 
Pacific war and of the breathless interval between the bomb's falling 
at Nagasaki and the quiet-spoken words of the Emperor Hirohito, 
besought by a cabinet divided between surrender and suicide. He 
elected to surrender.
<p>
Books have been written and prayers for divine guidance said to 
examine the morality of the bomb. If it is true that the intentions of 
the perpetrator are the final determinants of moral rectitude, then 
Truman is clearly blameless. He had weighed reports of projected 
American casualties in an invasion of Japan; estimates ranged between 
thirty thousand and a half-million dead and wounded. The same 
strategists projected Japanese casualties at many times that number, 
and even as Truman thought about the question -- before even the trial 
bomb at Alamogordo had established that Little Boy (Hiroshima) and Fat 
Man (Nagasaki) would indeed work their devastation -- we were 
routinely proceeding with our concentrated bombing of Japanese cities. 
Over eighty thousand were killed in the firebombings of Tokyo even as, 
a few months earlier, we had in three waves killed almost as many 
Germans in Dresden with the saturation bombings.
<p>
Did Harry Truman give sufficient thought to alternatives? There was 
the possibility of encouraging an earlier intervention against Japan 
by the Soviet army. There was the possibility of amending the terms of 
surrender sharply enough to affect the thinking of the bitter-enders 
in the Japanese military. The answer to these questions can't be 
given, not because the alternatives weren't presented to Truman, but 
because we don't know to what extent they captured his attention. We 
had only just conquered Okinawa, with a loss of 12,500 American 
servicemen. A national poll showed 90 per cent of Americans supporting 
in effect unconditional surrender. As far as Truman was concerned, we 
should give him the benefit of the doubt: the nuclear bomb was simply 
the next weapon in line. We had traveled, in Truman's lifetime, from 
biplanes to B-29s. Why cavil at a single bomb that could effect the 
same damage as a thousand bombers?
<p>
The soul-searching came later. It required centuries to mobilize 
civilized opinion against slavery and against torture. It is not 
finally settled even now on capital punishment. Nor is it on nuclear 
weaponry as a deterrent, but then of course in order to deter, nuclear 
weapons need to threaten. A civilized scholar very close to several 
Presidents once observed to me that if the Soviet nuclear flotilla had 
actually launched, he would have seen no purpose in counselling the 
President to launch our own: what had been there as a deterrent, 
designed to be conclusive, hadn't worked -- so why kill 150 million 
Russians? No one of course will ever know whether such reasoning would 
have stayed the hand of a U.S. President. It sufficed that Soviet 
leaders did not rule out nuclear retaliation: whereupon nuclear 
stalemate was born. It had a long life.
<p>
It does surprise that the evangelistic energy now spent on the horrors 
of Hiroshima does not bear little buds that would encourage the 
development of defensive means to intercept the hypothetical nuclear 
bomb of tomorrow. For reasons quite impossible to understand, those 
most transfixed by the horrors of Hiroshima are most unconcerned by, 
or even hostile to, any effort to accost not the evil in men's minds 
and nature -- perhaps because this is not possible -- but the weapons 
such men can deploy.

<h2>Nightmare Time</h2>

<hr></center>
<p>
The sudden thrust by the Croatians at the expense of neighboring Serbs tells us not very much that there is armed life in the area and that finally something stoexcept pped what was appearing to be a Blitzkrieg by Bosnian Serbs. Their objective has been, for four years, Sarajevo.  Collateral triumphs have been the discrediting of the United Nations, NATO, and U.S. foreign policy.
<p>
The break in America from the isolation of yesteryear was the result of the reduction from thirty days to thirty minutes of the traversability of the space that had shielded America from Europe for four centuries. The principled arguments -- revisionist but nonetheless convincing -- against our entry into the First World War were decreasingly safe when used to oppose our entry into the Second 
World War. It is of course a hackneyed irony to remark that Sarajevo triggered the First World War and is now a point of conflagration that could trigger, if not a world war, a collapse of the scaffolding we 
hoped to build in the postwar years. 
<p>
The primary cause of disillusion with world-mindedness after the Second World War was the diplomatic defeats we suffered in Europe and then in Asia. Having joined the Allies in a mission initiated to restore sovereignty to Poland, we were maneuvered into the totalitarian desolation of much of Europe under Stalin. At the other end of the world, having triumphed over imperialist Japan we stood by helpless against the Communization of China under Mao Tse-tung. To say the least, this damaged the sensibilities of those Americans who dreamed of making the world safe for democracy. But a further and protracted jolt was the formation of the United Nations. Not that the idea of an international body was wrong, but that the UN became almost overnight the diplomatic ganglion of hypocrisy. There the Soviet Union dominated the votes of the Third World. After jubilation over the retreat of British imperialism in India, Americans stood shocked and aghast when Pandit Nehru refused to condemn the Soviet tanks that gunned down students in Budapest who sought a few scraps of liberty. 
The United Nations, in short, didn't work, and indeed sheltered the most impudent rhetorical hypocrisies in diplomatic history. 
<p>
After the Nuremberg trials the civilized world seemed to be united on at least one proposition, namely that genocide would not again be tolerated. Well, it was tolerated. When it happened in Africa we 
managed discreet sighs and, in the closet, whispered that civilization had yet to reach certain parts of the world. But then with the end of Communism a refreshment of international idealism temporarily took 
over. The UN, for one thing, would no longer serve as an echo chamber for Soviet lies and hypocrisy. Then along came Yugoslavia, RIP.
<p>
There to the north, northeast, and west loomed the mighty power of Russia, Germany, France, and England. Diplomatic efforts to arrest ethnic cleansing crystallize as games concocted to engage the 
attention of students at war colleges. In the background geographically, in the foreground geopolitically, was the United States. On the one hand it was clearly the burden of Europe to handle 
the mess in Yugoslavia. On the other hand, we were the undisputed superpower, and it turned out that we could not breathe the requisite concern into our NATO allies. And so, month after month, year after 
year, nothing is done except that people kill each other and latent hostilities are stimulated. There is the Serb affinity for Russians and vice versa, the Western European historical affinity for Croatia. 
The Muslim world correctly questions whether there is any reliable concern in Europe for aggressions at its expense. The Greeks watch nervously at movement in the other Macedonia, and the Turks, however frequently they are reminded of their own historical excesses, let it be known that they are brothers of the Bosnians being killed, tortured, raped.
<p>
In New Jersey if year after year a county can't manage its own schools, Trenton takes the schools over. The metaphor is easily resisted: How exactly does NATO take over Belgrade? But that is the 
wrong approach in a century in which the question, How do we split an atom? was answered: We shall proceed to do so. 
<p>
The NATO enterprise is discredited. The Europeans are mired in their spiritual trough, and the feeling in America is, more and more: Two hot wars and one cold war are enough for one century. You figure it 
out.  Unhappily, history won't stand by to permit us our alienation. The reason we are entangled in Europe -- and in the Pacific -- is that we can't escape the consequences of  what happens there.

<title>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</title>

<h2>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
During the recess from Washington, our legislators have an opportunity 
to reflect a little, and it would not be time lost if they gave 
thought to a prayer amendment. There are several reasons to do this. 
One, the restoration of traditional authority for local schools; a 
second, the elucidation of a constitutional disfigurement done over 
the last generation by the Supreme Court; a third, to rebuke the 
Supreme Court for its fanatical misinterpretation of the First 
Amendment. <p>
But the question suddenly arises, Is a constitutional amendment 
necessary? When questioned early in the year about what had gone into 
the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich admitted that thought had 
been given to the prayer amendment but that since it required a two-
thirds majority, this was a challenge better put off until other 
problems had been coped with. The failure of the Balanced Budget 
Amendment (although by a single vote in the Senate) reminded us of the 
difficulty of amassing a two-thirds majority. It is therefore 
especially bracing to consider alternative means of accomplishing the 
same end, devised by the constitutional historian Harry Jaffa of the 
Claremont Institute.<p>
He reasons as follows. Forty-seven of our fifty states explicitly 
invoke the name of God in their own Constitutions. They vary in 
phrasing, but they are nowhere sectarian. By this is meant that the 47 
states in question nowhere cite God using denominational language. The 
President's home state of Arkansas, for instance, launches its 
constitution by saying, "We the people of the State of Arkansas, 
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty, and 
desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . ." In Maine, the people 
acknowledge "with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler 
of the Universe," while from Colorado we have the relatively Spartan 
intelligence that the people, "with profound reverence for the Supreme 
Ruler of the Universe," nevertheless authorize the election of Pat 
Schroeder to Congress. <p>
Suppose that a joint resolution of the Congress, requiring only simple 
majorities in both houses, were to declare that children in public 
schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such 
acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present in their own 
state constitution, or in the constitution of any other state? The 
Supreme Court could go beyond fuming and raging over the ensuing 
resumption of prayer in the public schools only by pronouncing the 
constitutions of 47 states to be unconstitutional. It is a reasonable 
guess that the Court would want to stop short of any such declaration. <p>
And bear in mind that the state constitutions have provisions 
equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of 
the First Amendment. California, for instance, ordains that "Free 
exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or 
preference are guaranteed. . . . The legislature shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion." And we bear also in mind 
that every enabling act by the Congress for the admission of a state 
to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision: "The 
Constitution of [the state being admitted] shall always be republican 
in form and shall not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United 
States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence." <p>
These are freighted words in two senses. As regards the religious-
freedom clauses, we are reminded historically that the 13 states 
admitted to the Union since the Civil War were scrutinized by 
Congress, which in ratifying their constitutions affirmed that they 
were admissible under the U.S. Constitution. More, the invocation of 
the Declaration of Independence, as an instrument to which the 
constitution of the aspiring state must not be "repugnant," 
strengthens the viability of the Declaration, which of course speaks 
of the rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] Creator." Such 
rights are "unalienable" because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God." It is always reassuring to know that 
some element more majestic than the God of legal positivism looks 
after and approves of our liberties. <p>
So then it is up to Speaker Gingrich.<p>

<title>Jerry Garcia, RIP</title>

<i>New York, August 18</i>
<hr>
<h2>Jerry Garcia, RIP</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
If I ever heard a song played by the Grateful Dead I wasn't aware of 
it. If I had been, I'd have pricked up my ears and listened real hard 
because I have a memory. It is of a young man who came to work at my 
shop. He had just graduated from Harvard, wanted to do some opinion 
journalism, and qualified for a summer internship that stretched into 
two or three years.<p>
It was toward the end of the decade of the Sixties that he drew me 
aside one day, after we had gone to press. He said that he had been to 
a concert by the Grateful Dead and that it was a wonderful experience, 
and that he would go again whenever the group was in reach, and he 
invited me to join him at one of the concerts, which I wish I had 
done. <p>
I have to suppose that, like so many others, I would have survived the 
experience without such harm as finally came to Jerry Garcia and, 25 
years before Garcia, to our young intern. He did his work, but with 
progressive listlessness. His editorial paragraphs had never been 
razor sharp but they had been trenchant and readable, and now they 
were murky.<p>
Things got worse, and now came the trappings, which were conventional. 
It began with sandals, then went in the usual direction, though I 
don't remember that he ran a ring through his ear. When an anniversary 
issue was planned for the magazine he suddenly demanded that his 
"generation" be represented, so I told him to go ahead and write what 
he thought would be a useful essay.<p>
I don't remember seeing it myself, but I was told not that it was 
unsuitable, or unfinished, or unprofessional, but that its meaning was 
impenetrable. At about that time an associate ten years older reported 
his (informed) opinion that our intern was going off the deep end. At 
a collegial staff lunch he once excused himself so abruptly as to 
provoke the melancholy conclusion that he had needed a quick jolt of 
whatever drug he was taking. One day he announced that he would be 
married, and soon brought in an addled flower child dressed as he 
dressed. One weekend they just faded away. A few years later we 
received formal invitations to a second marriage, to a South American. 
He went with his new bride to her country and taught English. In due 
course he sent us an article submission. It was potentially 
publishable but needed work, and the managing editor sent it back to 
him with recommended changes. We did not hear from him again, except 
after another interval of five years or so, when we learned he had 
married yet again, this time to a native, and gone off to live in the 
hills. Question before the house: Is Jerry Garcia in some way 
responsible for this?<p>
The issue of Newsweek that put Garcia on the cover quoted in huge type 
the words of a 21-year-old college student. "It's a free life when 
you're at a show. It's all about happiness. I'd just take my watch off 
and want time to stop." It isn't easy to rail against anyone who 
brings happiness, and one has to assume that many, perhaps the 
majority, of those who heard "shows" by the Grateful Dead achieved 
their highs without the use of intoxicants. But something unusual 
accounted for the young Americans, pictures of them reproduced in the 
days just gone by, exhibiting Dionysiac pleasure in their role as 
Deadheads. Exuberance finds its forms throughout the world and 
concentrates its energies on the young. But is the joy unconfined? 
Ought it to be?<p>
Jerry Garcia died only a week after leaving the Betty Ford Center. He 
is quoted as having said two years ago that, really, he needed to do 
something to restore his health, otherwise he would be dead, like "two 
years from now." He went on schedule, and is said to have died with a 
smile on his face, no doubt because he was a happy man but also 
because he made so many others happy. But he also killed, if that's 
the right word for such as our intern, a lot of people. And although 
he had a pulsating forum world wide for thirty years and knew from his 
own experience what his habits were doing to him, he never went public 
on it, not really. One has to suppose, sadly, that in his case, going 
public on his problem, extending a truly firm handshake to his 
legions, would have required the dramatic gesture of retiring from the 
stage. If he had done so, it would not have been wounding to those of 
us who were never exposed to Jerry Garcia's special intoxicant, but, 
if he had done so, how many would have had better prospects for 
health, love, and longer lives?<p>

<title>Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?</title>

<h2>Where Does Fuhrman take Us?</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html">
<b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If the 
exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the trial, 
the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for Detective 
Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a sentiment 
extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former wife and her 
companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors will ask 
themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the analyst 
concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.<p>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt to 
situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that Houdini 
himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence against O. J. 
with which the prosecution has made its case. The chief of police in 
Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press conference that "it is 
inconceivable to believe that for this one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 
people got together to plot against Mr. Simpson." Only Oliver Stone 
could stitch together a plot to do in O. J. that originated at two in 
the morning and matured with a bloody glove at his residence, and 
bloodstains that identified O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here 
and there along the route from the scene of the crime back to 
Simpson's residence.<p>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters 
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling as 
though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during a 
seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are, and the 
jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration. 
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their 
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above all, 
the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its ranks someone 
who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives in fury against the 
existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and civil rights. <p>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman in 
his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar at the 
North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported to her 
(according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion he and 
fellow officers handled four suspects. "We basically tortured them. We 
broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures of the walls 
with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger marks of [them] 
trying to crawl out of the room." A messy business, handling suspects 
in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his fellow law enforcers to 
clean themselves up with a garden hose. <p>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise that 
here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles or in 
Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason, Why 
should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police in Los 
Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the Rodney King 
story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed that there was 
a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed, might have 
intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon. But in the Fuhrman 
telling of the treatment of four suspects there would seem to be 
nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. <p>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun, 
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the years 
by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their treatment by 
him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged in such activity, 
why was he retained in the force? How will he be handled by the law? 
As a perjurer? He swore under oath that he had not used the term 
"nigger" when manifestly he had done so, using the word not in the 
detached tones of a storyteller, but with invidious gusto. "You're 
talking sh--. You sound like a nigger."<p>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who earned 
the confidence of his private investigator because of the coolness of 
his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after the killing. 
How could somebody so casual in his conduct during those hours before 
being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty? But of course such 
reasoning, from the particular to the general, would justify 
confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness stand could not be 
the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes. <p>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far 
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches on the 
recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings -- Americans -
- are capable. <p>

<title>China is Huffing and Puffing</title>

<hr><br>

<h2>China Is Huffing And Puffing</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"> <i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.
</center></b></i></a>
<hr><br>
We must suppose that the generals crowd around the power center in 
Peking with enticing war scenarios, as they dream of a military 
adventure against Taiwan. The Red Chinese, as one used to call them, 
have not fought a war since they took on Vietnam, a venture that ended 
in stalemate. That was twenty-odd years ago, and twenty-odd years 
before that, the Chinese army marched against the United States and 
South Korea, winning an ambiguous victory. That's a long time between 
wars, and the hunger for military action is sharp in the hearts of the 
Old Guard. They are men who stood by Mao Tse-tung during a period when 
he did more than any other man to damage China. And now the military 
sees the abandonment of Maoist ideals and, still more humiliating, an 
exactly corresponding rise in economic productivity. For that reason, 
among others, they clamor for the annexation of Taiwan.<p>

The pressure is exerted through the central figure in China, Deng 
Xiaoping, but biological decomposition is far along, and Deng must 
lean heavily on Li Peng and others. And the whole team would appear to 
speak with one voice on the matter of Taiwan. It isn't that they plan 
tomorrow to invade, but they desire that the diplomatic community 
should acknowledge, so to speak, that that is their right; they are 
dealing, after all, with a rogue province.<p>

The temperature heated almost to explosive levels when the President 
of Taiwan, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, went to Ithaca for a Cornell reunion. The 
eyes of the world were on the event because only one year earlier, 
President Lee had been denied the right to stop over in Hawaii to 
refuel his airplane. The outcry was so sharp on the Western side that 
President Clinton lifted the ban in order to permit the Cornell visit.<p>

How to handle China is a difficult question, but one shouldn't begin 
by picking a fight with Japan. Mr. Clinton pressed China in the cause 
of human rights while accomplishing nothing to further human rights, 
punctuating his Asia policy with threats to forbid the sale of 
Japanese Lexises. Peking withdrew its ambassador from Washington and 
imprisoned Harry Wu. The ambassador is coming back and Harry Wu has 
been released, but the pressure to bring this about had little to do 
with inventive U.S. diplomacy. It had to do with the congress of women 
in Peking, which China did not want to lose. After that, they covet 
the Olympics for 2004.<p>

But Taiwan does not sleep over it all. For one thing, Mr. Lee is going 
to run for a second term as president in March 1996. This will be the 
first election in which all Taiwanese participate. A free election in 
China is itself a unique event, but the Taiwanese venture especially 
galls Peking, on the quite logical grounds that Taiwan is acting like 
an independent country. Which indeed it is doing, which indeed it is. 
The historical haze that sits over the Taiwan Straits, as if Taiwan in 
an accidental moment of recent geological history had become detached 
from the mainland to float 170 miles out to sea, has become a miasma. 
Although there is fear among many Taiwanese of a mainland invasion, 
early indications are that Mr. Lee will be re-elected. He hasn't come 
out for the independence of Taiwan, but he has in recent months 
stressed that Taiwan is not receiving the kind of attention owing to 
an entity which has the most favorable balance of trade in the world 
and ranks tenth in economic power.<p>

And then Taiwan is not a military pushover. It has weapons, including 
American F-5s. Almost as a matter of definition, an island of 21 
million people would fall, in any prolonged engagement, to an army 
recruited from one billion people. But as one Taiwanese recently 
remarked in private conversation, if it looked as if military conquest 
were actually being scheduled, Taiwan could pull the diplomatic card 
from its sleeve: Declare itself an independent country, conduct a 
plebiscite that would confirm this status, and then ask for 
recognition. This would not diminish the mainland's proprietary 
rhetoric, but all the axes of diplomacy would necessarily rotate in 
the direction of recognizing an independent state.<p>

Always there is the possibility of a new regime in Peking after the 
death of Deng. But the prospect of one that is latitudinarian on the 
Taiwan question is beyond today's horizon.<p>

<title>Se Habla Ingles</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5</i><hr>

<h2>Se Habla Ingles</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a><hr></center><br>
 

It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national 
language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. 
academics. The movement to make English the official language of the 
United States is making legislative headway. The State of New 
Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what 
appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to 
presidential candidates.<p>

The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is 
called "U.S. English") is ironically headed up by someone whose native 
language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the 
heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. 
I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa 
wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will 
settle for less; others want more.<p>

There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to 
have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.<p>

The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what 
happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. 
Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful 
country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.<p>

There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been 
permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to 
insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in 
everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again 
Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the 
burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, 
they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or 
else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were 
taught English.<p>

Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The 
first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a faux 
cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in 
the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, 
which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. 
But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is 
entirely different from depending on it.<p>

It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what 
happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps 
millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become 
conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is 
an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and 
newspapers in Spanish.<p>

But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced 
a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he 
has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns 
out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where 
he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of 
them in Spanish.<p>

The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total 
immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those 
who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every 
foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over 
which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at 
McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while 
on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere 
you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in 
English.<p>

The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House 
bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the 
use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, 
whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous 
version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses 
enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally 
accepted as such.<p>

It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago 
a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow 
they plunked her down in a Russian school. "I cried every day for 
about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was 
said in Russian." To stand in the way of young people devoting 
themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging 
obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that 
every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the 
experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny 
brushwood for a few months or years.<p>

<title>The Passions of the Greenpeacers</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 8</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Passions Of the Greenpeacers</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Commentator/philosopher Herbert Agar had a term for it -- "the 
anarchic passion to smash." He was writing fifty years ago about 
whatever it is that causes some people, especially when young, to give 
vent to the impulse to wreck -- if necessary, the nearest thing in 
sight. The politicization of that impulse had a lot of help during 
this century from ideology, which seemed to give it some purpose. The 
young Bolsheviks destroying everything they could lay their hands on 
in St. Petersburg. The young fascists on a spree in Milan. The Nazis, 
who could objectify that passion to smash in search of anything 
Jewish.<p>

We have it now, that anarchic passion, and the animating instrument is 
nuclear -- well, nuclear anything. Most recently the decision by the 
French to conduct some nuclear tests in the South Pacific. But 
anything that has the word "nuclear" attached to it helps to bring on 
that same spirit. Not long ago Jane Fonda was enthralling the younger 
generation by her movie The China Syndrome, the hero of which was a 
nuclear meltdown that threatened, oh, the end of the world, or 
something very close to that. The Greenpeace movement is based on an 
undifferentiated hostility to everything nuclear, and it is having a 
wonderful time these days in Tahiti.<p>

The French are a highly utilitarian people, in ways commendable and 
not so commendable. They acknowledge force majeure, as when Hitler 
quickly and decisively proved that his army was better than their 
army: so they quickly surrendered, and got along with the occupiers 
without too much of a fuss, leaving it to the exiled Charles de Gaulle 
to help to mobilize Great Britain and the United States to effect 
French liberation.<p>

When nuclear power was shown to be a reasonable means of providing 
energy, the French, without much fuss, simply went nuclear, so much so 
that nearly 80 per cent of French electricity is nowadays generated by 
nuclear plants. In the Sixties, President de Gaulle decided that it 
was not prudent to depend on American nuclear missiles to serve as a 
dispositive deterrent to Soviet expansionism, so he developed what he 
called a force de frappe, something small enough to be manageable but 
deadly enough to discourage overt Soviet military aggression. 
President Chirac, thirty years later, was persuaded that one more set 
of tests was necessary to ascertain that French nuclear resources were 
authoritative. Evidently only that one series is deemed necessary to 
achieve the desired level of efficiency -- and safety -- because M. 
Chirac has declared that after the conclusion of these tests, in May, 
he will commit France never again to test nuclear weapons.<p>

Philip Shenon of the New York Times reports on the honeymoon of a 
Seattle dermatologist, Sonja Krejci, and her new husband, Dr. Bill 
Clark, bound for a romantic Polynesian resort island after a scheduled 
connection at Papeete. But when they landed, far from making their 
connecting flight, they were imprisoned in the airport building 
surrounded by rioters, tear gas, and smoke. At one point the rioters 
assaulted everyone with rocks and stones, causing Dr. Clark, who is an 
orthopedic surgeon, to consider the possibility of needing to use his 
professional resources to keep his bride alive. "At one point," 
reports Mr. Shenon, "some of the rioters found a bulldozer, 'and they 
just drove it right into the terminal building -- smashing cars and 
destroying the restaurant,"' as the poor doctor put it. An estimate of 
the damage done to the airport comes to $11 million. No estimate is 
yet in on how many honeymoons originally scheduled for Tahiti have 
been rescheduled elsewhere.<p>

A reader of the ongoing press reports on the activities of Greenpeace 
and others stops suddenly -- or might do so -- to ask: What is it the 
protestors fear? Are the French experiments, conducted 750 miles from 
Tahiti, endangering anybody in Tahiti? For that matter, are they 
endangering anybody or anything in Mururoa, the atoll used for the 
nuclear testing? Has anybody detected a rise in pollutants in the area 
where the first tests were undertaken? Has a whale been killed? Two 
whales? Has $11 million in damage been done to the sea surrounding 
Mururoa?<p>

The answer has to be No, for the simple reason that if it were Yes, we 
absolutely would have heard about it. The Greenpeace types desperately 
need a martyr. A poisoned ocean, a scarred sun -- something that 
points to Chernobyl. But there isn't anything there. Only the anarchic 
passion to smash. <p>

<title>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 15</i>
<hr>
<h2>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Richard Lugar was in town, and when that happens these days to the 
restrained, brainy senior senator from Indiana it means he is engaged 
in promoting his presidential candidacy. You shut your eyes, think for 
a minute: Who is Richard Lugar? The snippets form up deep in the 
memory. Yes . . . Rhodes scholar . . . mayor of Indianapolis . . . 
U.S. senator . . . strangely overlooked by George Bush when he went to 
the other senator from Indiana, Mr. Quayle, as Vice President, given 
that Lugar had been around longer and has here and there been 
prominent in foreign-affairs analysis.<p>

"I know more about foreign policy than anyone running for President or 
serving as President," he says, "and that is a modest claim." He is 
not the wisecracking kind, but it is an effective line and, one 
supposes, will be used by him in Iowa and New Hampshire, provided he 
can find an audience there that is interested in foreign policy.<p>

Well, what are his audiences interested in hearing about? The answer 
is: mostly taxes. Senator Lugar has proposed the elimination of the 
Internal Revenue Service. The what? someone in the company asked. Yes 
. . . exactly that. And a 50 per cent reduction in the capital-gains 
tax. And a $500 tax credit, not exemption, for every child.<p>

Well, but how are we going to finance all that?<p>

A consumption tax. Richard Lugar is all for growth, but he doesn't 
count on it to guarantee the long-term growth of the American economy. 
What we do need to do is to disencumber the economy, which is groggy 
from taxation and regulation. But the future of the economy is the 
world market. Hundreds of millions of people who want, and will 
increasingly be able to pay for, American products.<p>

But doesn't that run into the burgeoning protectionist bloc? Yes, 
indeed it does, and Pat Buchanan is doing a very good job in stirring 
that up. "I had an exchange with Pat recently and I told him the 
United States was running a trade surplus with Europe." He was flatly 
unaware of this, and showed it.<p>

"Senator Gramm said recently," a guest said, "that as a sometime 
economics professor he is well equipped to challenge the high-tariff 
people, but that this can't be done in a two-minute give-and-take or 
over talk radio. Are you going to talk about 'comparative advantage' 
in a stump debate?"<p>

Well, said the senator, the answer to that question is: You have to do 
it. "Do you know something? It costs one thousand dollars less to 
assemble an automobile in Indiana than it does in Mexico. One thousand 
dollars, because our workers have the training, the capital plants, 
the education, the advantages of transportation. Windshield wipers for 
cars, manufactured in Canada, are moving to the U.S. -- because it's 
cheaper. But Pat has them cheering and hollering with arguments from 
another age."<p>

Is it true, as recently heard, that if GATT and NAFTA were up for 
ratification tomorrow in the Senate they wouldn't get through? Yes, 
the senator said, that is true, and true also that some of the young 
Republican congressmen are infected with the protectionist virus.<p>

The candidate went on to talk about the problems of the front-runner. 
A few months ago, he said, Mr. Dole was running ahead of Mr. Clinton 
in California. Now he is behind. It is entirely possible that in May 
the GOP will wake up to find that no one candidate has got a majority 
of the delegates. So what has been planned between May and August? The 
answer to that is: Nothing. Nothing has been planned between May and 
August. But during that time I could knit together my positions -- for 
lower taxes, and increased trade -- and take on Clinton after my 
nomination. "But you have to learn to put your message, like on 
tariffs, down in black and white, in large type."<p>

Well, one guest asked, why haven't you done that? Gotten a couple of 
ad people together and given them that assignment? The senator is not 
fast on the polemical draw. He might have said that there is no 
equivalent of E=mc2 for the tariff argument, but he let it go. "That's 
a good idea."<p>

Is Senator Lugar getting anywhere? The objective indices aren't 
pulling for him. His finances are strained, and he barely showed up in 
the Iowa skirmish two weeks ago. He leaves you with the comfortable 
feeling of having been in the company of a decent, well-educated man 
who was a groundbreaking mayor, and is a fine senator.<p>

<title>Defend America?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Defend America?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois has introduced a measure under the title, 
Defend America Act of 1995. He is joined by Rep. Martin Hoke of Ohio 
in coming up with an idea strange to the imagination, namely that the 
defense of America depends to some extent on the freedom to act, and 
that that freedom to act was substantively forfeited in 1972 in the 
ABM Treaty.<p>

We are talking about that legendary bone of contention that allegedly 
forbids certain kinds of experiments in anti-missile technology, and 
flatly forbids deployment in more than one site. For a long time, a 
technical argument engaged legislators and diplomats as to whether 
experiments focused on the "brilliant pebble" were precluded under the 
terms of the 1972 agreement. The idea has been to arm satellites with 
slingshots, in effect, to destroy atmosphere-bound missiles. But the 
interesting question became, in the first phase, Why don't we pull 
away from the 1972 treaty? When Caspar Weinberger was secretary of 
defense under President Reagan he argued the legitimacy of 
experimentation, but Congress was not convinced, and appeasers all 
over the world argued against pulling back from any treaty the Soviet 
Union had agreed to.<p>

Mr. Reagan, though the proud author of the original insight into anti-
missile missiles (the Strategic Defense Initiative), never got around 
to serving the six-month notice required by the treaty to announce its 
rescission. Out of office, Mr. Weinberger publicly argued in favor of 
rescission, but his voice and other voices were drowned out by 
appeasers and others afraid of any initiative the Soviet Union would 
frown on.<p>

But of course now, although we have a treaty, there is a question 
whether the entity with which we entered into that arrangement still 
exists. The government of "Russia" is not the legitimate heir to the 
government of the Soviet Union, any more than the government of Lenin 
was the heir to the government of Nicholas II. Still . . . (it is 
argued) it does no particular harm to proceed as though the treaty 
were alive. The thing to do is to rescind it.<p>

Now this can hardly be interpreted as a provocative act given that the 
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction is no longer operative, since 
Russia and America are no longer at war against each other. But the 
Senate of the United States, on September 6, reached a "bipartisan 
compromise" on the matter of missile defense. The senators who 
produced that compromise claimed to have been guided by their concern 
for missile defense. But what they proceeded to do was to authorize 
future deployment only on behalf of America's allies, and American 
forces abroad. The important question, which has to do with research 
and deployment for continental defense, is therefore skirted, leaving 
us, in the phrase of defense strategist Frank Gaffney, in a state of 
"abject vulnerability" to nuclear attack by missiles of a rogue state.<p>

The senators who framed the great evasion of September 6 acknowledge 
all the correct things. "The threat that is posed to the national 
security of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and 
cruise missiles is significant and growing, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. . . . There is a danger that determined countries will 
acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and 
with little warning by means other than indigenous development." The 
senators' research even acknowledges that "the concept of mutual 
assured destruction, which was one of the major philosophical 
rationales for the ABM Treaty, is now questionable as the basis for 
stability in a multipolar world." So? So -- do nothing. That is, 
nothing that contributes to continental defense.<p>

Congressman Hyde, with his keen eye for the quick of a question, 
acknowledges that the shadow of the 1972 treaty has the effect of 
dimming strategic and tactical visibility, and should be disposed of 
once and for all. Accordingly, the Hyde -  Hoke measure would direct 
the President to notify the Russian Federation that the United States 
intends to exercise its right under the treaty's Article XV to 
withdraw from the accord.<p>

One has to hope that an enlightened debate will ensue. There aren't 
really many questions that need answering. 1) Does rescission of the 
treaty in any conceivable way endanger Russia? (No.) 2) Can research 
and deployment help us to shore up our defenses? (Yes.) 3) Are there 
other nations that might benefit from a vigorous anti-missile program? 
(Yes. All nations that wish protection from missiles.)<p>

<title>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
The entry into the presidential race of Malcolm (Steve) Forbes Jr. is 
something more than merely ho-ho time. Commentator William Schneider, 
on CNN, snappily summed it up: If Dole stumbles, it becomes an open 
race, and Forbes has the money to project his views.<p>

They are as rumored. The single unusual feature of his free-market 
program is a call for a return to the gold standard, something we have 
not heard much about since Lewis Lehrman retired from politics. Money-
exchange issues don't have the sex they had back when William Jennings 
Bryan set out to save the American people from crucifixion on a cross 
of gold. What the word "gold" tends to communicate today is merely 
sound currency, anti-inflation. Mr. Forbes assured his following that 
when his Administration takes office, once again people will be able 
to think in terms of 4.5 per cent interest rates on their mortgages.<p>

Beware, said Forbes, the use of the comparative "-er." As in "cheaper" 
government, "lower" taxation. Forbes would do away entirely with the 
tax code. He calls for a $36,000 exemption from federal taxes, after 
which the tax would be a flat 17 per cent. Capital-gains taxes would 
be phased out. Prometheus, unbound.<p>

Steve Forbes will tell you in unharassed conversation that there is 
something missing in the other campaigners for the Republican 
nomination. In his announcement speech he paid the formal courtesies 
to the other candidates: every one of them would be an improvement on 
what we now have. "[Yet] I think a lot of people would agree, there is 
an empty feeling in this campaign so far. One reason is that none of 
the other candidates is raising high the banner of economic expansion 
and opportunity. . . . But there are other reasons for the empty 
feeling. The fact is, the other candidates, on both sides, are 
insiders. And we all know that if the insiders had the answers, they 
would have implemented them by now." The emphasis, says Forbes, is on 
his own entrepreneurial background. This uniquely qualifies him, in 
his understanding, to lead the charge to high-octane economic energy.
<p>
But when he has the quiet opportunity to do so, he focuses, of course, 
on Phil Gramm, the only competitor in sight, in the event Dole should 
founder. "He is as smart a man as I have ever known," Steve Forbes 
will tell you. But -- he thinks -- Gramm's candidacy overstresses the 
negative, the need to cut spending in particular. Forbes is the 
enthusiast who sees an American giant bursting with innovative energy, 
shackled by the Lilliputians of Washington with their tax codes, 
regulations, bureaucracy -- the culture of Washington, which, he says, 
as a true outsider he is uniquely liberated from. Steve Forbes truly 
believes that the special music in the political air of 1996 is not 
elsewhere being heard, and that he can serve as the tunesmith for the 
nation.<p>

The announcement speech he made was hardly musical (". . . like John 
F. Kennedy did," "like Ronald Reagan did . . ." -- Steve Forbes and 
Adlai Stevenson attended the same college!). But it was very very 
American. He has come into the political fight with the brashness of 
the wholesome iconoclast. There is nothing there of the grouch, no 
petulance, no swagger: Steve Forbes is not Ross Perot. And even though 
the odds are preposterously adverse, he is willing to make the run and 
to finance his own campaign.<p>

What can sympathetic but skeptical conservatives say about it all? 
"Look," Forbes said recently to a friend. "I am a male, I am white, a 
Protestant, an Ivy Leaguer, rich, business-oriented, without practical 
political experience. It couldn't be worse, but at least I'd like to 
be free to fall down on my own arse, without any help from 
conservatives." Fair enough, and bon voyage. <p>

<h2>Grave Business In Los Angeles</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>


 

The cliche has it that anything Johnnie Cochran et al. can do to 
spring their client is okay. If this is so, they have certainly abided 
by that liberty. At the end of Thursday, Mr. Cochran had done his best 
to convince the jurors that either O. J. Simpson is guiltless and 
should be set free, and perhaps lionized in an effort to expiate the 
troubles he has seen, or else the jurors don't believe in the Bible, 
in the Constitution, or that Hitler went too far.
                                              <P>
Now pay close attention to what is going on. The cameras take us to an 
impromptu press conference called by Fred Goldman, who is the father 
of Ron, the young man killed alongside Nicole. Mr. Goldman is teeming 
with resentment and fires both barrels. "He's talking about racism and 
he's talking about hate? Who does he connect himself with? This man 
ought to be ashamed of himself to talk among decent human beings. He 
is one of the most disgusting human beings I have ever had to listen 
to in my life. Because of racism, we should put aside all other 
thoughts, all other reason, and set his murdering client free?"
                                    <P>
Well, that statement brought counterfire from the other side. The 
elder sister of O.J. took the floor for the first time to plead the 
innocence and virtue of her brother. But she said something more 
important, really, than that she was standing by for sibling loyalty. 
She said that "only" the jurors could pronounce the truth on all these 
questions being raised. The truth, of course, on whether O.J. killed 
Nicole and Goldman. But, derivatively, the case Mr. Cochran was 
pleading: that Mark Fuhrman, the racist detective, was 
indistinguishable from Adolf Hitler, that the Los Angeles police are 
happy to send an innocent man to jail for life, even though they know 
him not to be guilty. The point here is that, once again, we are asked 
to see the jury as an instrument for uncovering the Truth. To believe 
this is to surrender to the powers of hypnotists.
                         <P>
That of course is what Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck have attempted 
to do, to hypnotize the jury, and the inducements have been about as 
comprehensive as they can be. If you believe that Hitler was evil, 
then you have to fight Hitlerism in America, which is embodied in Mark 
Fuhrman, who uncovered the glove with O.J.'s blood on it, which glove 
had been placed there by Hitler. If you believe that the Los Angeles 
Police Department did some sloppy work, then you must believe that its 
motive in doing so was to advance the fraudulent case against O.J. If 
you believe, with Luke, that little lies often indicate bigger lies, 
then you must vindicate O.J. You cannot, simultaneously, believe in 
O.J.'s guilt, and in St. Luke's divine inspiration.
                <P>
It does remind one -- does it not? -- of some of the great show trials 
of the Thirties, conducted by Stalin. When it was charged that 
Bukharin was guilty of counterrevolutionary activity, not only the 
Soviet court nodded its acquiescent head, but a lot of other people 
did too, including American intellectuals. It required the labors of 
the Dewey Commission and some hard analysis by a generation of 
scholars to set the record absolutely right. In Moscow the court was 
the creature of Josef Stalin and would have ruled, if told to do so, 
that the earth is flat. The question seriously arises whether the 
court, in Los Angeles, becomes the creature of Johnnie Cochran, whose 
use of apocalyptic rhetoric transforms the question, Did he do it, or 
did he not do it? into the question, Do you believe in God, do you not 
believe in God? Into, Do you believe in civil liberties, do you not 
believe in civil liberties? 
                                                                                <P>
If one had confidence in Judge Ito one might hope that he could move 
the jury back to reality, to relieve the jury of any notion that it is 
complicit in Nazism if it finds O.J. guilty. How would the Soviet 
court have reacted if it had been given, the day before its ruling, 
Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon to read? But Judge Ito is in over 
his head, and just possibly it is true that Western judicial procedure 
is in over its head. If a persuasive shaman is left free to seduce a 
bleary, near-dead-from-fatigue jury that theirs is to justify death, 
or to save Western idealism, then we are talking about something very 
different from the administration of justice.

<title>Buckley:  The Hangover</title>

<hr>

<h2>The Hangover</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, "I think the O.J. 
verdict should be protested." The brainy professor said, "How?"
                            <P>
Indeed. How?
                    <P>
The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we 
must accept the verdict and turn over a new leaf. Well, it is one 
thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing 
that O. J. Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another 
thing to abide by the superstition that justice has been done. A lot 
of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free 
because white jurors wouldn't convict them. But there are those who 
left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and yelled, and 
insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come 
naturally to a lot of people, but the brainy wife of the brainy 
professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
          <P>
One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal 
acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie Cochran tells the 
press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as 
he knew it would be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman 
to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will of God as 
motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the 
relatives of O.J. sincerely thought him to be innocent, and pass over 
their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are 
we to make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction 
has been swept away, the police should get serious and search out the 
real killer. He, O.J., will do "whatever it takes" to identify him. 
One way to begin this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample 
to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 million with the 
telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about 
in Tibet, Tierra del Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on 
the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>
And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-
vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie Cochran was on Larry King Live on 
Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! O.J. 
is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who 
had called in to ask Mr. Cochran to explain the shadowy creature who 
had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the 
woman not listen to the witness, because the witness, if you followed 
him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much 
he, O.J., had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the 
testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, understand?
                                     <P>
It is on the order of rising to say, "I told you there wasn't a purple 
cow on the property that night, DID I NOT?" People begin nodding their 
heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene 
that night in June, one little piece at a time. 
                         <P>
What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, 
somebody asked? Answer: One would hope none. But there is most 
definitely a danger there. When 75 percent of black Americans believe 
that the answer is A, not B, and 75 percent of white Americans 
believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we have is a breakdown 
in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common 
language and a common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very 
very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic group flatly 
disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the 
structure of rational arguments. It is simply wrong to suppose that 
the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It 
is simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent 
because he was black. And -- remarkably -- those figures remained 
static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting 
for the white majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged 
in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of it. 
                <P>
Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up 
from their caves with evidence that St. Francis of Assisi ate live 
pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse 
to believe it. Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. 
But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the innocence of O.J. 
is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite 
awful setback.

<title>Buckley:  Understanding the Papal Bull</title>

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding the Papal Bull</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>



The impression made by Pope John Paul was quite simply stunning. 
Granted, the panoply was intoxicatingly splendid; yet all those 
millions of candles and choirboys and bishops would not have given the 
spectator such life as he got from what he saw and heard if its 
centerpiece had been a nice old bore. The transfiguring feature of all 
those appearances was the man, and his words. "May the Holy Spirit 
strengthen your hearts, making them blameless and holy before our God 
and Father, so that you may serve His people with ever greater joy." 
We are not talking about sound bites.
                                                            <P>
But one needs to be reminded that the exhortations of a pope are 
customarily done in the paradigmatic mode, which is fitting for the 
primary spokesman for Biblical injunctions. The language of Moses and 
of Christ is totalist in its formulation. We are enjoined to be -- 
saintly.
                                            <P>
This is beyond the reach of all but the very few. Even so, what we 
hear said about how we should be cannot be attenuated by the 
foreknowledge of man's inability to attain perfection. Give everything 
you have to the poor and join the pilgrimage of Christ -- here is a 
rock-solid injunction, toward the discharge of which human efforts are 
almost necessarily asymptotic. States are the organs of individuals, 
and so one runs into difficulties translating Christian imperatives 
into social policy. This is a problem that every pope in this century 
has faced, and Pope John Paul II cannot solve it, perhaps because it 
cannot be solved.
                            <P>
It has frequently been noticed that papal declarations tend to be 
undernourished on the matter of production. The emphasis is almost 
always on distribution. Thus we hear from papal declarations dating 
back more than one century about the obligation of the rich to give to 
the poor. The question naturally arises: It is right for Wealthy John 
to give to Poor Peter, but do we translate this into an obligation by 
John to vote to instruct Internal Revenue to descend on Wealthy James, 
to give to Poor Peter? The incorporation of individual virtue into 
state policy is a difficult business.
                 <P>
Consider the question of immigration. The Pope said, shortly after 
landing, "America keeps compassion, generosity and concern for others 
at the very heart of its efforts. . . . From the beginning until now, 
the United States has been a haven for generation after generation of 
new arrivals. Men, women, and children have streamed here from every 
corner of the globe, building new lives and forming a society of rich 
ethnic and racial diversity based on commitment to a shared vision of 
human dignity and freedom."
  <P>
Now this is not accurate historical accounting. What it is is a 
sublimation of American history. It is American history as it would be 
recounted if Americans were all saints -- and if no grass ever grew to 
interrupt the waterflow of goodness.
                                                                              <P>
What is true is that American compassion has been marked and still is: 
50 per cent of the world's immigration to the developed countries is 
into the United States. But it is also true that several times in 
American history Congress has elected to limit, or even to suspend, 
immigration. Sometimes the motivations of individual congressmen are 
xenophobic -- they just don't want any more foreigners. The Oriental 
Exclusion Act was quite straightforward on this matter.
                                                               <P>
But sometimes, also, practical considerations were at the forefront of 
legislative action. During the Depression it would hardly have made 
sense to invite a large wave of immigrants into a country in which 
millions were suffering and 20 per cent were unemployed. And then the 
question arises today: Is it a trespass on Christian principles to 
advocate a temporary restriction in the current rate of immigration? 
Is Barbara Jordan -- who headed the commission that recommended 
exactly that -- anti-Christian?
                                               <P>
Manifestly, it isn't so. Yet to advocate reduced immigration isn't to 
fault the Pope for speaking in the language of prophets, who deal not, 
and should not deal, with such questions as: Is California going broke 
under the burden? Is multiculturalism breaking up our culture? Why are 
there national borders, if immigration is not properly a matter of 
government policy?
                                   <P>
What we are left with is the papal injunction to: compassion, 
generosity, and concern for others. The particularization of those 
sentiments is necessarily a problem for individual states.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Should There Be a Law?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13</i><hr><h2>Should There Be a Law?</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 

This is an exploratory column, its purpose to encourage thought on a 
question that badly needs thinking about. 
<p>
The Problem: The birth every year of one million babies to unwed 
mothers. 
<p>
The Consequence: One million children who, on reaching the age of 13, 
tend to run into difficulties. The statistics tell us that the child 
raised by a single parent is likelier by a factor of 600 per cent to 
commit crimes, consume drugs, quit school, and bear, or sire, children 
out of wedlock. Assume -- if only to be hopeful -- that the problems 
diminish after age 19, we are still left with six million teenagers 
who are a heavy social burden, as also, of course, a burden to 
themselves. 
<p>
A Social Deterrent? Since manifestly it is against the interest of 
society, for reasons moral and material, to encourage the birth of 
babies to unwed mothers, what might be done to discourage the 
practice? Only one serious suggestion has been made, and at book 
length, by Mr. Charles Murray. He believes that welfare payments to 
unwed mothers serve as inducements and therefore that to eliminate 
that miscarriage of charity would significantly reduce illegitimacy 
(which is up, in the last thirty years, from 5 per cent to 18 per cent 
among whites, from 25 per cent to 63 per cent among blacks). We have 
seen that Congress has played around with this question, and that the 
proposal is well on its way to limit payments to two illegitimate 
births. This approach hardly addresses the problem with appropriate 
sternness. Among other things, we all know that if the third child 
were sick or starving, we'd look after it. The effort should focus on 
preventing the procreative act, rather than on mistreating the child.
<p>
A Civil Delinquency? As things now stand, the father (or mother) of a 
child born out of wedlock runs into no civil resistance of any sort. 
As far as the law is concerned, it is safer to have a bastard child 
than to double-park. A couple of years ago Bill Moyers did a 
documentary on the culture of wanton sex and found himself speaking to 
a young black stud, about twenty years old if memory serves, who 
proudly acknowledged fatherhood of three children by three different 
girls/ women, and gaily announced his intention of pursuing his 
bluebirdism, since he found it amusing. All that Mr. Moyers was able 
to manage was a gentle sigh for the pieties of yesteryear, which will 
get you exactly nothing from the people we are talking about. 
<p>
Are There Other Deterrents? Well yes, there are. To list some such is 
not necessarily to recommend them. But just as the Pentagon 
undoubtedly has a file on how to invade Switzerland, here is one on 
some of the deterrents that might be given a little thought.
<p>
 -- Deny a driving license to the parents for five years. (This side 
of imprisonment and death by hanging, this is the deepest known 
deprivation in the American culture.)
<p>
 -- Require the father to perform ten hours of appropriate work every 
week on whatever project makes sense. 
<p>
 -- Require the father to spend three evenings every week sequestered. 
Including Saturday night.
<p>
 -- Do a vasectomy on the man. A Norplant on the girl. 
<p>
Now these approaches raise problems, to put it lightly. There is, to 
begin with, the problem of locating the father. This accomplished, 
some proceeding or another would need to address the question whether, 
when the sexual union was done, the parties had agreed somewhere along 
the line to get married. In Sweden, about one-half the babies are 
conceived pre-marriage, but 90 per cent are born to two parents living 
together. How do you handle the situation: "Henry said he loved me and 
we'd be married just as soon as he finished high school"?
<p>
Is there a constitutional problem? Suppose that Henry says that 
without a driver's license he will be fired, because he earns his 
money delivering newspapers? Can the physical detention of the father 
be done without a judicial proceeding? Are there at hand convenient 
ways of absolutely identifying the father by DNA? Are vasectomies and 
Norplants acceptable, under such circumstances, in moral theology?
<p>
All these are designed as open questions, to flush out thought. 
Although commentary can't be acknowledged, I'd welcome having it, 
directed to me here at NATIONAL REVIEW, 150 East 35th Street, New 
York, N.Y. 10016.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  The UN at 50</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24</i><hr><h2>The UN at 50</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on 
undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a 
jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that 
Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, 
on the grounds that they were not "peace-loving nations." They were 
three countries that had not gone to war. But the term "peace-loving" 
had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the 
"Democratic Republic of Germany," which was Soviet-speak for 
undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 
<p>
In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a 
permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same 
rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third 
World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet 
measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited 
the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly 
established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided 
over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; 
and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 
<p>
On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by 
giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro 
spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the 
usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in 
Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to 
the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, 
Uncle Sam. 
<p>
We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN 
these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the 
organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on 
the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar 
world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at 
the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 
1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving 
economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on 
our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-
keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant 
committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense 
of an organization not all that popular back home.
<p>
But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the 
State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case 
should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the 
deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are 
the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be 
nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for 
cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to 
the United Nations.
<p>
The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate 
pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the 
tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging 
U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits 
of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba 
given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the 
overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, 
but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, 
and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing 
policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with 
Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the 
Soviet Union, so why Castro?
<p>
He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded 
us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to 
return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd 
almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. 
About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and 
jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist 
slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. 
leadership. 
<p>
But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its 
pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN 
sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  New York Live</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 27</i><hr><h2>New York Live</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
New York City early in the week was just the place to sharpen up on 
political and social protocol, Messrs. Giuliani and Rangel acting as 
dancing masters. The headlines went to the mayor, who sent two 
bouncers to Lincoln Center to escort Yasir Arafat out of the theater. 
This was done, apparently, even though the Palestinian delegation had 
received three tickets for the concert organized by the mayor for his 
international diplomats. The ouster was hailed by Mr. Giuliani's most 
intimate associates, condemned by everyone else, the State Department 
apoplectic in the matter. Mr. Giuliani's point was that as a 
prosecutor years ago he had handled, or been given to study, instances 
of terrorism done by Arafat and his organization. He would not, he 
declared to the press, serve as gracious host to anyone who had 
engaged in terrorism. 
<p>
That position can empty the house, of course. The former prime 
minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, not only participated in terrorist 
activity, he headed up Irgun, a terrorist organization. Nelson 
Mandela, even in jail, headed up an organization that proudly and 
defiantly exercised and defended terrorism. But if Mayor Giuliani had 
led President Mandela from the floor, he'd have provoked the black 
community, and maybe even would have violated one of the civil-rights 
laws. President Jiang Zemin of China is not too old to have 
participated in the Cultural Revolution, sustained by acts of state 
terrorism designed to tranquilize inquisitive children. And of course 
we had Castro.
<p>
Castro is a continuing phenomenon. After his opening speech at the UN 
he donned his battle fatigues and went up to Harlem, where he was 
treated as O.J. would have been if he had killed two women, not just 
one. Representative Charlie Rangel gave and got a bear hug, a 
significant emotional advancement for a man who only a few years ago 
railed against any commerce, diplomatic or material, with South 
Africa. <p>

The curious were entitled to wonder exactly why. Why should Democratic 
die-hard Charles Rangel be enthusiastic about the accomplishments of 
Fidel Castro? To begin with, there are no accomplishments save for 
full employment for prison guards and executioners. The only 
significant accomplishment of Fidel Castro is to have kept himself 
alive, given that there are at least a million Cubans who would gladly 
pull the trap on any scaffold on which Fidel Castro was poised. And 
staying alive was a considerable achievement, given that the United 
States' Operation Mongoose made several attempts to assassinate him, 
including one that dispatched for his use a scuba-diving suit that 
after a few minutes would transform itself into a host of piranhas; 
and, on another occasion, a superb cigar, except that it was designed 
to explode after two or three draws. On this matter, Fidel had himself 
a good laugh, when he told his audience in Harlem that he was not 
participating in State Department ceremonies because he didn't want to 
"interfere in this country's foreign affairs." 
<p>
Castro was received at the Council on Foreign Relations, which is okay 
given that the CFR flat-out invites any state leader, no questions 
asked, to its chambers to discuss that leader's line. And then also 
Castro dined privately with twenty establishment figures. Among them 
was Robert McNamara, defense secretary at the time Castro was 
receiving nuclear missiles aimed at the United States. We must suppose 
that Secretary McNamara apologized for acting so peremptorily back in 
1962 when he demanded the withdrawal of the missiles. We like to think 
that Castro was big about it and forgave McNamara. 
<p>
He was after all in an expansive mood, boasting that there were more 
doctors per capita in Cuba than in the United States and offering to 
send to America a few doctors to look after Americans in need. We were 
reminded of Eva Peron, who in 1949 offered straightfacedly to send 
clothes for the underclad children in Washington. . . . <p>And all the 
while New Yorkers thought that the burlesque was on Broadway.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 7</i>

<hr>

<h2>Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

Viewing the TV and reading the papers in the days after the 
assassination one got some idea of how Mr. Rabin operated. One 
reporter said that to see Mr. Rabin was as easy as calling him up and 
taking the ten-minute trip from the reporter's office to the office of 
the prime minister. Another spoke of his "thirty or forty" sessions 
with him over the years.
<p>
And then there were the eulogies. A retired professor who served many 
years on the college admissions committee spoke once of the skill 
developed after a few years in detecting letters of recommendation 
that are synthetic. Just so, listeners to eulogies develop after a 
while an ability to discriminate between the formalistic and the 
genuine. Many eloquent statements were made, some of them -- from men 
and women who had worked closely with Rabin -- heartfelt beyond any 
histrionic power to deceive. The tribute paid by Henry Kissinger is 
not easily forgotten.
<p>
Three days ago I'd have thought it singular to recall that twice Mr. 
Rabin was with me on Firing Line and that he had once come with a 
friend to lunch with my wife and me in Switzerland. To say this now, 
which is to confess to only three encounters with him over the years, 
suggests I was practically an exile, all but ignored by the great man, 
so profuse were his journalistic and social energies.
<p>
The various passions stirred by his death are by now familiar. We know 
that a cruel element of the tragedy was the background of the 
assassin: of all things, an Orthodox Jew, rising to kill the greatest 
living Jewish hero. There is the consternation having to do with the 
political legacy. Yes, Shimon Peres will pursue the same ends. But 
although it is acknowledged that the death of Mr. Rabin will renew the 
momentum of the peace movement, its longevity cannot be taken for 
granted. When Lincoln died (Ambassador Eagleburger likened the two 
events) the nation was for a period buoyed by the sentiments he 
expressed in his second inaugural address, but it was not long before 
Reconstruction became the ugly thing it was.
<p>
In the case of Israel, something needs to be done to restore the 
perspective of those who fought Rabin. It is difficult to believe that 
people who deem themselves Israeli patriots would as recently as a few 
weeks ago design an effigy of Rabin wearing swastikas. In New York 
City one young follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane declared on 
television that violence can be "bad" but it can also be "good." He 
had whatever reserve of good sense it took to decline to say that he 
was pleased that Rabin had been a target of "good" violence, but he 
left that impression, cultivating as he was the line that the return 
by Israel of parts of the West Bank was high treason.
<p>
Policy differences, then, can hardly be expected to disappear in 
tribute to one martyr. Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu was convincing in his 
disavowal of the killer-division of the Israelis who join him in 
opposing the policies of Rabin and Peres. But there are Jews who are 
models of civil rectitude who oppose those policies, and they will not 
be silenced by the silencing of Mr. Rabin, nor should they: the 
security of Israel is properly the paramount concern of the Israeli 
government.
<p>
It's not all that easy to communicate to others the meaning of the 
birth of the State of Israel. Jeffrey Hart, writing several years ago, 
put it, "Now I can understand why Israel in fact has become sacred. 
The history of the twentieth century is, to put it mildly, unique. The 
Holocaust is a sort of hole in the cosmos, a guarantor of the 
existence of evil. It is an equivalent for Jews of the Crucifixion. 
Israel then became the equivalent of the Redemption. This is true even 
for relatively secular Jews. Judaism has never successfully separated 
God and Tribe. The People itself is the God carrier. I think that from 
a full experience of the twentieth century I am willing to accept the 
sacredness of Israel as a religious fact."
<p>
That is the reason the death of Yitzhak Rabin was a transfiguring 
event. That he died, and how he died, and when he died, and for what 
he died. <p>

<html><head><title>Buckley:  What Made Colin Run?</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<center>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>What Made Colin Run?</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

The grave dignity of Colin Powell's announcement had the effect of 
causing dismayed observers to thrash out at those who had opposed his 
candidacy. This is a psychological phenomenon: Mom has an accident 
coming home from work and reproaches abound -- Why did Dad let her go 
on working so late in life? Why didn't Sonny, who after all is a car 
salesman, force Mom to get a better, stronger car? To say nothing of 
Mom's stupid eye doctor, who should have known Mom's glasses needed 
strengthening.
<p>
It happens even to wise and street-smart chappies, e.g., William 
Safire of the New York Times. He let himself go twice in his Powell 
column, once directly, once obliquely. He set up his target by 
carefully orienting his argument as testimony to General Powell's 
courage, a technique he knows as paralepsis, which is the affirmation 
of the point you wish to make by denying it ("I come to bury Caesar, 
not to praise him"); only Safire did it the other way around. 
"Certainly Powell was not chased off the field by the performance last 
week before the National Press Club of the Hard-Right Follies; the 
finger-wagging by that old abortion-and-school-prayer set was manna 
from Heaven for a moderate Republican's nomination campaign." Later in 
the same column, Mr. Safire made reference to "Arlen Specter, the pro-
choice candidate, with nobody on his side on that issue except the 
majority of Republican voters."
<p>
The Miami Herald weighed in weightily. "True conservatives want frugal 
government, but also prudent investments in children, concern for the 
needy, and a desire to widen economic opportunity, not just pile 
benefits onto the wealthy. General Powell says that 'the party of 
Lincoln' (a phrase borrowed from Kemp) [my impression was that the 
phrase was first used by Andrew Johnson] can balance these interests 
best, and that's why he chose to be a Republican. But he recognizes 
that he will have to fight -- hard -- to restore those values to a 
party lately hijacked by the Christian Coalition and its acolytes." 
And then Maureen Dowd, also of the New York Times, contributed the 
news that General Powell "had exposed the Christian Right as a 
panicked sectarian phenomenon."
<p>
What are we to make of all this? The Christian Right is indeed 
sectarian, which is why it isn't the Muslim Right, or the Jewish 
Right, however much the three faiths may have in common. And 
"panicked" is probably a defensible term to describe a movement deeply 
concerned by a rise of 400 per cent in serious crimes during the past 
generation and 300 per cent in illegitimate births. The word 
"panicked" is subjectively used, of course. Only three days ago, one 
newspaper report informed us that President Clinton was "panicked" at 
the prospect of General Powell's running. We have to assume that a 
metaphor was intended, given that nobody caught Bill Clinton about to 
throw himself out the window.
<p>
But the reference by Bill Safire is confusing, the business about 
"that old abortion-and-school-prayer set." Either he is saying that 
there should be term limits on concern over abortion and school 
prayer, or else he is saying that the questions have been debated and 
are behind us. It isn't that Mr. Safire is indisposed to stay in a 
battle for as long as it takes. He was a doughty soldier during the 
Cold War, which began many years before Roe v. Wade, but Safire was in 
there right up until the Berlin Wall came down, God bless him, and if 
it takes a hundred years to guarantee the safety of Israel, we cannot 
reasonably doubt that Bill Safire's great-grandchildren will be 
sounding the Zionist bell, and more power to them. If he is saying 
that, on the contrary, people ought to give up on school prayer, there 
are those who respectfully disagree, among them -- who knows? -- God!, 
who is contingently capable of influencing elections. And a call to 
acknowledge human life in the fetus isn't a question of the kind one 
ought to get bored about unless research absolutely establishes that, 
all the time, a fetus was really no different from a tomato.
<p>
The right-wing gentlemen who met last week to serve notice on General 
Powell that he had made references disquieting to them, honorable 
representatives of conservative positions within the GOP, spoke 
respectably on the issues to which they have devoted themselves for 
many years. They didn't raise a single question about General Powell 
that hadn't been raised, that same week, by George Will, but Mr. 
Safire and Miss Dowd and the Miami Herald have an instinctive sense -- 
maybe it was sharpened by reading General Powell's autobiography? -- 
who to pick on when Mom has an accident on the highway, and who to let 
alone.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14</i>
<hr>
<h2>X-Ray Time</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly 
democratic prism.
<p>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely to 
pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only the 
House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<p>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him by 
Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds of the 
vote in each house.
<p>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes a 
measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including 
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain 
Medicaid and Medicare.
<p>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically about 
the measure's health-care provisions.
<p>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override of the 
veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its hand on the 
President?
<p>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are 
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they 
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They are 
to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing so is 
blocked by the President's power.
<p>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity, 
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally 
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot be 
interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires 
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations by 
Congress.
<p>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered 
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey 
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that 66 per 
cent of Americans favor "balancing the budget [even] if that means 
that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue to increase but 
at a lower rate." Accordingly, Congress uses its trump card and 
freezes spending at the highest level authorized by a preceding 
Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<p>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress 
used its primordial power.
<p>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved. 
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the party 
upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election, the prime 
minister would resign and be replaced by a member of the validated 
party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be back with a compliant 
legislature. But then, the prime minister wouldn't be occupying the 
executive mansion unless placed there by the ruling faction in the 
legislature. What we face today is what the British would call a 
constitutional crisis.
<p>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for a 
period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers. The 
Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run out of gas 
unless a major creditor nation decides that there is too much harum-
scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves in dollars, 
switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<p>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people are 
vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress, but 
they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with medical 
care, and that element of Americans most concerned is of course the 
senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical clout. The 
President is relying on his incantatory evocations of starving 
children and homeless old people, with here and there a tear shed for 
what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential indignation makes its 
way quickly to the headlines.
<p>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all those 
things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which is that 
references are almost inevitably to the "rigid," the "defiant," the 
"reckless" Congress, the complement of the lonely, single defender of 
the people's interest. There was never a better example of everybody 
being out of step except Johnny.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 17</i>
<hr>
<h2>25 Hours at Sea</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Countdown time. In little more than a week, the government of the 
United States is scheduled to close down, there having been an impasse 
between the Executive Branch of government and the Legislative Branch. 
An esteemed world leader is assassinated, resulting in an Air Force 
One flight to Israel. Lo and behold, in the very same airplane are: 
the leader of the Executive Branch and the two leaders of the 
Legislative Branch. 
<P>
They will be 25 hours in the same airplane! Could it be that the God 
Jehovah planned it that way? The golden opportunity to come together, 
35,000 feet up in the air, a thousand miles away from the nearest air 
field, and spend some time discussing the future of the Republic? 
<P>
But protocol reigns, and the airplane belongs, so to speak, to the 
leader of the Executive Branch; the two leaders of the Legislature are 
on board as guests. The initiative, therefore, has to come from the 
host.
<P>
But he doesn't approach them. Why? Well, we are told, he was grieving 
the loss of the slain world leader. The President of the United States 
could not drive from his mind his concern for intra-Israeli 
reconciliation. During the 12 hours heading east all he could think of 
was -- Hebron. To that problem, and the surrounding problem of the 
West Bank, he bent his mighty political powers -- that, and his 
concern for the grieving widow and children. 
<P>
On the journey back, the doctor told the President he simply had to 
make an effort -- as a sacrifice for his country -- to distract 
himself from his preoccupation with Israeli fratricide. He needed 
therapy. And, since Bill Clinton is a soldier, even if he never went 
through formal basic training, he consented to make the effort, but 
stipulated that the only game he would consent to play was Hearts, 
which reminded him of the valentines he used to exchange with the 
slain prime minister. 
<P>
Meanwhile, at the other end of the plane the two legislative leaders 
fidgeted, wondering when the President would come in, or else summon 
them to his quarters, to put it all out on the table. There isn't that 
much time left! is what was going through their minds. They looked out 
the window and saw Ireland go by, no summons. A couple of hours later 
they spotted Gander. Then Nova Scotia. Then Long Island. They 
permitted themselves to wonder whether a deal could be made between 
Long Island and Andrews Air Force Base, which after all was 90 minutes 
away, time enough to come up with something that would put off the 
crisis for a couple of weeks, maybe. 
<P>
At that point Senator Dole is said to have turned to Newt and 
suggested that maybe the President could be persuaded to meet with 
them in Dayton to discuss the problem. But Newt was getting a little 
fed up and said there wouldn't be any rooms available in Dayton, not 
till all those Serbs and Croats and Muslims were out of there. Dole 
nodded and was about to suggest an alternative meeting place when an 
aide appeared, with the landing instructions. 
<P>
They couldn't believe it! It was stipulated that the two leaders of 
the Legislature should disembark from the rear of the airplane. At 
first they reasoned that the purpose for this was to avoid any body 
contact with the President that might result in impetuous bargaining 
over what to do about the close of government at midnight. But no, Bob 
Dole said, there's no realistic fear of that happening, since there 
will be too much hustle and bustle getting out of the plane. There has 
to be some other motive. After all, in Israel we all disembarked up 
front. To change that plan now suggests a motive. 
<P>
Newt looked up. He had got the idea! He was a historian, he told Bob, 
and he knew something about affronts on a major scale, and this was 
one of them. It hasn't absolutely been established, but there are 
revisionists out there who are convinced that Brutus acted as he did 
because of the inferior box Julius Caesar had stuck him in at the 
Colosseum's opening on the Ides of February. The President, he said, 
is trying to provoke us! He doesn't want reconciliation, he wants a 
public shoot-out with as many blasts on TV as he can get out of it! 
<P>
Senator Dole furrowed his brow. There was always an alternative, he 
said. We could let the budget stay unbalanced? 
<P>
Newt shook his head. No. We'll follow the lead of Caesar, and see what 
happens.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 21</i>
<hr>
<h2>McNamara's Final Surrender</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Robert McNamara has every right to publish a book advising the world 
that in his opinion we had been wrong, "terribly wrong," in engaging 
in war in Vietnam. But what more can be said about the liberties of 
Bob McNamara? He is free, if he is so impelled, to join the Communist 
Party; or to form one, if it no longer exists. What is creepy about 
his most recent exercise in self-mortification is the auspices under 
which it is being done. 
<P>
If you missed it, Mr. McNamara went to Vietnam, alongside a few other 
dignitaries whose names do not get into the papers, under the auspices 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. The announced purpose was to 
explore whether the war might have ended sooner, or indeed might have 
been averted altogether.
<P>
Now I am a member, however inert, of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
and I wonder why it should sponsor on a trip to Vietnam someone who 
has publicly abjured the reasoning of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, and Nixon, and the overwhelming majority of their advisors, 
on why the operation in Vietnam was justified. Inasmuch as Mr. 
McNamara received approximately 100 per cent of the publicity of the 
visiting delegation, the world has quite reasonably concluded that his 
oblation constitutes an official apology by the United States for 
acting as it did.
<P>
Well, the world is wrong; Mr. McNamara arrived with no such portfolio. 
When a few days ago Japan finally elected to apologize for Japanese 
conduct in Korea during and before the Second World War, the apology 
was tendered by the prime minister and represented official government 
opinion. McNamara's sole credential was as one representative of the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Several questions arise. The first is, 
What is the purpose in sending on a mission to investigate tensions 
with Vietnam an American who has publicly rejected, indeed scorned, 
the reason for such tensions? He wholly rejects the reasoning of the 
President who made him secretary of defense, the successor President 
who in 1964 was elected by a landslide in part because of his 
reaffirmation of the policy of containment, pronounced twenty years 
earlier by President Truman calling for resistance to Communist 
aggression whether in Greece, in Berlin, in Iran, in Guatemala, in 
Korea -- or in Vietnam.
<P>
It would have been interesting if our former secretary of defense, in 
his meeting with General Giap -- essentially Vietnam's secretary of 
defense -- had met as old football coaches might have done to exchange 
locker-room talk about what might have worked in this situation, what 
in that situation. But Mr. McNamara wasn't in Vietnam to say to Giap, 
"You proved the better soldier." He was there as the prominent 
American whose support of the war, advertised so proudly while in 
office, had mutated, after thirty tortuous years, into a profound 
rejection of all the premises of that war. If a Christian theologian 
decides, at age 78, that on second thought he doesn't really think 
Christ was the Redeemer, he isn't very useful as a delegate to a 
conference inquiring into the causes of impiety. And there is no 
evidence that Mr. McNamara ever thought to ask General Giap such 
questions as, Since I have retreated from my moral position about 
going to war, have you retreated from yours about treating the people 
of Vietnam like slaves?
<P>
In 1964, McNamara absolutely affirmed that the Vietnamese were 
responsible for a second assault on an American naval vessel on August 
4, 1964. He now declares that he is "overwhelmingly" convinced that no 
such assault actually occurred. And who does he ask to confirm his 
reversal? Why, the man who would have engineered the Tonkin Gulf 
attack. It happens that I am a student, however superficial, of the 
Tonkin Gulf episode, and I am convinced it never happened, but I am 
deeply convinced that the military and the Administration did 
genuinely believe it had happened. But the idea of going to Giap to 
ask for final judgment in the matter is the equivalent of going to 
Goering at Nuremberg and asking, Did you really slaughter six million 
Jews?
<P>
There is no effective way absolutely to teach people what manners are 
appropriate in what situations. I mean, there are several hundred 
thousand wives, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters 
who lost their husband, offspring, sibling, father in Vietnam. And 
they are justly solaced by their conviction that the fight was made in 
pursuit of a most honorable cause, i.e., to spare the people of South 
Vietnam the miseries of living under such as General Giap and Ho Chi 
Minh, while continuing to maintain the animating strategic policy of 
the Cold War. We lost the battle in Vietnam, but won the war -- 
finally -- not least because the enemy had at least a temporary 
experience of American resolution in Southeast Asia.

<html><title>Buckley:  The Hot Plotters</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Hot Plotters</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach 
more desperate lengths than the situation reported over the weekend, 
namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of telephone 
conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these 
calls, reported to have lasted two hours each, three are relatively 
unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, and 
Lowell Weicker.
<P>
Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it 
couldn't be settled which of the plotters should enter his name in the 
formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this problem, namely 
that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's 
speech to his soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in 
California testing the waters. He found them uniformly cold, if that 
is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck 
in them seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<P>
Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic 
outing on the yacht Monkey Business, the design of which caper has to 
have been to prove that the American voters don't care any more about 
adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, 
Senator Hart, unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, 
is a charismatic political campaigner. But when the opportunity came 
up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state, 
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home 
state for senator, it doesn't make much sense to go for 26 states.
<P>
Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman 
candle or two during the Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a 
reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual problem, which is that 
most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of 
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. 
Tsongas has medical problems which are said to have caused him to rule 
himself out as the candidate of the Hot Plotters.
<P>
Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor 
of Connecticut, soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at 
the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor Weicker's reign calls to mind 
the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's 
novel. "In 1945," Mr. Waugh wrote, "Miss Mitford voted the socialist 
ticket. Having done her best to make England uninhabitable, she went 
to France to live." It was Mr. Weicker who instituted the income tax 
in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the 
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to 
corporations, many of which have fled. There is this additional 
problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious moralist 
since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his 
most recent political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<P>
So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - 
Weicker, the answer is: absolutely nowhere. What their putative 
coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a "huge" 
hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce 
this agenda into idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way 
to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<P>
The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and 
some of it is his fault. It isn't a fault you'd score against a 
philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to help to 
understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political 
quandary, I asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the 
problem and he replied unhesitantly, "William of Occam." He meant by 
this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the denial 
of universals in the fourteenth century.
<P>
Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic 
mode, and when someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen 
of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone prudent, for him to cite 
federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a 
professor might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to 
original sin. But of course the trouble with an etiological search so 
comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human 
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from 
the sin of intellectual pride.
<P>
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina 
of the Speaker have given the voters a vision of something truly 
distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the Hot Plotters, 
who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to 
them.

<hr>
<h2>Have You Ever Had Terminal Blah Time?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
We confront, from our pillars of light, every problem that plagues or 
threatens to plague mankind, of every variety. Columnists have written 
on how best to avoid a war or how best to become involved in a war or 
how best to make a Floating Island. With less than a few keystrokes, 
the opinion makers can redesign the Cathedral of Chartres, advising 
where all the mistakes were made, and how they might be avoided. 
Scientific contentions having to do with the best mineral for 
preserving human teeth can become causes celcbres and contestants will 
stand their ground with all their weapons oiled, well poised to 
discredit a silly argument from the other side. But what happens when 
you are sick? 
<P>
A bizarre question, because incapacitating illnesses don't . . . seem 
to happen. We are all familiar with the law that the charismatic 
leader must appear to be immune to the abrasions that hinder mere men 
and women. Sensing this, though the idea was not yet explicated, FDR 
took pains to disguise his infirmity. Fidel Castro, we learned soon 
after his ascendancy in Cuba, simply cancelled all public engagements 
when feeling ill. In such a society as he rules over, it is easier to 
do this than it would be, say, in America, where arbitrary action is 
accepted only when caused by nature. You can cancel a game in the 
World Series because a hurricane got in the way, but not because Joe 
DiMaggio didn't feel well. In 1985 in Washington the weather was so 
cold that the whole inaugural parade was put off. That meant the 
President could not take his oath of office in the usual place, so he 
took it instead in the rotunda of the House of Representatives. And 
everyone knew that it was actually a re-enactment, because the 
constitutional date for taking the office had come the day before, but 
they don't like doing these things on a Sunday.
<P>
But what if one were really sick? A gentleman sent down two weeks ago 
for execution pleaded a postponement on the grounds that he was 
suffering from a terrible head cold and could not take in his own 
execution and that surely this was one of the designs of death-
sentence architects. Suppose that the Queen of England were to be 
crowned on Tuesday and that morning she announced to the Court that 
she simply was not up to it, that sitting up there on the throne for 
two or three hours would constitute a torture she'd find unbearable. 
What then?
<P>
What if she faced the same hideous plight as the columnist stricken 
with some combination of cold, sinus, nose-clog, throat-tightening 
even after two days of antibiotics, when time comes for him to produce 
. . . a column? 
<P>
There are ways to go that dramatize your immobility. Wanda Landowska 
slightly messed up one fugue from a sonata and then closed her 
harpsichord, permanently. Toscanini reacted similarly to a lapse of 
memory. Franz Liszt decided he would no longer perform before large 
audiences and ostentatiously pulled down the piano cover after he was 
through. The statesman of high office is less prone to apocalyptic 
departures from public life, though Charles de Gaulle did that 
exactly. 
<P>
What irks the quotidian analyst is the triviality of the challenge. I 
am not John McCain, whom one would have understood if he had ended any 
attempt at communication after five years in the Vietnamese prison 
camps. It is just, in the great scheme of things, one spark plug that 
won't ignite, not even after submitting it to the one-hundredth 
homeopathic distraction. 
<P>
So that, burrow as you might in these lines in search of an apercu 
worth pocketing, forgive me; my cupboard is bare. <p>

<html><title>Buckley:  Who Is to Blame?  -- 12/19/95</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Who Is to Blame?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted 
to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision 
to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar 
with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: 
Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of 
$10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou 
times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-
third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back 
into the Senate. 
<P>
Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator 
put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day 
of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them 
from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody 
had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the 
energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one 
phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that 
the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the 
senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that 
the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and 
enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when 
fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? 
No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a 
parliamentary system on the British model.
<P>
But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen 
had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just 
don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, 
the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite 
to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was 
the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that 
if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially 
what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<P>
And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most 
controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is "most." And 
the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise 
with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and 
his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses 
by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to 
$250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep 
breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic 
compromise. 
<P>
But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires 
rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is 
ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans 
wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using 
words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to 
sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and 
let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<P>
Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break 
under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the 
success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the 
final blame on the voting public. "The only people being fundamentally 
irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the 
American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague 
Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, 
voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete 
candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that 
election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent 
margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver 
on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party 
positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 
per cent." 
<P>
But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The 
editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, 
for wanting one thing and authorizing another. "Speaker Gingrich, for 
all his failings, is the first American politician actually to 
confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval 
rating of 27 per cent." Any effort to bail out the American people for 
this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's 
ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, 
six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton 
is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in 
agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- 
then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<P>
And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White 
House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters 
that that is the thing to do?<p>

<i>NEW YORK, DECEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Inside War</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>

The sequence is roughly as follows:
<P>
1. Senator Dole makes a statement: He will not, in 1996, urge the GOP 
to endorse a constitutional amendment that would ban the practice of 
abortion. 
<P>
Buzz . . . Why is Bob doing this? He needs the right wing of his party 
to get nominated . . . No, stupid, he is thinking about the election 
now. He has already won the nomination. He is following Nixon's rule: 
Woo the Right in order to be nominated, the Left in order to be 
elected. 
<P>
2. Ralph Reed, the Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, 
fires immediately. "Senator Dole's remarks not only represent an 
uncharacteristic departure from his previous record, but a stunning 
reversal from the winning Reagan position that has sustained the 
Republican Party for 15 years and helped make it a majority party. Not 
a single pro-life incumbent of either political party lost in 1994 and 
1995. Senator Dole is also the only leading candidate who has declined 
to sign a pledge that he supports the pro-life plank in the Republican 
Party platform." 
<P>
The sentence of the court was duly executed: "The Christian Coalition 
will distribute 22 million voter guides in the presidential primaries 
next winter and spring. Those voter guides will accurately reflect 
Senator Dole's and other candidates' positions on this issue." The 
next day, the Dole campaign "clarified" its candidate's remarks.
<P>
3. Noemie Emery ("a freelance writer living in New York") writes a 
lead article for The Weekly Standard. Early in its career, The 
Standard published an eloquent editorial affirming the pro-life 
position. Miss Emery says in effect, Look. Though we rightly consider 
the fetus a human being, it is something less than that exactly, and 
under the circumstances different moral perspectives are 
understandably brought to bear on the question, and the GOP should 
drop its categorical position and settle, instead, for progressive 
restrictions, leading in the right direction. 
<P>
Irving Kristol, a few days later, in an eloquent article in the Wall 
Street Journal berating the excesses of modern secularists, then asks, 
What are the mistakes of the other side? There are several. "Whatever 
one's views on abortion, it is clear that public opinion, today and 
for the foreseeable future, will not accept its criminalization." He 
upbraids his fellow conservatives: "By permitting their passions to 
dominate the issue, by converting their commitment to a 'right to 
life' crusade rather than to policy, they have made the best the enemy 
of the good -- a common error of zealotry in politics."
<P>
4. NATIONAL REVIEW sees in the Emery article a "part of a continuing 
effort to revise the Republican platform. Last year conservatives 
William Kristol and George Weigel suggested in NATIONAL REVIEW that 
pro-lifers focus on more readily achievable objectives such as 
parental-consent laws or bans on third-trimester abortions. Pro-lifers 
could debate the prudence of this position within the context of 
shared objectives: a reduction in the number of abortions and legal 
recognition of the practice's injustice." 
<P>
But the editors make two points, one of them transcendent in 
character: "Miss Emery and Mr. Bennett would reach a different 
judgment on abortion, and the reason is plain to everyone but them: 
they evidently do not regard abortion as 'wrong' in the same sense 
that infanticide is wrong." And a most telling empirical political 
point: If the strategic design of the pro-lifers is to win the fight 
with progressive tactical strikes, they are entitled to ask, "Where is 
a comparable modesty or prudence on the other side? Where is the 
willingness, on the part of Senators Kennedy and Specter, to accept 
restraints even on a handful of abortions, such as the grisly 'partial 
birth' abortions? The fact of the matter is that Noemie Emery and 
William Bennett have no audience on the pro-choice side. The pro-
choicers will not concede even the slightest restriction on abortion, 
because any restriction implies its wrongness." 
<P>
Kremlinologists can divert themselves by reflecting that William 
Kristol was a trustee of NATIONAL REVIEW until he became the 
(founding) editor of The Standard, that he is the son of Irving 
Kristol, that William Bennett was for several years a Senior Editor of 
NATIONAL REVIEW, that Bennett -- and Kennedy! -- are both Catholics, 
that George Weigel is a theologically trained Catholic, that Ralph 
Reed and Bob Dole are Protestants, the Kristols Jewish: and, of 
course, all of them Republicans. Just one more example of hegemonic 
conservative thought.<p>

</H2>
<BR>
Good morning, and Happy Leap Year, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I am honored to be asked my opinion about the 2000 Census.<BR>
Leap Year, indeed, is a good time to review the Census Bureau's plans, because
a great statistical leap into the 21st century is what the Bureau is proposing.
The Congress may wish to look very hard before you take this leap, however,
because it is a leap into the unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly concerned about the plan to use sampling to adjust the
hard count for the 2000 Census. Looked at through a green eye shade, it
may seem prudent. Obviously, it is financially burdensome to obtain the
last 10 percent or so of Census names, so sampling looks like a winning
solution. Undoubtedly that thought must have weighed heavily in the recommendations
of several bodies that are advocating adjustment. But if money is what matters
most, you could save even more by relying on still more sampling. The Census
is, indeed, expensive. But consider what you get with it. It holds up the
whole statistical system of the Unite States. Having said that, I do acknowledge
the legitimacy of the cost issue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The statistical accuracy argument must also be acknowledged. It is embarrassing
to have an undercount after every decennial Census. However, it is an embarrassment
the republic has managed to survive each decade for two centuries. I am
not sure how well we would survive its alternative. The problem with sampling
and adjustment does not lie only with accuracy, which statisticians can
debate, but with its admitted core of artificiality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My argument with adjustment, thus, is not primarily a matter of statistical
methodology. That's not my background, in any case. If anybody could pull
off an adjustment in a conscientious manner it is the U.S. Census Bureau.
My experiences at the Bureau left me with the greatest respect for the honesty,
ability and public spirit of the people who work there, right up to and
including the outstanding current director, Dr. Martha Riche. Moreover,
many of the statistical and management innovations the Bureau has proposed
for the 2000 Census, including new &quot;matching&quot; software to spot
double-counting, the digital &quot;capture&quot; of data on forms, more
user-friendly forms and the added mail contacts with each address, all have
excellent prospects, in my view. The 2000 Census, as with past censuses,
will see improvements, regardless of adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should an official adjustment take place, however, and you have one national
number, the Census will still not have counted everyone, even in theory.
For example, the present plan will have done nothing to count the literally
hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not employed by the government
and who are temporarily living overseas. (Overseas government employees
now are counted, of course.) The people I'm talking about are U.S. citizens;
some of them own homes and other property here; some are on the voter roles
and motor vehicle license lists. I certainly agree with the proposal to
explore the use of many other administrative records, such as Social Security
and welfare rolls, to seek names of people who may have been missed in the
Census head count. I also understand why the Bureau must count illegal immigrants,
even though they may lack reliable addresses and their stay in this country
may be very temporary, indeed. But shouldn't we also be trying to identify
citizens of the U.S. who happen to be out of the country around the Census
time, but whose names can be found in public records and who count the United
States as home? Isn't their stake in the country important enough to be
reflected in the numbers that are used, for example, to apportion Congress?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer given by the Census Bureau, with OMB no doubt looking over its
shoulder, is that such a search would be costly. Well, if so, why isn't
it proposed to sample and adjust for the overseas Americans, too? But, meanwhile,
the controversy of this very subject returns us again to the central problem
in the 2000 Census plan, and that is the moral or philosophical concept
of an official, adjusted enumeration. Sampling is a proven and accepted
form of measurement, but there usually has to be some hard, broadly accepted
data base from which the sample is drawn. More importantly, I can't think
of a statistical sample that is so closely tied to a civic act as is the
Census enumeration, any more than I can think of an election survey that
has the moral authority of an actual election.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census enumeration is a participatory function of government hallowed
by Constitutional mandate. There are not too many comparable civic acts;
voting is one, serving on juries is another. Perhaps participation in the
Census falls between those two--it is neither as voluntary as voting, nor
as demanding as jury service. In any case, the Census is one of the fundamental
democratic institutions of our society, and I believe, it is a noble one.
It gives us the numbers that make other numbers meaningful. It must not
only be trustworthy, but palpably trustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The current Census director herself has spoken of the three legs of the
Census stool that must dictate the process: cost, accuracy and public perception.
The first two legs are important, as I have acknowledged, but if the latter
breaks, the whole construction comes down. The term &quot;public perception&quot;
could also be described as trustworthiness. In a time when public mistrust
of government is rife, I question a change that would introduce the invention
of statistical persons into the Census--robots constructed of sampled data
and intellectual abstractions--to stand in the place of real human beings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census has long represented an honest attempt to count every person
in the United States--every real person, not every &quot;virtual&quot; person,
not every &quot;statistical analog&quot; for a person, not every &quot;full
time equivalent&quot; of a person, but every real person. Once citizens
realize that the Census number is partly an invention--however brilliant
an invention it is--they will begin to question many things. Suspicions
will be aroused. How, some will ask, do we know that the creation of statistical
persons does not have some partisan or factional or geographic regional
basis? How does this corrupted Census count infect other numbers and political
institutions?<BR>
Let me stress again my own full confidence in the integrity of the individuals
who serve at the U.S. Census Bureau. It is largely because I don't want
to see that integrity even put up to question that I raise this problem
of perception--of evident trustworthiness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's next consider legal problems with the Census; do you think you have
them now? In fact, the costly lawsuits challenging the Census invariably
are won by the government. Common sense tells a judge that a good faith
effort to count every person cannot be faulted for occasional human mistakes,
especially when plaintiffs can seldom if ever produce evidence of actual
individuals who have not been counted. But under an adjusted Census it will
not be difficult at all to produce evidence that the Census erred, and erred
intentionally, by imputing fictitious people into neighborhoods where the
real neighbors can readily prove that the interlopers do not, in plain truth,
exist. In some cases, the fictional, imputed people are going to amount
to a difference between drawing a redistricting line one place rather than
another, and maybe even change the apportionment of states. (After all,
isn't that part of the whole idea?) In such cases, I suggest, common sense
will now become the government's enemy, because you will need to give all
the judges and ordinary citizens an extensive course in statistics to persuade
them that it is just and fair to invent people for something as supposedly
straightforward as a U.S. Census. How especially do we explain including
invented people in determining such matters as apportioning Congress when,
as I noted before, we do not count real American citizens living abroad?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the American public will accept all this with total unconcern or even
satisfaction. But maybe, instead, this will be seen as one more way the
government is trying to pull a fast one on the people. Won't any resulting
public cynicism make the hard count even more difficult to obtain in the
first place? If it contributes to further falloff of response, won't that
and the ever-present financial incentives, lead to still more sampling in
subsequent Censuses, in a downward spiral? And won't it seem perfectly acceptable
soon to conduct the whole Census through sampling? And won't there be an
irrestible temptation to try, Census by Census, to improve the content of
what constitutes the invented persons created through the sample, and hence
the meaning of such invented persons?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am here to urge
you to look at the Census as one of the most venerable civic institutions
of the United States, and to do all you can to protect it. Once trust in
it is undermined, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to restore. <BR>

<h2>Black Racism Goes Largely Unchallenged </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 



 
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color 
line," W.E.B. Du Bois predicted in 1900. Unfortunately, his words 
still ring true in 1996 but with a bitter irony. In 1900 blacks stood 
on one side of the color line as victims of racism. Today, increasing 
numbers of blacks have crossed over the line to become perpetrators of 
racism as well. And while we have become far more courageous in 
condemning and punishing racism when it is practiced by whites, black 
racism goes largely unchallenged. Witness the reactions to two 
murderous attacks by racists last month.
<p>
In the first incident, two white soldiers are accused of viciously 
murdering a black couple in Fayetteville, N.C., because the men hated 
blacks. The murder was front-page news across the country and led the 
evening network broadcasts. The Army, concerned the suspects might be 
part of an organized network of white supremacists, launched a full-
scale investigation to weed out any racist fringe groups.
<p>
The second incident took place just one day after the racially 
motivated murder of the black couple in North Carolina. A black man 
entered a white-owned store in Harlem, warning blacks to leave, before 
he opened fire on the mostly Hispanic and white employees and 
customers and then set the store ablaze. When the conflagration ended, 
eight people, including the gunman, were dead. The story generated 
only moderate news attention outside New York and little national 
soul-searching about the causes or prevalence of black racism. Only a 
small handful of national columnists deemed the racial aspects of the 
homicidal rampage worthy of specific condemnation, and most of these 
were black journalists.
<p>
If the Harlem murders were an isolated event, the reluctance of so 
many white opinion leaders to confront black racism might be 
understandable. But black-on-white hate crimes have increased 
dramatically. In one study by Klanwatch, a liberal civil rights group 
that monitors racist incidents, nearly half the racially motivated 
murders over three years were committed by blacks, who are only 12% of 
the population.
<p>
Media reticence to condemn black racism reflects an insidious double 
standard. White racism is rightly viewed as a moral failing of the 
individual and as a threat to both the peace and justice of society. 
But many in the media seem reluctant to gauge black racism in the same 
way.
<p>
For weeks before the attack on the white-owned Harlem store, 
demonstrators marched in front of the building, shouting racist and 
anti-Semitic remarks. According to the testimony of the Jewish store 
owner, who sought a restraining order against the demonstrators prior 
to the murders, protesters "made motions of striking a match and 
throwing it on the outside clothing displays or into the doorway of 
the store." Days before the actual arson, he warned prophetically: "At 
some point real matches will be thrown at me and my store. This is not 
an idle fear on my part."<p>     But in the heart of the media capital of 
the world - New York City - this story of vicious hate-mongering went 
unreported until after the fire. Is it imaginable that a similar story 
of white protesters making such threatening gestures outside a black-
owned establishment would be ignored by the media?
<p>
In some circles, blacks are presumed incapable of racism because they 
lack power. But racism is about hate, not power. It takes hate, not 
power, to shoot an innocent couple on a deserted street or set fire to 
a store full of frightened people.
<p>
And it takes considerable cowardice not to recognize hate comes in all 
colors. 
<P>

<h2>'Dynamic' Newest Banned Word</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 

Bethesda, Md. - Warning: Radical feminists have added a new word to 
their lexicon of forbidden terms. "Dynamic" now joins "seminal," 
"mankind" and "hysterical" among other "sexist" expressions that 
feminists want to expunge from our vocabularies.
<P>
This most recent skirmish in the feminist language war erupted at 
Chico State University in California, where the philosophy department 
recently advertised for "a dynamic classroom teacher and program 
builder" to teach the "philosophy of feminism." The ad drew fire from 
a feminist English professor and the university's affirmative action 
director, who charged that the word "dynamic" described a "kinetic, 
dramatic style" most often associated with white males. University 
administrators, not wanting to offend, rewrote the ad, substituting 
"excellent" for "dynamic," but the controversy didn't end there. The 
local newspaper put the story on Page One, and even the usually 
liberal San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against adding "dynamic" 
to "the growing list of socially unacceptable words."
<P>
The whole episode might be amusing if it weren't part of a serious - 
and successful - propaganda campaign to change not only the way we 
talk but also the way we thingk. As George Orwell noted 50 years ago 
in his famous essay "Politics and the English Language". "If thought 
corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought." And corrupting 
thought is what radical feminism is all about.
<P>
Feminists fully understand their mission. "The political implications 
of language have made linguistic study imperative for feminists," 
intones the Women's Study Encyclopedia in an essay on "Feminism and 
Semiological Theory." For those uninitiated in contemporary academic 
jargon, semiotics is a theory of language that asserts that words are 
symbols representing not only the things they describe but, more 
importantly, the values of the dominant class within a culture. If you 
wnat to change the values of a culture, you must change its language. 
And feminists have been trying to change ours for a generation.
<P>
We've all but abandoned sex-specific terms in public usage. Firemen 
and policemen have disappeared, even though they account for 98% of 
fire department personnel and 84% of those in police departments. Miss 
and Mrs. have given way to the nondescript and dissonant Ms. Official 
Washington has banished its chairmen and spokesmen. And most editors 
would rather break grammar rules than offend feminists, substituting 
"they" for the generic "he" when a third person singular pronoun is 
required. (One copy editor actually suggested that I use the pronoun 
"it" when referring to a non-specific child.) Even "mother" and 
"father" are becomng endangered terms, replaced by the less 
descriptive "parent."
<P>
Sex itself is being quickly supplanted by "gender" - which in 
feministspeak refers to an arbitrary social construct. As the Women's 
Study Encyclopedia puts it: "To many, gender continues to be read as 
synonymous with sex." But not to radical feminists, for whom "the 
relation between sex and gender has becmoe the central question for 
contemporary feminist theory as a whole." The idea is to abolish 
differences between men and wom,en, even those rooted in nature. And 
the first step is to break down distinctions in language - to 
"deconstruct" language, in another favorite phrase from the jargon of 
the academic left.
<P>
Author and philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, whose book 
"Who Stole Feminism?" is a biting critique of radical feminists on 
campus, makes the distinction between what she calls "gender 
feminists" and "equity feminists." The former see themselves as 
victims of a culture totally dominated by men, and their objective is 
to transform that culture, using language as a tool to reconstruct 
society in their image.
<P>
"Equity feminists," on the other hand, simply want women to have equal 
legal rights with men and the same opportunities as men to make the 
most of their own individual talents. Unfortunately, the gender 
feminists have the upper hand in universities across the country, and 
their influence spills over into the broader culture day by day.

The attempt to neuter language, or to put certain words off limits 
because they ostensibly represent masculine traits, is an exercise in 
thought control. Totalitarianism didn't disappear with the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. It's alive and well on many American college 
campuses today.

<h2>Hillary Furor: Greed, Not Deception, At Issue</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> Linda  Chavez



 
 
The entire Washington press corps and scores of politicians 
seem obsessed the last few weeks with finding out whether Hillary 
Clinton is telling the truth. But deception isn't the heart of 
the scandals and controversies swirling around the first lady - 
greed is. The Clintons' greed, as well as that of their friends, 
is the root of the problems afflicting the first couple, from 
Whitewater, to Hillary's dubious commodity trades, to the firing 
of White House travel office personnel. This an old-fashioned 
story about graft and corruption - the kind that has been the 
undoing of many a politician. 
 <P>
The trouble began in 1978, when Bill Clinton was the poorly 
paid, young attorney general of Arkansas and Hillary was not yet 
the $ 125-an-hour partner in the successful Rose Law Firm. James 
McDougal, an Arkansas businessman with more chutzpah than 
scruples, approached the couple with an offer they couldn't 
refuse: Become business partners in a potentially lucrative land 
deal, and he'd make them rich. 
 <P>
The Clintons had no real money to invest - they didn't even 
own a home - but that didn't matter. McDougal was willing to give 
them a 50% share of 230 acres on the White River, to be purchased 
entirely with borrowed money from a bank willing to accept the 
partners' signatures as collateral for a $ 203,000 loan. (Try 
that with your local bank the next time you see property you'd 
like to own but can't afford.) 
 <P>
Although both Bill and Hillary graduated with honors from Yale 
Law School, they seem not to have questioned the legality, much 
less propriety, of accepting something for nothing. Nor did the 
Clintons trouble themselves about ethics as the land deal went 
sour, requiring more shady borrowing, and their business partner 
McDougal became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal that 
cost taxpayers billions. 
 <P>
Although Whitewater itself never produced the profits McDougal 
promised, it gave the Clintons some hefty tax write-offs as their 
incomes increased with Hillary's growing law practice. And 
McDougal even threw Hillary some legal business as well, a 
$2,000-per-month retainer he says the then-governor personally 
solicited (though Bill Clinton denies it). 
 <P>
And while Whitewater didn't become a cash cow, Hillary made a 
bundle in another bovine adventure: the cattle futures commodity 
market. The Clintons reaped a $ 100,000 profit on a $ 1,000 
investment, again with help from an Arkansas businessman, James 
Blair. As general counsel of Tyson's Foods, one of Arkansas' 
biggest employers and an industry regulated by the state, Blair 
did plenty of business with the state while he was fattening the 
Clintons' bank account. Neither the governor nor his 
attorney-wife questioned the lawfulness of letting Blair place 
trades on Hillary's behalf or pocketing the proceeds. 
 <P>
Even Travelgate boils down to greed - on the part of Clinton 
chums, if not the president and his wife. Although most of the 
attention has focused on whether Hillary Clinton ordered the 
firing of the White House travel office staff, there's much more 
to the story. An article by Byron York in the Jan. 22 issue of 
The Weekly Standard documents the attempt by a Clinton friend and 
his business associate to take over all of the federal 
government's non-military aircraft business, not just the 
chartered press travel run out of the White House. Had the flap 
not developed when the White House firings took place, this plan 
would have gone forward, netting millions of dollars in profits 
to Clinton's friends. 
 <P>
The Clintons may have railed against the Republicans' "decade 
of greed," but all the while they were trying to line their own - 
and their friends' - pockets.

<h2>Children Do Suffer Most From a Divorce </h2> 
<P> <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>
<br><p> 


As unusual as Michael Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley seemed 
in 1994, their impending divorce, announced last week, is all too 
commonplace. The superstar duo have become just one more statistic 
among the 1.2 million American couples who divorce each year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With no little Jacksons to suffer the consequence of their breakup and 
a prenuptual agreement to protect each party's property, the couple's 
split is hardly cause for any public concern.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the approximately 700,000 
marriages involving children that dissolve every year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These divorces are more than personal tragedies. They are a social 
problem with significant societal costs.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in two marriages in the United States now end in divorce 
- the highest rate in the world. And a majority of these divorces - 
about 60% - are among couples with children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years while the divorce rate was skyrocketing, social scientists 
argued that children were largely unaffected by divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many even argued that children were better off being raised by a 
single parent than they were watching parents quarrel or remain in a 
loveless marriage.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But evidence to the contrary has mounted over the past two decades. 
Now there is little doubt - based on overwhelming research results - 
that, on average, children of divorce are worse off than those who 
grow up in intact families.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Children of divorce are more likely to be truant, to do poorly in 
school and to get in trouble with the law than children who grow up 
with both parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "California Children of Divorce Study," one of the most 
comprehensive of its kind to date, found that more than a third of 
children from divorced families experienced moderate or severe 
depression even five years after divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among adolescent women in the study, "almost all confronted issues of 
love, commitment, and marriage with anxiety, sometimes with very great 
concern about betrayal, abandonment, and not being loved," according 
to Judith Wallerstein, who analyzed the results of the study in her 
book Second Chances: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these young women, she reports, resorted to short-term sexual 
relationships in response to their fears and anxieties.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barring physical or severe mental abuse, it is nearly always better 
for children in a family if their parents stay together.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until relatively recently, parents understood this and considered it 
an obligation on their part to remain together - at least until their 
children were grown.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1960, 91% of children lived with two parents. No more. A whole 
ethos of self-fulfillment and personal happiness has replaced the 
ethic of self-sacrifice and concern for the best interests of one's 
children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many divorcing parents put their own desires and needs ahead of 
their children's and then rationalize their actions by claiming their 
children will be better off if their parents are happy.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For once it would be refreshing if those who do selfish things would 
simply own up to their behavior.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marriage is never an easy proposition. I have never known a successful 
marriage that did not, at some point, experience severe stress that 
could tear the marriage apart if the parties allowed it.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference between couples who remain married and those who 
divorce is not more love or fewer difficulties, but greater 
commitment.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who stay married often face identical problems with those who 
split up, but the former ride out the difficulties.

In many countries, divorce laws encourage couples in this process by 
placing lengthy waiting periods before a marriage can be dissolved 
unless special grounds exist, such as adultery or abuse.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most nations in western Europe, including most of the socially liberal 
countries in Scandinavia, require a minimum of a one-year wait before 
uncontested divorces are granted.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of states are considering stricter divorce legislation this 
year, including Iowa and Michigan.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After years of ignoring the devastating impact divorce has on 
children, it's time public policy took account of what's good for 
children, not just what's convenient for their parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divorce still hitting a million kids every year Divorces affect fewer 
children now than in 1980, but far more than in 1970:  <p>

<h2>
Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime 
</h2>
<p><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez 
</a>

<P>  
The murder rate is dropping dramatically in cities across the country, 
but analysts disagree why. In New York, the murder rate dropped by 32% 
last year; Washington, D.C., experienced a 10% decline for the second 
year in a row. The pattern is repeating itself in cities large and 
small, and murder isn't the only serious crime that's down. Of the 
Justice Department's index of serious crimes, only larceny theft was 
up slightly (3%) in the first six months of 1995. A new study by the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas suggests that putting 
more criminals behind bars at least partly explains why crime is 
finally going down - at least in Texas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, crime in Texas is now at its lowest point since 1973, and the 
murder rate is lower than at any time since 1966. Crime is falling 
most in big cities:  down 35% in Dallas and 29% in Houston between 
1991 and 1994, and the decline is  even greater for murder and motor 
vehicle theft - crimes that are almost always  reported and therefore 
most statistically reliable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precipitous drop is no great mystery to Morgan O. Reynolds, author 
of the study and a Texas A&M professor of economics. "Punishment 
works. Incarceration works. It's that simple," he says. Reynolds 
points to a "prison-building binge"  that tripled the state's capacity 
over five years. Texas now has more prisoners  per capita than any 
state in the country. And while many liberals would rate this a 
dubious distinction, more prisoners means fewer criminals out 
terrorizing their fellow citizens. Reynolds estimates that the lower 
crime rate means 1,140  fewer Texans will be murdered this year than 
in 1991 and 450,000 fewer crimes committed against persons and 
property.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The major problem in the exploding violent crime rate in recent years 
has been the inability of law enforcement to ensure that convicted 
criminals remain behind bars for a significant length of time. Prison 
became a revolving door through which violent felons passed repeatedly 
in and out, with stays so short it sometimes seemed convicts were 
being given a respite from their life on the streets rather than 
punishment. Parole was used by many prison officials throughout the 
country as a means to reduce prison overcrowding, not because 
convicts' crimes or their behavior in prison justified early release.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Texas was no exception. In 1990, Texas prison officials approved 79% 
of all prisoners considered for parole, in large part because of a 
federal court order  to reduce crowding in state prisons (a fate 
shared by more than 40 other states). With a threefold increase in 
prison cells since then, however, Texas' parole approval rate fell to 
22% in 1994. And there is good reason to believe that longer prison 
terms reduce crime, not only by removing perpetrators temporarily from 
society but also by deterring others who are considering committing 
crimes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Reynolds notes, committing a crime is often a rational decision. 
Arrest rates are down in Texas, as in most other states, over the past 
three decades. The probability of being arrested for committing murder 
is down 21%, and down 22% for committing rape. With little chance of 
getting caught, criminals find the benefits of crime outweigh the 
costs, he says. Nonetheless, this calculus changes if the punishment 
increases dramatically - as it has in Texas. Expected prison time for 
convicted murderers is up 274% over the past three years, and up 152% 
for rape and 246% for aggravated assault.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most effective way to prevent crime is to make the 
punishment so  harsh and so certain that would-be criminals decide the 
risk isn't worth taking. Let the experts argue - Texas legislated 
those policies, and crime fell.

<P>
 
Ever wonder why so many Americans are turned off by politics, 
politicians, journalists and nearly everything having to do with 
Washington? (Except maybe its monuments and museums?)

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maybe all the fuss generated by "Primary Colors" -- the new, 
anonymously written novel about the 1992 Clinton campaign -- provides 
a clue.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's the ultimate insider's tale about a world that few on the outside 
know or care about, and it's preoccupying a good deal of the nation's 
capital. The novel itself and the controversy it has generated are 
testaments to all that is petty, insular and creepy about political 
Washington.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using the techniques of a roman a clef (which means literally "novel 
with a key"), the story reads like a political edition of the game 
Trivial Pursuit.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story involves a young, ambitious governor of a small Southern 
state whose presidential campaign is plagued by scandals.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you don't know who Mandy Grunwald, Betsy Wright and Stanley 
Greenberg are (they're actual Clinton operatives), you'll probably get 
lost trying to decipher the book's elaborate cast of characters. Which 
seems to be the author's aim: Create cardboard-cutout characters 
immediately recognizable to Washington sophisticates but of little 
interest to the rest of the world, then hope the pundits create a 
large enough buzz to sell lots of books.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plan seems to be working. "Primary Colors" hits No. 1 this week on 
USA TODAY's best-seller list.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this might be harmless enough were it not for two insidious 
aspects of the book.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was written either by someone inside the Clinton operation or a 
reporter with access to intimate details of the campaign, and it 
contains every vicious, undubstantiated rumor ever circulated about 
Bill or Hillary Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Washington officials, pundits and the press corps are too busy trying 
to guess who wrote the novel to waste much indignation on the ethics, 
much less propriety, of the venture. But surely there is something 
wrong when either a former campaign worker or a journalist can make 
money anonymously peddling smarmy gossip about the president of the 
United States and his wife.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff loyalty is a virtue that has long since disappeared in 
Washington. Presidential aides no longer wait until their boss is out 
of office (much less dead) to write intimate tell-alls -- and 
Republican presidents fare no better than Democrates. But "Primary 
Colors" breaks new ground in the kiss-and-tell genre. By remaining 
anonymous, the author keeps his or her reputation intact -- at least 
temporarily -- while ravaging others'.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most disturbing possibility is that the book was written not by 
someone inside the campaign but by a journalist. The novel reeks of a 
strange, hybrid bias -- it exudes both admiration and contempt for the 
Clintons.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whoever wrote the book is a fan of the Clintons' politics but clearly 
not of their moral character. Journalists are entitled to their biases 
and opinions -- so long as they're stated up front. That's why 
newspapers have editorial and opinion pages. But journalists are not 
free to weave their prejudices into their reporting.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor should they be free to slander public figures through thinly 
veiled fiction while keeping their own identities secret.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I'm no fan of the Clintons, but they deserve better than this.

<title>Chavez: Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges -- 2/22/96</title>

<h2>
Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>

<P>
As we squander money building students' egos, we feed crime. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We've heard it so often, none of us questions whether it's actually 
true: you've got to feel good about yourself in order to succeed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The crusade to improve self-esteem has invaded every sector of life -- 
public and private -- but nowhere more pervasively than education. 
School reformers have spent millions of dollars in the past two 
decades trying to raise the self-esteem of poor achievers. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But researchers now are questioning whether this money has been a good 
investment, since increases in self-esteem show little -- if any -- 
effect on actual achievement. And now a new study, published in the 
journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests raising 
self-esteem may actually be dangerous, especially among individuals 
whose inflated sense of self-worth does not comport with reality. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For at least a generation, it has been an axiom of U.S. education that 
children must have high self-esteem in order to perform well 
academically.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And U.S. students today measure higher than those from any other 
country on questions of self-esteem. Unfortunately, they don't do 
nearly as well on math or science or reading, lagging g far behind 
much of the industrial world in actual performance in these areas. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For critics of the self-esteem movement, such evidence suggests 
American schools have wasted a lot of money and effort that could have 
been spent more productively on basic skills and more rigorous 
academic content. But the increased emphasis on self-esteem that has 
permeated American education may be even more pernicious than most 
critics assumed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to three research psychologists who evaluated dozens of 
studies of violent behavior, high self-esteem is more often associated 
with violence than low self-esteem. The authors -- Roy F. Baumeister 
of Case Western Reserve University and Joseph M. Boden and Laura Smart 
of the University of Virginia -- acknowledge that their conclusions 
run counter to conventional wisdom that low self-esteem is the source 
of most anti-social behavior. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But their evidence for "the dark side of high self-esteem" is 
persuasive. The authors claim that "people turn aggressive when they 
receive feedback that contradicts their favorable views (of 
themselves). More to the point, it is mainly the people who refuse to 
lower their self-appraisals who become violent." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A teen who feels he hasn't received the respect he deserves -- in 
other words, he's been dissed -- is more likely to strike out than one 
who genuinely believes himself unworthy -- a sign of low self-esteem. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his co-authors cite dozens of studies of murder, rape, 
domestic abuse and even terrorism that show that violence occurs more 
often when a perpetrator with a high -- often inflated -- opinion of 
himself is challenged by someone he considers inferior. One study of 
more than 100 rapists, for example, confirms that rapists sometimes 
choose a particular victim in order "to disabuse her of her sense of 
superiority. That is, the woman gave the man the impression she 
thought she was better than he was and so he raped her as a way of 
proving her wrong." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most interesting example given of the correlation between 
high self-esteem and violent behavior involves racist violence. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nazism involved a whole ideology of racial superiority that justified 
violence against those deemed weak or inferior. Similarly, the Ku Klux 
Klan during its heyday was often most violent against two groups who 
challenged the notion of white supremacy: upwardly mobile blacks, and 
whites who helped blacks or treated them as equals. The authors note 
that one study of whites belonging to hate groups demonstrated that 
those who engaged in violent behavior actually were better educated 
and had higher career aspirations than non-violent members of such 
groups. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his colleagues suggest that efforts to raise self-
esteem actually may be making the problems of violence worse: "The 
societal pursuit of high self-esteem for everyone may literally end up 
doing considerable harm." Their conclusion should give all of us -- 
especially educators -- pause. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All those inflated teen-age egos may be contributing to an explosion 
in youth violence that has only begun.

<h2>
Castro Acts, Clinton Crumbles  
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">

</a>

<P>
President should call for full sanctions and threaten a military 
blockade and retaliatory strikes if necessary.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton faces a touch test of his foreign policy as he 
fashions a response to the downing Saturday of two U.S. civilian 
aircraft in international waters near Cuba. And, so far, he's in 
danger of flunking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Haitian or Bosnian lives were at stake over the past three years, 
Clinton didn't hesitate to threaten and ultimately to use force, 
sending thousands of troops to defend dubious U.S. interests. But the 
brutal attack on unarmed Americans (three of four fliers were U.S. 
citizens) last weekend elicited no such reolve.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best the president could muster in the hours after the attack was 
to send the Coast Guard to try to recover the bodies. And his 
announcement Monday that he would reinstate a ban on charter flights 
to Cuba doesn't go nearly far enough.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration's policy toward Cuba has been muddled from the 
beginning.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president would clearly like to normalize relations with Cuba and 
has been steadily moving in that direction since he took office. But 
Fidel Castro keeps throwing monkey wrenches in the deal. The attack on 
two U.S. planes is only the most recent - and most surprising - of his 
actions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro consistently has thumbed his nose at Clinton. In August 1994, 
Castro embarrassed the United States by allowing 30,000 Cubans to flee 
the island on rickety boats headed for the U.S. The president handled 
the crisis by detaining most of the refugees in camps outside the U.S. 
and repatriating those who would agree to return to Cuba. To do so, 
the president had to reverse the U.S. policy granting Cuban refugees 
automatic asylum that had been on the books for 30 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last fall, in the hopes of improved relations with Cuba, the 
administration lifted some restrictions on air flights and on goods 
and dollars that could be sent to the island by Americans. And, for 
the time being, money from relatives will continue to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most observers believed that the administration was moving toward 
lifting the 34-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba and would - in a 
second term - grant formal recognition to Cuba, which the United 
States has withheld for more than 35 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Castro has rewarded the Clinton administration's overtures with 
increased belligerence.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro continues to rule Cuba with an iron fist, tolerating no open 
dissent and inflicting terrible deprivation on his own citizens in 
order to maintain a powerful military, even as the economy of the 
island crumbles. In recent weeks, he has resorted to rounding up 
dissidents and human rights activists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the past two weeks alone, Cuban state secret police have arrested, 
detained or searched the homes of 50 dissidents.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the downing of the two U.S. civilian planes will finally 
convince the president that he's headed down the wrong path.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro understands only one thing: power. Castro will escalate his 
violence if he thinks he can literally get away with murder, including 
killing Americans.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration ought to use this incident to totally revise its 
Cuba policy.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sanctions against Cuba ought to be fully reinstated and vigorously 
enforced. The president should warn Cuba in no uncertain terms that 
any repeat of the refugee blackmail Castro initiated in 1994 and 1980 
(when more than 100,000 Cuban refugees fled by boat to the U.S.) will 
be met with a military blockade. And any further military attacks on 
Americans will be dealt with in kind by retaliatory strikes by U.S. 
forces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president shouldn't expect much support from the international 
community on such a  course of action. It took hours of debate to get 
even a mild U.N. Security Council statement deploring Cuba's attack on 
the two planes. But Cuba is in America's back yard and Fidel Castro 
remains a threat, not only to his own people but also to ours. The 
next time Clinton thinks about deploying U.S. troops, maybe he should 
consider defending U.S. interests a little closer to home.

<h2>
Welfare Reform: Bill, Shame On You 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>
<p>
<i>Political ad promoting president as great reformer is just a fraud. </i>
<P>
BETHESDA, Md. -- The biggest case of welfare fraud in U.S. history is 
taking place right now -- and the perpetrator is Bill Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Harsh words? Yes, but the president and the Democratic National 
Committee deserve it for the dishonest political commercials they're 
now airing trumpeting Bill Clinton as the Great Welfare Reformer.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ads appear in 13 Midwestern and Western bellwether states where 
conservative Democrats traditionally determine presidential election 
outcomes. I saw them just last week in New Mexico, where they were 
showing several times a day.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Families destroyed. Children's dreams lost. The legacy of our present 
welfare system," intones the narrator over depressing pictures of 
poverty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The president's plan: Increase child support enforcement, reduce teen 
pregnancy. Work requirements for welfare recipients, strict time 
limits on welfare benefits. Teach values in our schools. No work, no 
welfare -- rescue children from the destructive welfare system," 
bellows the unseen narrator as the pictures change.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A worker punches a time clock, kids say the Pledge of Allegiance -- 
images of patriotism and bedrock family values flash across the 
screen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The ad ends with Clinton's last State of the Union address: "We can 
make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American 
people," he tells Congress.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the ad doesn't say is that Clinton has already vetoed two 
welfare-reform packages that would have accomplished everything the 
commercial claims the president wants.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In December, Congress passed both a comprehensive welfare bill and an 
even more ambitious welfare-reform package in the budget 
reconciliation bill. The first would have saved more than $ 58 billion 
over seven years, the second more than $ 81.5 billion during the same 
period. The president vetoed both, even though he offered no serious 
alternative himself.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the bills' provisions were tough work requirements. Adults on 
welfare would have to begin working within two years and would face a 
five-year lifetime limit on their welfare benefits.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the area of child-support enforcement, the bills created a central 
registry to track deadbeat parents nationwide and required states to 
suspend driver's licenses for those who failed to pay support.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To deter teen pregnancy, the bills allowed states to deny teen-agers 
welfare payments unless the young mothers agreed to supervised living 
arrangements.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also did some things not mentioned in the Clinton ads.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislation proposed cutting off aid to drug users and alcoholics 
who now qualify for disability payments under the Supplemental 
Security Income program.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also proposed limiting aid available to new immigrants, a 
provision that simply puts teeth in existing immigration law, which 
requires that sponsors of immigrants bear financial responsibility for 
their charges for the first five years they live in the U.S.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans want welfare reform, and Clinton knows it. In 1992, he 
managed to hoodwink a plurality of the electorate into thinking he 
would "end welfare as we know it." Clinton's use of the welfare issue 
was calculated to win back voters the Democratic Party has been losing 
to Republicans over the last two decades. The campaign successfully 
targeted key states with high percentages of "Reagan Democrats" and 
ran ads very similar to those the DNC is pushing this year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the moment he was inaugurated, President Clinton quickly put 
welfare reform on the back burner while he attended to more pressing 
issues like gays in the military.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't until 1994 that the president even bothered to send up a 
welfare-reform package.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For Clinton now to try to regain the mantle of welfare reformer shows 
more than the usual political chutzpah. He's trying to defraud the 
American people in an election year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If the DNC's welfare-reform ad promoted a commercial product rather 
than the president of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission 
would yank it from the airwaves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the very least, the ad ought to bear the warning: Voters beware.

<title>Chavez: Culture Fails a Child -- And A Teacher

<h2> 
Culture Fails A Child -- and A Teacher 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   

BETHESDA, Md. -- She was a 45-year-old special education teacher, a   
wife and the mother of a 6-year-old boy. He was a troubled teen-ager   
who desperately wanted a gold Toyota Camry for his 17th birthday.   
Their paths crossed at a shopping center in Toms River, N.J., where   
the teacher drove her 1995 gold Camry to buy a sandwich on her way to   
a college exam.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That chance encounter ended both their lives. The teacher was buried   
last week. The boy sits in jail, awaiting trial for murder and   
carjacking. As tragic as this incident was, it wouldn't have attracted   
much attention were it not for one difference. The teacher, Kathleen   
Weinstein, surreptitiously recorded the last half-hour of her life,   
which she spent counseling, cajoling and pleading with the teen-ager.   
The recording led police to the boy, Michael LaSane.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unlike the 35,000 attempted or completed carjackings that take place   
each year, this one became a national story when bits of the   
transcript were printed in newspapers across the nation.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Most of the attention has focused on Weinstein, a remarkable woman   
right down to her last minutes on Earth. But it's her alleged   
assailant -- and the thousands like him -- we must begin to focus on.   
What is it that motivates a teen-ager to kill an innocent stranger?   
What can we do to prevent such horrors? Sure, we need tougher laws,   
more policemen and more prisons. But we also need to admit that   
something has gone very wrong with our culture when so many young   
people have no regard for human life and do not seem even to   
understand the difference between right and wrong.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Weinstein's alleged assailant doesn't quite fit our image of a killer.   
Yes, like 70% of young men who commit violent crimes, he comes from a   
single-parent household, and he lives in public housing, where crime   
is all too common. But his mother works in law enforcement, and his   
family is described by friends as God-fearing churchgoers. And while   
Michael had been in trouble with the police before, nothing about his   
record indicates he was capable of such cold-blooded violence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is known about Michael is that he was obsessed with owning a   
shiny new car. He talked about it incessantly to his friends,   
describing how he was saving to buy his dream. It is a fantasy that   
consumes most teen-agers, reinforced dozens of times a day by TV ads   
that equate owning a new car with success, physical attractiveness and   
even intelligence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it's not just cars; it's all manner of material things we're told   
we can't live without. The young are especially susceptible to such   
messages, particularly since so many young people have nothing -- no   
one -- countering such influences in their lives. Increasing numbers   
of fathers are missing altogether from their children's lives, and   
mothers are spending less and less time caring for their children.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One-third of American children are now born to single mothers, and   
half of all children will spend part of their childhoods without   
fathers. About 70% of mothers of young children now work outside the   
home and often are so tired when they come home there's no energy left   
over to provide the consistent discipline and moral education children   
need.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Schools no longer teach right from wrong, either. For decades,   
intellectuals have claimed there are no absolutes - everything is   
relative, governed by the circumstances.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In one young man's case, the situation was clear. He had to have a   
gold Camry. He bragged he was getting it for his birthday. In her last   
few minutes, Mrs. Weinstein couldn't teach lessons the whole culture   
had failed to teach this boy in a lifetime.

<h2> 
Hollywood Misses American Reality 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Sex sells. Hollywood is simply giving Americans what  
they want. That's the explanation entertainment executives and media 
critics have been giving for years to explain why sex saturates movies 
and TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But a new public opinion survey by U.S. News & World Report suggests 
they're wrong. Americans are fed up with the smutty fare the networks 
dish out. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine surveyed a random sample of 1,000 adults in March and 
reported the results in the April 15 issue. Overwhelmingly, 
respondents reported that they disapproved of what they see on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
More than 80% expressed concern about verbal references to sex, 
nudity, and premarital and extramarital sex on TV. And 75% were 
worried about portrayals of homosexual activity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And huge majorities said they believe that television portrayals of 
sex or sexual references actually affect behavior: 84% said such 
portrayals contributed to extramarital sex, 83% to casual sex, 90% to 
young people having sex, and 94% to violence against women. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Are Americans overreacting? Or is TV really raunchier these days? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine actually surveyed prime-time shows on the four major 
broadcast networks for one week. It found that half of all shows 
contained sexual acts or references to sex. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Another, more comprehensive study by media analysts Robert and Linda 
Lichter found a sex act or reference occurs once every four minutes on 
prime-time shows. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the sexual depictions are anything but responsible. Casual sex is 
the basic plot line of NBC's top-rated sitcom Friends, about a group 
of libidinous twentysomethings always on the make. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Recent episodes have depicted one-night stands, lesbian moms, 
homosexual marriage (with House Speaker Newt Gingrich's openly gay 
sister performing the ceremony) and intergenerational romance. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The latter plot involving the show's ingenue Monica (Courtny Cox) and 
Richard (played by Tom Selleck -- who ironically has been active in 
the traditional values movement) made much of Richard's quaint lack of 
sexual experience. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As a divorced man in his 40s, Richard admits he's slept with only two 
women, his wife and Monica. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While that makes him practically a freak as a TV character, it 
probably puts him in the same category as about two-thirds of men his 
age. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
According to the most comprehensive study of Americans' sexual 
behavior ever done, the National Health and Social Life Survey 
conducted in the early '90s, 67% of men Richard's age actually married 
their first sexual partner, and more than 65% of males remain faithful 
to their spouses while they are married. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But TV reflects neither reality nor viewers' preferences. What it does 
reflect is the values of its creators. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Although U.S. News didn't conduct a scientific survey of entertainment 
executives, it did mail out a questionnaire to more than 6,000 
Hollywood leaders, about 10% of whom responded. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the gap in attitudes between the TV executives and the public was 
huge. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In virtually every category, only a minority of the Hollywood elite 
who responded showed concern about actual sexual activities on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Less than one-third expressed concern about homosexual activity, 
compared with three-quarters of the public, for example, and half as 
many industry executives as the general public were upset by TV nudity 
or seminudity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Since these executives took the time to respond to the survey in the 
first place, their responses may actually overstate general Hollywood 
concerns about sex on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
After all, those who don't think there's a problem would be least 
likely to fill out the survey. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
So why not just turn off the TV set or change the channel? More and 
more Americans may be doing just that, which partially explains why 
the networks are losing audience share. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But that's not the total answer. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Hollywood isn't a society unto itself, and the values it helps create 
shape the world in which all of us live. It's hard to imagine even 
Hollywood executives wanting their own children to behave as 
promiscuously as the characters they create in prime time.

HEADLINE: Minimum wage: Bad idea GOP fears to fight 
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Republicans may as well run a white flag up the 
Capitol flagpole if the current debate over a minimum-wage hike is any 
indication of their resolve to retain congressional power this fall. 
The Republican leadership seems to have given up even trying to make 
the case against raising the minimum wage. The leaders know the 
Democrats' proposal to increase the federal minimum wage 20% over two 
years, to $ 5.15 per hour, is bad policy, but they're scared to death 
of the politics of the issue. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's why 24 moderate Republicans have already broken ranks with the 
leadership and offered their own -- higher -- minimum-wage bill. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But sacrificing policy to politics is usually a bad bargain, even in 
an election year. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's no question that raising the minimum wage is popular. Recent 
polls show that about 8 in 10 voters favor the proposed increase. Most 
people can't imagine living on the current $ 4.25 an hour minimum, 
much less supporting a family on such low wages. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And rightfully so, since so few workers actually do support themselves 
or families at minimum-wage jobs. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of the approximately 2 million workers -- out of a national workforce 
of nearly 140 million -- who earn $ 4.25 or less an hour, 53% are 
younger than 25 years of age. Most minimum-wage workers today are 
secondary earners who come from middle-class families, often students 
who work part time. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Almost as many current minimum-wage workers live in families earning 
more than $ 50,000 a year as live in poor households. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Of course, increasing the minimum by 90 cents an hour will enlarge the 
universe of minimum-wage workers, covering an additional 8 million 
workers who earn up to $ 5.15 an hour, many of whom are older and more 
likely to support families. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But it won't necessarily improve their economic opportunities. Most 
economists agree that raising the minimum wage will cost jobs; the 
only real question is how many. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has been touting a couple of studies 
that dispute decades of research in this area, most notably a study 
involving fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and California by 
Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger (who served for a 
while as Reich's chief economist). The Card/Krueger study purported to 
show that New Jersey's state minimum-wage hike to $ 5.05 per hour, one 
of the highest in the nation, did not lead to job losses. But the 
study now has been largely discounted by everyone but its authors and 
Reich. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The New Jersey findings were based on data obtained from carelessly 
worded telephone surveys and were subsequently disproved by other 
economists who examined actual payroll records in the state. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Nonetheless, most Republicans have been intimidated into silence. The 
best the leadership now hopes for is to attach the proposal to 
legislation Republicans want and Democrats don't, thereby either 
sinking the bill or exacting a price for its passage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Perhaps the most cynical political move of all, however, came from the 
24 maverick House Republicans who last week announced their own bill 
to increase the federal minimum wage to $ 5.25 an hour. Most of them 
come from high-wage states in the Northeast with tight labor markets 
where it is almost impossible to hire someone at the minimum wage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
These states have been losing jobs to lower-wage states in the South 
and West for years. 
 But if Congress increases the minimum wage nationally, these states 
won't be at such a competitive disadvantage. What these Republican 
legislators seem to be saying (if not in so many words) is that if 
their districts must lose jobs, why not share the pain? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Republicans have nothing to gain by backing a minimum-wage increase -- 
and a lot to lose. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Republicans cave on this issue, it will cost jobs -- including, 
no doubt, those of some Republican members of Congress who will have shown they lack the courage of their own convictions. 
<BR>

<title>Chavez: All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  - 5/01/96

<h2>  
All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">  
Linda Chavez  
</a>  
  
<P>    
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Proponents of affirmative action and forced busing  
are complaining of an ominous shift away from support for civil  
rights. They point to recent court rulings and state and national  
efforts to bar preferences for minorities as proof the mood has turned  
ugly. A recent cover of Time even warned the country is headed "Back  
to segregation" on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Plessy vs.  
Ferguson, the Supreme Court's infamous 1896 "separate but equal"  
ruling.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
What's really going on is the repudiation of the racial numbers game  
invoked to end discrimination. Americans overwhelmingly support the  
right of minorities to attend the same schools and compete for the  
same jobs as whites. The National Opinion Research Center, which has  
been monitoring opinion on racial issues for more than 50 years,  
reports that 90% of Americans favor such rights.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
That doesn't mean they're willing to go along with schemes to bus  
schoolchildren or give hiring preferences to minorities to maintain  
some ideal "racial balance." Debates in Massachusetts and California  
illustrate the current mood.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For years, Massachusetts has been trying to enforce racial balance in  
the public schools. A 22-year-old state law declares any school with a  
minority enrollment that exceeds 50% is out of balance. Under the law,  
districts that "voluntarily" balance their schools' racial composition  
through busing or other methods receive a huge financial bonus. The  
state covers 90% of the cost of school construction for districts that  
comply, an incentive critics have called a virtual bribe.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Now, however, the state board of education is considering repealing  
the law. And the most vociferous proponent of repeal is Abigail  
Thernstrom, a soft-spoken political scientist with impeccable civil  
rights credentials.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
California, too, has been in the forefront of the racial numbers game,  
especially in higher education. A University of California medical  
school was the focus of the Supreme Court's famous 1978 Bakke  
decision, which barred outright admissions quotas by race but allowed  
schools to "take race into account" in order to promote "diversity."  
Last summer, however, the university's regents voted to prohibit any  
racial or ethnic preferences in admissions or hiring. And leading the  
charge was Ward Connerly, a black businessman who now heads the effort  
to enact a ban on all state preferences.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Neither move indicates the clock is being turned back on civil rights  
enforcement. What they do signify is an end to a fixation with racial  
balance as an end in itself. That obsession did little to improve the  
quality of education for black or white children or to improve the  
skills of minority workers.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In his book Forced Justice, David Armor points out that the gap  
between white and black educational achievement has been closing over  
the past few decades, but it has little to do with school  
desegregation. According to Armor's assessment of national data,  
"Gains for segregated black students are as large or larger than for  
desegregated blacks, and . . . blacks in disadvantaged urban  
communities gain as much as blacks in nondisadvantaged communities."  
Armor maintains that black students' achievement has much more to do  
with their parents' economic status than their classmates' color, just  
like whites.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Simply trying to balance numbers by race and ethnicity won't improve  
the quality of schools children attend or help them gain the skills  
necessary to compete later in life. But a shift away from numbers  
might actually force policymakers to deal with the true impediments to  
minority progress.  
<BR>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
     
<P>       
 If Americans want big, fancy cars, they have to pay the price.     
 <p> 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Looking for someone to blame for today's high gas     
prices? Chances are the culprits aren't some oil executives in Houston     
or sheiks in Riyadh, but a lot closer to home.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Try looking in your own garage or your neighbor's. Minivans, sport     
utility vehicles and pickup trucks are fast replacing compacts as     
Americans' favorite vehicles. These bigger cars, plus higher speed     
limits, have driven down fuel efficiency and driven up demand.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
So, too, did last winter's bitter cold, which kept consumers burning     
more heating oil in their furnaces. Just last week, snow once again     
hit the Rocky Mountains and the Midwest, creating more home heating     
oil demand long past the usual season. And unless supply can keep pace     
with demand -- which is difficult in the short run for a product like     
gasoline -- the price goes up. It's as close to a fixed law of     
economics as there is.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But politicians can't very well blame their own constituents or Mother     
Nature for rising prices at the pumps, so they're playing politics --     
on both sides of the aisle. The Clinton administration announced plans     
to sell off part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This move is     
probably harmless, if ineffectual, since it will add a mere trickle     
into the consumers' supply, about 12 million barrels or less than two     
days' worth of gas for the nation's drivers.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But the administration didn't stop there. The Justice Department also     
announced it will investigate the oil companies for collusion and     
price-fixing. This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to win votes     
by peddling paranoia.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Meanwhile, the Republicans have been exploiting the gasoline pricing     
issue for their own purposes. They're using recent price hikes to     
justify repealing a tax they've been opposed to from its inception:     
the Clinton administration's 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Cutting     
taxes is a good thing, but no one should be under any illusion that     
repealing the gas tax will have any permanent effect on the price of     
gasoline.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
One of the biggest dangers in this political posturing is that it     
feeds the all-too-common misconception that government intervention in     
the economy can work to benefit consumers. It never happens that way.     
Even if the president or Congress could wave a magic wand and cut     
prices, government price controls lead to supply shortages. Would     
Americans really rather line up for hours at filling stations than pay     
a few cents more per gallon?     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
In fact, although prices have risen steeply recently -- 13% in three     
months -- gasoline is still a great bargain in the United States.     
Europeans and Asians pay four times as much for their gas as we do,     
which is why they drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. And the     
American Petroleum Institute says we are actually paying the lowest     
price per gallon, in constant dollars, since World War I.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But although we're paying less, we're using more gasoline than ever.     
We now live farther from work and shopping than we once did. And wives     
as well as husbands commute to work, often in separate cars from their     
spouses. All that adds up to more miles on the road.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Dr. Lee Shipper, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in     
California, estimated in The New York Times recently that U.S.     
vehicles traveled 7,900 miles per person in 1994, compared with 5,350     
in 1973. More fuel-efficient cars in recent years helped reduce the     
impact of these longer distances. But in 1994, bigger vehicles brought     
fuel efficiency down once again to 19.3 miles per gallon from a high     
of 20.2 in 1985.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Prices will probably decline somewhat in the weeks and months ahead as     
supply catches up with demand -- especially if Iraq re-enters the     
market, as it is expected to if Saddam Hussein agrees to terms imposed     
by the U=2EN. with U.S. backing.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But so long as Americans want the freedom to drive our own big, fancy     
vehicles long distances for work and play, we're going to have to pay     
the price.     
<BR>

BETHESDA, Md. -- Has America embraced a "culture of death" as Pope   
John Paul II warned on a visit here in 1993?   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/GALLUP poll showing some 75% of Americans   
support so-called assisted suicide suggests the pope may be right.   
Most Americans who support "the right to die" -- including the   
ghoulish Dr. Jack Kevorkian, acquitted Tuesday of two counts of   
assisted suicide, and the judges in two recent appeals court cases in   
Washington and New York -- claim to be motivated by compassion. After   
all, they are only supporting people who want to end their own lives.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
But before the courts and the public get too enamored of this   
incipient movement, perhaps they ought to take a close look at what's   
happened in the Netherlands, the only Western nation that formally   
endorses the idea of physicians helping patients kill themselves.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch have nearly a quarter century of experience with physician-  
assisted suicide and euthanasia. In 1990 a Dutch government commission   
conducted a survey, which showed that euthanasia is far more widely   
practiced in the Netherlands than officials had believed and that it   
is most frequently administered without patients' consent.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
According to the report of the Dutch commission, 11,800 patients were   
euthanized in 1990 through active measures, most often by   
administering lethal drugs, and 5,941 of these were performed without   
the patient's consent. Only 400 patients opted for assisted suicide.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The commission also reported an additional 13,506 patients were denied   
"nonfutile medical treatment with intention to terminate life," a   
practice the Dutch call "euthanasia by omission" because it denies   
lifesaving treatment. And the great majority of these cases, 64%,   
involved persons who had given no prior consent to such a fate through   
a living will or other document.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Netherlands is a tiny country, with a population of only about 15   
million. To put these euthanasia figures in some perspective, a   
comparable euthanasia rate in the United States would result in nearly   
200,000 deaths from active measures and another 225,000 from   
euthanasia by omission.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Once embarked down the path of doctor-assisted suicide, that may be   
where we are headed.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch didn't start out to practice euthanasia so widely, but once   
doctors started killing patients rather than treating them, the slide   
into mass murder was relatively easy. A recent article by a Dutch   
physician, Richard Fenigsen, in the journal Issues in Law and Medicine   
explains why "Euthanasia is not just changing medicine; it is   
replacing medicine. This suppression of traditional medical thinking,   
medical working habits, and the medical way of reacting to events has   
an impact on both the emergency care and the long-term care of   
patients," he writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Fenigsen describes several case studies. In one teaching hospital,   
anesthetists stopped providing anesthesia for cardiac surgery   
involving Down's syndrome patients. In other cases, hospitals and   
doctors refused to apply simple, lifesaving measures to patients whose   
lives they determined were "unlivable."   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In one case, a physician did not administer insulin to a 6-year-old,   
mildly retarded boy who developed juvenile diabetes, thereby causing   
his death. In another, a doctor persuaded an elderly woman to stop   
taking medicine needed to treat an enlarged heart because she was   
living a "limited life" -- she depended on several medications, needed   
help cleaning her house, and could walk only a few blocks at a time.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In all, 65% of Dutch doctors believe that physicians may propose   
active euthanasia to patients who do not ask for it themselves,   
according to Dutch surveys.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
"Euthanasia has perceptibly affected the position of the individual in   
relation to society, society's very nature and purpose, the law, the   
government, the judicial system, the family, the expectations of older   
persons and the prospects of newborn infants, the practice of   
medicine, and the care of persons with disabilities," Fenigsen writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
What has happened in the Netherlands could easily happen here if we   
allow it.

<h2> 
Clinton Welfare Flip: At Least He Landed in Right Spot
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- He may not look like an Olympic gymnast, but Bill 
Clinton has proved he's a real master of the triple somersault with 
his latest move on welfare reform. The man who campaigned on the 
promise of ending welfare as we know it -- and then vetoed two 
welfare-reform bills which did just that -- has once again reversed 
himself.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On Saturday, the president announced he'll support a Wisconsin plan to 
abolish Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replace it 
with a mandatory work program.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet just months ago, the president and other administration officials 
excoriated Republicans in Congress as "radical" and "extremist" for 
proposing welfare reforms far more modest than Wisconsin's plan.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's welfare reform, Wisconsin will 
eliminate traditional welfare and replace it with work. Women who 
apply for assistance in Wisconsin will receive job counseling and be 
expected to work in a regular job or in one subsidized by the state.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who have few skills or little work experience, the state 
will provide community-service jobs or places in "sheltered workshops" 
which will provide work activities consistent with recipients' 
abilities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These changes in state law require the administration's approval 
before they can take effect, however, which is why the president's 
endorsement is so crucial. And requiring welfare mothers to work is 
still controversial in some circles -- especially among Democrats.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Welfare-rights activists who oppose the Wisconsin reforms argue that 
children will suffer if their mothers are forced off welfare and into 
jobs unless the state provides a myriad of expensive services, 
including job training and child care.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And President Clinton cited the lack of sufficient money for training 
and child care in the congressional welfare-reform proposals when he 
vetoed them last winter.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But working mothers who have never been on welfare receive little, if 
any, help with subsidized day care for their children, much less 
government-financed employment training.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Does it really make sense to provide greater benefits to those who 
have shown less initiative and responsibility than we do to women who 
struggle to balance work and family duties?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some welfare advocates argue that mothers of young children 
shouldn't be forced to work at all. This argument might actually have 
carried some weight when most women stayed home to raise their 
children. Indeed, AFDC began in 1935 as a program to help women whose 
husbands had died or abandoned them, at a time when only about 8% of 
married women with children were in the labor force.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, 76% of married women with school-age children work, as 
do 62% of those with children under 6 years.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great irony is that a larger percentage of married than single 
moms work. Only 57% of single mothers are in the workforce, including 
only 52% of those with children under 6. For nonworking single moms, 
Uncle Sam is the main provider. And women who bear children out of 
wedlock are far more likely than divorced mothers to end up on welfare 
and to stay there for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, something has gone wrong with a system that makes it easier 
for a woman to stay home to raise her children if she doesn't marry 
the father than if she does.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least in Wisconsin that may no longer be the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It takes an election to get Bill Clinton to do the right thing. But 
for now, his latest welfare back flips have landed him in the right 
spot -- and he's likely to remain there at least for the rest of the 
campaign.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trick for Republicans will be to use Clinton's Wisconsin decision 
to force his hand on a federal bill that puts in place some of the 
same reforms before the election.

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Remember when there were two political parties in the 
U.S.? One party favored big government, the other wanted to cut it. 
One party talked about social justice, the other party demanded law 
and order. One party defended the right to do your own thing, the 
other encouraged traditional values. No more. At least when it comes 
to political rhetoric, the era of liberalism is over.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's no accident that today's Democrats -- most notably Bill Clinton -
- sound a lot like staunch Republicans. The country has shifted to the 
right over the last four presidential elections and Democrats have had 
to move, too, at least rhetorically.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent Gallup poll shows Americans overwhelmingly support a 
conservative political agenda. Over 80% favor a balanced budget 
amendment, oppose racial preferences in schools and jobs, and endorse 
English as the official language. More than 70% support congressional 
term limits, sanction a constitutional amendment allowing school 
prayer and want to cut off welfare after two years unless recipients 
work. Similarly large majorities oppose legalizing homosexual 
marriages, favor school choice and want to ban partial-birth 
abortions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given these numbers, no candidate in his or her right mind would 
publicly endorse deficit spending, racial quotas, or expanding 
welfare. When it comes to driving the political agenda Republicans win 
hands down -- which is why President Clinton is spending his time 
honing a conservative image.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same man who pushed gays in the military now says he'll happily 
sign federal legislation to ban gay marriages.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who ignored welfare reform for his first two years in 
office, and then twice vetoed Republican welfare bills, now brags he's 
helped states to reform welfare on their own.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who appointed dozens of federal judges with a history of 
allowing criminals back on the streets never misses a photo 
opportunity to surround himself with police officers who put those 
criminals behind bars in the first place.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton, ersatz conservative, hopes voters will forget his deeds and 
remember only his rhetoric. So far, the polls indicate his plan is 
working=2E Bill Clinton has never been so popular.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this strategy carry him through the election? And will Clinton's 
latest tilt to the right convince Americans the Democratic Party 
represents the new conservatism? Not likely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most voters haven't even begun to concentrate on the election in the 
fall. They're too busy planning their kids' graduations and family 
vacations to focus on November.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When voters do start to focus in earnest -- probably not until the 
party conventions -- Democrats will have a hard time sustaining their 
new-found conservatism. Public employees, who make up the biggest 
block of delegates, will hardly turn the Democrat convention into a 
cut-government-spending rally.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association won't countenance discussion of 
school choice. And Jesse Jackson would never permit his party to roll 
back racial preferences.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Forget Democratic support for making English the official language. As 
for endorsing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, how 
would that make the 162 congressional Democrats who voted against it 
look?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact is, Democrats can't make good on Republican issues even when 
it's in their interest to do so. When it comes to acting, not talking, 
1996 won't be any different. Come November voters will choose 
Republican action over Democratic words.

<h2>The Coming Battle on Social Security</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
The continuing conflict over Medicare reform may be just a warm-up to 
the coming battle on Social Security.  Though few politicians want to 
talk about it, the Social Security system is anything but secure.  And 
if current demographic trends continue, those persons who are 25-50 
years-old today can forget about recouping their contributions into 
the system when they turn 65.
<P>
Social Security is one of the biggest give-away programs in the 
federal budget, yet the program remains almost universally popular and 
untouchable when it comes to budget-cutting.  Why?  Because most 
people -- both the elderly and younger workers -- have been sold a 
bill of goods.
<P>
Myth # 1. Social Security recipients are simply getting back in 
benefits what they and their employers put into the system in payroll 
taxes during their working lives.  
<p>
Actually, the average person retiring today will get back what he and 
his employers paid into the system within the first 4.5 years after 
retirement.  Since the average man will live 7.3  years after 
retirement age and the average woman 14 years, most beneficiaries will 
receive nearly 1.5 to 3 times what they contributed.
<p>
Myth # 2.  The Social Security Trust Fund operates like any other 
pension system, the money is put aside and invested to pay for future 
benefits.
<p>
Wrong.  In most private pension plans, the employer/employee 
contributions are saved and invested to provide  the actual benefits 
workers will receive from the plan.  But Social Security benefits are 
financed differently, on a pay-as-you-go system.  Benefits don't come 
from retirees' own contributions, but rather from the contributions of 
those who are still working.  
<p>
The so-called Trust Fund isn't really a separate fund at all, but a 
bookkeeping device.  And the money supposedly "in" the fund isn't 
invested but used by the government to pay for other government 
programs.  The fund supposedly "receives" long-term Treasury bonds in 
return for this "investment."  
<p>
In essence, the government borrows from itself and promises to pay it 
back at some later time.  But what that really means is that the 
government borrows from taxpayers, in this case future taxpayers, and 
most likely will pay it back by raising taxes down the line.
<p>
Myth # 3 Even if Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, the next 
generation will be willing to pay for the program that, after all, 
takes care of its own parents.
<p>
The problem is the next generation of retirees had fewer children than 
previous generations.  The current system depends on a pyramid 
financing scheme.  In order to pay for the present level of benefits, 
3 workers contribute payroll taxes to pay for 1 retiree's benefits.  
But the ratio of workers to retirees is actually shrinking slightly.  
When the baby-boomers retire, there will be only 2 workers per retiree 
available to pay taxes for the same benefits.  Something will have to 
give: either benefits will significantly drop or taxes will rise 
dramatically.
<p>
Myth # 4.  The elderly are the most vulnerable and poorest members of 
society who can least afford to have their government benefits 
trimmed.
<p>
Certainly there are many poor elderly people in the U.S.  But the 
economic condition of the elderly has actually improved dramatically 
over the last few decades, while that of children has declined at the 
same time.  There has been a large shift in wealth in recent years 
from the young and working aged to the elderly, and government 
programs have been chiefly responsible.  
<p>
Although those aged 65 or older are only 12.5% of the population, they 
receive more than one-third of all federal dollars in benefits, 
regardless of actual need.  Americans rail against welfare programs 
for poor women and their children -- especially Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children, which accounts for only about 1% of federal 
spending -- but never imagine that both Social Security and Medicare 
are really welfare programs for the elderly, including those who are 
wealthy and have no need of subsidies.
<p>
It's time Americans of all ages face up to the fact that current 
elderly programs will bankrupt America. Radically reforming Social 
Security is not only necessary, but just and fair.

<h2>As In Israel, We Need to Tone Down Rhetoric</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 


The murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an extreme 
Israeli nationalist should be a warning to all political groups that 
words have consequences. Since the signing of the first peace accord 
with the Palestinians in 1993, some opponents of the agreement have 
attacked Rabin in the most vicious and personal terms. Rabin was 
depicted as a traitor to his country, a murderer, even a Nazi SS 
officer.
<p>
Vilifying political opponents isn't unique to Israeli politics, nor 
are the dangers that go with such angry rhetoric. In recent months 
Democrats in Congress have called Republicans "worse than Hitler" and 
accused them of "practicing genocide with a smile." Meanwhile, 
Republicans have called Democrats "the enemy  of normal Americans," 
and the right-leaning National Rifle Association has portrayed federal 
law enforcement agents as jack-booted storm troopers.
<p>
The First Amendment gives us the right to call each other Nazis or 
enemies, but constitutional protection doesn't make it right. 
Responsible leaders have an obligation to refrain from engaging in 
such tactics and to discourage the behavior among their supporters. 
That doesn't mean we have to stifle political debate. The danger on 
any issue comes when the focus of criticism shifts from disparaging 
the policy to demonizing the policymakers. That dangerous game can 
have deadly consequences.
<p>
There seems to be a growing tendency to portray our political 
opponents not only as wrong but evil. When Democrats attack 
Republicans, they portray them as  callous and greedy, wanting to take 
food from the mouths of poor children to give money to the rich. 
Republicans engage in similar demonization, calling Democrats un-
American and immoral.
<p>
Politicians poison public debate when they turn policy differences 
into attacks on their opponents' character, ethics, patriotism and 
morality. What's more, they make legitimate compromise more difficult 
-- and public cynicism inevitable.
<p>
What will happen when the Democrats and Republicans agree on a budget 
-- as they must eventually? What will happen when the Congress reverts 
to Democratic control -- or a Republican occupies the White House? 
Will any of these events portend national disaster? Do they justify a 
revolution?
<p>
One of the saving graces of American politics has been its centrist 
nature. The ideological difference between Republicans and Democrats 
has never been as great as between the Conservative and Labor parties 
in England, not to mention as wide as the chasm that separates neo-
fascist and pro-communist groups in other European democracies.
<p>
Following Rabin's assassination, Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the 
opposition Likud Party in Israel and a critic of Rabin's peace plan, 
said the most important thing Israelis could do was to pull together 
as a nation and a people.
<p>
Americans face no crisis comparable to the Israelis' at the moment, 
but Netanyahu's advice could serve us well nonetheless. We've had our 
share of extremist individuals - on both the right and the left - who 
have engaged not only in assassinations but domestic terrorism.
<p>
Politicians in Israel, especially on the right, will be soul-searching 
to determine whether their words might have incited extremists in 
their midst to violence. We could do with some similar examination of 
conscience here at home.

<html><head><title>Chavez: Immigrants Make Gains in California
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>Immigrants Make Gains in California</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
 
Californians still have earthquakes, mudslides and fires to worry 
about, but they can breathe a little easier when it comes to another 
perennial source of anxiety: the state's 6 million immigrants.
<p>
A new study by the University of Southern California shows that the 
region's immigrants are rapidly moving into the social and economic 
mainstream despite fears they would be a huge burden.
<p>
The study, by USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, details 
impressive gains in income, status and English proficiency among the 
largest immigrant groups, including Asians and Latinos who arrived in 
the 1970s.
<p>
Using census data from 1980 and 1990, the USC researchers found that 
Asian immigrants in Southern California who were between 25 to 34 
years old in 1980 had more than doubled their average income by 1990.
<p>
Nearly 70 percent became U.S. citizens in the same period. And more 
than half spoke English very well.
<p>
Immigrants of the same age from Europe and the Middle East made 
similar gains in income and even more spectacular gains in English 
proficiency, though only 51 percent became citizens.
<p>
Even Latino immigrants had made significant progress, improving their 
earnings by 27 percent.
<p>
Although relatively few Latinos who came to the U.S. as adults spoke 
English  very well (only 21 percent of those who were 25 to 34 in 
1980), 70 percent of those who immigrated as children were fully 
proficient in English by 1990.
<p>
But if California immigrants are doing so well, why have their fellow 
state residents turned sour on immigration?
<p>
 Nearly half of registered voters in the state - including 28 percent 
of Hispanic voters - believe there is no benefit whatsoever from 
immigration, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll.
<p>
And Californians aren't alone in their hostility to immigrants. Nearly 
two out of three Americans say immigrants are "a bad thing for this 
country" and will never assimilate.
<p>
The problem may have to do with more than simple prejudice.
<p>
With so many new immigrants coming to the United States now - about 
800,000 were admitted last year - it's difficult to measure their 
progress.
<p>
Simply comparing how all immigrants measure up on education, language, 
earnings and the like from 1980 to 1990 tells almost nothing about 
those immigrants who actually lived in the U.S. for that entire 10-
year period.
<p>
Why? Because the group measured in 1990 isn't composed of the same 
people as  the one measured in 1980.
<p>
The newer immigrants - by definition - haven't lived in the U.S. as 
long and  won't have had as much time to improve their status.
<p>
The USC researchers got around this problem by analyzing census data 
differently.
<p>
Instead of looking at all immigrants in 1980 and 1990, they broke up 
immigrants into groups based on their ethnic background, age and time 
of arrival.
<p>
The USC researchers then tracked these "cohorts" in the census of both 
1980 and 1990.
<p>
This allowed researchers to compare the same group 10 years apart.
<p>
The more accurate analysis can demonstrate what improvements similar 
groups of immigrants make in learning English, becoming citizens and 
increasing their incomes.
<p>
Too bad the USC study won't be widely read by those in or out of 
California.  It could be an important antidote to the anti-immigrant 
sentiment sweeping the country.
<p>
The USC data dispel many of the myths about immigrants: that they're 
stuck on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, that they can't or 
won't assimilate and that they'll never become Americans.
<p>
At the very least, the study should be required reading for members of 
Congress, who will soon vote on major legislation that could 
dramatically reduce immigration.

<hr>
<h2>The "Stern-ing" of America?</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

What does it say about the state of our popular culture that radio 
shock-jock Howard Stern can replace Colin Powell as the best-selling 
author in America?
<p>
Stern's book, Miss America, went to the top of the charts last week, 
selling more than nine copies for every one copy of the next best-
selling book on the list.
<p>
Stern's specialty is trash talk, and apparently there are thousands of 
garbage collectors out there who will pay $ 27.50 to wallow in the 
muck.
<p>
I ran into several hundred of them last week in Manhattan as they 
lined up in front of a bookstore to get autographed copies of Stern's 
rubbish. I must admit I was intrigued, even a little amused (Howard 
Stern fans can read?) - from a distance.
<p>
The taxi driver warned me when I gave him the address of my 
appointment that it was just down the street from Stern's book signing 
and traffic would be more than usually snarled. He suggested dropping 
me short of my destination since I'd have better luck walking the last 
block and a half.
<p>
The sight of police barricades on the sidewalk and a dozen or more 
blue uniforms persuaded me he was right. Besides, I was curious to see 
just who would stand in line for several hours in 30-degree weather to 
get Stern's autograph. The mostly male, youngish crowd - late teens to 
mid-30s - weren't content to wait quietly for their chance to meet 
their idol, who had promised to appear dressed in the same 
transvestite outfit that adorns the book's cover. Several shouted 
insults and obscenities at cars, pedestrians, police, anyone and 
anything in hearing distance. I suppose I shouldn't have been 
surprised, but the voices bellowing curses felt like a slap in the 
face. I can turn the dial when I hear Stern's foul mouth on the public 
airwaves. But for the few minutes I stood waiting to cross the street 
in front of Stern's fans I couldn't escape his cheap imitators.
<p>
Stern likes to fashion himself a libertarian (he ran, briefly, as the 
Libertarian Party candidate for governor of New York in 1994) pushing 
the envelope of free speech on the radio. He even manages to sneak in 
a few lines of "social commentary" in his 482-page book, striking a 
blow for morality by inveighing against Woody Allen's "low-life, 
amoral habits" and the hypocrisy of those parents who sent their 
prepubescent sons to spend the weekend with Michael Jackson, no 
questions asked.
<p>
And Stern proudly touts his 20-year marriage, describing himself as "a 
devoted husband and father." It's enough to make you wonder if his 
whole bit isn't a put-on.
<p>
But Stern is no satirist, a latter-day Jonathan Swift making "a modest 
proposal." He incites nastiness, crudity and effrontery. And his fans 
revel in outdoing their mentor. In his book, Stern describes one 
particularly vulgar protege who specializes in Stern's trademark prank 
phone calls. This social misfit delights in tormenting TV call-in show 
hosts, especially Mother Angelica, a Roman Catholic nun whose program 
appears on a religious cable station. Stern reproduces the transcript 
of two of these creepy calls in his book under the subheading "Jesus 
died for you," in bold print.
<p>
Stern has made millions with this trash. And the sales of his book 
suggest he'll make millions more. And it's not just Stern who's 
getting rich, but also the publishers and radio stations that give him 
access to his audience.
<p>
Infinity Broadcasting, which produces his radio show, has paid $ 1.7 
million in fines to the Federal Communications Commission for some of 
Stern's on-air antics, which violated FCC rules. They're not laying 
out that kind of money just because they believe in the First 
Amendment. The response to Stern needn't be censorship. Mother 
Angelica had the best answer. "You really need to examine your 
conscience," Stern quotes her saying to a Stern-inspired prank caller.
<p>
There's not much hope Stern or his fans will take Mother Angelica's 
advice. But maybe the rest of us can shame the media executives who 
give Stern a platform into examining theirs.
<p>

<h2>Murders Show Evil Can Exist Anywhere</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
  
Just last week in Illinois, Jacqueline Williams was accused of ripping 
an unborn baby from his murdered mother's womb.
<p>
Barely had the gruesome details faded from the headlines when two more 
ghastly stories appeared in which women were suspects in the horrific 
murders of their own children.
<p>
In Olathe, Kan., a 44-year-old doctor, Debora Green, was charged with 
setting fire to her own home and killing two of her three children. 
Green also is suspected of attempting to poison her estranged husband 
earlier this year, although charges have yet to be filed.
<p>
In New York, a 29-year-old woman, Awilda Lopez, was arrested for 
killing her  6-year-old daughter by hitting her in the head with a 
blunt object. Police who investigated the crime said the child bore 
numerous scars from cigarette burns and bruises over her whole body.
<p>
Who are these monster-women?
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich blamed the Illinois murders, which 
included not only the dead mother but also two of her other children, 
on the welfare state.
<p>
Welfare policy has created "a drug-addicted underclass with no sense 
of humanity, no sense of civilization and no sense of the rules of 
life," Gingrich  told a Republican governors meeting shortly after the 
bizarre murders and kidnapping were reported.
<p>
If only it were as simple as that.
<p>
Yes, welfare policy has led to growing social pathology in this 
society. Welfare rewards people for not working, frees men from the 
financial responsibility for their children and encourages women to 
remain unwed if they become pregnant.
<p>
And certainly both the Illinois and New York murders took place in an 
underclass environment.
<p>
Although not all the details are yet known in the Williams case, drugs 
probably played some role. And Awilda Lopez, who was indicted Tuesday, 
was clearly involved in drugs: Her daughter was born addicted to crack 
cocaine.
<p>
Women who commit crimes are even more likely than men to be regular 
drug users: 65% of female prison inmates compared with 62% of males 
are regular drug  users, and 36% of women vs. 31% of men were using 
drugs when they committed the  crimes for which they are incarcerated.
<p>
But the problems go far deeper than drugs, welfare and the underclass.
<p>
Dr. Green is a wealthy, well-educated woman living in small-town 
America. Susan Smith, who was convicted earlier this year of drowning 
her two sons after  claiming they'd been kidnapped, also came from a 
respected, middle-class family.
<p>
What is so horrifyingly inexplicable about the murders of the Green 
and Smith children is that they don't seem to have been committed by 
women driven crazy by drugs or poverty.
<p>
These were coldblooded, calculated murders by women who seemed to lead 
ordinary, even privileged, lives. It's the very familiarity of these 
women's experiences that makes so chilling the evil they perpetrated.
<p>
Stories of women who murder their own children have shocked and 
fascinated us for thousands of years. No figure in Greek mythology 
invokes more dread or loathing than Medea, who killed her own children 
to punish their father, Jason,  for his infidelity.
<p>
In Euripedes' play of the same name, Medea is described by Jason as a 
"hateful thing, you woman most utterly loathed by the gods and me and 
all the race of mankind."
<p>
Last year 538 children in the United States were killed by their 
parents (compared with 308 parents killed by their own children).
<p>
The Justice Department doesn't publish statistics showing how many 
mothers vs. fathers killed their children, although it is difficult to 
imagine that murders by mothers constituted more than a small fraction 
of the total. Difficult to imagine because there is no more horrible 
or unnatural crime than a mother taking the life of her own child.
<p>
Sometimes no amount of analysis or explanation or blame shifting will 
allow us to avoid looking evil straight in the face - even when it 
belongs to a mother.
<p>
What is truly frightening about these recent murders is that they 
demonstrate that evil can exist anywhere, including where it seems 
most unlikely. And it is  more difficult to root out evil than to 
change public policy.
<p>

<h2>Don't Underestimate Taxpayers' Intelligence </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

 
As budget negotiations near the crisis stage again next week, expect 
Democrats to demagogue on taxes as they have for the past three years. 
Although President Clinton was elected with a promise to enact a 
middle-class tax cut, he instead raised taxes in 1993. And now he and 
Democrats in Congress want Republicans to scale back the $ 245 billion 
tax cut included in their congressional budget package.
<P>
Democrats believe the key to a balanced budget is higher tax revenues, 
which they think government can magically control by manipulating tax 
rates. The theory is simple enough: Tax the rich at higher rates and 
the government will take in more revenues, which can then be used to 
pay for all those expensive government programs Democrats favor. The 
problem is, it never seems to work out  quite as intended.
<P>
A new study by Harvard Professors Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg 
demonstrates why.
<P>
In 1993, the Clinton tax increase raised marginal tax rates from 31% 
to 36% on incomes between $ 140,000 and $ 250,000 and to 39.6% on 
incomes above $ 250,000. Those tax increases should have produced $ 
19.3 billion in extra revenues if the affected taxpayers had not 
changed their earnings behavior. Instead, the hefty tax hikes produced 
less than half the expected extra revenues - $ 8.4 billion.
<P>
Democrats assume taxpayers are a docile lot. Raise their taxes and 
they'll willingly fork over the extra money to the IRS. In fact, 
taxpayers - rich and not so rich - usually resist government efforts 
to take more of their money by changing their behavior. The rich, in 
particular, have lots of options to avoid  paying more to the IRS, 
including cutting back on their work effort. President Reagan was fond 
of describing his response to the confiscatory marginal tax rate of 
90% that prevailed when he was an actor. He simply quit working when 
he earned enough to put him in the highest bracket. It wasn't worth 
making that next dollar if he only got to keep 10 cents.
<P>
The study shows many wealthy Americans responded to the Clinton tax 
increases the same way. They may have worked less, taken more time 
off, bought more expensive homes with higher mortgages (shielding more 
income with higher home mortgage interest deductions), or given more 
to charity (producing higher charitable tax deductions). By whatever 
means, those in the highest brackets reduced their taxable incomes by 
an estimated 7.8%.
<P>
Some wealthy taxpayers - including Hillary Rodham Clinton - also 
avoided paying the higher 1993 taxes by shifting some of their 
expected 1993 income to 1992. Ordinary workers don't have that luxury, 
but executives, lawyers and other high-income earners sometimes do. 
They can exercise stock options or take some of their future income in 
current year bonuses if they anticipate tax increases  in future 
years. Mrs. Clinton sheltered some of her earnings by taking a year-
end bonus in 1992, thus avoiding paying the higher 1993 taxes.
<P>
It seems never to occur to Democratic politicians that many wealthy 
people got that way by being smart about money. Allow them to keep 
more of what they earn and they'll earn more, in the process creating 
jobs through their investment. But tax them excessively and they will 
figure out ways to keep Uncle Sam from getting a larger share of their 
money. Even Mrs. Clinton found a  way around the 1993 tax increase, 
temporarily putting aside Democratic ideology  when it affected her 
own pocketbook. Maybe it's time Democrats stopped underestimating the 
intelligence of U.S. taxpayers.

<h2>Call it A Miracle </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Call it a miracle - or perhaps just the triumph of tolerance and 
common sense - but there seems to be far less controversy over 
religious displays on public property this holiday season than in 
recent years. Both creches and menorahs are on display - albeit with 
some restrictions - despite the hostility of the ACLU and other groups 
opposed to such exhibits. 
 <P>
In a computer database search of newspaper articles from around the 
country, I found only 59 stories appearing since Dec. 1 that even 
mentioned Nativity displays, and most of these were announcements of 
holiday celebrations and events. 
 <P>
Admittedly, the ACLU did try to silence "Silent Night" and recordings 
of other Christian hymns piped into a government building in Chicago 
this year. But a federal court decided last week that the group was 
off base (as usual) in claiming  a few carols played over a 
government-owned loudspeaker system were an "establishment of 
religion" forbidden by the First Amendment. 
 <P>
Since 1984, when the Supreme Court handed down its first decision 
involving the display of religious symbols on public property, cities 
and towns have been debating just how far they can go in allowing 
Nativity scenes, menorahs, crosses and other symbols depicting 
important religious events. The court's rules - which seem to change 
each season - now permit religious symbols as part of state-sponsored 
displays so long as secular symbols are also included. And last June, 
the court expanded its interpretation, in effect saying jurisdictions 
couldn't interfere with the right of religious groups to put up 
whatever symbols they chose if the jurisdiction gave non-religious 
groups the right to erect secular, political or other non-religious 
displays on public property. Cities and towns now have the choice of 
saying no to everyone or no one. 
 <P>
Sometimes it's hard to remember that the holidays weren't always so 
complicated. Like most Americans over 40, I can remember when religion 
was at the heart of civic celebrations during Christmas. Denver, where 
I grew up, was well known for its wonderful public and private 
Christmas displays. My father always arranged a special family outing 
for the occasion. He piled everyone into the car for an excursion that 
took us throughout the city. First, we headed downtown to 16th Street, 
where the streets and stores were decked out in ornaments and tinsel, 
then to the Civic Center, where the exhibit proclaiming "Joy to the 
World" and "Peace on Earth" lit up the December sky and filled the air 
with music. We usually ended our tour in the east Denver neighborhoods 
best known for their elaborately decorated homes, many with mangers 
and Wise Men adorning the front lawns. 
 <P>
It was on this part of the trip that I first learned about Hanukkah. 
Through some windows, I could see what appeared to be candelabra with 
only a few candles asymmetrically lit. I thought perhaps they were 
special Christmas lights, like the "luminarias" that decorated my 
native New Mexico. But my father explained to me that these were 
Jewish homes celebrating a different holiday altogether - Hanukkah. 
Later I learned that the holiday commemorates the rededication of the 
Temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. after the Maccabees' victory over the 
Syrians. 
 <P>
Today children in many cities can learn about the Hanukkah traditions 
in public displays. Members of the Lubavitch community of Hasidic Jews 
erect large outdoor menorahs in parks and other public places across 
the country. 
 <P>
Americans are among the most religious people in the world. The 
radical separationists - who believe the First Amendment requires that 
religion be driven from civic life - are fighting a losing battle. 
America was founded on the freedom of, not from, religion. And there 
is no better way to celebrate that freedom than to welcome all 
religions back into the public square this holiday season.

<h2>GOP Congress: '95 Something to Crow About</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Is the Republican revolution about to fizzle barely one year 
after it began? 
<P>
The Congress has produced no significant legislation. Extremists 
dominate the freshman class in the House. Republicans want to put poor 
children out on the streets and deprive elderly sick people of medical 
care in order to give tax breaks to the rich. The magnificent 
machinery of government has ground to a halt, not once but twice in as 
many months, causing chaos for millions of Americans. And the public 
has had enough. At least that's what the Clinton administration wants 
you to think - and the media has obligingly conveyed the message.
<P>
But before the Clintons order their favorite Arkansas champagne for 
the 1997 inaugural and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt picks out 
new drapes for the Speaker's office, perhaps it's time to take a 
closer look at just what did happen in 1995.
<P>
The Congress of the United States actually produced a 3,000-page, 
detailed bill that will balance the budget in seven years.
<P>
Sure, the president vetoed it, but the feat is historic nonetheless. 
The Democrats couldn't come close to offering a balanced budget in 
their years at the helm - even when they controlled both the 
legislative and executive branches, as they did in the Clinton 
administration's first two years.
<P>
Republicans have taken on the first major entitlement programs - 
Medicare and Medicaid - putting principle before politics. For years, 
Republicans have been going after the small potatoes entitlements, 
such as AFDC and food stamps. These programs, while unpopular, make up 
only a small fraction of the federal budget, roughly 3%.
<P>
The really big money entitlements are Social Security and Medicare, 
which go mostly to the middle class, and Medicaid, which goes to the 
poor. These items account for more than one third of the entire 
federal budget.
<P>
Democrats have never been willing to even try to rein in these 
entitlements. But this year Republicans have risked their own re-
election in order to stop burying future generations in debt. For this 
Republicans - and especially the 73 House freshmen - have been labeled 
"extremists," not only by the president but by much of the media.
<P>
Republicans have permanently altered the terms of the debate on 
welfare. Even Democrats sound hardline about ending welfare dependency 
these days. No one argues for welfare rights' or defends welfare 
recipients who stay on the rolls year after year. And virtually 
everyone now agrees that the War on Poverty failed, not for lack of 
funds after more than $ 5 trillion spent in three decades, but because 
the programs themselves were misguided.
<P>
Democrats still cling to the demonstrably erroneous notion that 
expensive government training programs are necessary to get recipients 
off welfare and into jobs.      But when the president finally signs 
welfare reform legislation - as he must soon or face the consequences 
at the polls next year - it will bear a decidedly Republican stamp, 
devolving responsibility back to the states and giving states more 
leeway to limit dependency and discourage illegitimacy.
<P>
Republicans forced Congress to live by the same rules it cavalierly 
mandated for others and to stop accepting gifts and entertainment from 
lobbyists.
<P>
For years when Democrats controlled both Houses, Congress exempted 
itself from laws it insisted other employers obey: civil rights laws, 
health and safety laws, labor relations laws. In recent years, 
Republicans began drawing attention to this Democrat hypocrisy by 
offering amendments to make Congress subject to the same laws it 
applied to others - to no avail.
<P>
Republicans won their battle only when they won control of Congress. 
Suddenly even Democrats decided maybe no one should be above the law - 
not even Congress, now that they no longer controlled it.
<P>
The same thing happened with lobby reform. Democrats had no interest 
in lobby reform when they occupied the powerful committee 
chairmanships. But once they became backbenchers they were more than 
happy to jump on the Republican freshmen's lobby reform bandwagon.      
These Republicans accomplishments may not yet constitute a revolution. 
But they add up to the most significant legislative reforms in a 
decade - not bad for one year's effort.  
<P>

<title>du Pont:   Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts  -- 1/16/96
</title>

<center><i>January 16, 1996</i><hr>

<h2>
Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
"Fair is foul, and foul is fair." 
<P> 
Thus incant the three "weird sisters" usually referred to as witches - 
at the outset of Shakespeare's "MacBeth", as they set forth the 
proposition that what is good will be made bad and what is bad will be 
made good. 
 <P>
In like manner, three nationally syndicated columnists - Joan Beck, 
Molly Ivins and Jane Bryant Quinn - have recently stirred the pot, 
proclaiming a fair health care reform proposal foul and a foul one 
fair. 
 <P>
All three columnists attack the idea of Medical Savings Accounts 
(MSAs), particularly the Republican proposal to provide Medicare 
beneficiaries with an MSA option. 
 <P>
Currently, most people get their health insurance either through their 
employer, or from the federal government through Medicare and 
Medicaid.  In the past, most employers offered a health insurance 
policy with a deductible up front, and then people had to pay, say, 
20% of their medical bills up to a maximum amount. Increasingly, 
companies are moving to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or 
other types of managed care. 
 <P>
An MSA permits a third option.  A person may take the same money that 
is currently spent on that low-deductible policy or HMO and purchase a 
less-expensive, high-deductible health insurance policy, say, with a 
$3,000 deductible.  The money that is saved by purchasing that less 
expensive policy is then deposited by the employer in a Medical 
Savings Account and can be used during the year to pay smaller health 
care bills. Any unspent money in the account at the end of the year 
can be withdrawn or rolled over and grow with interest to be used for 
health care in the future. 
 <P>
In attacking MSAs, the three columnists quickly assert that fair is 
foul.  Joan Beck claims that "the idea of Medical Savings Accounts is 
largely an untried idea." 
 <P>
Not true.  Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), testifying recently before 
the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, said that there are some 
3,000 U.S. businesses that have adopted some form of MSA.  Abroad, in 
1984 the country of Singapore adopted a "Medisave" program  
as the primary means of paying for health care. Today, Singaporeans 
have access to the same technology as most European countries, with 
hospital stays equaling those of aggressive managed care firms in the 
U.S., but they are only spending 3.1% of their GDP (compared to about 
14% in the U.S.). 
 <P>
Jane Bryant Quinn thinks that only healthy and wealthy people would 
want an MSA, but   during the same congressional hearing, everyone 
testifying -- some of whom had implemented MSA plans for their own 
employees -- found that both the healthy and sick benefited 
financially from the plans.  The healthy benefited because they got to 
keep the unspent MSA balance at the end of the year, and the sick 
because they spent less money out of pocket, since their exposure was 
limited to the MSA amount.  Insurance paid 100% of the rest.  
 <P>
Molly Ivins thinks that Republican support of MSAs is the result of 
recent lobbying by special interest insurance companies looking to 
make money off selling the MSA plans.  But the MSA idea goes back to 
the mid-1980s; several think tanks and congressmen -- including those 
now in the Republican leadership -- have supported the idea for years.  
Further, most large insurance companies have opposed all MSA 
legislation for the very reason that it would encourage individuals to 
retain some of the money they had been giving to the insurance 
companies.  (As in "MacBeth", you know the world is topsy-turvy when 
Molly Ivins would rather people give their money to insurance 
companies than keep it themselves.) 
 <P>
All of the above columnists also think that foul is fair -- that MSAs 
would undermine the Medicare system.  Surely a system that is by 
everyone's count going bankrupt in seven years is already undermined.  
Medicare has been plagued with exploding costs and suffocating 
regulations for years. 
 <P>
MSAs are simply not a radical idea.  Indeed, most self-employed 
individuals who purchase a health insurance policy on their own -- and 
thus don't perceive the employer or government as providing a health 
insurance policy free -- usually choose a high-deductible policy and 
pay for smaller medical expenditures out of pocket.  All an MSA does 
is provide individuals or their employers with the opportunity -- not 
a requirement -- to put a limited amount of tax-free money in an 
account to pay those smaller medical bills. 
 <P>
Congressional Republicans are trying to fix and preserve Medicare by 
providing senior citizens with private sector options such as MSAs.  
By contrast, these columnists criticize the plan as threatening to an 
already bankrupt system.   
 <P>
Their solution is to stir the pot and chant:  "Double double toil and 
trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."  It may be good theater, and 
even good liberal politics, but it won't help Americans get better 
health care.

<h2>Time For A New Tax System</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
The objective of the Tax Reform Commission appointed by Speaker 
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole was, in the words of its chairman, 
Jack Kemp, "to tear apart the whole tax code...and draft...a dramatic 
reform." 
 <P>
As a member of the Commission, I believe the report we issued on 
January 17th completed this mission. 
 <P>
The tax code as it exists today is unjust and unfair. Its definitions 
are complex, its regulations often incomprehensible, and its 
enforcement ranges from lax to nasty.  It is a politicized method of 
unequally extracting income from people who have earned it and 
transferring it to people who haven't, but who the politicians in 
Congress think have a superior claim to it.  Sugar and ethanol 
producers, drug addicts who need federal dollars to support their 
habits, and pornographic arts programs come to mind. Congress simply 
uses the code to reward its friends, punish its enemies, and - of 
course - to get itself re-elected. 
 <P>
The income tax takes as much as 40% of what we earn each year, and 
half of anything left over when we die - the family farm, the small 
business we have built, or the savings we have worked so hard to 
accumulate.  Compliance takes 5.4 billion hours of our time, and if we 
disagree with the IRS, the burden of proof is on us - we are guilty 
until we prove ourselves innocent.  The IRS can search our property 
without a warrant and seize our assets without a trial. 
 <P>
One of the brutal byproducts of the tax code is stagnating incomes for 
individuals but galloping revenues for government.  Between 1973 and 
1993 annual income growth for middle class and low-income wage earners 
has remained flat.  In roughly the same period (1973-1995) government 
"take home pay" has increased 58% in real terms.  Family earnings have 
not risen, while the government's have increased 58%.  There's 
fairness for you. 
 <P>
The members of the Tax Reform Commission believe it is time to repeal 
this whole sorry mess and begin again.  A new tax system proposed by 
the Commission would be based upon three principles. 
 <P>
First, a generous personal exemption.  The Commission did not set a 
number, but for discussion  let's use $7,500 ($30,000 for a family of 
four) on which no income tax at all would be due. 
 <P>
Second, earnings above that amount would be taxed at a uniform, low 
rate, say, 19%.  (again, my hypothetical rate, not the Commission's.)  
All taxpayers would pay the same rate of tax, which is not only fair 
but presumably what the Constitution means by "equal protection of the 
laws."  The rate could only be increased by a two-thirds supermajority 
vote of each House of Congress. 
 <P>
Such a tax system would be progressive.  As the table shows, with a 
19% rate, the wealthy family of four would pay a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than a middle-income family. 
 <P>
<pre>
	Income        	Taxable Income     Tax Due      Tax As a % of Income 
	$ 30,000           	$0               			0                   		0 
	45,000            	15,000        			2,850                 6.3% 
	60,000            	30,000        			5,700                 9.5% 
	120,000            	90,000       			17,100                14.3% 
 </pre>

<P>
The Commission's third principle is that income should be taxed only 
once.  This would make the employee's half of Social Security taxes 
deductible and eliminate the double taxation of investment income.  It 
would also eliminate death taxes and the alternative minimum tax. 
 <P>
The adoption of such a progressive, uniform tax rate system would 
cause an explosion of growth in the American economy, creating 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars of take-home pay.  The 
Hall-Rabushka flat-tax proposal was estimated to increase economic 
growth a full percentage point per year.  Although that increase may 
seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of the economy 
translates into 6 million jobs and two trillion dollars in real 
economic productivity over 8 years.  It would also increase government 
tax revenue by nearly $700 billion. 
 <P>
By discouraging investment, innovation, and the taking of risk, the 
current tax code is restraining the U.S. economy's growth rate to 
about 2.5% per year.  With a progressive flat tax, the economy could 
be growing 4%, or perhaps more, which would bring real increases in 
their quality of life to tens of millions of American families. 
 <P>
That is the goal of the Tax Reform Commission's proposal:  to increase 
jobs, growth, income, and the quality of life.  With our current tax 
code, these things are impossible.  With a progressive flat tax, they 
can be achieved.

<h2>The 1996 Election:  A Choice of Visions</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>  
 <p>

The football season and the State of the Union message are behind us.  
In another few weeks the election of 1996 will be upon us.  In these 
few days of calm before the Iowa caucus, we need to reflect upon the 
social and political transitions of our times and how they impact the 
November elections. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We live in a society that is being transformed by forces largely 
outside of our control.  We are caught in a transition from the old 
industrial, hierarchical, mass production society to the individualism 
of an Information Age. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, it is not our nation's first transition.  Historians tell 
us that there have been three American Republics.  The first stretched 
from the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 to the Civil War.  We 
might call that the Age of Federalism, a time of decentralized 
government power with a strong emphasis on individual responsibility. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Second Republic lasted until the Great Depression of the 1930s.  
It was a time of growing federal power and involvement in our lives.  
We might call it the Age of Government Expansion.  
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Third Republic was the political, governmental and social 
transformation created by the New Deal.  This one's easy to tag:  it 
was the Age of the Welfare State. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beginning of the end of the New Deal era came with the election of 
Ronald Reagan in 1980.  But the actual end of liberalism came 14 years 
later -- after the collapse of communism as an organizing principle of 
society - when control of the U.S. House of Representatives passed 
into conservative hands. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the words of MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch:  "Statism has had its 
time on the stage.  Pervasive regulation, public-sector enterprises, a 
bloated welfare state with crushing tax burdens of those who work - 
and absurd levels of subsidies for those who don't - have failed as 
effective alternatives to decentralized decision-making...." 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the election of 1996 is not about Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, the 
elimination of the Commerce Department, or Haiti, Hooters or hand-gun 
control.  The election of 1996 is about a choice of visions to guide 
us in the Fourth Republic. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First is the choice between collective and individual decision-making.  
Will the government make decisions for you, or will you make your own 
decisions?  The resolution of this conflict will determine whether you 
or the government will invest your retirement savings, whether you or 
the  
government will decide which school your child attends, whether you or 
the government will decide which doctor you see. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare statist says it is better that government make these 
decisions for us; the advocates of liberty believe we are capable of 
making them for ourselves. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second choice is whether equality or freedom will be the core of 
our vision.  The liberal vision worries that if people are allowed to 
be free, they will become unequal, and that will be unfair.  So 
government must count outcomes by race, hue, gender, age, sexual 
preference, etc., and then enforce remedial policies to make sure that 
no group gains relative to any other. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conservative vision, by contrast, recognizes that whenever 
equality has been the driving force, freedom has been the first 
casualty.  The advocates of liberty believe the individual should be 
free to go as far as his or her efforts, talents and energy will 
allow, regardless of race, color or creed. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is the choice of whether the state or the individual 
should be held responsible for moral conduct and the spiritual 
dimension of our lives.  The liberal vision sees the state as the 
repository of virtue and therefore responsible for morality.  When 
something goes wrong it is the fault of the state, not the individual, 
so the state must act.  Conversely, the conservative vision sees the 
individual as responsible for his or her own actions, and the sum of 
these actions sets society's moral course. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any transition the challenge for political leaders is not to stop 
it - they cannot - but to advance a vision for that transformation 
compatible with our constitutional traditions of liberty, justice, and 
limited government. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton's vision reflects the faith in government of the 
Third Republic.  His veto pen has struck down a balanced budget and a 
reform of welfare as we know it.  His top domestic priority is to 
ensure that the government is "never, ever" shut down again. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by its very nature an accelerating flow of information is 
decentralizing, increasing individual power and choices.  It will 
transform not only our lives, but our government as well.  The 
conservative vision, anchored in the liberty established by the 
Founding Fathers in the First Republic, is the only one compatible 
with the individualism demanded by an information society. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing between these competing visions for the Fourth Republic is 
what the 1996 election is all about.

<h2>The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont
</a>

<P>  
Sixteen months into the conservative revolution that swept the field 
in the 1994 elections, the liberals are winning the war. They lost the 
battle at the polls but they are winning the war in the trenches of 
the Congress and the sound bites of the evening news. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason is that the argument in Washington - and thus on the 
television - has been about the deficit and the cruel spending cuts 
the Republicans have enacted to reduce it.  When the Republicans 
propose reducing the rate of increase in spending for program A from 
9% per year to 7% (when the annual inflation rate is less than 3%), 
President Clinton brands them harsh and heartless. In due course 
people across America begin to believe it, and then such a modest 
reduction in future growth is thought to be "extreme," and "going too 
far too fast." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans shouldn't be surprised, for it comes with the territory. 
Being portrayed as mean spirited is the price to be paid for becoming 
the Green Eyeshade political party - that is, paying more attention to 
bookkeeping than to vision. When balancing the budget becomes your 
goal, and budget scoring becomes your god, you lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Once upon a time the Republicans were the party of growth.  Ronald 
Reagan ran and won on a program of 30% income tax rate cuts. It 
worked.  Eighteen million net new jobs were added to the economy, 
economic growth rates averaged nearly 4% per year after the tax rates 
kicked in, and federal tax revenues rose by 26% during President 
Reagan's two terms. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A growth policy would work again.  There is no way to reduce the 
deficit more efficiently and more painlessly than with a higher rate 
of economic growth.  And there is no way of reducing the need for 
welfare spending more rapidly and more permanently than by achieving 
higher incomes for everyone. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing 
the growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic 
growth is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases 
take home pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax 
receipts. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Such a policy should begin with enactment of the core pro-growth tax 
reduction programs of the Contract With America. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Cutting and indexing the capital gains tax would quickly stimulate 
growth by unlocking billions of dollars of assets. Expanding the use 
of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and repealing the Social 
Security benefits tax would increase growth, too.  Raising the amount 
that retirees can earn without loss of benefits would expand the 
supply of elderly workers, help employers meet their demands for 
skilled labor over the next decade and increase federal revenue. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Second, instead of pursuing deficit reduction as the primary goal of 
economic policy, Republicans should advocate a policy of aggressive 
deregulation to encourage economic growth.  Free farmers from acreage 
restrictions so they can grow more crops while phasing out subsidies, 
thus reducing spending. Deregulate communications to unleash high-tech 
growth.  Replace welfare programs with work to increase labor output 
at the lower end of the economic scale.  Allow parents to choose the 
best schools for their children to spur long range economic growth by 
improving the skills of the workforce.  Begin the transfer of 
retirement saving from the Social Security system to individually 
owned marketplace IRAs. They would grow both the retirement income of 
older Americans and the savings pool of the nation to fuel even more 
prosperity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Finally, pick up on the growth ideas of the Tax Reform Commission: 
repeal the existing tax code and replace it with a single-rate, 
progressive flat tax. The resulting  explosion of growth would create 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars in increased personal 
income.  The Hall-Rabuska flat tax proposal was estimated to increase 
economic growth a full percentage point per year. Although that 
increase may seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of 
the economy translates into six million jobs and two trillion dollars 
in real economic productivity over eight years.  It would also 
increase government tax revenue by nearly $700 billion, allowing 
Republicans spooked by the deficit to reduce it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
That is an economic program worth expending political blood and 
treasure to enact.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Let the liberals take the other side - that the tax reductions are 
growing the economy too fast, creating too many jobs, and giving 
people too much freedom and too much money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans can reply that Democratic proposals to reduce the economic 
growth rate from 4% to 3.5% are cruel and heartless. The evening news 
will be filled with shots of disappointed men and women who had been 
counting on putting a new roof on the house or their daughter through 
college. Congressional Budget Office scorers could be furloughed as 
non-essential employees.  And the deficit would go down.  And who 
knows, even the Green Eyeshade Republicans might be happy.

<title>du Pont: Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea  -- 2/8/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
<i>Congress may soon make Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) the law of the 
land.  And even labor unions like the idea.   </i>
 

<P>
Medical Savings Accounts give people the opportunity to move from a 
conventional, low-deductible health insurance plan to one with a high 
deductible (say $2,000 to $3,000) and to put the premium savings in a 
medical  savings account.  Employees and their families pay all 
medical bills up to the deductible from their MSAs and out-of-pocket.  
Insurance then covers 100% of everything else. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political battle for MSAs has been long and hard, but even when 
the political battle is over, the fighting will continue.  That's 
because the real issue behind the MSA debate is who will control our 
health care dollars.  MSA supporters want individuals to control more 
of their health care dollars;  MSA opponents want someone other than 
the patient - a manager, "gatekeeper" or bureaucrat - to control those 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is becoming the ultimate in populist vs. elitist battles, and 
nowhere is that more evident than in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a 
suburb of Philadelphia. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
During 1995 contract negotiations between teachers at the Bucks County 
Technical School and officials of the Bucks County School Board, the 
issue of the high cost of health care became a topic for discussion.  
Members of the Bucks County Technical School  teachers union  had 
recently heard of Medical Savings Accounts and thought that by 
shifting to an MSA plan, both the teachers and the administration 
could benefit.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They learned that some 3,000 businesses have adopted some form of MSA 
plan.  The apparently universal experience is that MSA plans reduce 
employers' health insurance expenditures over time and permit 
employees to benefit financially by managing their health care dollars 
wisely.  A win-win situation for everyone involved. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ed Moffit, who teaches air-conditioning and refrigeration technology 
for the school and is president of the teachers' union, optimistically 
presented the idea to the Board.  After all, the money employees spend 
for health insurance ultimately belongs to the employee.  He thought 
the Board would be delighted that a union was proposing a free-market 
solution to their health care dilemma.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He was wrong. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Board's solution to restraining health care spending was to move 
the teachers out of their fee-for-service policy and into a managed 
care plan, lowering the Board's cost and pocketing the difference.  
Unwilling to let a managed care plan make choices for them, union 
members opposed the school's solution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The battle thickened.  Moffit and the union publicly asked the school 
Board to release information about the union members' health care 
costs.  Finally it did, and now pressure is building for MSAs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What the Bucks County Technical School Education Association has 
learned is what union members and employees across the country are 
learning - MSAs make sense.  For example:  
<BR> 
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, the United Mine Workers adopted an MSA-type proposal by 
providing members with a $1,000 deductible policy and writing them a 
check for $1,000 at the beginning of the year. 
<br>
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;City employees in  Jersey City, New Jersey, get an $1,800 MSA 
contribution to a family plan and a $2,000 deductible - and the 
average MSA refund was about $1,000 at the end of the first year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Union members often have the most comprehensive health insurance plans 
in the country, often costing well above the national average of about 
$5,000 for a family plan.  As a result, union members who choose a 
less expensive catastrophic plan can have a significant amount of 
money left over to deposit in their MSA, and most would have a nice 
bonus waiting for them at the end of the year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But as the Bucks County experience makes clear, management often 
mistakenly  thinks it knows best.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For example, in recent testimony before Congress, John N. Sturdivant, 
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, 
which represents 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees, 
declared that "people are willing to accept limitations on their 
choice of providers in exchange for more comprehensive benefits and 
lower out-of-pocket costs."  Translation: Mr. Sturdivant wants your 
choices limited if it will save a little money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And, he added, "Under MSAs . . .consumers would delay treatment until 
it was absolutely necessary."  Translation: You can't be trusted with 
the money because you're too stupid to make good health care decisions 
for yourself.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Condescension, whether practiced by management or union leaders, is a 
poor substitute for individual empowerment.  There is no reason to 
think that the Bucks County School Board or John Sturdivant or anyone 
else besides you and your physician should make decisions about your 
health care.  Medical Savings Accounts will give you that opportunity.

<title>du Pont: Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found In Alaska -- 3/7/96</title>

<h2>
Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found Gold In Alaska
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>

Pat Buchanan is running hard and strong, perplexing all the pundits in 
the process.  His issues, mostly trade, immigration and abortion, 
appear to be resonating with a sizable block of voters.  But, there's 
a broader message here - Pat is tapping into a rich vein of distrust 
and disgust with the national government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Consider the first caucus he won, in what would have seemed the 
unlikely jurisdiction of Alaska.  Unlikely, that is, until we consider 
Alaska's treatment at the hands of the federal government during its 
almost four decades of statehood.  It's a treatment that makes the 
state fertile ground for a candidate seeking to harvest people's 
growing frustrations with the intrusiveness of Washington. 
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In 1958, the citizens of the Alaskan territory voted by a margin of 
more than 5 to 1 to accept Washington's offer of statehood. The 
proclamation signed by President Eisenhower on January 3, 1959 made 
Alaska our 49th state, guaranteeing it "equal footing" with the other 
48 states. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, that's not the way it turned out.  Instead, Alaskans have 
witnessed one attempt after another - some successful, some not - on 
the part of the federal government to change elements of the original 
statehood "contract." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As part of Alaska's statehood, it was agreed that the federal 
government would be entitled to 10% of any oil revenues arising from 
federal lands.  Yet, in 1964, the federal government unsuccessfully 
tried to increase its share to 75% of oil revenues from the Kenai 
Peninsula. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While it was always expected that the federal government would own and 
manage vast acreage within their state, many Alaskans no doubt felt 
shocked and betrayed in 1980, when President Carter signed the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Act.  The Act gave to the federal government 
much of the state's most valuable acreage, or acreage that blocked 
usage of valuable acreage in private and state hands. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Commonwealth North, a group of prominent Alaskans, notes the federal 
intrusiveness that arises from the large size and unfortunate (from 
Alaska's viewpoint) placement of federal land ownership within Alaska, 
noting there are actually 54 different ruling "governors" that have a 
say over land usage.  These include park superintendents, wildlife 
refuge superintendents, etc. that rule over different federal land 
units within Alaska.  Sadly for Alaska's citizens, these authorities 
are appointed in Washington, and have no reason to answer to the 
people of Alaska.  Predictably, their rule can be capricious and 
inconsistent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The prohibitions against developing some federal land, or even using 
it to get from private or state-owned land to deep water ports and 
other elements of business infrastructure, make it impossible to 
accomplish much economic development.  This especially hurts Alaska's 
attempts to shift its economy away from its dependence on oil. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, even when Alaskans can work with the land, their hands are often 
tied.  For example, the natural markets for oil extracted from 
Alaska's North Slope would be nations on the Pacific Rim, including 
Japan.  Yet, until very recently, federal law prohibited Alaska from 
exporting this oil to Japan, which resulted in Alaskan oil passing 
through the Panama Canal on the way to a Gulf port, while oil from 
Mexico headed in the other direction on its way to the Pacific Rim. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Washington's attempts at environmental micro-management  have also 
severely impacted Alaska.  74% of Alaska's non-mountainous land area 
falls under the definition of wetlands, and so is managed in 
Washington.  So are fisheries and timber.  Alaska's everyday life is a 
series of David and Goliath-like clashes with a distant national 
government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Our federal government seems to have broken its promises to Alaska - 
to have told its biggest lies to our biggest state.  Since statehood, 
Alaska has suffered from laws that were passed and administered by 
people sitting in Washington, people who were either unaware, or 
didn't care, how those laws would affect the people in Alaska.  And, 
this has been done with the usual Washington arrogance that it knows 
better than the people of Alaska what is good for them and their 
state.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
No wonder Pat Buchanan won the Alaska caucuses.  And, while it remains 
to be seen if his win was the first step toward the presidential 
nomination, or just the start of a good month that ended after New 
Hampshire, there is one real concern that we should address.  If 
Washington treats Alaska, a state that sits 5000 miles away and is 
primarily wilderness, so shabbily, just think what it's doing to the 
rest of us.

<h2>
Reviving The Growth Agenda
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>

<P>
The campaigns of Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan resonated with voters 
this primary season  because they were the only two candidates running 
who directly addressed the problem of economic growth.  Inside the 
Beltway everything seems fine - and why not?  Bill Clinton has created 
lots of employment for policy wonks, with his everchanging agenda of 
plans to nationalize health care, raise taxes, and pay people to 
become "volunteers."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But out in the real world things are not so rosy. The latest 
government data confirm what voters see: the economy is flat;  there 
is little economic growth.  In the fourth quarter, real GDP grew less 
than 1 percent.  In all of 1995 the economy only grew about 2 percent 
- down sharply from the 3.5 percent rate registered in 1994.  In fact, 
during the three years of Clinton's presidency, growth has only 
averaged about 2.6 percent per year.  The Clinton Administration would 
have us believe that two and a half percent annual growth is fine, 
maybe the best we can do.  In fact, the administration warns against 
efforts to raise the growth rate because it would be inflationary.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not so long ago we did a lot better.  Real  growth averaged 3.4 
percent per year for eight years of the Reagan administration - 
including the effects of a deep recession.  If we leave out the 
recession and look only at the last six years of the Reagan 
Administration, real GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent per year.  And 
this was accomplished while inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 1980 
to just 1.1 percent in 1986.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So the lesson of the 1980s is that it is possible to have faster 
growth - well above the two and a half percent rate that Clinton's 
economists tell us is the best we can do - without inflation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How did Reagan do it?  He did it by reducing the burden of government.  
Taxes were cut, the growth of spending was scaled back, and the burden 
of regulation was slashed.  Taxes fell from 19.6 percent of GDP in 
1980 to 18.9 percent in 1988.  Outlays fell from 22.3 percent to 22.1 
percent over the same period.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But perhaps even more important was Reagan's assault on federal 
regulation.  According to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester 
Institute of Technology, the cost of federal regulation fell from 11.3 
percent of GDP in 1980 to 8.1 percent in 1988.  In other words, the 
reduction in the burden of regulation during the Reagan years was far 
greater than the reduction in the fiscal burden.  Since 1988, 
unfortunately, the burden of regulation has risen again and is now 
back to 9 percent of GDP, according to Prof. Hopkins.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why are Republicans so reluctant to defend the overwhelming 
economic success of the Reagan years?  Many have bought the liberal 
line that growth was bought "on credit" with higher deficits, and that 
Reagan's tax cuts were a giveaway to the rich that only increased 
income inequality.  This started with President Bush, who always 
seemed somewhat embarrassed by Reagan - it is hard to know how else to 
interpret the "kinder and gentler" line in his inaugural address. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The consequence is, as economist Paul Craig Roberts points out, that 
Republicans have handicapped themselves in addressing the growth issue 
because they neither understand the Reagan record nor are willing to 
defend it with enthusiasm.  Moderate Republicans have become so 
obsessed with the budget deficit that they are incapable of looking at 
tax cuts except as a loss of revenue. In spite of the Reagan growth 
record, lower taxes only  equal higher deficits in their limited, 
accountant's mentality.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be sure, the House and Senate have voted to cut the capital gains 
tax and scale back regulation.  But at the first sign of resistance 
from the Clinton Administration, Republicans  backed off.  Apparently, 
in their heart of hearts, many agree that cutting the capital gains 
tax only enriches the rich, and that more government regulation is 
necessary to protect the environment, schools, and various economic 
constituencies.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Into this self-created Republican vacuum stepped Pat Buchanan and 
Steve Forbes.  Buchanan's message of isolation and trade protection  
is a false vision, and a counterproductive approach to economic 
malaise.  But Pat offered solutions, and  it is a political fact of 
life that even bad ideas will beat no ideas every time.  Steve's ideas 
of hope, growth, and opportunity were much stronger, and offer a way 
out of the current Republican malaise.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing the economy - creating jobs, new businesses and opportunities 
- is neither impossible nor dangerous.  President Kennedy did it with 
tax cuts.  President Reagan did it with tax cuts, slower spending 
growth, and deregulation.   It worked twice and it will work again - 
if Republicans will just do it.

<html><head><title>du Pont: The Failure of Protectionism -- 4/04/96
 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>Thursday, April 4, 1996 </i><h2> The Failure of Protectionism 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont </a><P>

 

 
The Great Wall of China dates from the Ming dynasty (1368-
1644), but successive invasions from the North proved that 
it had no more military utility than the "impregnable" 
Maginot Line did for the French in 1940.  Gunpowder and 
artillery long ago had rendered castle walls useless too.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure of walls to provide military security has not 
discouraged a tough-talking Pat Buchanan from centering his 
presidential campaign around trade walls to enhance our 
economic security.  Unfortunately, economic walls make no 
more sense in the modern world than do castle walls for 
military protection.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Logic rejects protectionism, for a wider choice of goods at 
varying  prices benefits consumers.  Experience has backed 
up the logic.  The 1930s, of course, are exhibit A.  To save 
jobs, two Republicans, Representative Willis C. Hawley of 
Oregon and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah, crafted a bill to 
raise a massive tax wall around the U.S. economy.  Signed 
into law in 1930 by another Republican, President Herbert C. 
Hoover, foreign trade plummeted, handsomely aided by the 
retaliatory tax burdens erected by other governments.  The 
ensuing mass unemployment and desperation throughout the 
industrial world led to dictators and semi-dictators, who, 
in turn, took the steps from trade war to actual war.  
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Learning this lesson, 1945's victorious allies were 
determined to work to reduce tariffs and eliminate other 
barriers to international cooperation.  The much-denounced 
GATT, or General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, was the 
primary means chosen to promote open international trade.  
To be sure, multilateral agreements have blemishes and raise 
sovereignty issues, but there is no gain saying that GATT has 
worked.  World trade has been kept relatively open and now 
tops $4 trillion per year in merchandise alone, not to 
mention an enormous daily volume in services, investments 
and financial transactions across national borders.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not that economic logic and facts are likely to deter a 
bellicose Pat Buchanan.  It is easy to arouse tribal 
resentment, but a wall around U.S. business is the last way 
in the world to appease Americans' longing for a better 
life.  Protecting companies from competition will not make 
us rich.  On the contrary, open trading, both foreign and 
domestic, is the key to wealth.  We should make trade 
easier, not harder.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protection may work in a distorted way in the short run, 
holding a few visible jobs in companies that would otherwise 
"rightsize" or disappear.  But it cannot work in the long 
run to boost jobs and wages.  Protectionism rewards the 
inefficient and penalizes the efficient.  As economist 
Ludwig von Mises put it, "The history of mankind is a long 
record of obstacles placed in the way of the more efficient 
for the benefit of the less efficient."  A few politically 
visible jobs are protected by interference at the cost of 
many better-paying jobs destroyed elsewhere. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the longer run, government protection fails to create 
jobs and prosperity in the most protected industries.  Take 
the maritime industry, for example.  Once a great seafaring 
nation, the United States became much less competitive 
during the 20th century.  Heavily subsidized and unionized, 
our domestic maritime trade is completely reserved to 
American-built, American-owned and American-crewed vessels.  
The consequence has been high-priced monopoly service 
between U.S. ports, costing consumers higher prices for 
goods and, yes, costing U.S. sailors their jobs. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How has the maritime industry fared under its 75-year 
protected monopoly created by the Jones Act of 1920?   In 
1950, the U.S. flag fleet consisted of a thousand ships; a 
half-century of subsidy later, there are less than 200.  In 
1950, U.S. flag vessels carried 43% of America's foreign 
trade; today they carry less than 4%.  In 1950, 57,000 
Americans had jobs in our merchant fleet; today less than 
9,000 go  to sea in U.S. flag ships.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A 1991 International Trade Commission study put the 
inefficiency costs of the Jones Act at $3.6 billion to $9.8 
billion annually. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protectionism simply cannot work.  Technologies and 
industries rise and fall, expand and contract, come and go.  
The reasons are diverse but foreign competition is  one of 
the minor factors in our huge, global-size economy.  
Economic change is an asset, not a liability, as new 
technologies and cost reductions bring wider consumer 
choice.  We have nothing to fear from better or cheaper 
foreign products.    
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Centuries ago, the English King Canute stood at the water's 
edge and forbade the tide to come in.  He was no more 
successful than America can be in trying to keep out foreign 
goods and services in the age of the Internet and global 
economics.  The daily ebb and flow of the tides is central 
to global ecology, just as trade is to a global economy.

<h2>   
The Forbes Legacy   
 </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>


One great strength of the American political system - and one that no   
doubt baffles foreigners - is the way it brings people who are enemies   
one day  together as allies the next.  Just recently we saw Phil   
Gramm,  Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes attacking Bob Dole in  Iowa   
and New Hampshire. But just a  few weeks later, Gramm, Alexander and   
Forbes all dropped out of the race and endorsed him.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The flip side of this phenomenon is that Dole has suddenly  found   
merit in ideas put forward by his previous opponents.  Just a few   
short weeks ago, on March 4, Dole had  nothing good to say about the   
Forbes flat tax.  While campaigning in New York in advance of that   
state's primary, Dole strenuously  attacked the flat tax for   
eliminating deductions for mortgage  interest and charitable   
deductions, and for increasing the deficit. But now, Dole has   
apparently decided that the flat tax is not  a bad idea after all.  As   
the New York Times put it, "Mr. Dole is  now talking about a flat tax   
proposal of his own, something his  aides hint he would have announced   
sooner if Mr. Forbes had not  grabbed the issue first."   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

While to some, such behavior may prove the fecklessness of American   
politicians, in truth it is an essential strength of  our system.    
Good ideas are not banished from the political  process just because   
they had the bad luck to be promoted by a  losing candidate.  On the   
contrary, like flowers in the desert, they bloom again and again.  In   
fact, competition for ideas  generally works the same way as   
competition for goods in the  marketplace.  The best tend to prevail   
despite adversity.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The fact is that ideas often win by losing. Norman Thomas, the   
Socialist candidate for  president in the 1930s, was one of the most   
unsuccessful  candidates in history, yet virtually all of his   
proposals - higher taxes, old age pensions, public power and flood   
control, and unemployment insurance - were ultimately adopted by the   
Democratic Party and enacted into law.   On the conservative side,   
Barry Goldwater's losing campaign in  1964 was equally "successful",   
although not until his ideas were adopted after the election of    
Ronald Reagan 16 years later.      
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

My own experience in the 1988 campaign proves the point.  My proposal   
for school choice, opposed by Bush, Dole, Kemp and, of course, all the   
Democrats, is now Republican policy, and is even being enacted in some   
communities and states across the country.  Similarly, a market-based   
alternative to Social Security, ridiculed as a "nutty" idea, has,   
thanks to Steve Forbes, become a mainstream economic issue.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes will find similar vindication.  Although widely dismissed   
as an iconoclastic, unimportant candidate, many of his ideas - like   
the  flat tax that Bob Dole is already moving toward endorsing - will   
be around for a long time to come   
  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 
Although the flat tax was Forbes' most visible idea, it was  not his   
only idea.  He also spoke eloquently about the need to make the dollar   
as good as gold,  about ending political careerism with term limits,   
and about  privatizing Social Security.  Indeed, the very fact that he   
was not vilified for suggesting the latter idea, as Barry Goldwater    
was, may be the most important development of the 1996 campaign.  As   
Sherlock Holmes once observed, the significant event was the dog that   
didn't bark.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Social Security has long been known as the "third rail" of  American   
politics because every politician who ever suggested  privatization   
suffered the same fate as those who touch the  electrified third rail   
of a subway.  But times are changing.  Because of demographics there   
are fewer people every year who get a good deal out of Social Security   
and more  who have little expectation of receiving anything.  As a   
result,  even the American Association of Retired Persons is said to   
be  sympathetic to some option that would allow younger workers to set   
aside some of their payroll taxes in a private savings account.  The   
Social Security Advisory Council is expected to make a similar   
recommendation in a few weeks.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes may never run for president again and his run  this year   
may never warrant more than a footnote in history, but if Bob Dole -   
or even Bill Clinton - proposes a flat tax next year, or if  Congress   
moves toward some kind of private alternative to Social  Security,   
Forbes will deserve some of the credit.  For if nothing  else, his was   
a campaign about ideas.     
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And as Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>A New Medicare: <br>A Better Deal for the Elderly
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>








<P>

<P>




<P>
Medicare, the government health care program for older 
Americans, currently serves 32 million people and costs about $180 
billion a year.  Medicare recipients pay $19 billion in premiums and the 
rest comes from a federal payroll tax.
<P>
Often the health care provided isn't very good. One reason is that 
the government pays doctors and hospitals providing the care only about 
70% of its cost, so doctors don't want to serve Medicare patients. As a 
result, there are longer waits for care, and sometimes a lack of care. So 
health care is being rationed to some of the elderly.
<P>
The quality of care may be lower, too, since hospitals and doctors 
are paid the same fee regardless of the quality of care provided.  For 
example, if a doctor is paid a fixed amount to implant a pacemaker, why 
not implant the cheapest one available and pocket the difference?
<P> 
 Finally, new medical technology is slow to be approved by the 
Medicare bureaucracy, so the elderly often get "old medicine."
<P>
 Even with all these efforts to limit costs, Medicare is proving to 
be very, very expensive.  According to the Clinton administration and 
Medicare Trustees, Medicare as it now operates will run out of money in 
less than seven years.
<P>
  By 2000, under current budget projections, Medicare will spend 
almost $250 billion, about 13% of the entire federal budget.  The deficit 
in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and the general revenue 
contribution to Medicare Part B (insurance for physicians' fees and other 
expenses) will be adding almost $150 billion to the total federal deficit.  
<P>
 Financial problems will quickly grow worse after that.  By the 
time those entering the workforce today retire, the Medicare payroll tax 
will need to be three to seven times higher than now.  The annual 
premiums paid by the elderly will be about $4,400 to $8,600 per couple 
instead of today's $1,000.
<P>	
 It doesn't have to be that way.  One simple and popular reform 
proposal offers a solution:  allowing the elderly the choice of substituting 
a Medical Savings Account and private insurance for their current 
Medicare coverage.
<P>
 Under one version of this proposal, Medicare beneficiaries 
would have the right to receive 95% of average Medicare spending per 
beneficiary and put it into a Medical Savings Account (MSA).  Retirees 
could also contribute the funds they must currently pay for Medicare 
premiums, supplemental Medigap insurance, and out-of-pocket health 
expenses.
<P>
  For the average retiree, these would total close to $9,000 next 
year.  The retiree would use part of these funds to purchase catastrophic 
insurance covering all expenses over a high deductible (say $2,000 or 
$3,000).  The retiree would have at least $2,000-$3,000 remaining in the 
account, which would then be used to pay expenses below the deductible, 
including HMO or other private health care insurance coverage if they 
prefer.  Any unspent MSA funds could then be withdrawn at the end of 
the year for any purpose, or saved for future medical expenses.
<P>
 With MSAs, the quality of elderly health care would quickly 
begin to improve.   Patients would be free to choose the doctors and 
hospitals that would provide the quality health care they prefer.  The 
elderly who exercised the MSAs would also have complete catastrophic 
coverage, which Medicare does not provide.  Medicare coverage runs out 
after a certain number of days of hospital care, and other benefits are 
similarly limited.  But with an MSA, the elderly can buy a catastrophic 
policy that pays all costs over their chosen deductible.
<P>
 Most important, since people would effectively be spending 
their own funds out of the MSAs for non-catastrophic health care, they 
would have excellent incentives to eliminate waste and inefficiency and 
control their own costs.  Since doctors and hospitals would be receiving 
100% payment for their services instead of 70% under today's Medicare, 
they in turn would compete to reduce costs to attract elderly patients 
trying to conserve their MSA funds.  The result would be lower costs for 
Medicare.
<P>
 Several private sector employers have already adopted MSAs 
for their workers and achieved dramatic cost savings of 30%-40% and 
more as a result.  To the extent Medicare beneficiaries chose MSAs, 
much of this cost savings would likely be achieved for Medicare as well.  
This would greatly help to reduce the burden of Medicare on the federal 
budget and its contribution to the overall deficit.  It would also help to 
solve the long term Medicare financing crisis. And since the individual 
gets 95% of average Medicare spending, the government saves an 
additional 5%, or more than $5 billion per year.	
<P>
  This proposal provides overwhelming benefits to the elderly, 
and would be enormously popular.  Yet, all of this can be achieved while 
actually saving the government substantial funds, and helping to solve the 
program's long term financing crisis.  Such a combination of advantages 
should be irresistible to policymakers.

<h2>V-E Day Reflections
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










 <P>
 





Omaha Beach Cemetery, V-E Day - Beneath a clear blue sky and endless 
rows of white marble crosses lie ten thousand of the boys who set out 
to win the war. 
 <P>
They fought their way onto the continent on D-Day, and then across it 
to the Rhine and victory.  They secured the beaches and the peace for 
us, giving up their chance to live life into their old age.  On V-E 
Day, 1945, a million cheering Brits gave thanks for their bravery, 
joining  hands to sing God Save the Queen to Winston Churchill and 
Queen Elizabeth, who stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. 
 <P>
For millions of people, though, V-E Day was not the end of anything.  
For Poles and Czechs and Eastern Europeans, it was neither the end, 
nor even the beginning of the end, of tyranny.  It was only the 
beginning of Stalin's occupation now that Hitler's was finished.  And 
this more brutal oppression would last 44 years instead of six. 
 <P>
Oscar Lindner, an Estonian refugee, survived both.  "The only 
difference between the Germans and the Russians," he explains, "was 
that Nazis come for people during the day; Communists deport people in 
the middle of the night." 
 <P>
How ironic it is that President Clinton was neither in England nor 
France on V-E Day, but in Moscow.  The Russians, of course, have much 
to celebrate 50 years after the end of their Great Patriotic War, from 
survival of the 900 day siege of Leningrad, to the hand-to-hand battle 
in the factories and sewers of Stalingrad, which won the war and saved 
the Motherland.  But they have just as much to atone for:  the 
massacre at Katyn of the Polish officer corps, the enslavement of half 
of Europe and the crushing of freedom in Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
 <P>
So V-E Day was not the end of the anguish.  The horror of Auschwitz 
was yet to be comprehended and some 40 years of communist oppression 
lay ahead. 
 <P>
But the end of European combat began to lift an enormous weight from 
minds and hearts of Americans.  Even for those too young to fight (I 
was 10 on V-E Day), the relief was real, for the war had been with us 
for most of our young lives.   
 <P>
War bulletins, ration coupons and black-out curtains had punctuated 
our days.  Around our supper table we learned about Pearl Harbor, U-
boats, D-Day and the Seigfreid Line.  My uncle, a private in 
Eisenhower's army, was somewhere in Europe.  But where?  Near a place 
called Bastogne, it turned out, where he grabbed a butcher's cleaver 
(which he fortunately never had to use) as he turned out to meet the 
Germans pouring through the Bulge. 
 <P>
Our understanding was sharpened by the media as well, by the movies, 
newsreels, and radio.  Ingrid Bergman in the swirling mists of 
Casablanca taught us devotion to a cause; so did John Wayne in fighter 
planes and foxholes.  The endless parade of Nazi officers assuring us 
they had ways of making us talk impressed our young minds with the 
terror of the police state, while Pathe News showed us Kamikaze 
fanaticism.  Over the BBC, Winston Churchill and the Battle of Britain 
inspired us:  "never have so many owed so much to so few...this was 
their finest hour!"  Vera Lynn's haunting "I'll be seeing you..." 
reminded us that sometimes the ending would not be happy, and The Best 
Years of Our Lives brought home all the tragedies of war.  
 <P>
World War II had taught us two lasting lessons:  through effort, good 
could triumph over evil, and that our entire nation could unite to 
meet a challenge.  We shared a common determination -- "the war 
effort" --  and a clear understanding of what evil was. 
 <P>
The final lesson is how quickly that clarity faded.  The further the 
war slips from memory, the more blurred our distinction between good 
and evil has become.  In 1945, no one was for the Nazis.  By 1950,  
lots of people questioned whether South Korea even mattered.  And by 
the time of Vietnam, Jane Fonda, our universities, and our media were 
on the other side.  The tyranny of the left became acceptable only 
twenty years after we had fought a great war to destroy tyrannies of 
the right. 
 <P>
The boys buried above the cliffs of Omaha Beach would never have 
understood that.  Their cause was to free the world from the evil of 
oppression.  Its clarity is engraved in the stone of their Memorial 
Chapel:   "Remember the glory of their spirit." 
 <P>
Remember, too, that in their glory they each gave up the chance to be 
what we are today. 
 
<P>

<h2>Crimson Tide and SDI
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>









 <P>
 






Crimson Tide is a sizzling movie, two hours of high tech, high tension 
confrontation wrapped around a post-Cold War terrorist scenario.  The 
film's tension is created by the need to fire a pre-emptive strike 
from a U. S. submarine in time to destroy rogue Russian missiles being 
fueled for an imminent launch.  But the real drama lies in the issues 
raised about America's security in the post-Cold War era.  
 
The film is fiction, so it doesn't bother to tell us that destruction 
on the launch pad is the only way to kill the Russian nukes.  But in 
the real world it's true:  once a missile is launched, the United 
States is unable to shoot it down.  We can pray for our family or 
friends who in a few minutes will be incinerated.  But we must suffer 
the missile's impact on Washington, Los Angeles, or wherever, because 
we have not built a missile defense system to protect us against 
incoming ICBMs. 
 <P>
We have the technology to build one.  A decade of Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) research has developed the Patriot anti-missile 
missile, for example.  As we saw in the Middle East, the Patriot gives 
us the ability to protect small regions of civilians and soldiers from 
missile attack.  Further, our shipboard AEGIS missile system is a 
workable defender of our naval fleet. 
 <P>
What we lack is the will.  For years, the Congress has gutted funding 
for SDI research and national missile defense, until today's funding 
levels are less than one-third of a decade ago.  Now the Clinton 
administration is negotiating with the shadow of the former Soviet 
Union to be sure we never build a national missile defense. 
 <P>
So we sleep defenseless against a single terrorist missile.  Think for 
a moment about a rogue band of international terrorists operating in 
some remote corner of  Iran -- or Iraq, or in the mountains of North 
Korea, or in the Crimson Tide scenario in rebel Russia on the 
Kamchatka Peninsula.  How does the United States respond if such a 
group were to launch a missile towards our country?  We could, of 
course, retaliate and obliterate their nation, killing millions of 
innocent people.  But what do terrorists care about that?  How much of 
a deterrent would that be to a band of kamikaze extremists willing to 
destroy an American city? 
 <P>
Over a decade ago, when the idea of SDI was first proposed by the 
Reagan Administration, it was derided by liberals as a science fiction 
fantasy, an expensive and impractical dream.  Democratic Congresses 
and weak Presidents bought that argument, so today we have no missile 
defense. 
 <P>
Indeed, our nation has no better means of protecting its people today 
than it did back in the fifties and sixties, the days when American 
school children practiced hiding under their desks during air raid 
drills.  That is inexcusable.  The only reason there is not more of an 
outcry demanding construction of an anti-missile defense shield is 
because many people think it already exists.  In a survey conducted by 
the Coalition to Defend America, almost 60% of the respondents thought 
the "U.S. could destroy a ballistic missile" before it "could hit and 
do damage."  When the respondents were told no such capability exists, 
over 75% said they thought deployment of such a capability should be a 
priority for our nation. 
 <P>
It would not be an expensive priority.  A recent study conducted for 
the Heritage Foundation by former civilian and government military 
experts concluded that for just $2-3 billion over the next five years, 
our nation could adapt existing AEGIS technology to provide an 
effective missile defense for our nation. 
 <P>
As former President Ronald Reagan said in 1993, ten years after he 
launched our nation's SDI effort, "now more than ever, it is vital 
that the United States not back down from its efforts to develop and 
deploy strategic defenses.  It is technologically feasible, 
strategically necessary and morally imperative."  Frank Gaffney, Jr., 
the former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration 
and currently head of The Center for Security Policy, notes the lack 
of such defenses is "our people's most serious strategic 
vulnerability." 
 <P>
For those who have not yet seen Crimson Tide, I won't give away the 
ending.  But, if  we ever do find a half-a-dozen ICBMs streaking 
towards America, we know our nation would be defenseless against them.  
That's a sad ending.  And Hollywood wouldn't even be around to film 
the sequel. 
 <P>

<h2>Washington's New 
Math
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<p>







A decade ago as Governor of Delaware, I was trying to persuade the legislature to enact a bill granting lower tax rates to banks that moved business operations into our state.  Some liberal legislators objected to the tax incentive, arguing that the state would be taxing banks too little and the bankers would be making too much.<p> 
 "Look," I said, "today we get zero taxes from a bank that isn't here.  If one comes, we get the taxes and all the jobs it creates.  The banks will benefit and so will the state."<p>
 A similar argument currently rages in Washington about lowering capital gains tax rates.  Cut the tax rate, the liberals argue, and the government will tax too little and the wealthy will benefit too 
much.<p>
 Remember that capital gains - the increase in value of stocks or other assets - are only taxed if the asset is sold.  Obviously, affluent people have more assets than nonaffluent people.  But like the bank 
that isn't here, if they don't sell the asset, the government doesn't realize any tax revenue.  But if the prospective tax on the capital gain is lowered, some people who otherwise would have held onto their 
asset will decide to sell it.  The seller will reap his reward and capital gains tax revenue will increase.  So both the seller and the government will benefit.<p>
 Or so you might think.  But in the make-believe world of Washington arithmetic, the government will be scored as losing money.  The reason is that Washington's revenue estimators - the "scorekeepers" you read about - use what amounts to two sets of books.  On the one hand, they agree that the government will get a certain amount of additional revenue in the short run.  But the way they calculate the amount of gain would tax anyone's patience.  If someone doesn't sell an asset because they would have had to pay $10,000 in taxes, but does sell it when the tax is reduced to $7,000, the revenue estimators consider it a $3,000 revenue loss rather than a $7,000 revenue gain.  So a tax rate reduction that results in more dollars flowing to the Treasury is said to be a revenue loss - or, as the scorekeepers put it, a "tax benefit" to the seller.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <p>
 Following this line of reasoning, if a retail store with goods that cost $500,000 and were priced at $1 million sold them for $750,000, the result would be not a $250,000 profit but a $250,000 loss.  And by 
Washington arithmetic, the sale would be unfair because it benefited the customers. <p>
 That's what the liberals argue in denouncing the tax cuts enacted by the House of Representatives - they are unfair because they benefit the wealthy.  As Bruce Bartlett, the former Treasury Department 
official who is now a Senior Fellow with the NCPA, has noted, things are not quite what they seem here.  The wealthy do hold more assets - or they wouldn't be wealthy - but 74% of the taxpayers who benefit from a capital gains tax cut have incomes of less than $75,000.  Indeed, when all the tax cut provisions of the House bill have taken effect, 65% of the benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes below $75,000, even though they pay only 49% of all federal taxes.  A bonanza for the wealthy?  Not exactly.<p>
Consider another example, the "draconian budget cuts" the liberals charge the Republicans are going to make in Medicare.  Under both the House and Senate versions of the budget, Medicare spending is 
scheduled to increase - by an average of 7% in each of the next five years. <p>
So how can an increase be a drastic cut?  By the same "Washington arithmetic" that makes tax revenue increases net losses to the Treasury.<p>
 Washington arithmetic uses a strange accounting system called "current services baseline budgets."  A current services baseline budget assumes that you will keep doing everything you do now exactly the same next year, and that in addition because of inflation and increased use of Medicare, next year's costs will rise as much as this year's.  That amount then becomes the "baseline" and any spending less than the baseline is a "cut" in the budget.  So a 7% increase in Medicare spending, compared to a 12% baseline budget, comes out as a 5% spending cut. What keeps all this from being hilarious is that the people who think this way have control of huge amounts of real money - our  money.  The truth is Washington arithmetic is designed to ensure that taxes are never cut and spending is never lowered. No wonder so much of the public lacks faith in the Congress.<p>
 Even the Delaware liberals who argued against the bank bill in the 1980s now admit it was a good thing.  Bank franchise taxes yielded $3 million in revenue the year before the bill was passed.  Last year, because a great many new businesses had moved to Delaware, revenues approached $100 million. <p>
Not bad.  Of course by Washington arithmetic, Delaware suffered a $97 million loss. <p>

<title>The End of Quotas Just in Time</title>

<h2>The End of Quotas Just in Time
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>

President Clinton's  "full-throated" (Washington Post) and "near- evangelical" (New York Times) endorsement of affirmative action has set liberal hearts a flutter.
<p>
The University of California's Regents' vote to end race-based admission, hiring, and contracting set Rev. Jesse Jackson ablaze.
<p>
Over at the Judicial branch of government, cooler heads are prevailing. The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the brakes to affirmative action, questioning the constitutional validity of programs that guarantee jobs or contracts on the basis of race.  "Equal protection of the law is a personal right, not a group right," wrote Justice O'Connor.
<p>
Just in time, too, because for two decades government quotameisters have been cutting a broad swath through individual rights.
<p>
For example, the Pentagon sent out word that "special permission will be required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities."  The U.S. Forest Service, desperate to meet its goals for minority firefighters, earlier this year said in a job posting that it would only consider applicants "who do not meet standards."
<p>
Navy Secretary John Dalton has issued a policy that henceforth Naval officers will be commissioned "in a percentage approximately equal to the racial make-up of the populace."  Navy flight standards also seem to have been bent to meet quotas for women fighter pilots.
<p>
Nondiscrimination in hiring, promoting and in awarding government contracts is both right and a right.  But in practice, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been turned on its head by those charged with enforcing it.  Instead of trying to wipe out discrimination, they have mandated it.  The legislation that Senator Hubert Humphrey assured us could never be used to impose quotas has become a quota statute.
<p>
Affirmative action has become a zero-sum game in which gains for one group can only be made at the expense of other groups.  Setting aside a construction contract for one minority group takes opportunity away from others.  When the University of California at Berkeley sets different admission standards for Asian-American students (the policy the Regents just voted down) because too large a percentage of them would be admitted if only grades and test scores were used, Asians are disadvantaged and blacks gain.
<p>
Quotas also undermine the very minorities they are supposed to help.  In a recent issue of The New Democrat, Carol M. Swain, a black professor of politics and public policy at Princeton University, blamed affirmative action for promoting a "helpless victim" mentality that undermines self- respect and initiative.  She wrote:  "It says in effect that you, as a woman or minority, are less capable than a white male and will need special preference in order to compete successfully in a world dominated by white males."
<p>
As a result, a black or Hispanic or woman who is hired or is promoted to a position of responsibility has to overcome the suspicion on the part of others that he or she wouldn't be there except for a quota.  The resulting self-doubt can become an additional handicap in achieving success.
<p>
Justice Clarence Thomas, addressing school busing in the Kansas City desegregation case, was blunt:  "It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.  This position [that racial imbalances are unconstitutional] appears to rest upon the idea that any school that is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites."
<p>
Quotas are also an easy way out.  Quotameisters just calculate that the local population is 12% black, 7% Hispanic and 1% Asian-American, and demand that the makeup of everybody's workforce reflect those percentages.  Then businesses don't have to worry about searching for talented people, or recruiting them, or looking for human potential and helping to develop it.  That takes work.  It's much easier just to hire by the numbers.
<p>
Thus we have incidents like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Chicago office spending seven years unsuccessfully  suing a Korean-owned janitorial service because more than 5% of its workforce was Korean and 95% of the Chicago labor pool was not.
<p>
Trying to end racial or sexual discrimination by giving preferences to one group at the expense of another is like trying to level a table.  If you cut too much off one leg, you have to cut off the others to even things out. And if you make a mistake, you can always trim a little more here or there.  But soon the table is useless.
<p>
So far, there is no indication that the government is going after National Basketball Association teams because they have such a high percentage of black (or tall) players.  Nor does anyone seem to be investigating why seven of the ten best lifetime batting averages of all time belong to left- handed hitters.  Maybe Justice O'Connor spoke just in time.

<h2>A Program in Need of a Crisis
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
When the politicians in Washington suddenly discover a new issue, do you ever wonder about the facts?  You should, because sometimes the facts contradict what the politicians are saying.
<p>
Remember "Alar"?  It turned out there was no apple pesticide problem - the politicians made up the scare.
<p>
Likewise, the Congress mandated $4 billion a year in acid rain mitigation, even though the most comprehensive environmental study in history concluded there was "no evidence of a general or unusual decline of forest in the United States or Canada due to acid rain." And the problem of global warming, according to the Washington Post, "appears to be heading toward solution before [researchers] can find any solid evidence that serious harm was or is being done."
<p>
This summer saw another example of the facts contradicting the politicians:  children's vaccinations.
<p>
In 1993, right in the middle of the great health care debate when President Clinton was trying to scare everyone (with some success) into believing the country's health care system had imploded, the president proposed and the Congress passed a costly new program that would  create an elaborate new distribution system to provide vaccines free of  charge to poor children, the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).
<p>
Never mind that about half of all childhood vaccines were already being provided free through public health clinics.  The Clintons - and I use the plural intentionally - needed to persuade people that a health care crisis had arisen.  The president pointed to a measles epidemic between 1989 and 1991 that took the lives of more than 100 children in the United States.  And he argued that the reason many children weren't vaccinated was the cost - drug companies were pursuing "profits at the expense of our children."
<p>
But the facts tell a very different story.  In May 1994, for example, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a study of measles immunization of 2-year-olds in Mississippi during the time of the outbreak.
<p>
What did the researchers find out about this rural southern state with a large black population and below-average incomes?  First, that the statewide measles immunization rate of 2-year-olds was 87% (ranging from 79% to 97% according to the geographical district).  While 87% isn't perfect, it's far from being a crisis justifying a $500 million federal vaccination program.
<p>
Moreover, immunization rates were "similar for white and black children in each health district and for the state as a whole."  So there is no racial discrimination problem.
<p>
But what about the poor, rural population? They're the ones who have to drive the farthest to get the immunizations, so doesn't a large rural population point to the need for the president's new distribution scheme? No, because "the level of vaccine coverage was significantly higher in districts with lower population densities (i.e., rural) and those with higher per capita incomes," according to the report.
<p>
So who's left?  Lower-income people living in urban areas - those most likely to have access to public clinics where free vaccines have always been available.
<p>
But the most significant finding of the JAMA study is this:  half of those measles cases contracted during the outbreak in Mississippi "occurred in unimmunized children too young to receive the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine."  (Emphasis added)  It's pretty difficult to blame those "greedy" drug companies for the fact that many children were too young to get the vaccine.
<p>
Now, two years after the VFC's inception, comes a General Accounting Office (GAO) report finding that the VFC's newly created distribution scheme, meant to make the vaccines more accessible to poor children, is not working.   For example, 14 states were prohibited by state law from distributing free vaccines to private physicians, the software needed to process orders was defective, and the Centers for Disease Control could not ensure that the program would serve only entitled children.  Of seven  major implementation tasks considered by the GAO, six  "remained incomplete and problematic."
<p>
Most significant, the GAO found the cost of vaccines had never been a major barrier to immunizations.  A different 1994 JAMA study, done prior to the GAO report, had come to a similar conclusion.  It found that the "provision of free vaccine alone will not guarantee adequate immunization of poor urban children."
<p>
The truth is that the administration created and promoted the VFC program from political necessity rather than medical necessity.  As with his grander attempt to restructure the entire health care system, President Clinton needed to impart a crisis atmosphere, and he succeeded -- for a time, anyway.  Now that the crisis mentality and his health care plan have died, so should the VFC program.

<title>SCHOOL REFORM: WILL NEW JERSEY EVER LEARN?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><i>Thursday, August 17, 1995 </i>
<hr>



<h2>School Reform: Will New Jersey Ever Learn?
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
For the third time in half a dozen years, the state of New Jersey has 
seized control of a local school district.  This time the victims are 
the 48,000 students of the Newark school system, who are about to 
receive a civics lesson they will likely never forget.  They are going 
to learn what it's like to be dumped out of the frying pan of one 
failed education bureaucracy, only to fall into the fire of another. 
<p> 
There is no question that the Newark school system deserves a failing 
grade.  Only one-fourth of its students were able to pass the 1993 
high school proficiency test on their first try.  The district's 
classrooms had fallen into disrepair.  Student attendance was poor.  A 
1994 report, prepared by the state, blasted Newark school officials 
for "dereliction of duty."  The highly critical report spoke of 
students in rat-infested schools, while administrators sat in 
"comfortable offices" and had "important-sounding titles."   
<p> 
Change was obviously needed, but why do New Jersey officials believe 
that shifting control to a larger, more distant state bureaucracy is 
the right kind of change?  They have it exactly the wrong way around:  
effective school reform involves moving decisions about educating 
students closer to the classroom, not further away.  Replacing one 
bureaucracy with another will not work. 
<p> 
New Jersey officials do not have to look very far to see that this is 
so.  In the last six years, New Jersey state education officials have 
also taken control of the schools in Jersey City and Paterson.  When 
Bret Schundler became Jersey City's Mayor in 1992, its schools had 
been under state control for three years, and they continue under 
state control today.  Mayor Schundler states he is "convinced the 
takeovers are doomed to failure and can actually make matters worse."  
He notes "there has been no innovation in Paterson, no innovation in 
Jersey City, and there will probably be none in Newark." 
 <p>
A study of the Jersey City schools, conducted last year, concluded 
that the "district remains below standard in four out of five high 
schools in writing and mathematics."  Results in the district's 
elementary schools for reading and mathematics were also 
"unacceptable."  In certain areas, performance actually deteriorated 
under state control. 
 <p>
So, if state control does not work, what does?  The answer is to give 
control to teachers and parents, so teachers can teach and parents can 
choose the teachers they want for their children. 
<p> 
Suppose that six years ago, instead of commandeering their school 
system, New Jersey had allowed the parents of Jersey City to send 
their children to the school of their choice - public or private, near 
or far?  Parents could have chosen the school best suited to each of 
their children.  Newly formed charter schools might have sprung up; 
private schools might have expanded their enrollment.  Existing public 
schools would have improved to attract more students. 
 <p>
Most important, the children of Jersey City would have immediately 
begun receiving a better education.  As it worked out, Jersey City's 
30,000 students are not receiving an education today any better than 
the one the state replaced six years ago. 
 <p>
Choice and charter schools are no longer new ideas.  They are being 
tried and evaluated across the country.  In New York, East Harlem 
District No. 4 is legendary for the significant student improvement 
that occurred when teachers and parents were empowered to design and 
choose the education approach they wanted. 
 <p>
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an increasing number of low-income children 
are in the fifth year of a school choice program, and test scores are 
rising, although so far only slightly.  More importantly, student 
satisfaction has improved, as has parental satisfaction and 
involvement, and not surprisingly, student attendance and discipline.  
These all contribute to a learning-friendly environment that is bound 
to increase test scores even more in the future. 
 <p>
The truth is that education bureaucracies, whether the Newark school 
board, the New Jersey Department of Education, or the U. S. Department 
of Education, are simply not customer-focused.  They act like the 
monopolies they are, focusing on what is best for them. 
 <p>
The failure of these bureaucracies should be obvious to all.  SAT 
scores have fallen precipitously over the last two decades, and the 
number of students scoring 600 and above on the Verbal SATs has 
dropped 35%.  American students rank 13th in the world on math and 
science tests.  Only 26% of the fourth graders in America can actually 
read at the fourth grade level. 
 <p>
What the education bureaucrats in New Jersey and thousands of 
education departments across the country have yet to learn is that 
time and technology have passed them by.  They are industrial-age 
dinosaurs in an information-driven society, attempting to deliver 
mass-produced education to children who need individualized attention. 
 <p>
Their educational model must be replaced with the energy and 
initiative of schools free to innovate and parents empowered to do 
what is best for each of their children.

<title>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center>
<i>Thursday, September 28, 1995</i><hr>
 
<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<title>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>Thursday, October 4, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

 
The House Republicans have proposed a major revision to Medicare that, if enacted, will provide greatly improved health care for America's senior citizens.   <p>
 
The proposal accomplishes this by shifting power and control over Medicare and its funds away from the government, the hospitals, and the doctors to the elderly themselves.  As a result of this power to the people approach, the elderly will now enjoy the same freedom others have to choose a broad range of private health care plans instead of being forced to participate in the government Medicare system.    <p>
 
Under the House Republicans' plan, the elderly would each have the freedom to take their share of funds out of Medicare and use it to buy any of the full range of private alternatives for their health coverage.  HMOs or managed care will be one option; others  include Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), traditional fee-for-service insurers, preferred provider networks, provider service networks (where doctors and hospitals in an area organize to provide health coverage directly), and plans offered by associations such as AARP, or unions, or employers.  The elderly would each be perfectly free to stay in the current Medicare system if they prefer, foregoing the private options entirely. <p>
 
The amounts that can be withdrawn from Medicare for these private 
options would average about $5,000 per year to start and would be 
allowed to grow no faster than specified in the federal budget.  <p>
 
Both experience and actuarial studies show that for these amounts many 
plans can provide better benefits than Medicare.  For example, 
Milliman & Robertson, the nation's top actuarial firm, recently 
completed a study for the National Center for Policy Analysis in 
Dallas showing that with these funds retirees could buy an MSA with 
full fee-for-service insurance covering all expenses over $3,000 per 
year, with $1,500 left in the MSA to pay for expenses below the 
deductible.  Or they could buy an MSA that provides managed care for 
all expenses over $3,000, with $2,100 left in the MSA. <p>
 
Such MSA plans would provide better benefits than Medicare in at least 
five ways: <p>
 
First, the MSA provides complete catastrophic coverage for all 
expenses over $3,000, while Medicare does not.  Medicare coverage runs 
out after various caps and limitations. <p>
 
Second, the fee-for-service MSA provides a cap on out-of-pocket 
spending for covered medical expenses of $1,500 per year (the 
difference between the $3,000 deductible and the $1,500 in the MSA) or 
$900 if the managed care option is chosen.  Medicare has no cap on 
out-of-pocket expenses; the elderly can be liable for  thousands of 
dollars in medical expenses. That is why 70% of the elderly will pay 
almost $1,200 next year on average for private insurance to supplement 
Medicare.  With the MSA, the elderly can keep that $1,200 per year or 
use it to reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses. <p>
 
Third, the funds in the MSA can be used for health care expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs or eyeglasses. <p>
 
Fourth, unspent funds in the MSA at the end of the year would belong 
to the retiree, and could be saved for future expenses, or withdrawn 
for any purpose, subject to certain minimum balance requirements in 
the House Republicans' bill.  This allows the elderly to share 
directly in the reward for controlling health costs. <p>
 
Finally, MSAs would not be subject to the payment and reimbursement 
limitations of Medicare, or the outdated limitations on what new 
services and treatments the program covers.  These limitations and 
controls are reducing access to care and quality of care under 
Medicare, effectively rationing health care for the elderly. <p>
 
HMOs and other managed care options will be able to provide better 
benefits than Medicare as well.  They will likely add catastrophic 
coverage and prescription drugs to the package offered to the elderly 
for the funds they can withdraw from Medicare each year. <p>
 
Furthermore, the House Republicans' proposal does not increase costs 
appreciably for most older Americans.  There is no increase in 
Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and Medicare premiums (except 
for the very wealthiest Americans) would actually remain at their 
current level of about 31% of the costs of Part B. <p>
 
Best of all, the House Republicans' reform plan actually increases the 
freedom of the elderly to choose their own doctors.  Since private 
plan doctors would not be subject to the Medicare payment limitations, 
doctors  would not be discouraged from providing services to the 
elderly, and so there would be a wider choice of physicians.  <p>
 
Millions of elderly Americans are worried about the future of 
Medicare.  This new approach not only lays those fears to rest, it 
opens vast new health care options for all senior citizens.<p>

<title>du Pont--REPUBLICAN BAD NEWS BEARS ARE ON THE PROWL </title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Republican Bad News Bears Are On The Prowl </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
  
 

 
 
My grandmother told me that bad news comes in threes.  Over a 
lifetime, I've concluded that she was right.  This especially came to 
mind last week, as I read in the papers three pieces of bad news that 
could torpedo the Gingrich Republican revolution of 1994. 
                       <P>
First item - Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) seems to have slipped a new 
subsidy for the maritime industry into an appropriations bill.  It's 
only $46 million - what difference can that make to a $1.58 trillion 
government?  But it continues one of those catastrophic subsidy 
concepts that has so characterized liberal thinking for the last 50 
years. 
             <P>
The idea that the government can somehow hold back the tide of 
competition in international shipping has been liberal dogma for 
decades.  There is the Jones Act, for example, which according to our 
International Trade Commission, costs the taxpayers $10 billion a 
year.  The Maritime Operating Differential Subsidy, according to the 
General Accounting Office, costs hundreds of millions more.  And all 
the while America's merchant fleet is dwindling, priced out of the 
market by the very subsidies that are supposed to be rescuing it. 
                                                                                   <P>
Even President Clinton once proposed that the subsidies  be ended.  So 
did Vice President Gore, in a study that said their elimination could 
"spur the country's economic growth by $3 billion annually." 
                                                                         <P>
Well, they may have been kidding.  But we didn't think the 
conservative Republicans were.  
                                                             <P>
Second, I'm struck by the similarity of another Republican effort - 
this time led by the senior governor in America, Republican Terry 
Branstad of Iowa.  Using the wiles and power of the Republican 
constituency of farm belt America, Governor Branstad evidently 
persuaded the leaders of the smaller government revolution to 
reinstate a $1.8 billion (over seven years) subsidy to the ethanol 
industry. 
                                                 <P>
The House Ways and Means Committee had proposed reducing the ethanol 
tax exemption from 54 cents a gallon to (gasp!) 51 cents.  Governor 
Branstad proclaimed Iowa's future imperiled!  The ethanol industry 
will be destroyed, said the lobbyists. 
                                      <P>
I saw how smoothly Governor Branstad sweet-talked the Congresspeople, 
and how quickly they bought the argument that a 6% decrease in a 
single subsidy could destroy the nation's 28th largest state with a 
$56 billion economy.  Then the alacrity with which the Republican 
leadership caved on the issue made me wonder whether the Republican 
Revolution of 1994 could ever succeed. 
                       <P>
If America's third party -- the Gingrich conservatives elected in the 
sweep of 1994 -- as contrasted with the Senate Republicans and the 
liberal Democrats -- was in favor of this enormous and unnecessary 
subsidy, who would ever be for eliminating it?    
       <P>
Then, as if to round out my grandmother's truism, there was an article 
that a group of  Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were 
turning into marshmallows on the subject of tax cuts.  The word is 
that they want to cut taxes a lot less than $245 billion over seven 
years because they have lost their nerve about the spending cuts that 
would be needed to balance the budget.  Never mind that the Senate had 
negotiated the House down from $345 billion in tax cuts and then 
agreed to the $245 number.  These Republican Senators now wanted to 
renege. 
      <P>
The backsliders - John Chafee of Rhode Island, Orrin Hatch of Utah, 
Alan Simpson of Wyoming, Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Alfonse 
D'Amato of New York - prowled the Senate like Republican bad news 
bears.  They appear to have been seized by Beltway madness,  the 
insidious affliction that has driven federal spending up more than 31% 
in real terms since 1981.  These Senators have evidently decided that 
it's politically easier for them to let the government keep on 
spending than it is to let Americans keep their own money.  The 
liberal Democrats seem to have found some unexpected allies. 
                                               <P>
For the moment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole seem to have threatened the recalcitrant six into line - a 
line that will probably hold through Senate Finance Committee votes.  
But many opportunities to undermine the tax cuts of 1995 remain - in 
floor amendments, the conference with the House, and final passage 
under threat of a Clinton veto. 
                               <P>
I should be optimistic, but I can't shake my grandmother's wisdom:  
bad things do come in threes.  First, more maritime subsidies.  Then 
more ethanol subsidies.  And, finally, the same old "keep on spending, 
business as usual" syndrome.  And all approved by the very 
conservatives we put into power to clean up the mess. 
<P> 
If, as some polls suggest, the new Congress is slipping from favor 
with the general public, could it be because the general public sees 
too much of the old business as usual in the Capitol? 
           <P>

<title>du Pont--HELPING THE POOR:  WASHINGTON WELFARE FOR PRIVATE CHARITIES </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Helping the Poor:  Washington Welfare for Private Charities</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
   
  
What would you think of a doctor who prescribed the same treatment to  
every sick person he treated, whether the patient had a cold or lung  
cancer?  Yet, isn't that the way we handle welfare today?  The fourth- 
generation welfare mother, the educated person temporarily on hard  
times, the drug addict, the man who is simply incapable of holding a  
job - they're all treated pretty much the same by federal welfare  
policy. 
<p> 
But they aren't the same.  They're more than case numbers; they are  
people,  individuals.  Not surprisingly, a comprehensive study by Mary  
Jo Bane and David Ellwood of Harvard University found that poor people  
are just as diverse as nonpoor people.  They have diverse reasons for  
being poor and respond to diverse incentives. 
 <p>
So just as in medicine, the better the provider knows the recipient,  
the more likely that welfare funds will be spent in a way that  
benefits both the individual and the community.  Giving block grants  
to the states to handle their own welfare programs is a step in the  
right direction, but it only transfers welfare responsibility from a  
federal bureaucrat to a state bureaucrat.  A much more fundamental  
change is needed.  We must break free of the idea that only government  
- at whatever level, federal, state or local - holds the answer to  
social problems.  Generally it's not so.  It certainly isn't so in the  
case of welfare. 
 <p>
Thirty years of experience and scholarly studies confirm that the  
current welfare system discourages work and encourages dependency,  
single motherhood and the breakup of families.  People may complain  
about the monetary cost, but the real cost is the social and   
psychological cost in lives damaged or destroyed, children deprived of  
opportunity, increased crime and violence, and the creation of a  
permanent underclass of people with no hope.   
 <p>
Where welfare is concerned, there is already a better answer than  
government programs.  There is mounting evidence that private  
charities do a better job of getting aid to those who need it most,  
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance, strengthening the  
family unit, and using resources efficiently. 
 <p>
Private charitable efforts are not insignificant:   In 1991, private  
charities provided more than $100 billion in cash and $76 billion in  
volunteered time for health, education, and welfare.   
 <p>
The best private charities believe that most people can and should  
support themselves and their families.  They tailor aid accordingly.   
They get aid to those who need it most and provide help without  
encouraging dependency.  They encourage or require aid recipients to  
contribute labor to the charity itself.  One might say private  
charities take just the opposite approach from government welfare:   
whereas it often takes a long time to get on government welfare rolls,  
it is easy to stay on.  Conversely, it is easy to get aid from a  
private charity, but hard to keep getting it. 
 <p>
Government programs spent about $350 billion on means-tested welfare  
programs last year - the federal share being about $240 billion.   
Instead of talking about reducing welfare spending, why not channel  
these funds to the private charities or local government programs that  
do the best job of helping the poor?  Instead of sending these  
billions to Washington, let each taxpayer decide which anti-poverty  
effort to support.  Here's one way this could work: 
 <p>
Create a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individual contributions to  
anti-poverty programs operated either by state or local governments or  
by private sector charities.  That is, for every dollar individuals  
give to such programs, up to say $3,000 - which is about what the  
median household now pays in federal income taxes - they could take a  
dollar off their tax bills.  One estimate is that this could move a  
large portion of the $240 billion the federal government is spending  
now to private charities and state and local governments. 
 <p>
Only one person in three believes they get good value for tax dollars  
spent on social welfare programs.  But three out of four contributors  
to private charities feel their contributions are put to good use.   
So, almost everybody who pays income tax would actively think about  
the best way to provide charitable services to needy people, and would  
be likely to pay close attention to how the private charity - or the  
local or state government if that's what that taxpayer chose - is  
using the money.  After all, the poverty programs would now be run by  
people in your own home town. 
 <p>
It was early in this century when doctors first understood enough  
about medicine to begin customizing medical treatment to fit the  
patient's needs.  It would be fitting if we could end the century with  
the same kind of progress in welfare for the poor.

<h2>Public School Choice and Racial Balance</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a>
</center> <P>
 <hr><p>
If you thought the Congressional elections of 1994 marked the end of 
liberalism and a new era of conservative government, look at what the 
education establishment is doing to school choice back home.  A 
current example comes from Delaware, where the State Board of 
Education has blunted a new public school choice law by insisting it 
comply with racial quotas.   
 <p>
In Delaware, all the traditional school improvements advocated by the 
education establishment and the teachers unions have been tried:  
smaller classes, higher teachers salaries, earlier education and, of 
course, spending more money.  Meanwhile, SAT scores have dropped 19 
points in 10 years, the National Assessment of Educational Progress 
test scores for math showed Delaware students 28th in the nation, and 
the state now has the highest percentage in the nation (20%) of 
students attending private schools. 
 <p>
But suddenly last summer two events created a surge of hope for 
Delaware parents.  Governor Thomas R. Carper signed a public school 
choice bill in July and a few weeks later Federal District Court Judge 
Sue L. Robinson lifted the controversial busing order that for 17 
years had decreed that a school's racial balance was more important 
than excellence, student achievement, or the individual needs of a 
child. 
 <p>
Now parents would be able to choose the public school (space 
permitting) their children would attend in September, 1996.  Freedom, 
opportunity and optimism were in the summer air. 
 <p>
But it was a false dawn.  On October 19th, just 66 days after Judge 
Robinson lifted the busing order, the empire struck back.  The State 
Board of Education and its top management strongly endorsed local 
school district policies subjugating school choice to racial quotas. 
 <p>
The "new freedom and opportunity" provided by choice, said State Board 
President Paul R. Fine, "must not be at the cost of diversity in our 
public schools."  Read that again, slowly.  Individual freedom and 
educational opportunity are subservient to something called 
"diversity," as defined by state government. 
 <p>
Such policies are the core of welfare state liberalism:  the 
government will decide just how much freedom and opportunity your 
children will be allowed, but in no case will it be so much as to 
upset the policies of the state.  A federal court ends busing to 
achieve racial balance in our schools?  Not to worry, it will be 
reinstated by order of the educational bureaucracy.  For above all, in 
Mr. Fine's words, "schools...must mirror the public they serve." 
 <p>
So much for scholarship.  So much for individual freedom.  And so much 
for the Constitution, which uses the word diversity not at all but 
speaks volumes about liberty and the unalienable right to pursue 
opportunity. 
 <p>
Several  school districts, including the state's largest, have already 
adopted policies that will deny a student's choice of school if it 
would upset the racial balance of the school.  So a de facto quota is 
now in place:  no whites may transfer into school A; or no more than a 
certain number of blacks will be allowed into school B.  Delaware's 
school assignment policies have regressed a full century, once again 
allocating students based upon the color of their skin. 
 <p>
Most disturbing, though, is the reasoning of the State Board.  The 
1977 District Court busing order, as mistaken as it was, prohibited 
the state from assigning pupils to schools in racially disparate 
numbers.  The Delaware State Board's policy forbids children from 
choosing to attend schools in a way that will result in racial 
disparity within them. 
 <p>
Over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the assignment of 
children to school by race was first permitted (Plessy v. Ferguson, 
1896); then forbidden (Brown v. Board of Education , 1954); and now 
constitutionally required (Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 1971).  But 
these decisions all addressed the question of government assignment of 
children to schools.  The Delaware Board of Education has carried the 
policy a step further.  Now individuals may not choose to act in a way 
that does not "mirror" society. 
 <p>
It is not a new idea, of course. Soviet Russia and Communist China 
governed societies based upon the principle that the individual was 
subservient to the state. 
 <p>
But it is an interesting idea, particularly viewed in juxtaposition 
with Thomas Jefferson's view that "all men are created equal" and 
"endowed by their creator" (not the government) "with certain 
unalienable rights" (that is, unalienable by the government),  
"including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  
If memory serves, our Constitution was based upon Mr. Jefferson's 
vision.   
 <p>
Nevertheless, the educational bureaucracy grinds on, limiting 
students' pursuit of opportunity just when it should be adopting a 
more enlightened policy. 
 <p>
Why should government recoil from a straightforward policy with which 
every parent agrees:   no child will be denied admission to the school 
of their choice because of the color of their skin? 
 <P><P>

<title>du Pont--One Jobs Program That Works</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>November 9, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>One Jobs Program That Works</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>

Last week's District of Columbia appropriations bill contained a 
startling education innovation.  It mandates the establishment of a 
nonprofit corporation governed by the private sector to train and 
place non-college-bound students in jobs. 
<p> 
If, as President Reagan said, "The best social program devised is a 
job,"  then those without jobs or who lack skills that employers want 
need some help to acquire those skills to connect them to the 
workplace. 
 <p>
Both the House and the Senate have recently passed bills resulting in 
a sweeping reform of the federal job training system.  Between 80 and 
125 programs will be consolidated, depending on the final conference 
actions, and overall funding cuts will be between 15% and 25%.    
 <p>
If the conservative revolution in Washington is to succeed, no one 
must be left behind.  One low-cost, high-return way to accomplish this 
is to implement well constructed, economical training in communities 
where jobs are available.  That is the thrust of the two bills in 
Congress - devolving authority, flexibility, and decisions to the 
state and local level - and requiring important private-sector 
involvement in how the funds should be spent. 
 <p>
But the innovation in the District of Columbia may turn out to be the 
most significant step of all. 
 <p>
It is of particular interest to me, because it is based upon an idea I 
developed in my prior life as a governor.  I used the powers states 
had then to devise a better way to train young people for work in the 
real world.  Our idea worked then, and it can be a model for what will 
work now. 
 <p>
"Jobs for Delaware Graduates" (JDG) was created in 1978 as a non-
profit partnership to prepare, counsel, and place high school seniors 
in career jobs.  I committed myself to serve as chair, and challenged 
some of the state's most important business, government, education, 
community and labor leaders to join me in taking personal 
responsibility for the program.  In turn, we hired a staff that would 
each be held personally accountable for helping a group of 35 to 40 of 
our state's most at-risk young people move successfully from school to 
work. 
 <p>
In the very first year, truly impressive results were achieved in the 
test high schools.  Costs were less than one-third that of similar 
programs - including the provision of  nine months' assistance after 
students left school to assure successful placement and performance in 
the private sector. 
 <p>
It was so successful that a number of foundations and government 
agencies helped test the program in four other states.  "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG) was then created to help bring Delaware's 
success story throughout the country. 
 <p>
Today, I am pleased to report that a majority of states now have the 
JAG program - the largest organization of its kind. 
 <p>
What makes it work?  Why do 90% of these at-risk young people graduate 
from school?  Why is it that within nine months 80% are either on the 
job, in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or 
training?  Why is it that JAG shows a 30% improvement in employment?  
Why is it so cost-effective - at $1,200 per participant, less than 
one-third the cost of the national average of similar programs? 
 <p>
Because there is private sector oversight and responsibility, real 
accountability of people to achieve results, and the fact that young 
people themselves must meet the employability requirements of 
businesses and take responsibility for themselves and their lives.  
Governors like Chuck Robb (VA), Kit Bond (MO), and Lamar Alexander 
(TN) joined me in testing and leading the organization.  To date, the 
JAG organization has helped 175,000 young people. 
 <p>
JAG can demonstrate that young people more than repay the cost of 
their participation in the program in taxes paid alone.  Heaven only 
knows how much they would have cost if they hadn't completed school, 
hadn't gotten a job, had gotten on welfare or into trouble with the 
law -- or worse. 
 <p>
Training, counseling, and job placement services can work, if they are 
run by the private sector, involve communities, and demand results.  
 <p>
That is why Speaker Gingrich is so enthusiastic about the value of 
training as part of the welfare reform bill the House has passed.  
That is why so many of us conservatives have found ourselves 
supporting bottomline, low-cost ways to make sure that we don't leave 
any of our young people behind - each gets a decent chance to complete 
school and get a good job upon graduating.  And that is why the 
Speaker and Labor Secretary Robert Reich will keynote the 
organization's 14th anniversary celebration this month. 
 <p>
Supporting America's young people, conserving the cost of social 
programs and protecting the base of our taxpayers in the future are 
good, sound, conservative principles.  In "Jobs for America's 
Graduates," they work in practice.

<h2> Bringing Medical Advances to Patients Sooner 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Some 70 Americans will die today because the Food and Drug 
Administration doesn't allow existing medical technology to be used to 
save their lives. 
 <p>
If the FDA approves a product that eventually causes a problem in the 
marketplace, it gets into trouble.  But if the product isn't available 
in the United States and isn't generally known to exist, the FDA 
doesn't get into trouble even if thousands of people die for lack of 
it. 
 <p>
Thus there was no outcry even though 119,000 people died of 
hypertension or heart disease during an eight-year wait for beta 
blockers to be approved.  Or when more than 2,000 died from heart 
disease during three years of waiting for Mevacor.  Or when 3,500 died 
of kidney cancer during the three-year wait for Interleukin-2. 
 <p>
The procedures for bringing new products to use in the United States 
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world.  In 
the 1960s it took six years for the FDA to approve a new drug.  Now it 
takes almost 16 years, even with the recently heralded reduction in 
the time required for final review to just over a year and a half. 
 <p>
It's time to help the elderly and the ill by bringing drugs and 
medical devices to market more quickly.  The Progress & Freedom 
Foundation has a proposal to do it.  It would separate the development 
and product review process from the FDA's role of enforcing mandated 
safety and effectiveness standards. 
 <p>
The FDA would license private entities called Drug or Device 
Certifying Bodies (DCBs), which drug or device manufacturers would 
retain to oversee their product's development.  Since manufacturers 
could choose among DCBs, they could compete to produce a lower-cost, 
faster, and higher quality process for drug and device development and 
review. 
 <p>
More important, the FDA would have 90 days to approve a positive 
recommendation by a DCB.  If it did not act, the use of the drug or 
device would be allowed.  This would be far different from now, when 
the FDA raises hurdle after hurdle, requires more and more tests, 
never saying yes, but rarely daring to just say no.  The current 
bureaucratic gridlock would be broken, so that more effective 
treatments can get to the ill. 
 <p>
There's no reason private entities should not be used to review a drug 
application.  Private entities already perform all functions involved 
in this process except the final approval step.  Currently, the FDA 
requires sponsors of new drugs to obtain approval to begin clinical 
trials, and then continues to oversee the sponsor's clinical program 
through regular reports and other mechanisms.  After the clinical 
studies are completed, sponsors apply for FDA approval.  The FDA does 
no testing, but only reviews the data collected through clinical 
trials. The FDA would review the DCB's analysis of the data, and could 
veto approval if it found the new drug unsafe or ineffective. 
 <p>
The approval process for medical devices needs to be changed, too.  
Currently, if a device is not substantially equivalent to one already 
on the market, it must go through a complex clinical trial process 
even if it's a simple device that carries little or no risk.  The 
breast examination pad, for example, is two pieces of plastic with a 
layer of silicone in between.  It has no moving parts, is non-toxic, 
and in use does not invade the body.  But it is illegal in the United 
States because there is no analogous product on the market.  So years 
of testing loom while women whose lives could be saved by it are 
forbidden to use it. 
 <p>
Finally, there is the question of liability.  Where the treatment of 
patients with serious medical problems is involved, there are going to 
be adverse outcomes from the use of drugs and even death on occasion, 
no matter how responsible the manufacturer and how strict the 
regulation.  U.S. companies are not permitted to defend themselves 
from lawsuits simply by pleading that they have complied with 
regulations.  As a result, manufacturers of some pharmaceuticals have 
simply quit making them.  Here, we might look to Europe, where 
regulatory standards protect the patient, but a company is free of 
tort liability if it can show that the state of scientific and 
technical knowledge when the product went into circulation was not 
such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered. 
 <p>
The FDA was designed for the 1930s and is bureaucratically incapable 
of handling the exploding technological advances of medicine in the 
1990s.  We must change the current system for bringing medical 
products to the marketplace so that our citizens will receive the full 
benefits of the dramatic scientific discoveries and medical 
breakthroughs our nation's vast research establishment is producing. 
 
And they need those benefits while they are still alive.

<title>du Pont--  Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>November 29, 1995</i><hr>

<h2> Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>

</center><hr>  

 <p>
 
Most people would agree that if prisoners learned a skill while they 
were in jail they could more easily get a job when they got out, and 
that an ex-prisoner with a job is less likely to commit another crime.  
Since nearly one-half of people released from prison return to prison 
within three years, job skills could mean a significant decline in the 
crime rate. 
 <P>
The problem is that most productive prison work - other than food or 
laundry work within the prison itself - is against the law. 
 <P>
In 1936, Congress banned convict labor on federal contracts exceeding 
$10,000 in value.  In 1940 the Ashurst-Sumners Act made it a federal 
crime to transport convict-made goods in interstate commerce.  And 
many state legislatures have enacted laws to prohibit the sale of 
convict-made goods within their borders.  States like New York 
compromised and adopted the "state-use" system, which permitted 
convicts to manufacture goods for sale to governmental agencies only, 
which provides a very limited market for the fruits of convict labor. 
 <P>
These statutes were a form of protectionism - to protect providers of 
goods and services in the free market from having to compete with 
convict labor.  Small businesses and labor unions view such 
competition as unfair, and have successfully prevented relaxation of 
the statutes.  When Congress tried to change the laws in 1979, the 
best it could do was allow prisoner work if they are paid the 
prevailing wage, labor union officials approve, local labor is 
unaffected, and no local unemployment is produced.  These criteria are 
nearly impossible to meet, so a mere 1,660 prisoners, out of one 
million, were working under these waivers in 1994.  
 <P>
It was not always this way.  In the last century, prisons earned a 
major part of their daily cost by leasing convict labor to private 
employers.  In 1885, three-fourths of prison inmates were involved in 
productive labor, the majority working for private employers under 
contract and leasing arrangements.  By the 1930s only 44% worked, and 
nearly all worked for state industries rather than for private 
employers.  A 1990 Census found that only 11% of prisoners worked in 
prison manufacturing or farming, down from 16% in 1984.  If part-time 
work in laundry and food services is included, only about half of 
prisoners work. <P>
 
Many prisoners are eager to work, if only to relieve the tedium of 
prison life.  But more important is that the work is good for society 
in the long run because it reduces crime.  A 1983-87 Federal Post-
Release Employment Project study confirmed that employed prisoners do 
better than others without jobs.  Prisoners who work have fewer 
disciplinary problems in prison and lower rates of re-arrest; they are 
more likely to get a full-time job; more likely to quit their job in 
favor of a better-paying job; and less likely to have their 
supervision revoked for a parole violation or new crime.  In the words 
of Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association, 
"It's a matter of public safety:  inmates who have worked in prison, 
and gained new skills have a significantly better chance of not 
returning to crime and prison...." <P>
 
The only disadvantages of more work opportunities for prisoners are 
the feared competitive effects on local labor markets.  But the 
government's first responsibility is to citizens, not to narrow 
interest groups.  New production benefits all Americans.  It raises 
the demand for their services and creates new goods for purchase.  
Competition is the strength of our economic system,  not a wrong to be 
righted, so our policies should be breaking down, not erecting, 
barriers to work - especially when the work will make the streets 
safer for the rest of us. 
 <P>
Allowing prisoners to work makes sense.  Begin by repealing state and 
federal limitations on inmate pay.  Let responsible private businesses 
competitively bid for the use of prison labor.  Let prisons "profit" 
from accepting these contracts.  Provide monetary incentives to 
prisons and their wardens for leading their institutions to self-
sufficiency. <P>
 
It won't be easy for the private-sector bidders, because prison labor 
is not easy to use.  Difficulties include security problems, lack of 
skills and good work habits, remote prison locations, and poor worker 
productivity.  At least at the beginning, the market value of prisoner 
labor will be very low and the quality of their work poor.  But both 
will improve as skills improve. 
 <P>
Across the country a million prisoners are serving time in jail.  Each 
month, 40,000 of them are released under mandatory supervision, on 
parole, or at the conclusion of their sentences.  Our streets would be 
safer and the crime rate lower if these men had a skill, a job, and 
the beginning of a future.

<title>du Pont--  The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>December 6, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>Should America replace its current income tax with a flat tax, a 
single, low-rate tax - say 19% - applied to ALL income above a 
personal exemption of, say, $36,000 for a family of four? 
 <P>
Yes, said the conservative team led by William F. Buckley, Jr. and 
former Democratic Governor Jerry Brown of California in a two-hour 
Firing Line debate taped at Texas Christian University.  Absolutely 
not, replied the liberals, captained by former U. S. Senator George 
McGovern and MIT economist Lester Thurow.  (Before reading on, you 
should know that I was a member of the conservative team.) The debate 
will be aired on PBS the week of December 18th. 
 <P>
The case for the flat tax is based upon three ideas:  it is fairer for 
all to pay the same rate; it will spur growth to create millions of 
jobs and billions of dollars in personal income, and the current 
income tax is grossly unfair, riddled with loopholes and preferences. 
 <P>
A flat tax will be fairer because everyone will pay it.  It will be 
progressive but not penalize effort, and all the special loopholes 
will be gone.  It will be simple enough for most people to fill out on 
a postcard. 
 <P>
As for growth, the National Center for Policy Analysis calculated that 
the flat tax proposed by Governor Brown in 1992 would create 2 million 
new jobs in two years and increase the Gross National Product by 10% 
by the year 2000. 
 <P>
Finally, few will disagree that our current tax system is 
fundamentally flawed and grossly unfair.  The government takes one-
third of what the average person earns each year (more if you are 
successful) and confiscates one-half of whatever is left when we die - 
the family farm, the small business we have built, or the savings we 
have worked so hard to accumulate. 
 <P>
Worse, the Congress opens and closes loopholes every year to reward 
its friends, punish its enemies, and, most important of all, to make 
sure its members are re-elected.  There have been 4,000 changes to the 
tax code since the last "reform" was enacted in 1986.  Our politicized 
tax code takes varying amounts of money from people who have earned 
it, and transfers it to people who haven't, but who the Congress 
thinks have a superior claim to it. 
<P> 
So who is for replacing this mess with a flat tax?  Well, the 
Washington Post:  "the ideal income tax is a flat percentage of all 
income above a threshold of $10,000."  President Clinton's chief of 
staff, Leon Panetta, introduced a flat tax bill as a member of 
Congress in 1982.  And 57% of the TCU students who expressed an 
opinion in a poll conducted prior to the debate favored a flat tax. 
 <P>
And who is against it?  Presumably Republican President Teddy 
Roosevelt, who helped enact the progressive income tax in 1913.  And 
Karl Marx, who initially popularized "a heavy graduated income tax" to 
redistribute income. 
 <P>
But most passionately, Lester Thurow, who confessed in a defining 
moment in the debate that if HE were writing the tax code it would 
contain a progressive consumption tax with top rates "way over 100%" 
so that the wealthy  would find it prohibitively expensive to buy the 
things they buy. "You couldn't have," he said, turning to Bill 
Buckley, "your boat."  
 <P>
Professor Thurow chose an interesting example, for the luxury tax on 
yachts - a mere 10%, not the 100%-plus he proposed - enacted by the 
liberals in 1990 to punish the rich nearly destroyed the U.S. boat-
building industry.  Those punished by the luxury tax (which also 
applied to aircraft and jewelry) turned out to be not the wealthy, but 
the thousands of working people thrown out of work and the taxpayers 
forced to pay $24 million in unemployment benefits to them.  And the 
luxury tax only collected $17 million.  So much for the Thurow theory 
of economics. 
 <P>
But the debate was more than sound and fury.  Senator McGovern came 
around to the view that the double taxation of company earnings was 
wrong.  And liberal economics writer Robert Kuttner conceded under 
fire that if a tax system raised the incomes of all but the wealthiest 
taxpayers 10%, and the wealthiest by 20%, it would still be a good 
thing.  Of course, he denied it could ever happen. 
 <P>
But no one on the left could satisfactorily answer Bill Buckley's 
opening question:  Why should a cab driver working 60 hours a week be 
punished for his extra effort by paying a higher tax rate than his 
neighbor who drove his hack only 40 hours?   
 <P>
Nor could they explain how the current tax system differed from what 
the American patriots listed in the Declaration of Independence as one 
of their grievances against the British King:   He has "sent hither 
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance." 
 <P>
That sounds an awful lot like the IRS.

<title>du Pont--  A Christmas Carol
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>
A Christmas Carol
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
It's not long until Christmas, a very special time for all families.  
In Washington, Christmas is a very special time, too.  The president 
has lit the national Christmas tree.  And lobbyists are beginning to 
think about what kinds of presents they would like to receive this 
year. 
 <P>
I've been rattling some of the packages under the national Christmas 
tree trying to guess what some companies and organizations could be 
getting. 
 <P>
Here's a nice present.  Let's see - it's from the Department of 
Agriculture's Market Promotion Program.  You know, a recent study from 
the Cato Institute pointed out that this department of the government 
spends $110 million a year underwriting the cost of promoting American 
products abroad. 
<P>
Let's see what's inside.  Well, there's $2.9 million to Pillsbury to 
advertise its muffins and pies in foreign countries.  Here's another 
$10 million to promote Sunkist oranges.  And look - $465,000 to 
advertise McDonald's Chicken McNuggets abroad.  That's so thoughtful.  
One of the great things about Christmas is the ability to help someone 
in need.  Without government help, how would McDonald's ever find 
half-a-million dollars to advertise its McNuggets?  
<P> 
The Cato Institute study also points out that:  "Martin Marietta 
Corporation charged the Pentagon $263,000 for a Smokey Robinson 
concert, $20,000 for the purchase of golf balls and $7,500 for a 1993 
office Christmas party.  Ecology and Environment, Inc., of Lancaster, 
New York, spent $243,000 of funds designated for environmental clean-
up on 'employee morale' and $37,000 on tennis lessons, bike races, 
golf tournaments and other entertainment."  As they say in Hollywood:  
That's entertainment! 
 <P>
The Cato Institute estimates that there are more than 125 government 
programs that subsidize private business.  In fiscal year 1995, more 
than $85 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on these programs.  
Now, let's see what else is here.  Oh, here's a big one.  The card 
says this one goes to the sugar industry.  Now isn't that nice:  $1.4 
billion in price supports.  I know the sugar industry will appreciate 
Congress' thoughtfulness--especially the 33 largest cane plantations 
which will receive more than $1 million each. 
 <P>
Of course, there are the gifts that keep on giving, too:  dairy price 
supports, which keep the price of milk much higher than it otherwise 
would be so that the dairy industry will profit.  Then there are gifts 
called "marketing orders" - regulations that govern how many oranges, 
almonds and other products can be grown. 
 <P>
Then there's President Clinton's Christmas shopping list--a few items 
he put in his latest budget.  For example, $333 million for the New 
Generation of Vehicles program, or the "Clean Car Initiative," which 
the White House says will "ensure the global competitiveness of the 
U.S. automobile industry."  That would be GM, Ford, and Chrysler, who 
collectively made nearly $10 billion in profits last year.  I guess a 
gift from the government of another $333 million would still be 
appreciated. 
 <P>
Of course, the suggestion of eliminating or even just slowing this 
government spending spree can result in people calling you a modern 
day Scrooge.  That association obviously misses two important points:  
First, nobody wants to hurt the Tiny Tims of this country; just the 
opposite.  Those who are trying to cut all of these presents to 
wealthy corporations are doing so precisely because they want to make 
sure there is enough for the Tiny Tims. 
 <P>
Second, associating budget-cutting with Scrooge implies that the 
federal government - like Scrooge - has a lot of money that it 
selfishly doesn't want to part with.  But the federal government 
doesn't have a surplus of money lying around.  That debt is the Ghost 
of Christmas Past.  Congress has often been generous in the past, so 
lobbyists continue to press for more presents.  And because we are 
moving into an election year, the congressional spirit of generosity 
towards big businesses can be stronger than usual. 
 <P>
For most of us, Christmas is about sharing, especially with those who 
have the least.  For Washington, Christmas can also be about sharing - 
sharing our tax dollars with those who have the most.  Of course, it's 
easy to be generous with other people's money - especially when its 
the next generation's.  And that's where the Ghost of Christmas Future 
comes in.  No nation will long prosper by stealing from its children.  
If the Congress is serious about cutting the growth in federal 
spending so that we don't leave future generations of American 
overwhelmed with debt, it must cut back on its corporate Yule Tide 
generosity. 
<P> 
Otherwise, how in the "Dickens" are we going to get federal spending 
under control?

<title>du Pont:   Maintaining the Value of the Dollar -- 12/22/95
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>



<center><i>December 20, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>
Maintaining the Value of the Dollar
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power "to 
coin money [and] regulate the value thereof." 
 <P>
Nowhere does the Constitution tell Congress how much money to coin, 
how it should be valued, or how the government should regulate these 
matters.  In 1913, the Congress gave the power to decide those issues 
to the Federal Reserve, which quickly became - and still remains - the 
most powerful economic institution in the nation. 
 <P>
As our nation's central bank, the Fed decides how much money will be 
available in our banking system to make loans.  So in addition to 
controlling the money supply, it largely controls short-term interest 
rates.  With control over the money supply and interest rates, the Fed 
then has enormous influence over real economic growth, unemployment, 
and inflation in our economy.    
 <P>
Most people know little - and care less - about monetary aggregates, 
discount rates, and other technical Fed issues.  But every American 
understands that a primary responsibility of the government is to 
maintain the value of our money.  A government that intentionally (or 
even unintentionally) erodes the value of earnings and savings is 
undermining current prosperity and the future prospects of its 
citizens.  Along with establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquillity and providing for the common defense - to quote the 
preamble to the Constitution - sound money,  a dollar "as good as 
gold," is the ranking economic priority of the nation. 
 <P>
The trouble is, that's not what the law says.  The Employment Act of 
1946, as amended by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, legally sets 
"full employment" as the primary goal of Federal Reserve policy.  This 
law requires the Fed to stimulate the economy with lower interest 
rates and the coining of more money whenever the unemployment rate 
rises.   
 <P>
Of course these two actions can quickly lead to higher inflation,  
which devalues our money.  Nevertheless,  whenever unemployment rises, 
even when inflation is already too high, the Fed is legally required 
to stimulate the economy.  So inflation ratchets higher and higher, 
until a recession occurs and moderates the inflation.  
 <P>
Such economic cycles roll through our economy much as weather fronts 
roll across the country.  But unlike storms, economic cycles build 
upon each other.  History has often seen that both at the trough of 
each new recession and at the peak of each cycle of expansion, 
inflation and unemployment were higher than they had been the time 
before.   
 <P>
So there is a "catch 22" in which higher inflation leads to higher 
unemployment.  Then under the Humphrey-Hawkins rule, the higher 
unemployment requires additional Fed stimulus, which in turn leads to 
even higher inflation.  These kind of cycles and pressures hinder the 
Fed's long run ability to maintain the value of our money.  As long as 
the Humphrey-Hawkins law remains unchanged, the value of our savings 
remains at risk. 
 <P>
Right now inflation is under control, and unemployment is low, so the 
Fed faces no dilemma.  But sooner or later the Fed will again face 
that hard choice of whether to obey the law and temporarily reduce 
unemployment at the cost of higher inflation, or violate the law and 
stick with price stability.  The Fed should not have to face such a 
choice.   
 <P>
Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) and Congressman Jim Saxton (R-NJ), who co-
chair Congress's Joint Economic Committee, have introduced legislation 
to end the Feds dilemma of choosing between full employment and low 
inflation. They would do so by repealing the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and 
replacing it with the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act. 
 <P>
This new legislation would change the Fed's policy mandate by 
establishing price stability as its primary mission.  It would no 
longer be required to stimulate the economy to create full employment, 
and could concentrate all its efforts on maintaining the value of the 
dollar by controlling inflation. 
 <P>
Mack and Saxton believe that in the long run, maintaining price 
stability is the best thing the Fed can do to keep unemployment down 
and encourage real growth in the economy, which in turn will create 
more jobs.  Thus, ironically, getting rid of the full employment 
Humphrey-Hawkins requirement is actually the best way to achieve full 
employment. 
 <P>
 
Maintaining the value of our money must be the Fed's first 
responsibility, and Congress should say so by law.

<h2>Spiritual Renewal</h2></center><P> 

[Today's the first day of the new year -- the perfect time to examine our 
personal weaknesses and the shortcomings of our society, and resolve to 
fix what needs fixing.]
<p>
In an essay published in the November issue of Hillsdale College's 
monthly journal, Imprimis, former Education Secretary William Bennett 
says that the last 30 years have been a period of cultural decline for 
America. During the last three decades, he says, "there was a 560 percent 
increase in violent crime; more than a 400 percent increase in illegitimate 
births; a quadrupling in divorces; a tripling of the percentage of children 
living in single-parent homes: more than a 200 percent increase in the 
teenage suicide rate; and a drop of 75 points in the average SAT scores of 
high school students." When it comes to social pathology, America sets 
the global pace. "We are at, or near, the top in rates of abortions, 
divorces, and unwed births," says Bennett. "We lead the industrialized 
world in murder, rape, and violent crime. And in elementary and 
secondary education, we are at, or near, the bottom in achievement 
scores."<p>

There are other, harder-to-measure "signs of decay." Bennett suggests 
that "there is a coarseness, a callousness, a cynicism. a banality, and a 
vulgarity to our time" and laments in particular the deleterious effect on 
children. "We live in a culture which at times seems almost dedicated to 
the corruption of the young, to assuring the loss of their innocence before 
their time," he says. Where are the protesters? Why doesn't anyone do 
anything? "We have become inured to the cultural rot that is setting in," 
concludes Bennett. "People are experiencing atrocity overload, losing 
their capacity for shock, disgust, and outrage."
<p>
Bennett insists that "the real crisis of our time is spiritual." He says that 
"our desires are turned toward the wrong things. And only when we turn 
them toward the right things -- toward enduring, noble, spiritual things -- 
will things get better." That's going to be rather difficult as long as there 
persists "a disturbing reluctance in our time to talk seriously about 
matters spiritual and religious." Bennett says that, "when millions of 
people stop believing in God, or when their belief is so attenuated as to 
be belief in name only, enormous public consequences follow. And when 
this is accompanied by an aversion to spiritual language by the political 
and intellectual class, the public consequences are even greater."
<p>
William Bennett recommends four steps toward "spiritual renewal." The 
first is to recognize the "intrinsic limits to what the state can do, 
particularly when it comes to imparting virtue, and forming and forging 
character, and providing peace to souls." The second is to reinvest public 
policy with "our deepest beliefs." The third is to "recover a sense of the 
fundamental purpose of education," which is moral instruction. Last, says 
Bennett, "we need to return religion to its proper place" in society -- no 
matter how much it may disconcert those who flee from faith.

<h2>Vincent Foster</h2></center><P> 

[More than two years after it occurred, the death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster continues to raise troubling questions.]
<p>
The body of White House Counsel Vincent Foster was discovered in Fort 
Marcy Park across the Potomac River from Washington DC, at 6 p.m. on 
July 20, 1993. The U.S. Park Police found a pistol in Foster's hand and 
quickly ruled the death a suicide. Nevertheless, a poll conducted by Time 
magazine and CNN two years later revealed that 65 percent of Americans 
do not accept the official verdict in the case.
<p>
Government investigators have ignored evidence suggesting that Foster's 
body was dumped in Fort Marcy Park, and that he may not have taken his 
own life. The suspicious nature of Foster's death, and his connection to 
the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals, make this one of the biggest 
news stories of the 1990s. Yet, only one reporter in America is 
investigating the Foster death on a full time basis. Christopher Ruddy 
began his probe as an investigative reporter for the New York Post in 
1993 . Now associated with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Ruddy 
continues his one-man crusade to find out what really happened to "the 
highest ranking federal official in more than 30 years [to die] under very 
suspicious circumstances."
<p>
Ruddy summarizes the many inconsistencies in the case in a new report 
available from the nonprofit Western Journalism Center entitled Vincent 
Foster: The Ruddy Investigation. Ruddy points out that a confidential 
Secret Service memo written on the night of Foster's death stated that 
"U.S. Park Police discovered the body of Vincent Foster in his car." He 
says a senior Park Police investigator admitted that she and her 
colleagues reached a verdict of suicide "prior to going up and looking at 
the body."
<p>
Three handwriting experts have declared Foster's so called suicide note a 
forgery. "A note torn into 28 pieces, leaving no fingerprints and said to 
have been written by Foster, was found almost a week after his death," 
says Ruddy, but it lacks the contents typical of a suicide note -- no 
mention of death, no farewell to loved ones, and so on. The lack of an 
accounting for Foster's whereabouts during the last five hours of his life 
is also problematic, says Ruddy, noting that "no one came forward to 
claim they had seen him alive at the park or even around Washington, 
that fateful afternoon."<p>

The suicide scene itself was atypical. Foster's body was neatly arranged. 
"The fired bullet was never found. No one heard the fatal shot," says 
Ruddy. "Trace analysis of Foster's shoes at the FBI lab found not a speck 
of soil on his shoes or clothing despite a 700-foot-plus trek through the 
heavily wooded park."
<p>
All Ruddy wants is straight answers to some simple questions. "If Foster 
didn't shoot himself . . . who did? Where? How did he really die? These 
are the questions investigators should have asked," says Ruddy. "Their 
answers lead to other, logical questions about the strong evidence that the 
body was moved to the park."

<h2>Terrorism</h2></center><P> 

[The threat to American security posed by Libyan and Iranian terrorists 
doesn't seem to loom as large today as it did in the early 1980s, but the 
threat remains.]
<p>
Former FBI agent Ray Wannall says that Iran and Libya have held 
grudges against the United States since at least the early 1980s. "Their 
terroristic threats against the U.S. were intensified following our raid on 
Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya in 1986, the accidental shooting down of an 
Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf in 1988, and the U.S. downing of two 
Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean the following year."
<p>
Wannall recalls that early in 1985 Muammar Qaddafi urged black 
American servicemen to leave the military and form a separate army 
because the United States "must be destroyed." In a 40-minute satellite 
address from Libya to a Nation of Islam convention in Chicago, Qaddafi 
declared: "This country must be destroyed. They refuse to accept you as 
American citizens. This means you are obliged to create a separate and 
independent state." Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, 
endorsed the Libyan dictator's remarks, saying, "Brother Qaddafi is a 
man the world does not understand."
<p>
In that 1985 speech, Qaddafi incited Farrakhan's followers to 
insurrection. "You have the force, you have the soldiers," said Qaddafi. 
"We are ready to give you arms, because your cause is just. We are with 
you. Don't worry. You have to trust us. We will fight together shoulder 
by shoulder. The final victory will be soon." Though claiming to have 
declined the offer of arms, Farrakhan did accept a $5 million interest-free 
loan from Qaddafi, ostensibly to underwrite a commercial enterprise to 
help black Americans create financial independence.
<p>
The Washington Times reported in 1985 that a radical Islamic 
infrastructure of terror has been established across the U.S., consisting of 
safehouses, weapons, ammunition, money, and systems to provide 
medical and legal aid, false identity papers, and transportation. Followers 
of Qaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini man this network, ready to 
spring into action when the word comes. Appearing before Congress the 
following year, FBI Director William Webster warned that three-fourths 
of the 2,000 Libyan students in the U.S. were financed by the Libyan 
government and could constitute a terrorist threat.
<p>
Former FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver Revell warned earlier 
this year that it is likely that a radical Islamic fundamentalist 
infrastructure has been firmly established in our country. The radical 
fundamentalists "support such organizations as Hezbollah, Hamas, and 
the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which are directly involved in terrorism and 
violently oppose the Israeli-PLO initiative," says Revell. "These 
organizations are aided and supported by Iran, including its diplomatic 
establishments and intelligence services, which makes them even more 
dangerous."<p>

Ray Wannall says the Iranians and the Libyans "have not tempered their 
threats in recent years. Nor has Louis Farrakhan given any sign of 
rejecting Qaddafi's avowed friendship and support. Jihad, the holy war 
waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty, is still being fought."

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[Medical Savings Accounts are an idea whose time has come. By 
returning control over medical choices to the individual, MSAs should 
rein in the spiraling costs of health care.]
<p>
Peter Ferrara of the National Center for Policy Analysis says that "health 
care costs are out of control" because the wrong people are paying the 
bills. The patients, the ones receiving medical care, do not generally pay 
their own bills. The bills are paid, for the most part, by third parties -- 
employers, insurance companies, or the government. The average 
American pays only one-fifth of his own health care costs. "Someone else 
pays the rest," says Ferrara, and that third-party payment system is what 
is driving up health care costs. Americans simply have no personal 
incentive for monitoring the costs of their health care and shopping 
around for less expensive alternatives.
<p>
The solution is simple: Take control over health care away from third 
parties and give it back to the people who are using it. Give them a 
personal, financial incentive for keeping costs down. Ferrara says it is 
only human nature for people to be careless, even extravagant shoppers 
"if we are spending someone else's money." And it's only natural for 
doctors and other health care providers to encourage us to take advantage 
of extra tests and procedures -- just to be on the safe side -- "if they know 
that we are not paying the bills." But Americans spend their own money 
in every other marketplace, and they make wiser decisions when they do 
so. Why, then, is the marketplace of medical care different from all the 
others?
<p>
1996 looks to be the year that Congress begins restoring economic sanity 
to our health care system. The Archer-Jacobs bill will encourage 
individuals and their employers to make tax-free deposits into Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs), which employees can draw on to cover 
ordinary health expenses. MSAs will let Americans choose the care they 
want and spend their health care dollars as they see fit, thereby providing 
a huge incentive to keep health costs down.
<p>
With Medical Savings Accounts, employees would be spending their own 
money for non-catastrophic health care. As a result, Peter Ferrara says, 
"they would have excellent financial incentives to control the cost of such 
care. They would seek to avoid unnecessary care, look for quality plus 
value in doctors and hospitals, and consider whether the services were 
worth the prices." Medical Savings Accounts would have other benefits 
too, such as reduced administrative costs.
<p>
If Americans switch to Medical Savings Accounts in large numbers, 
health care spending will decline dramatically. MSAs will give 
consumers more choices and more control in health care decisions. These 
accounts will be portable too, not linked to continued employment at a 
specific location. MSA funds can be applied to any type of health care, 
and are not subject to the approval of insurers or health maintenance 
organizations. Medical Savings Accounts will harness the power of our 
remarkable free-enterprise system to make American medical care 
affordable again.<p>

<h2>"No-Win Situation" in Bosnia </h2></center><P> 
 
[Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer says that sending U.S.  
troops to Bosnia is a "serious mistake" and a "no-win situation."]  
  <P>
In a recent issue of The Weekly Standard, Charles Krauthammer argues  
that U.S. involvement in Bosnia will have one of two unacceptable  
outcomes. Either it will end in "a humiliating retreat . . . after some  
incident involving a major loss of American life and cries from the  
Congress and the American people for withdrawal. Or, more likely, we  
will persevere, indeed escalate our involvement, send more troops to  
protect existing troops and be caught in a long-term, static, and defensive  
deployment with painful losses, ambiguous rules of engagement,  
escalating friction among NATO allies . . . and no way out."  
  <P>
Krauthammer says American troops are going into Bosnia with "no  
definable objective, no identifiable enemy, no exit strategy." Being the  
"sole remaining superpower" and having the "finest, most powerful  
military" do not obligate the United States to be the world's peacekeeper.  
"It is decidedly not the role of a superpower to place itself between the  
combatants in a civil war of marginal importance to the world balance of  
power . . . among unreconciled parties who have already shown a  
propensity for killing and kidnapping peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"Peacekeeping is the job of small countries with no particular interest in  
the outcome of a conflict," says Krauthammer. "It is far harder for a  
superpower to remain neutral, and even harder to be perceived as neutral,  
in most conflicts. And, in the Bosnian war, in particular, the United States  
has been decidedly not neutral. We have made our sympathies with the  
Bosnian Muslim side abundantly clear in our declarations, in our use of  
air power, and indeed in our promises to arm the Bosnian government  
even as we act as peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"If the combatants in Bosnia are serious about ending the fighting and  
accepting roughly the distribution of territory and roughly the balance of  
power now on the ground, then they should do it and enforce it  
themselves," says Krauthammer. "If they are not, then there is no peace to  
keep. And between such antagonists is no place to interpose American  
troops."  
  <P>
Krauthammer concedes that "reneging" on the promise to deploy troops  
"would be a blow to NATO," but contends that "following through and  
actually sending the troops would be worse." He describes as "nonsense"  
the argument that "we must intervene in Bosnia because of the  
continuing, indeed intensifying, threat the war poses to European  
stability." He says "the war is in fact contracting" and that the great  
nations of Europe have no reason to make war "over the control of this  
cursed, tragic piece of land." While acknowledging that American  
credibility is damaged "whenever the United States makes a commitment  
and then reneges on it," Krauthammer insists that the blame belongs to  
"the administration that made that foolish promise without proper  
reflection." Congress, on the other hand, should be applauded for "trying  
to avert the consequences of that ill-considered promise."

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 9, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> Dole on NAFTA</h2></center><P> 
 [The efforts of Senator Bob Dole to distance himself from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement could signal a historic shift in U.S. trade 
policy.] 
 <P>
"The callous behavior of Bill Clinton and his trade allies in Congress in 
bulldozing the GATT and NAFTA treaties through in the face of the 
overwhelming opposition of the American people set the stage for the 
current counterrevolution on the trade front," says William Gill of the 
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. The seeds of that 
counterrevolution "were first sewn in 1990," says Gill, with publication 
of a book called Trade Wars Against America. That book persuaded Pat 
Buchanan and other conservative leaders that so-called free trade is "a 
destructive aberration that goes against the Constitution -- and the 
protectionist policy of George Washington and the other Founders -- the 
policy that built America." 
 <P>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, intends to 
keep publicizing the defects of free trade "until public opinion finally 
forces the government to repudiate this insane policy that is strangling 
America." As casualties of our country's self-defeating trade policy, Gill 
cites the nearly 80,000 mid-level managers to be laid off by AT&T, the 
12,000 bank employees made redundant by the pending merger of 
Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, the 1800 millworkers left stranded 
by the shutdown of Bethlehem Steel, and the 3200 textile workers let 
loose by Fruit of the Loom. 
 <P>
"Nowhere has the frenzy to cut jobs been more apparent than in the 
nation's once invincible defense industries," says Gill, noting that 
1,300,000 defense workers have lost their jobs since 1988, and 700,000 
more will be let go in the next two years. "Although most of these two 
million jobs will have disappeared because of cuts in the federal budget, a 
significant number can be traced to trade," says Gill. "Billions of dollars 
have been spent by the armed services on foreign products, many of them 
high-tech items invented in America and once made here before 
production was shipped overseas." As if that weren't bad enough, "it has 
become fashionable for U.S. defense companies to enter into joint 
ventures with foreign firms and governments in the production of some 
of our most sophisticated weaponry." Venture partners such as Japan 
have sold the technology acquired in this manner to our enemies. 
 <P>
Pat Buchanan has made protectionism the cornerstone of his bid for the 
Republican presidential nomination, and the-public's favorable response 
to that theme has not escaped the notice of front-running Republican 
presidential candidate Bob Dole. Last November, Dole expressed 
"significant disappointment" with the results of NAFTA, warned his 
colleagues in the Senate that America is "choking on new agreements," 
and called for a "cooling-off period" on trade pacts. "If Bob Dole sticks to 
his new guns on trade, and if he gets the Republican nomination in 1996, 
he will outflank Bill Clinton on an issue that now has most Americans up 
in arms against it," says Gill.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 10, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Abolish the Department of Education</h2></center><P> 
[Abolishing the Department of Education would curb the federal 
government's baleful influence on public schools and save as much as 
$70 billion a year in taxpayers' money.] 
 
 <P>
Early in the 1976 presidential elections, the National Education 
Association threw its important support behind a relatively unknown 
candidate named Jimmy Carter. The NEA endorsement gave visibility to 
the obscure, one-term Georgia governor, adding momentum to his 
ultimately-successful campaign. The endorsement came with a price, 
however, one that President Carter gladly paid. The establishment of the 
federal Department of Education was the quid pro quo that the National 
Education Association received for the push it provided to the political 
presumptions of a pandering peanut farmer. 
 <P>
Of course, the federal government was meddling in education long before 
then, but the creation of a separate cabinet-level department has greatly 
exacerbated the problem. Congress now appropriates $70 billion per year 
for what it calls education. Roughly half of this amount goes to the 
administration of 244 separate programs in the Department of Education. 
The rest is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 overlapping 
programs. There are more than 90 separate federal preschool and child 
care programs, administered by eleven different agencies and 20 different 
offices. There are 86 separate federal teacher training programs, 
administered by nine different departments. There are at least 46 separate 
federal youth development programs, administered by eight different 
agencies. None of these programs is necessary, and most of them are 
redundant. 
 <P>
The Federal Government's 30-year experiment with education funding 
has failed miserably. Illiteracy has reached epidemic proportions, and 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have dropped so dramatically that the 
Educational Testing Service is now adding nearly 100 points to every 
score to conceal this embarrassing decline. Abolishing the Department of 
Education will not adversely affect our public schools, which flourished 
before the department was created and will survive its termination. 
Federal spending in public schools is only about six percent of their total 
budget, and precious little of it supports legitimate academic pursuits. 
Layoffs of superfluous administrative personnel could easily offset a six-
percent downsizing. 
 <P>
Establishing a federal Department of Education may have worked 
wonders for the National Education Association, but it has done nothing 
positive for America's public schools. In fact, it has had an entirely 
deleterious effect, further weakening local control and adding costly 
government regulations at the expense of academic curricula. The fact 
that it hasn't worked is a good judgment for abolishing the Department of 
Education, but the best argument of all is that the Department is simply 
unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution  makes no mention of education, 
and provides no authority for the federal government to meddle in local 
schools. The federal government has inserted itself into numerous areas 
beyond its constitutional jurisdiction, and it's time for Americans to insist 
that it return to its proper concerns. Eliminating the Department of 
Education would be a good start.

Duplantier</a> <br>
January 11, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> MSAs Could Save Medicare</h2></center><P> 
[Employees at the Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indianapolis are 
staunch supporters of the proposed Medicare reform called the Medical 
Savings Account. That's because all 1200 employees already have MSAs] 
 
 <P>
The Golden Rule Insurance Company is America's leading writer of 
individual health policies, with 800,000 policyholders and nearly $800 
million in annual revenue. Golden Rule is also the nation's number-one 
promoter of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), having signed 
up nearly 1000 companies for its MSA group plan. The company is so 
keen on Medical Savings Accounts that it even established an MSA 
group plan for its own employees two years ago, says reporter Bob Jones 
in a recent issue of World magazine. "Golden Rule Chairman Pat Rooney 
has made it his mission to show that MSAs actually work." 
 <P>
Jones explains the logic behind MSAs: "Health care costs will be 
controlled only when people start spending their own money instead of 
the insurance company's. To accomplish this, Medicare would offer 
seniors a new, high-deductible policy. The higher deductible means lower 
premiums; the savings are deposited to an account from which 
individuals can pay- for medical bills that fall below the deductible. 
When expenses in any year exceed the deductible," Jones continues, "the 
catastrophic insurance kicks in, paying 100 percent of remaining bills 
(instead of the 80 percent now covered by Medicare)." 
 <P>
If an individual spends less than his deductible, whatever remains in his 
MSA is "rolled over into a tax-free annuity that can be used to pay future 
medical bills or provide long-term care. This system," Jones says, 
"provides an incentive for seniors to become smart health care 
consumers, costs them no more than the current system, and at the same 
time offers more flexibility and greater benefits." 
 <P>
Under proposed Medicare reforms, "MSAs would be tax deductible like 
IRAs, making them enormously attractive not only to private businesses, 
but also to the millions of self-employed. Even without that tax 
exemption," says Jones, "MSAs have been hugely successful at a few 
pioneering companies like Golden Rule [where] health care costs 
dropped 40 percent the first year that MSAs were implemented." Medical 
Savings Accounts are even more popular among employees, says Jones, 
citing a 1994 study that found a satisfaction level of 98 percent. MSAs 
have even encouraged Golden Rule employees to take better care of 
themselves. "More than a quarter of employees are taking advantage of 
some medical service they never used before, simply because the money 
is there and they can choose how to spend it without having to worry that 
it won't be covered under their policy," says Jones. 
 <P>
The current Medicare trust fund surplus of $130 billion is expected to 
dwindle to zero in seven years. "By 2004," says Jones, "Medicare will 
face a deficit of more than $100 billion." Medical Savings Accounts are 
just what the doctor ordered to avert that grim prospect.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 12, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Judicial Usurpation</h2></center><P> 
 
[By extending rights to illegal aliens, federal judges undermine the value 
of American citizenship and de-legitimize self-government.]
<P>
Washington Times columnist Paul Craig Roberts warns that self-
government may be "a thing of the past" in America. He cites a federal 
judge's recent order blocking implementation of California's Proposition 
187, which received 59 percent of the votes cast in a statewide election in 
1994. "The judge," says Roberts, "ruled that the right of illegal aliens to 
publicly-provided benefits, such as education and welfare, exceeded the 
right of citizens to utilize the democratic process to limit or curtail their 
financial obligations to people illegally residing in our country."
<P>
The judge's ruling is just the most recent example of judicial usurpation 
in what has become "a frontal assault on citizenship and the exercise of 
self-rule," says Roberts. "It demeans citizenship by eliminating any 
difference between the claims of citizens and illegal aliens to taxpayer-
provided benefits. And it destroys self-rule by denying citizens the right 
to limit their taxpaying responsibilities through the exercise of the 
democratic process."
<P>
Judges have been undermining citizenship and self-rule for decades. 
Roberts cites a 1982 Supreme Court decision in which five of the nine 
justices "decided that the State of Texas could not restrict the use of its 
limited resources to educate only lawful residents. The court's cavalier 
disregard of the rights of U.S. citizens was not based on any law or legal 
precedent," says Roberts. "It rested entirely on the subjective feelings of 
five justices that it was good social policy for taxpayers to be made to 
finance public education for illegal aliens."
<P>
Roberts notes that Chief Justice Warren Burger and the three other 
dissenting justices "criticized their brethren for violating the separation of 
powers by assuming a policymaking role. The Constitution, they said, 
does not vest the court with 'the authority to strike down laws because 
they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy."' That's exactly 
what the High Court did and got away with, however, thereby 
demonstrating "how readily blackrobed social engineers substitute their 
own policy predilections for the will of the people."
<P>
Judicial decisions "based on feelings and not law" are unworthy of our 
respect, says Roberts. "If Americans are to be ruled by sociology, we 
have no need of law schools. There is nothing in a legal background to 
give jurists guidance on the 'correct' social policy," and every judge who 
oversteps himself in this manner should be swiftly censured. "The 
elevation of social engineering above law and self-rule has dire 
implications," says Roberts, noting that it may now be plausible for 
illegal aliens to resist deportation by claiming the rights of citizenship. 
This much is clear: no republic can survive without respect for the rule of 
law. When the personal agendas of powerful men replace objective 
standards, when emotion usurps reason, our God-given rights cease to be 
secure and we can no longer rely on the truth and the law to defend 
ourselves from injustice.

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 15, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Long-Term Commitment in Bosnia </h2></center><P>

[Will American troops return from Bosnia in 12 months or less -- or will 
they still be there 20 years from now?] 
 <P>
John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation warns that "there are very serious 
questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the 
[Bosnian peace] accord and the effectiveness of the American military 
intervention to implement it." For starters, how realistic is a Bosnian state 
composed of "two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat 
Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic"? For such a state to be viable, 
says Hillen, "the two separate entities will have to show the most 
extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that 
have never been in evidence in Bosnia." Hillen contends that "the accord 
does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-
determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and 
offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central 
government." 
 <P>
The Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself is pretty fragile. "There is 
considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance," says Hillen. 
Local support for the peace accord is also tenuous. "All three Bosnian 
Serbs present-at the- Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, 
and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its 
initialing." Among the issues left unsettled by the accord was the question 
of "how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that 
would serve the foreign policies of the central government." With such 
considerations in mind, Hillen concludes that "the United States will 
incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia" far beyond 
its one-year commitment. 
 <P>
"There are also serious questions about the military feasibility of NATO's 
Implementation Force," says John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives" have yet to 
be identified. The Bosnian peace implementation plan "strips any 
advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a 
passive and reactive posture." Despite President Clinton's assertions of a 
limited deployment, "the peace accord opens the door for NATO 
peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring 
the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian 
workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free 
elections, and responding to violence against civilians." 
 <P>
The continuing expansion of peacekeeping duties -- and the perception 
that early withdrawal of U.S. troops could jeopardize the NATO mission 
-- would seem to dictate an extended American presence. "European 
allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable 
for American forces in Bosnia," says John Hillen. "President Chirac of 
France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 
years." Clinton knows that the American public would never agree in 
advance to such "a protracted and costly intervention in an area of 
marginal strategic interest," but is counting on our reluctant support for 
his fait accompli. "Once the prestige, blood, and treasure of the United 
States are engaged," the Europeans hope that "the U.S. will have to see 
the intervention through to its conclusion."

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 16, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Foster Facts</h2></center>
<P> 

[There 's something shy about the 1993 death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster. Could he have known too much about the scandals 
dogging the President?]
<P>
Investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy has identified numerous 
inconsistencies in the official investigations of Vincent Foster's so-called 
suicide. First, there was no suicide note. Then there was a suicide note, 
only it didn't actually mention suicide or bid farewell to family members. 
The 28 torn pieces of the note were found in a briefcase that had been 
searched at least once already, the note had no fingerprints on it, and 
three handwriting experts have declared it a forgery.
<P>
The condition of the body was odd, to say the least. Ruddy says two 
paramedics observed that the slain White House official appeared to be 
"ready for the coffin,'' with arms and legs neatly arranged and head facing 
straight up. There was less blood than might be expected "from a gunshot 
wound to a living person's head." There was no trace of soil on Foster's 
shoes, as there surely would have been had he walked through dense 
brush to the secluded spot where his-body was found. The FBI found 
carpet fibers all over Foster's clothing, but never bothered to determine 
where or why it had come into contact with carpeting.
<P>
The gun was found in Foster's hand, a rarity for suicides. Nevertheless, 
there were no fingerprints on the weapon, says Ruddy. Although Foster 
supposedly shot himself in the mouth, there was "no visible blood 
splatter" on the gun, the recoil did not "chip or damage teeth," and no 
gunpowder was found on his tongue. No one heard the fatal shot, and the 
fired bullet was "never found, despite exhaustive searches."
<P>
Ruddy says Park Police did not "bother to interview park neighbors or 
regular visitors." They failed to "take statements from all persons found 
in the park." They misrepresented the statement of at least one witness. 
They failed to seal Foster's office and "gave away key crime scene 
evidence, such as his beeper and papers, within hours of his death." They 
neglected to have the gun tested "until one week after" the death was 
ruled a suicide. All of the 35-millimeter crime scene photos have 
disappeared, as have seven Polaroids taken at the scene by a Park Police 
officer. The X-rays mentioned in the autopsy report are also missing.
<P>
During the first official investigation of the Foster death, a witness who 
discovered the body was allegedly badgered by- the FBI "to alter his 
testimony on critical issues." Ruddy says another witness charges that the 
FBI lied in claiming he "could not identify a man he saw in the park." 
Investigators simply ignored the statements of other witnesses "who said 
two men, not Foster, were in and around his car just before the body was 
found." The lead prosecutor in the second official probe "resigned after 
being thwarted" in his efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation. 
Somebody pretty powerful must not want us to know what really 
happened to Vincent Foster.

<br>
January 17, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Musical Madness</h2>
</center>
<P>
["Popular musical messages contribute to an increasingly violent and 
morally bankrupt society. "]
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Focus on the Family 
research manager Robert Waliszewski argues that "musical messages are 
capable of planting dangerous ideas in the minds of young people or 
fueling those which already exist." He provides samples of some of the 
more offensive rap and heavy-metal lyrics and cites documented accounts 
of the violent crimes they've inspired. Although there is much evidence 
that "a strong correlation exists between a steady diet of mayhem and the 
urge to act on it," Waliszewski concedes that "no one knows what the 
cumulative effect will be when a young person consumes a steady diet of 
violent music."
<P>
Musically inspired sexual assaults and murders are just the tip of the 
iceberg. "For every teenager who makes the 6 o'clock news by carrying 
out an act of violence, there are thousands more whose values are being 
fashioned subtly through disturbing musical messages," says 
Waliszewski. "They're learning that demeaning women is not only 
acceptable, but [even] preferable to treating women with respect. They're 
hearing accounts that glorify serial killers and praise drive-by shootings. 
They're being bombarded with the messages that parents and other 
authorities are not worthy of respect; that life revolves around drugs, 
money, and perverse forms of sexual activity -- to be obtained by force, if 
necessary."
<P>
The content of contemporary music is qualitatively different from that of 
even the recent past. "Three decades ago, not one popular song 
encouraged robbery, rape, murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle 
disputes," says Waliszewski. "In today's popular music, all these themes 
can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo. Unfortunately, America's 
streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect this fact. What's more, 
since violent lyrics are a relatively new phenomenon, no one knows the 
results of raising a generation on this type of musical diet. In addition, 
teenagers have greater access to (and are listening to) far more music than 
they have in past generations." Waliszewski notes that, by the end of high 
school, the average teenager has listened to more than 10,000 hours of 
rock music.
<P>
Violent crime increased by over 500 percent during the three decades 
ending in 1990. There may be a host of factors contributing to this social 
pathology, but "violence in the media" is certainly one of them. "Music 
industry insiders often shirk responsibility by saying their music reflects 
society but does not impact it," Waliszewski observes. "Some music 
industry insiders have argued that, as performers and 'actors on the stage,' 
musicians cannot be held responsible for their fans' criminal behavior. 
Their anti-social messages are not to be taken seriously because...they 
don't actually mean what they say."  Such claims are disingenuous at best. 
Whether they know what they're doing or not, the purveyors of this 
madness should be held accountable for the damage they've done to an 
entire generation of young Americans.

<h2>Filth on Film</h2></center><P>

["By the time the average child leaves elementary school, he will have 
witnessed 8,000 murders and i00, 000 other acts of violence on TV."]
<P>
"TV, if used for responsible purposes, can have a positive impact," says 
Focus on the Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "Yet, 
positive television is only a small portion of what America is watching. 
For many, the 'education' received from televised programming can have 
a detrimental effect." Waliszewski cites a 1993 report by the American 
Psychological Association that declared emphatically that "higher levels 
of viewing violence on television are correlated with increased 
acceptance of aggressive attitudes and increased aggressive behavior." 
Surveys of prison inmates imprisoned for violent crimes reveal that as 
many as a third "reported having consciously imitated criminal 
techniques learned from television pro ,rams."
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Waliszewski argues 
that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence, and sexualized 
violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its early pioneers," 
adding that "public sentiment would not have embraced the likes of The 
Playboy Channel, MTV, Spice, HBO and Showtime." But ugliness and 
depravity are pervasive on television today, and "TV talk shows are just 
the tip of the iceberg. With its offering of offensive sitcoms, cartoons, 
made-for-TV-movies, film releases and graphic news footage, television 
has sunk to new lows."
<P>
Waliszewski warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to 
those being taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message 
to believe." Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem 
to suggest that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the 
lion's share of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most 
impressionable years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average 
American child graduates [from] high school, he or she will have spent 
nearly 20,000 hours in front of a television" -- nearly twice the amount of 
time spent in school.
<P>
Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood. 
Waliszewski laments the passing of the Production Code, which 
discouraged directors from giving in to their baser instincts. "Since the 
days of silent movies, the power of a motion picture, with its potential to 
negatively impact society, has not gone unnoticed. For that reason, 
industry pioneers drafted a self-regulatory code of ethics in 1930 that 
governed the content of movies," prohibiting films that undermined the 
sanctity of home and marriage, disparaged the clergy, blasphemed, or in 
any way lowered the standards of viewers. That code has long since been 
abandoned.
<P>
Waliszewski concedes that "films do not 'cause' anyone to commit 
destructive acts. However, they can, and do, shape the values of the 
watchers." He notes that films like Natural Born Killers and Menace II 
Society have encouraged numerous impressionable viewers to imitate the 
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there. 
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a 
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws 
and lawkeepers."

["Industry executives claim there is no conclusive evidence  
demonstrating that video game violence affects young people." Recent  
research, however, show that claim is false.] 
 <P>
"In 1990, the National Coalition on Television Violence found that nine  
of 12 research studies on the impact of violent video games on children  
and adolescents reported harmful effects," says Jerry Melchisedeck of  
Focus on the Family. In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in  
Us: The Frightening Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth,  
Melchisedeck cites research identifying "a short-term relationship  
between playing violent games and increased aggressive behavior in  
younger children." Other research suggests that "the ill effects of video  
games are worse than those of TV because children actively control the  
violence rather than passively view it. In other words, the more children  
practice violent acts, the more likely they are to perform violent acts." 
 <P>
Jerry Melchisedeck says one researcher "reported that 40 out of 47 top  
video games he surveyed centered on violence, and 13 of those contained  
subthemes that emphasized the idea of women as victims." That same  
researcher "concluded that there are no gray areas in the behavior of  
game characters, and that players are rarely required to reflect or make  
contextual judgments." The manufacturers and distributors of violent  
video games resort to the usual dodge to justify their poisonous products.  
They insist they're only giving the customers what they want. "If  
consumer demand is the industry's guiding principle," says Melchisedeck,  
"then the future of video and computer gaming holds products that are  
progressively violent and realistically three-dimensional." 
 <P>
The demand for increasing levels of "realism," if you can call it that, has  
ominous implications. Video games now outsell Hollywood films, and  
that has movie moguls murmuring. Hollywood's getting in on the action,  
developing "interactive" movies that allow gamers gorged on two- 
dimensional gore to immerse themselves in cinematic savagery. 
 <P>
The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only non- 
educational diversion available to them. Electronic mail is another. E- 
mail allows for the uncensored global transfer of words; sound; artistic,  
photographic, and videographic images; and computer software.  
Pornographers and pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse  
possibilities. 
 <P>
"Like the public library, the Internet provides access to volumes of up-to- 
date facts and data," says Jerry Melchisedeck. "Millions use it in the same  
manner as previous generations have referenced hardbound  
encyclopedias. For some, however, the Internet is a means of propagating  
their obscene, often violent, inclinations under the guise of First  
Amendment freedom. Access to this disturbing fare is as easy as a click  
of a button." Melchisedeck warns that "parents must not look to the  
government to protect their children. They must take an active role in  
monitoring the types of information" that the Internet delivers directly  
into their homes.

<h2>Idahoans Lead Health Care Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Can you name the two most progressive communities in America? When it comes to innovative approaches to health care, Jersey City, New Jersey and Ada County, Idaho are true trailblazers. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
In 1994, Jersey City, New Jersey became the first local government in 
America to offer its employees the health insurance option of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs). Fewer than 200 of the city's nearly 3,000 
employees signed on at the outset, but even that small number saved Jersey 
City $21,000 in insurance premiums in the first three months that the plan 
was in use. In 1995, Ada County, Idaho followed suit with an MSA-based 
health insurance plan that County Commissioner Gary Glenn says was 
"designed to provide Ada County employees significantly enhanced health 
insurance coverage at a significantly reduced cost to the taxpayer." 
Roughly 170 out of 900 Ada County employees agreed to switch to MSAs, 
saving taxpayers $87,000 a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing enhanced coverage at a reduced cost may sound like "voodoo 
economics," but the explanation is simple. MSA plans pay 100 percent of a 
policyholder's health care expenses, but rely on a high deductible to keep 
costs down. The high-deductible policies are much cheaper than traditional 
low-deductible plans. Part of the money saved goes into Medical Savings 
Accounts set up for employees. Workers use the MSAs to pay their minor 
medical bills until they reach the deductible. Because policyholders get to 
keep whatever funds are left in their MSAs at the end of the year, they 
have a strong incentive to dicker with their doctors, to take better care 
of themselves, and to forgo unnecessary tests and treatment. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
An editorial in the Idaho Statesmen last summer described Medical Savings 
Accounts as "a great way to save money, promote lower overall health-care 
costs, and make consumers a more active and equal partner in the health 
equation." An MSA plan "can save money because it encourages workers to 
shop around. Bargain hunters can motivate hospitals and doctors to 
compete," said the newspaper. "As long as medical providers and insurance 
companies are running the show, consumers have little control over cost and 
little incentive to worry about it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ada County Commissioner Gary Glenn thinks the Medical Savings Account is 
"the wave of the future" and takes pride in his county's status as "the 
second public employer in the nation to try this option." An MSA plan "puts 
the patient in charge," says Glenn, who insists that "Americans are as 
capable of making decisions about health care as they are about every other 
product and service they buy." Everyone's a winner with MSAs. "Taxpayers 
win because they will have to pay less to cover their public employees," 
says Glenn. "Employees win because they have the freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions and maybe save some money in the process. And the 
country wins because it will bring down the cost of health care in 
general."

<title>Duplantier: Why America Must Cut Immigration -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>Why America Must Cut Immigration </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Immigration has been, and can continue to be, in the national interest -- 
if properly regulated." </i></blockquote>
<P> 
The United States issues 675,000 immigrant visas a year. Senator Alan 
Simpson of Wyoming thinks that's far too many. As chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Immigration, Simpson has proposed cutting the number to 
540,000, a 20 percent reduction. "The first and most important reason [for 
reducing immigration] is that the American people desire it," says Simpson. 
If Congress fails to take the initiative on this matter, he argues, "the 
people in the states and local communities of this country will most surely 
take it into their own hands to make the badly needed changes." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason the American people want a reduction in immigration is "to allow 
the historically high flow of immigrants who have entered in the past 
several years to assimilate, to learn English . . . and to become 
integrated into the American economy." Simpson says that Americans "want 
criminal aliens swiftly expelled from this country. They want assurances 
that immigrants will not become a burden on the public welfare system. They 
want to know that American workers, particularly workers and students just 
entering the job market, will have a fair chance at the jobs offered by 
American employers -- and that wages of U.S. workers will not be undercut 
by foreign workers overjoyed to receive a fraction of what Americans earn." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the immigration of family members, Simpson argues that 
"those opportunities should be reserved for the 'nuclear family' of 
citizens and permanent residents." He argues that "our present policy of 
giving preference to more distant family members . . . leads to the entry 
of in-laws of in-laws and persons who have only the most distant kinship 
relationship to the original immigrants -- or even none at all." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Simpson believes that it is in the national interest to "restrict 
the immigration of unskilled workers, those who would directly compete with 
American workers entering the job market as a result of new limitations on 
the use of public assistance." He contends that "responsible immigration 
reform must also consider the more than one-third of a million Americans" 
who lost their jobs in the past year. "Of particular concern," he says, 
"are Americans who are laid off only to see their former jobs lawfully 
performed by temporary foreign workers.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Alan Simpson's proposed legislation to revise immigration policy is 
based on the following common-sense principles: "Persons who are here 
illegally, particularly criminal aliens, should be quickly removed from the 
country through the reform of our detention and deportation process -- and 
while here should not be able to either work or obtain most forms of public 
assistance. Persons seeking to come legally should be swiftly united with 
their close family members in this country or . . . expeditiously and 
effectively screened so that they may take the jobs for which no qualified 
American is available. Finally, the overall number of immigrants should be 
reduced for at least five years."

<title>Duplantier: Feminists Ignore Successful Women  -- 2/8/96</title>

<h2>Feminists Ignore Successful Women </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>More than six million American women own their own businesses. Yet, for 
some strange reason, you'll never hear a feminist trumpeting these 
triumphs. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
Feminists seem determined to "wave aside the achievements of the individual 
for the collectivist utopia of group success," says Elizabeth Larson in a 
recent issue of The Freeman, a monthly journal published by the Foundation 
for Economic Education. Larson argues that such feminist-supported policies 
as affirmative action are actually detrimental to women. "The American 
working woman pays a high price for the position or promotion she receives 
from affirmative action," says Larson, and that price is "the unspoken 
assumption that she was not the 'best man' for the job." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular instance or not, the 
fact remains that affirmative action tends to make the qualifications of 
all women seem suspect -- with sad, but certain consequences. "Resentment 
against an individual case of hiring by quota ferments into resentment 
against all members of the privileged group," says Larson. Although 
affirmative action is supposed to remedy the effects of discrimination, in 
reality it only perpetuates it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Supporters of affirmative action for women play fast and loose with their 
figures. The so-called wage gap between men and women is "neither as wide 
nor as unbridgeable as it is portrayed," notes Larson. "Once you stop 
lumping all women of all ages in all fields together and using that 
resulting dollar figure as representative of the average American working 
woman, the gap narrows. Comparing the wages of women and men of the same 
age, with similar experience, training, and years of uninterrupted time in 
their field yields a much more optimistic picture of how women fare today." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson says "the gaps that do still exist are likely due to the fewer 
continuous years women have been in the workforce. Women who have never 
interrupted their careers for any reason now earn at least 98 percent as 
much as their male counterparts." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson contends that "many feminists labor under assumptions about the 
workplace and the meaning of success that are both unreasonable and 
unrealistic. They seem to believe that making an attempt at her job in and 
of itself guarantees a woman success." It's not that easy, says Larson. 
"Just because a woman wants to be the first female CEO of her company does 
not mean she is entitled to the position, or that if she fails to make it 
that far up the corporate ladder it is someone else's fault. Luck, drive, 
brains, connections, education, and, yes, good looks, can all play a part 
in the promotions any worker -- male, or female -- receives." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are many women who have "genuine, free-market success stories to 
tell," but you won't hear about them from feminists, because that would 
undercut their campaign for government intervention. "An eagerness to rely 
on the government," says Elizabeth Larson, "betrays a lack of confidence in 
women's abilities to achieve financial and personal independence."

<h2>Property Rights Are Under Attack!</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Do Americans really own anything anymore, or is everything we possess just 
on loan to us from the federal government? </i></blockquote>
<P> 
"Mass confiscation [of personal property] has become politically 
fashionable," reports James Bovard in a recent issue of The Freeman, the 
monthly journal of the Foundation for Economic Education. "Politicians and 
the courts have created an overwhelming presumption in favor of the 
government's right to seize control over private land, private homes, 
boats, and cars, and even the cash in people's wallets." Bovard warns that 
government's power to seize private property "directly subjugates citizens 
to the capricious will" of public officials. And those officials don't need 
much of a pretext to justify their actions. Bovard says, "Thousands of 
American citizens are being stripped of their property on the basis of 
rumors and unsubstantiated assertions made by the government's confidential 
informants." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is this the American way? Whatever happened to personal property rights and 
the presumption of innocence? How did we get to this state of affairs? 
"Beginning in 1970, Congress enacted legislation to permit government to 
seize property of Mafia organizations and big-time drug smugglers," 
explains Bovard. More forfeiture laws were enacted as the years went on, 
with the result that "federal agents can now seize private property under 
more than 200 different statutes. From 1985 to 1991, the number of federal 
seizures of property under asset forfeiture laws increased by 1500 
percent." Federal officials lost interest in crime lords and drug kingpins. 
"Unfortunately, the more forfeiture laws legislatures enacted, the less 
attention police seem to pay to major criminals," says Bovard. Today, the 
vast majority of citizens forfeiting their property to the federal 
government under drug laws "are never formally charged with any crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Bovard asserts that nowadays "the mere suspicion of a government official 
is sufficient proof to nullify all claims that a citizen legitimately owns 
his property." He notes that "forfeiture laws are turning some federal 
agents into the modern-day equivalent of horse thieves. Ranchers are being 
victimized by seizures based on allegations of violations of environmental 
laws." By confiscating the vehicles that ranchers use to earn their 
livelihood, federal agents effectively put them out of business. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to the Justice Department's 1992 annual report on asset seizures, 
"No property may be seized unless the government has probable cause to 
believe that it is subject to forfeiture." That sounds good in theory, says 
Bovard, but that's not the way it works. "In reality, government officials 
are seizing people's property based solely on 'hearsay' -- rumor and gossip 
-- from anonymous informants." Bovard considers it more than likely that 
some policemen have "invented anonymous informants to give them a pretext 
to take private property they covet." The old double standard comes into 
play here with a vengeance. "While government agents can use hearsay 
evidence to justify a seizure," says Bovard, "property owners are usually 
prohibited from offering hearsay evidence to support their claims."

<h2>Welfare Makes The Problem Worse</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Welfare spending in New York City has exacerbated the Big Apple's 
monumental social problems. What's the solution? Surely not more spending!</i></blockquote>
<P> 

"Over the last 30 years, New York City and State have devoted an increasing 
share of their revenues to the most dysfunctional members of society," 
writes Heather MacDonald in the Winter issue of the Manhattan Institute's 
City Journal, "and now social service spending constitutes the largest 
share of both city and state budgets. Yet, as spending grew, so did the 
social problems that spending was supposed to solve." A reasonable person 
might have concluded that throwing more money at the problems would 
probably do more harm than good. The official response, however, was quite 
the opposite. "The government," notes MacDonald, "responding by adding more 
programs." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heather MacDonald concludes that "New York City's enormous commitment to 
social welfare spending has not stemmed social breakdown." If anything, it 
has made matters worse. "Social service spending has sucked out of the 
private economy capital that could have been used to create jobs, the best 
mechanism for ending poverty," says MacDonald. "But, in response to 
inner-city poverty, welfare advocates call for further social service 
spending, thereby accelerating the flight of business from the city." In 
addition to stifling job creation, welfare programs also discourage the 
formation of traditional families -- which are also a time-tested means of 
overcoming poverty. "The two-parent family is all but extinct in some 
neighborhoods, rendered superfluous by welfare's subsidy for illegitimacy," 
says MacDonald. "The resulting increase in juvenile delinquency, truancy, 
and teen pregnancy brings in more social services, which in turn further 
erode the incentives for personal responsibility." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Social service programs "reward dysfunctional behavior and subordinate the 
well-being of children to dubious ideology," says MacDonald. "Families 
create sound individuals by imposing discipline and moral values on 
children. Even if a government program could do this, these programs do 
not; for years, imposing values has been anathema to social workers, who 
studiously avoid making judgments about the 'life-style choices' of their 
clients." MacDonald argues that social workers confuse "moral deficit with 
material need." The more irresponsible a person is, the more financial 
assistance he receives. "Just as the birth of illegitimate children 
provides the mother with an income, so will deplorable child-rearing bring 
her a benefit." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
These perverse incentives are the direct result of "contemporary social 
worker's refusal to make moral judgments," says Heather MacDonald. "Rather 
than taking children or adults away from destructive environments, the 
reigning service ethic dictates that they remain 'in the community' and 'in 
the family' for treatment." Such wishful thinking ignores the fact that 
"usually there is no real community to go back to. Treating a juvenile 
delinquent in the war-torn environment that produced him does not look like 
a recipe for success." MacDonald argues that, when social workers respond 
to "unsustainable ways of life" as though they were "short-term crises," 
their efforts are doomed to failure.

<title>Duplantier: Implications Of The VMI Court Case -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>Implications Of The VMI Court Case </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>A Supreme Court decision favoring Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department in the VMI sex-discrimination case could open up a can of worms. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
For the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has treated sex-discrimination 
cases differently from race-discrimination cases. In race cases, the Court 
applies "strict scrutiny," under the assumption that racial classifications 
are inherently "suspect" and unconstitutional (except, of course, when 
affirmative action is involved). Up till now, the Court has not considered 
gender discrimination to be inherently suspect and has applied what it 
calls "intermediate scrutiny" to cases of this nature. This standard seems 
to have worked well, and there is no evidence that this approach is either 
unworkable or unjust. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As part of its effort to force the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) to 
open its doors to women, the Justice Department under Attorney General 
Janet Reno has asked the Supreme Court to add sex to its list of "suspect 
classes," thereby requiring the Court to apply "strict scrutiny" when 
considering cases involving charges of sex discrimination. Applying strict 
scrutiny to the VMI case would lead not only to the sexual integration of 
VMI, but to the sexual integration of all single-sex colleges. The fact 
that most single-sex colleges are women's colleges poses a dilemma for 
feminists and other politically-correct types. Many have no problem 
advocating the forced integration of men's colleges, but recognize that 
applying such a policy even-handedly would mean the elimination of 
women-only colleges as well. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A Court ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied in gender cases would 
invite lawsuits against every public and private institution in America 
that makes distinctions between men and women. The effect on U.S. Armed 
Forces would be revolutionary. Our military services now provide separate 
facilities for men and women. This would be a no-no under strict scrutiny. 
The strength and endurance standards for men and women in the military are 
now substantially different. How could this be justified under strict 
scrutiny? Leave and discharge policies are different for men and women, 
recognizing pregnancy as a circumstance to be given special consideration. 
Military regulations regarding clothing and personal appearance are 
different for the two sexes. Such distinctions would not be tolerated in an 
irrational world of coercive uniformity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about women's athletic programs at co-ed schools and colleges? Would 
they have to be merged with the men's programs? Would an equal number of 
boys and girls be required for every team? Would they have to share locker 
rooms and showers? Every such consideration raises the specter of a 
thousand lawsuits. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Supreme Court decides to apply strict scrutiny in sex-discrimination 
cases, what will the impact be on homosexual issues such as military 
service, same-sex marriage, and adoption? Will prohibitions against 
government funding of abortion be considered sexist? We would not have to 
ask such questions if the Supreme Court could be trusted to resist the 
temptation of judicial activism.

<title>Duplantier: DEFENSE BILL VETO -- 2/19/96</title>

<h2>Defense Bill Veto</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>President Clinton has demonstrated his commitment to "peacemaking" 
in Bosnia. At the same time, however, he has rejected efforts to provide 
for the defense of the United States.</blockquote></i>

<P>
The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.

The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by Clinton represented "a 
serious effort to end America's present, absolute vulnerability to missile 
attack," says Frank Gaffney of the Coalition to Defend America. The bill 
would have required that the entire United States be protected against 
missile attack by the year 2003. Clinton's objection to the bill was that it 
would have put American policy "on a collision course with the ABM 
Treaty." That's what it would have done, all right, and it's about time we 
abrogated an outmoded, ill-advised treaty with a country that no longer 
exists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Bipartisan majorities on Capitol Hill recognize that the time has come 
for the American people to be protected against missile attacks from all 
quarters by deployed defensive systems," says Gaffney. "Mr. Clinton, on 
the other hand, believes the American people should not be protected by 
such systems, lest a 1972 treaty that effectively prohibits their 
deployment be jeopardized." This difference of opinion as to whether 
America should be defended or "deliberately left vulnerable, and perhaps 
exposed, to missile attack" could be a defining issue in the 1996 
presidential campaign.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gaffney points out that vetoes of defense authorization bills helped 
decide two previous presidential contests. In 1978, President Jimmy 
Carter vetoed the Pentagon's fiscal 1979 authorization legislation 
because he thought it provided too much money for defense and because 
he objected to several of the projects it authorized. "Ronald Reagan was 
able to use this veto as a prime example of the differences between his 
determination to rebuild America's military and Mr. Carter's refusal to 
do so," recalls Gaffney. Giving that veto symbolic value contributed 
greatly to Reagan's election.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Then, in 1988, President Reagan vetoed the fiscal 1989 defense 
authorization bill on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient 
resources for defense and in particular for anti-missile systems," says 
Gaffney. "This action once again showcased differences between 
Democrats (who then controlled Congress) and Republicans on security 
policy, contributing to the sound drubbing Vice President George Bush 
gave Michael Dukakis in the '88 election."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Clinton's veto of the 1996 defense authorization bill could help 
decide the outcome of the 1996 presidential election, says Gaffney, 
provided the Republican candidates "make the most of it by clearly 
establishing that, if elected, one of their first orders of business will be the prompt deployment of U.S. missile defenses."

<title>Duplantier: MARDI GRAS -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>Mardi Gras</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Today is Mardi Gras in New Orleans. As tractors tow the papier-mache 
and crepe-covered floats of the Rex parade down oak-lined St. Charles 
Avenue to Canal Street, parade-goers of all ages will shout their 
traditional plea to the trinket-laden riders: "Throw me something, 
Mister!"
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone's a beggar on Carnival Day in New Orleans, pandering for 
handouts that come in the form of cast-metal doubloons, strings of 
multicolored beads, and oversized plastic cigars, toothbrushes and other 
oddities. It's a day of self-indulgence, and it's all in fun, but it takes 
hundreds of well-trained policemen, posted at every corner of the six-
mile parade route, to keep the merriment from getting out of hand. As 
much as New Orleanians love their Mardi Gras, you'd be hardpressed to 
find anyone who isn't glad to see it end on Ash Wednesday, the 
beginning of Lent.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine people hanging out in the streets all year long waiting for 
someone to toss them a few freebies, having nothing better to do in the 
meantime other than look for ways to get into trouble. A single day of 
community-wide excess may serve as a relief valve for the pressures that 
build up during the year, but socially-sanctioned self-indulgence on a 
continuing basis makes no sense at all. Yet, that's just what we have with 
our federal welfare system.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation argues that welfare "reduces 
work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent 
families." The government dole is "extremely efficient at replacing self-
sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes 
and eliminating poverty." Welfare is especially detrimental to children -- 
increasing the dropout rate and the unwed pregnancy and delinquency 
rates, and reducing longterm earning potential.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Foreign aid is nothing more than international welfare -- a global, year-
long Carnival -- and the effects are just as harmful. "Not only has the 
U.S. foreign aid program failed to promote economic growth in less 
developed countries, but many recipient countries are worse off because 
of it," say Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, also of the Heritage 
Foundation. They argue that, "instead of helping poor countries lift 
themselves out of poverty, aid often impedes their economic growth 
while damaging their fragile economies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe it's time the federal government took a tip from the City of New 
Orleans. If the politicians in Washington are determined to continue 
offering handouts and encouraging self-destructive behavior, let them 
confine this madness to a single day of the year. Let all the recipients of 
government largesse -- from individual entitlements to corporate 
subsidies to foreign aid -- gather in Washington for an annual one-day 
blowout. Let them jockey for position along the streets of the nation's 
capital as they wait for costumed congressmen to roll past on decorated 
floats. Let them all scream "Throw me something, Mister!" at the top of 
their lungs and fight among themselves for the goodies tossed their way. 
Then they can go home and behave themselves for the rest of the year.

<h2>Crime Decline</h2>


<i><blockquote>
It's an article of faith among liberals that prison sentences are no 
deterrent to criminal behavior, but statistics prove that would-be 
lawbreakers do consider the likelihood of punishment before resorting to 
crime.</blockquote></i>

<P>
Attorney Bruce Fein reports that "punishing and stigmatizing criminals 
is working. Violent crime is tumbling as prison populations swell, chain 
gangs are returning for serious offenders, three-time felons confront 
mandatory life sentences, juveniles are treated as adults for the 
commission of murderous crimes, shame is a growing feature of novel 
punishments, and parole is falling into disrepute."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's the good news, says Fein, in a recent Washington Times editorial. 
"The bad news is that the mass media and so-called penal experts are 
generally displaying fierce resistance to the good news." They don't want 
to relinquish their moral superiority. They can't bear to admit that the 
soft-hearted and fuzzy-headed policies they supported for so many years 
were monumental failures. They refuse to concede that common sense 
really does work. Fein says these superior beings are infatuated with 
rehabilitation programs and committed to fighting "the alleged 'root' 
causes of crime, i.e., poverty, unemployment, malparenting, ill 
education, and discrimination." Ideology keeps them from 
"acknowledging the obvious" and forces them to resort to 
"unconstructive whining" over get-tough policies.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bruce Fein concedes that "violent crime remains intolerably high." But 
the recent decline is "a welcome relief" from the skyrocketing rates of the 
1960s and 1970s. "During those Great Society decades, treatment and 
rehabilitation were [misrepresented] as inexpensive and enlightened 
answers to crime, and criminal behavior was generally blamed on 
societal ills or psychiatric ailments." Fein contends that these misguided 
notions led to lighter sentences for convicted felons, and that such 
leniency served only to embolden the criminally inclined. Gradually, this 
sentimentalized view of the criminal as victim infected the general 
population, undermining the "cultural deterrence of crime" as manifested 
by "ostracism or community debasement of criminals for choosing evil." 
Fein says that such social penalties have a tremendous impact on crime 
and cites Japan as a nation where they continue to be used effectively.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But stiff sentences and societal condemnation are making a comeback. 
"Unforgiving prison terms for felons work to reduce crime because an 
enormous proportion is attributable to recidivism," says Fein. Needless to 
say, repeat offenders commit no crimes while incarcerated. The longer 
they stay in prison, the fewer crimes they commit. Holding criminals 
responsible for their own behavior is back in style. Fading fast is the idea 
that criminals "deserved indulgence and sympathy because their 
depravity was engendered by societal wrongs or imperfections, or the 
happenstance of environmental factors."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fein argues that the "community devastation wrought by such imbecility 
concentrated the minds of ordinary citizens, legislatures, and judges 
wonderfully. No longer are criminals viewed as victims of fate," he says, 
"but as evil creatures who have chosen to indulge their anti-social vices 
and passions; they should be shamed and disgraced."

<h2>Love Canal</h2>


<i><blockquote>
At a recent press conference announcing that the Occidental Chemical 
Corporation had agreed to pay $129 million to clean up toxic waste at 
Love Canal, Attorney General Janet Reno observed that it was only fair 
to expect people to clean up their own mess. She neglected to mention, 
however, that government played a major role in creating this particular 
mess.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone knows that Occidental's predecessor company, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics, buried toxic waste at Love Canal more than 40 
years ago. What they don't know, says Michael Fumento of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, is that "Hooker tried desperately to 
convince the city of Niagara Falls (where Love Canal is located) not to 
build on the site." Citing a 1981 article in Reason magazine, Furnento 
recounts how the Niagara Falls school board "applied massive pressure 
to obtain the land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health 
hazards. Finally, Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar 
bill. It insisted, though, that the land . . . was under no circumstances to 
be excavated."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Niagara Falls ignored that stipulation. "Instead, the city decided to build 
a housing development on the site.... Then it sold the plots to 
unsuspecting home buyers." The fact is that Hooker did not endanger the 
public when it dumped its waste in an undeveloped area. "It was the 
city's choice to bring people" to that location, says Fumento. "The bad 
guy wasn't the big faceless corporation; it was your friendly city 
government."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento notes that "nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmental reporter for the 
local paper began a series of articles telling the people that they were 
sitting on a toxic waste site." Then a feeding frenzy began. "The media 
descended on the town and relayed to the outside world every sneeze, 
every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love Canal 
residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by toxic waste." 
Bureaucrats and politicians saw an opportunity to grandstand. "The EPA 
and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost. Ultimately, tens of millions of dollars were spent evacuating the 
residents."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento reports that subsequent studies by state and federal agencies 
"found that Love Canal residents had no more illnesses than would be 
expected in any other area of similar size." Attorney General Janet Reno 
neglected to mention this at the news conference, possibly because more 
than $100 million of the Occidental settlement is going to be 
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund, which was created in the 
wake of Love Canal hysteria. EPA Administrator Carol Browner used 
the occasion to warn that "Congress is attempting to roll back the 
environmental health protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
That contention is easily refuted, says Fumento. "Since there was never 
any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously Superfund brought no 
protection there."

<h2>Space Academy</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Some day in the not too distant future, you may get to watch your child 
or grandchild graduate from the U.S. Space Academy. On that proud 
day, you can both thank Lt. General Daniel Graham for making that 
opportunity possible.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Lt. General Daniel Graham had become convinced towards the end of 
his life that U.S. space policy "needed fundamental overhaul. Space had 
become a ravenous consumer of resources when it should have become a 
source of national wealth and a bastion of national security," he 
lamented in his autobiography, Confessions of a Cold Warrior Graham 
recognized that new and emerging technology could "make the 
taxpayers' space investments provide a substantial return," if only the 
government could be persuaded to "open space to the general public and 
the private sector." Advances in technology had "removed the principal 
constraints on the pursuit of practical goals in space, and enabled both 
commercial and government programs that would be well-supported by 
the public."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The commercial exploitation of space is no longer just a dream. If 
Americans want to capitalize on the boundless possibilities, however, we 
must plan accordingly. "No U.S. space policy, however well-formulated, 
can bear fruit without attention to the people who will be called upon to 
carry out the policy," General Graham warned. "Space efforts require a 
constant input of bright and properly educated young people into those 
sectors of government, industry and commerce that deal with space."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Graham knew that generating "enthusiasm for space among young 
people" would be simple enough. "They want to be a part of the grand 
adventure of space activity," he observed. "But, beyond getting them 
excited, we have little advice to give them about how to realize their 
dreams except to advise excelling in one or another hard-science 
discipline." Graham's visionary solution was "a Space Academy along 
the lines of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy where young 
Americans, and perhaps youngsters from other lands, could be steeped in 
the disciplines pertinent to space. They could be graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in space science, ready for employment in the 
aerospace industry, commercial space enterprises, or government civil 
and military space programs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Graham envisioned a comprehensive program of space 
scholarship, including disciplines such as "space medicine, space law, 
space diplomacy, space construction, and space literature." He saw "no 
difficulty whatever in establishing a space-oriented curriculum for the 
cadets of a Space Academy meeting all necessary criteria for the 
granting of degrees." He also knew that "the standards for entry into 
such an academy could be set very high and still not accommodate all 
young people who would apply and qualify. A student body with 
computer literacy, technical aptitude, physical fitness and high personal 
standards would be easily assembled, as well as a competent, highly 
motivated faculty." General Graham predicted that "graduates of such a 
Space Academy would be in great demand, and the aspirations of young 
people interested in a career in space-related activity could be channeled 
effectively."

<h2>Organized Crime</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The face of organized crime in America is dramatically changing. " 
The challenge is to defend ourselves against it without giving up the 
freedoms we hold dear.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
"In the 1980s, the government began cracking down on organized 
crime," reports Robert McGarvey in the February issue of the American 
Legion magazine. The results were nothing short of spectacular. 
"Nowadays, the chiefs of the American Mafia . . . are languishing in 
prison, leaving the organizations they left behind in disarray." Their 
sudden departure created an equal employment opportunity for other 
minority gangsters, however, and "literally dozens of ethnic crime 
groups have emerged to fill the void." McGarvey reports that 
"Colombian drug barons earn billions of dollars annually in the United 
States. Japanese gangsters . . . claim a mounting presence in Hawaii, 
along with scattered outposts on the West Coast. Various Mexican 
criminals . . . wreak havoc in U.S. border states."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most menacing of all are the Triad gang of Hong Kong and the so-called 
Russian Mafia. "The Triads' business is heroin," says McGarvey. "Some 
60 percent of the drugs entering the United States are traced to Triad 
sources, primarily Burmese poppy fields that have long been controlled 
by Chinese criminals." The Triads have not neglected to diversify, 
however. Their other interests, according to McGarvey, include 
"extortion, prostitution, international car theft, and their much-
publicized involvement in alien smuggling," the latter netting them more 
than $3 billion a year. McGarvey warns that "the Triads are building 
alliances with U.S. street gangs," whose teenaged members "represent a 
sizable, often coldblooded army that will take on even the most vicious 
jobs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Russian Mafia, composed of former KGB officers and various gulag 
graduates, "now ranks as one of law enforcement's top priorities," says 
McGarvey. A deputy assistant FBI director recently told Congress that 
the Russian Mafia may soon be "the principal organized crime group in 
the United States." He warns that its members are extremely violent and 
have already linked up with Italian and Colombian comrades in crime. 
The FBI's New York bureau chief reports that he has "transferred agents 
and other scarce resources out of traditional organized crime 
investigations and foreign counterintelligence to concentrate on Russian 
crime."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey asserts that "America's new Russian gangsters also rank as 
perhaps the nation's most versatile criminals." He says that "the most 
fearsome aspect of the Russian Mafia is its access to the ill-guarded 
military warehouses of the old USSR. This makes the 'Moscow mob' 
instant leaders on the international arms black market, where they sell 
everything from automatic weapons to rocket launchers. Russian thugs 
even are alleged to be dealing in weapons-grade radioactive materiel."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey worries that "U.S. law enforcement currently is ill-equipped 
to battle groups like the Triads and the Russian Mafia." We should be 
concerned about the damage to our society from "corruption, violence, 
and wholesale theft," but we should never sacrifice our democratic 
freedoms in the fight against internal enemies.

<title>Duplantier: UNION TACTICS -- 2/27/96</title>

<h2>Union Tactics</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The purpose of all cartels is to raise prices above competitive levels and 
to redistribute income from consumers to cartel members. When unions 
successfully raise the price of labor above free-market levels, much of the 
employers' higher labor costs are passed on to consumers."
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Trade unions have often been described as "cartels of workers which 
collude to push their wages above free-market levels," observes Thomas 
DiLorenzo in a recent issue of The Freeman, the monthly journal of the 
Foundation for Economic Education. "Competition and the entry of new 
(and lower-priced) competitors are the bane of all cartels." That's why 
unions strive "to block competition from nonunion workers through 
special-interest legislation and regulation, and by committing acts of 
violence and intimidation against nonunion workers."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, and nonunion chains make grocery 
union organizers see red. The avowed objective of these organizers is "to 
either raise the prices of nonunion grocery stores or drive those stores 
into bankruptcy." DiLorenzo observes that "driving one's competitors out 
of business may be good for aspiring monopolists, but is bad for 
consumers and those workers" whose companies are targeted for 
destruction. "Low-income Americans will be hurt the most, as they 
always are when prices rise." With their typically low profit margins, 
grocery chains are especially vulnerable to "union harassment 
campaigns."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The preferred tactic among grocery union organizers is pressuring a 
company "to accept a union without ever permitting its employees to vote 
on whether or not they want a union," says DiLorenzo. "This is a stark 
admission that, at least in the grocery industry, unionization cannot 
succeed if employees are allowed to vote on whether or not they want a 
union. Extortion has replaced organizing." Unable to win a fair election, 
union organizers "intimidate and threaten to extort employers until they 
sign a contract with the union without holding a union certification 
election."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DiLorenzo contends that the "flexible labor relations" essential to a 
company's efficiency are "rarely -- if ever -- found in unionized firms. 
Rigid job descriptions and restrictive work practices ratchet up costs and 
prices at unionized grocery chains, all to the detriment of the consumer. 
These higher costs and prices also threaten the job security of unionized 
employees who work for uncompetitive businesses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The American workplace is "awash in regulations, most of which are 
impossible for mere humans to understand, let alone comply with." 
Unions have "taken advantage of this fact to impose regulatory costs on 
nonunion firms." DiLorenzo says that "regulation is so out of control that 
any business person in America, at any one time, is most certainly 
'guilty' of noncompliance with at least some regulations." He charges 
that unions "use regulation as a tool for extorting 'concessions' from 
nonunion employers, [including] recognition of the union without a 
representation election." DiLorenzo concludes that "deregulation of labor 
relations -- and of the economy in general -- is sorely needed if the 
American economy is to prosper."

<h2>Demise of the Home Economy
</h2>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The industrial revolution created material prosperity in America, but in 
the process it also destroyed the traditional household economy. Did we 
lose more than we gained?
</I></blockquote>
<P>

"Before 1840, the vast majority of Americans -- over 90 percent -- lived 
on farms or in small villages: the life of the cottage," observes Allan 
Carlson of the Rockford Institute in the February issue of The Family in 
America. "While many adults had a specialized trade, most households 
aimed at -- and commonly achieved -- self-sufficiency in food, clothing, 
and other essentials." Children were an integral part of this home-based 
economy. "By age five, children were active participants in the work of 
the household, as were elderly or unmarried kin. Husbands and wives 
were bound together in a partnership of home-centered work," notes 
Carlson. "Family loyalties rested not only on love and emotional 
companionship, but also on need: wife and husband, child and parent 
were intertwined."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Carlson contends that this traditional home-based economy "began to 
change, about 1840, as industrialists harnessed the logic of the division 
of labor to the steam engine and to finance capital. The results included 
a considerable increase in productive efficiency; an accelerated output of 
goods such as wheels, shoes, and clothing; and a sharp lowering of their 
costs relative to the work of cobblers, tailors, smiths, and other displaced 
craftsmen. Decentralized, small, family-held enterprises gave way to 
large, centralized, joint-stock, limited-liability firms."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most important, this dramatic change was what made high taxes 
and Big Government possible. "Although families could now purchase 
an array of cheaper consumer goods, the price this new freedom exacted 
was the surrender of productive family functions such as candlemaking, 
food processing, and weaving to the industrial sphere. It also meant 
moving the family production of goods, normally uncounted, into a cash 
nexus, where it would be counted and transformed into profit (and, later, 
into taxes as well)." Carlson charges that "the immediate interest of 
employers lay in keeping wages low and the pool of potential workers 
large. Wives, husbands, and children competed against each other in the 
sale of their labor, driving wages downward, to the level of individual 
subsistence."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stifling of the productivity of the home had drastic ramifications. "In 
this new order, the home became separated from the factory and the 
office, a revolutionary shift in living patterns. People now worked in one 
place . . . and slept in another," Carlson observes. "With mothers and 
fathers pulled out of the 'cottage,' the care of children became a social 
question; again, something altogether new in human affairs. Time for 
tending the cottage garden or the family cow disappeared, and families 
were forced to enter the market to buy all of their food. In general terms, 
the ownership of productive property such as land and tools gave way to 
a reliance on cash wages and factory-produced goods. Economic loyalties 
were no longer rooted in family relationships, but increasingly owed to 
the employing firm."

<h2>
Revival of the Home Economy
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>More than a million American children are now schooled at home. If 
present trends continue, homeschooling may one day become the 
preferred method of education in America, as it was before 1840.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

The modern social-welfare state arose in the hundred years between 
1840 and 1940, assuming "nurturing functions that had throughout 
human history belonged to the family. The first and most important of 
these was education," writes Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute in 
the February issue of The Family in America. "Beginning in the 1840s, 
in the same time and place as early industrialization, the common school 
movement, backed by compulsory education laws, took children out of 
the home for moral and practical training."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The social-welfare state soon "captured other family functions as well," 
says Carlson. "Reform schools, the 'child saving' movement, the 
juvenile-justice system, and the vast child abuse and neglect apparatus 
all grew." Even child labor laws "further expanded the modern state's 
socialization of children's time." State-funded pension programs "erased 
other basic features of the family economy: security between the 
generations and care of the ill and infirm. Until modern times, grown 
children and other relatives provided security and support to elderly 
persons, particularly the indigent and the invalid. Adults bore an 
obligation, moral as well as social and legal, to care for their own; they 
also knew that their security might depend someday on the children they 
had reared and on the example they had set in giving care to their own 
parents. New systems of state pensions and health insurance shattered 
these security bonds between the generations of a family."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Allan Carlson contends that the growing homeschooling movement 
began in the 1970s as a reaction to "specific events -- federal efforts to 
regulate public and parochial education, Supreme Court decisions 
blessing the sexual revolution, the breakdown of discipline and standards 
in local schools, the appearance of books . . . encouraging a radical break 
with existing patterns of learning." These events, he says, "inspired a 
critical mass of pioneers to bring their children home. They soon 
discovered that, indeed, there's no place like home for the education of 
their children. These pioneer families also found that the nature of their 
family relationships changed, almost overnight. No longer mere 
consumers sharing the same roof and television set, they had become 
members of a learning enterprise who needed each other and who 
profited -- morally and practically -- from each other."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The pioneers of homeschooling made other pleasant discoveries. "Most 
of these families began to find ways to bring other functions home as 
well -- gardening, food preservation, or a family business -- and they 
tasted the satisfactions of an independence unknown to several American 
generations." Carlson argues that homeschooling "is the most promising 
effort at family institutional reconstruction undertaken in America 
during the last 150 years. The family, born to and naturally residing in 
the symbolic 'cottage,' then uprooted and ravaged by factory and state, 
has found a path back to its true home."

<h2>
Origins of the Income Tax 
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>

We've heard a lot of talk in recent months 
about the many benefits of 
the flat-rate income tax, but we rarely hear anything about the marvelous 
federal income tax we used to have -- none at all!

</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>



In 1862, the year preceding his famous Emancipation Proclamation, 
President Abraham Lincoln inaugurated America's first income tax law, 
styling it an "excise tax" to circumvent the prohibition against direct 
taxation found in Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. 
Within two years he had opted for a graduated income tax, summarily 
rejecting the principle of equality under the law which had prevailed in 
America until that time. It was only as a temporary measure that 
Lincoln's income tax achieved passage. Despite efforts to extend it, the 
tax lapsed in 1872, two years after its prescribed expiration. But the 
appetite of politicians and their bosses for an unlimited source of revenue 
and power had been whetted, and the freedom that Americans had 
enjoyed for less than a century would soon be imperiled again.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt sought unsuccessfully to have 
Congress enact an income tax law. In the first year of the administration 
that followed, however, President William Howard Taft acquiesced in 
the passage of a tariff bill with a rider providing for the taxation of 
corporation incomes. He also agreed to a resolution calling for a 
constitutional amendment to establish an income tax. On February 
3,1913, the State Department certified 38 states as having ratified the 
amendment. Only 36 of the 48 states then in the union were needed for 
ratification, but in recent years scholars have discovered evidence that no 
more than 27 states ratified the amendment in the prescribed manner. 
Properly ratified or not, the Sixteenth Amendment has had the full force 
of law for more than 80 years now. Indeed, this assault on the very 
liberties that the Constitution was designed to safeguard has been 
enforced more zealously than any law, constitutional or statutory, in all 
of American history.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Sixteenth Amendment empowered the federal government "to lay 
and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without 
apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any 
census or enumeration." It also had the effect of diminishing at least 
three of the rights guaranteed by previous amendments to the 
Constitution: the right to due process in the Fifth Amendment; the right 
of the States and the people to retain all powers not expressly delegated 
to the Federal Government in the Tenth Amendment, and the right to be 
free from involuntary servitude, as protected by the Thirteenth 
Amendment.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Flat tax advocates abound nowadays, but it's hard to find any supporters 
of the tax system our Founding Fathers devised. Why is that? Could it be 
that powerful groups in our society have a vested interest in maintaining 
the peculiar institution of the income tax?

<h2>
Conservative Clinton
</h2>

<P>  
<blockquote><i>"The era of big government is over. We know big government does not have all the answers. There is not a program for every problem."</i></blockquote> 
<P>
  
Who was that man who gave the 1996 State of the Union address? He  
looked like Bill Clinton, but he sounded like Ronald Reagan -- until he got  
down to particulars. Then the New Democrat turned back into an Old  
Democrat, and we found out that the era of big government isn't over after  
all, but just playing possum. President Clinton thinks that big government  
still has all the answers, and a program for every problem. Unfortunately,  
the answers are wrong, and the programs just make the problems worse. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton still wants to socialize the health care industry -- the  
biggest big-government power grab in decades! In a fit of false  
compassion, he would force actuaries to ignore the hard reality of risk and  
insure the uninsurable, thereby bankrupting yet another vital American  
industry. The President wants to expand federal authority by calling for  
"community partnerships with local police forces" and the investigation of  
local gangs by federal agencies. He declared that "we must end the deadly  
scourge of domestic violence." But whom did he mean by we? Big  
government, of course. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The President insisted that "every classroom in America must be connected  
to the information superhighway, with computers, good software, and well- 
trained teachers." But who's going to do the connecting? And who's going  
to pay for this "technology initiative"? Why, a "national partnership," of  
course. That's another pretext for federal intervention in areas reserved to  
the states by our U.S. Constitution! Clinton wants local schools to adopt  
"national standards," but the federal government has neither the authority  
to establish such standards, nor the integrity to resist politicizing them.  
Clinton called for more federal spending for his national service program,  
cash grants to top high school graduates, expansion of the student loan  
program, and a so-called "GI Bill for America's Workers." That doesn't  
sound like cutting back big government. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



President Clinton also called for more taxpayer spending for "drug  
education," even though the $2 billion of federal funds squandered so far  
have had no measurable impact on drug abuse. He asserted that all schools  
should teach "character education: good values and good citizenship." Will  
the federal government establish national character standards, too? Will  
these standards be as far removed from right reason and reality as were the  
outrageous U.S. History Standards? Doesn't Bill Clinton know that the best  
way to teach values is by example? The President even went so far as to  
recommend uniforms for schoolchildren. The era of big government is  
clearly not over when the nation's chief executive officer is preoccupied  
with such local concerns. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



No, the era of big government is not over yet, but the era of defending it  
certainly is. Bill Clinton's desperate bid to recast himself as a conservative  
is a tacit admission that liberalism is philosophically bankrupt.

<h2> Reading Experts Speak Out 
</h2>


<P><blockquote><i> When the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education invited public  
comment on proposed curriculum reforms for state schools, he did not  
anticipate a critique from 40 of the nation's top linguistic experts. 
</i></blockquote><P> 

Last July, Massachusetts Commissioner of Education Dr. Robert Antonucci  
received a letter signed by 40 linguistic experts, expressing their dismay  
that the state's new standards for the teaching of reading in public schools  
give an uncritical endorsement to the Whole Language method. In a cover  
letter, linguistics professor David Pesetsky and neurologist Dr. Janis  
Melvold identified themselves and their 38 co-signers as "experts on  
language and reading" hailing from "seven Massachusetts institutions,"  
their ranks including "three members of the National Academy of  
Sciences, four presidents of the Linguistic Society of America, three  
directors of major research training programs, and the authors of two of the  
leading books on language for the general public." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold pointed out that the Whole Language approach is  
"widely blamed for serious declines in reading achievement" in other  
states, and speculated that "the recent decline in Massachusetts could be  
connected to the increased use of Whole Language methodology." They  
warned that the proposed new standards "point in exactly the wrong  
direction -- away from a curriculum that takes linguistic realities into  
account, and towards methods that have failed elsewhere." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold offered Dr. Antonucci a brief introduction to reading  
theory. "Written language is a way of notating speech," they explained in  
their letter to the education commissioner. "To become a skilled reader, a  
learner must master this notation system, learning how the sounds and oral  
gestures of language correspond to letters and letter groups." In other  
words, a mastery of phonics is "fundamental to reading." The state's  
proposed new standards, however, downplay the importance of phonics,  
encourage unproven "strategies" such as guessing, and reject systematic  
instruction. In this respect, they "closely mirror the popular but  
increasingly criticized approach known as 'Whole Language.'"

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The accompanying letter, signed by all 40 linguistic experts, challenged  
the "scientifically unfounded views of language" that characterize the new  
standards for reading instruction. These nationally recognized "experts on  
language and reading" charged that "the common-sense view of reading as  
the decoding of notated speech" was being rejected in favor of "a surprising  
view of reading as directly 'constructing meaning." "The importance of  
'decoding' was being played down in favor of strategies such as contextual  
guessing." Such an approach ignores "the most important property of  
written English," the alphabet! 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
The experts insisted that "the view of language research" manifested in the  
proposed reforms "is inaccurate." They expressed their dismay that the  
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in setting school standards, would  
"presume to legislate an erroneous view of how human language works, a  
view that runs counter to most of the major scientific results of more than  
100 years of linguistics and psycholinguistics. We are even more  
concerned," they added, "that uninformed thinking about language should  
lie at the heart of a 'standards' document for Massachusetts schools."

<h2>
Broadcasting for Freedom
</h2>



<P>  <blockquote><i>

 
The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were  
instrumental in the collapse of Communism in Europe. So, why aren't we  
broadcasting the blessings of  liberty to the Communist countries of East  
Asia? 
 

</i></blockquote><P>


Lech Walensa and other veterans of the fight against Communist  
oppression in Eastern Europe have testified to the tremendous contribution  
that Radio Free Europe made to their struggle. Radio Free Europe's impact  
on the rise of the Solidarity union in Poland "cannot even be described,"  
said Walensa in a 1989 interview. "Would there be earth without the sun?"  
he asked rhetorically. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
"Broadcasting can be one of the most effective and economical components  
of America's diplomatic and military efforts," says James Tyson, president  
of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. The $350 million currently  
allotted for the U.S. government's foreign broadcasting effort is a small  
fraction of the $250 billion annual defense budget. Ironically, the Voice of  
America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were so effective in  
bringing the message of freedom to the captive nations of the world that  
many of our elected of officials have concluded that they are no longer  
necessary. "Following the collapse of communism in Europe, Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty have been drastically downsized," says Tyson.  
The rush to cut back on such effective programs may prove to have been  
premature, especially if the resurgence of hardliners in Russia continues  
unchecked. "It is unfortunate," he says, "that Radio Liberty is becoming  
ineffective" just as Russia may be slipping back into dictatorship. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Even if the situation in Russia does stabilize, there will still be 1.4 billion  
people suffering under brutal Communist governments in China, North  
Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Tyson argues that our broadcasting  
efforts should be focused on the Far East. "China is the largest and most  
dangerous nation in the world today," he observes. "More than a million  
people are confined in its slave labor camps. With its massive increase in  
arms -- including long-range missiles and atomic, chemical, and biological  
weapons -- the regime represents a threat to all its neighbors." Tyson says  
recent emigres report a growing hunger among the common people in  
China for accurate news about what is really going on in their own  
country. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
A proposal to establish a Radio Free Asia broadcasting service was under  
consideration for several years, says Tyson, who served in 1992 on the  
Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Asia. But it wasn't until 1995  
that Congress finally appropriated $10 million in start-up funds. Tyson  
contends that Radio Free Asia is "one of the most cost-effective policies we  
could follow," and estimates that an annual budget of $30 million would be  
sufficient to sustain the service. This would be money well spent. "If Radio  
Free Asia could accelerate the democratization of China as Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty did in the Soviet bloc," says Tyson, "it would  
result in huge savings in our defense budget."

<h2>
Religion in America
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i> Millions of Americans are enjoying better health and happier lives than  
they ever imagined, and you can too, once you know the secret. </i></blockquote>
<P> 

Are you suffering from high blood pressure? Does someone in your family  
show signs of depression or substance abuse? Has the fire gone out of your  
married life? Don't despair. Now there's a fast, safe, and simple way to  
overcome these problems -- and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Sound  
too good to be true? Well, it's not.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


 
Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation reveals that going to church is  
the secret to better health and a happier life. In a new report called Why  
Religion Matters, Fagan argues that religious practice "strengthens  
individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly  
affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such  
major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol  
addiction, crime, and delinquency." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
Research indicates that church attendance and good cheer go together.  
"Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who  
attend religious services regularly," notes Fagan. Less stress means better  
health, of course, but the benefits don't stop there. Church attendance also  
leads to happier, longer-lasting marriages. "Regular church attendance is  
the critical factor in marital stability," says Fagan. Even among those who  
have separated from their partners, "reconciliation rates are higher among  
regular church attendees." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But wait, there's more. "One of the most powerful of all factors in  
preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief,  
[which] sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse. The  
reverse is also true," says Fagan. "The absence of religious practice  
accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Still not convinced? What if we told you that "alcohol abuse is 300 percent  
higher among those who do not attend church"? It's true. Not only that, but  
"alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are  
much more likely to seek help and treatment." What about suicide? "The  
practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide," says Fagan, more  
effectively than anything else. "Those who attend church frequently are  
four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend."  
Church attendance also reduces the incidence of depression, before it can  
lead to suicide. Adolescents are particularly at risk for depression, but they  
"tend to experience fewer anxieties of growing up if they are religious." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




Patrick Fagan concludes that "regular religious practice is both an  
individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most  
significant social problems." Going to church is "good for individuals,  
families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic  
well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence  
of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency,  
drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices."  
So, don't delay. Take advantage of this amazing opportunity now. For a  
happier, healthier life, go to church regularly.

<h2>The Future of Education

</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>    
The political correctness movement has captured America's universities, and the NEA dominates our    
public school system. But students won't have to learn in lock step much longer, because the technological    
revolution will soon make these institutions of indoctrination obsolete.</i></blockquote>
<p>    
    
Years ago, many Americans got their education from correspondence courses. Now, an enterprising outfit    
in Springfield, Virginia has updated the concept for the '90s. The Teaching Company offers more than 60    
college-level courses on audio and video cassettes. One of their more popular offerings is a 70-part series    
of 45-minute lectures entitled The Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition. Two well-known    
and respected scholars from prestigious Ivy League universities deliver most of the lectures, with four    
other "superstar teachers" supplying the balance. "The result," according to a full-page advertisement in a    
popular weekly magazine, "is a definitive survey of Western thought by an all-star teaching team with no    
equal in lecturing skill at any single college campus anywhere in the world."    



  



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


  
What could be better than access to "an all-star teaching team" on videocassettes at a fraction of the cost    
of college tuition? How about a give-and-take between you and a noted scholar in the privacy of your own    
home? That's available now, too -- thanks to Bob Jones University and something called the Live    
Interactive Network Classroom, or LINC for short. The Live Interactive Network Classroom can be in    
your living room or in a traditional schoolroom -- or in any other private or public facility. No matter    
where you are, you'll receive daily satellite transmissions from a teacher in a television studio -- a teacher    
you can see and hear and speak to, as can any other student anywhere in the country who happens to be    
participating in the same class.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


     
    
Who's the intended target of this satellite schooling service? Surely not the nation's elite. "The wealthy    
will always be able to afford the best private education," writes syndicated columnist Cal Thomas. In a    
recent column describing the Live Interactive Network Classroom, Thomas argues that LINC "can free the    
middle class, and especially the poor, from their bondage to government schools. As an all-in-one    
resource, it can maintain the highest standards in foreign languages, math, and science, as well as    
advanced subjects, such as physics, that are not always available in private education." Cal Thomas    
predicts that LINC "could eventually allow all parents the freedom to choose what they believe is best for    
their children, at a reasonable price, and without the indoctrination that passes for education in the current    
intellectually and spiritually closed system" that all taxpayers must subsidize whether they want to or not. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

   
    
If the Teaching Company and the Live Interactive Network Classroom developed by Bob Jones University    
are any indication of what education will be like in the future, American students have every reason to    
rejoice. American educators, on the other hand, had better start looking for new jobs.

<h2>
Free Trade Follies
</h2>

<blockquote><i>
Did you think that the breakup of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the  
Captive Nations of Europe had tolled the death knell  for socialism? Well,  
one trade expert predicts that international treaties such as NAFTA and  
GATT will ultimately destroy the middle classes throughout the world and  
lead to a resurgence of the welfare state. 
 </blockquote></i>

<P>  

The World Trade Organization, created by the General Agreement on  
Tariffs and Trade, is now in operation. Its first major act was to order the  
United States to change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face  
sanctions by the international community. The governments of Venezuela  
and Brazil had appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the  
U.S. to accept their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental  
standards. Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations  
regarding gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation"  
trade sanctions. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This ruling is an omen of things to come, predicts William Gill of the  
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. Gill and his group were the  
first to warn that the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as  
NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as  
GATT) "were the first big steps toward a world government that would rob  
America of our cherished independence as a nation." NAFTA and GATT  
threaten our prosperity as well as our sovereignty. Gill says nine million  
jobs "have been lost in the corporate downsizing" of the 1990s, one million  
of which are "directly attributable to NAFTA." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The damage doesn't end there. NAFTA "and other free trade efforts to  
erase all national borders" have unleashed an invasion of illegal drugs and  
illegal aliens into the United States. Infectious diseases are also entering  
our country at increasing rates. "The death rate from this invidious source  
rose . . .58 percent between 1980 and 1992," observes Gill, who describes  
this 12-year period as an "era when trade tore down virtually all the  
traditional defenses of our borders." 
 




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ironically, NAFTA has not done our neighbors south of the border any  
good either. Gill reports that "the middle class in Mexico is being wiped  
out, joining the hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers driven off their  
land by NAFTA in the tragic trek downhill into abysmal poverty and  
despair." He warns that "free trade is sowing the seeds of revolution"  
throughout the world. "There have already been uprisings in Mexico and  
violent strikes in France," Gill observes, and this is only the beginning. He  
predicts that the unrest will rise, resulting in "a worldwide resurgence of  
socialism as the chaos caused by open borders forces governments into  
restoring and expanding welfare programs for the poor." The American  
Coalition for Competitive Trade intends to keep publicizing the defects of  
NAFTA and GATT and other free trade follies until public opinion finally  
forces our government to repudiate what William Gill calls an "insane  
policy that is strangling America."

<h2>
Whole Language Supporter Recants
</h2>
<Blockquote><i>

If a child hasn't learned to read by the end of the first grade, he's been  
cheated, and the odds are that he'11 never achieve his true potential.</blockquote></i>

<P>   
Bill Honig was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California  
from 1983 to 1993. During that decade, he presided over a school system  
that threw out many of the proven pedagogical approaches of the past. The  
test scores for California's public school students plummeted as a direct  
result of this ill-advised change in direction. That's the bad news. The good  
news is that Bill Honig learned from this needless disaster, and maybe his  
testimony will help keep other superintendents of education from making  
the same mistake. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Honig has written a book called Teaching Our Children to Read. In it,  
he emphasizes that educators must ensure that all schoolchildren are  
"reading beginning books by mid-first grade" and be prepared to resort to  
"organized intervention" for those who aren't. Children who are not  
beginning to read by this point, says Honig, "almost never recover." To  
read successfully, children must learn how to break words into their  
smallest "sound chunks. " In other words, they must master phonics. Honig  
argues that "the amount of time a student is engaged in phonics instruction  
is highly predictive of subsequent reading achievement." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The former state superintendent of education does not acknowledge his  
own mistake in allowing the destructive Whole Language method to  
become entrenched in state schools during his tenure. Nevertheless, he  
asserts emphatically that children will learn to read only if they are taught  
to sound out the syllables of the English language and put them together  
like building blocks -- not by using pictures to guess at words, as  
recommended by Whole Language advocates. Honig explains that "bad  
habits of guessing" make learning to read much more difficult, and argues  
that "beginning readers who rely too heavily on contextual clues, such as  
pictures or the connection of other words in the passage, are distracted  
from looking at the letters in a word and connecting those letter patterns to  
words in their minds."<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Honig's rejection of the Whole Language approach should have  
tremendous impact on his colleagues throughout the country because of the  
prestigious position Honig once held in California. Unfortunately, the  
ineffective Whole Language approach to reading has driven phonics out of  
most of our nation's school systems. Honig reports that "very few  
instructional programs currently in use provide children with materials  
designed specifically to connect with systematic and sequenced skills  
development. In some cases," he says, "state, county, district, or university  
leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills components and  
discourage phonics teaching." Maybe Bill Honig's new book will persuade  
some of these ideologues to take an honest look at the damage they're  
doing with the Whole Language approach. Maybe some of them will  
resolve to teach America's schoolchildren how to read the right way --  
using the proven method of systematic phonics.

Self-Reliance
</h2><blockquote><i>

If displaced workers spent as much time looking for new jobs as they do complaining about having lost  
their old ones, they'd find themselves employed again much faster. 

</blockquote></i>
<P> 
Bill Prince was merchandising director for Frito-Lay in Dallas from 1959 to 1966, a period during which  
sales skyrocketed from $50 million a year to $325 million. When Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola,  
however, Bill resigned to start his own food company. Despite an enormous personal investment of time,  
money, and his own considerable experience, the company failed, and Bill was obliged to start all over  
again. 
 

 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
It wasn't the first time he'd been in that predicament, nor would it be the last. Much like Sisyphus, the  
character in Greek mythology whose fate it was forever to roll a giant rock up a steep hill only to have it  
roll down again every time he reached the top, Bill knew from personal experience that life is a series of  
challenges. Whether you succeed or fail in any given challenge, there's always another giant rock waiting  
to be rolled up another steep hill. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill Prince worked ceaselessly throughout his life, in a wide variety of occupations. Over the course of a  
50-year career, he was never unemployed for more than a month at a time. "Some of the time, my income  
was in the top five percent, but not always," Bill recalls, "because I took any job I could get when I needed  
work." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill notes that in recent years many companies have had to downsize in order to survive. This trend has  
been accompanied by increasing numbers of people "complaining about those mean, nasty, uncaring  
corporations and businesses who fire good and loyal workers." Bill wonders if these carpers and grousers  
"really believe" that a company has a lifetime obligation to anyone it hires, "no matter what kind of  
problems the company may have in the future?" He marvels at the attitude so prevalent among displaced  
workers that the government should "do something to save them." They obviously don't understand that  
government intervention is the main reason their jobs have evaporated. Why can't they see, as Bill so  
clearly does, that, "if government had not been passing all those business-busting laws and writing  
harassing, anti-business regulations, they might still have their jobs?" 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Whatever happened to individual initiative and enterprise?" Bill asks. "And why do people turn to  
government like they are asking for manna from heaven?" Bill insists that middle-aged managers thrown  
back into the job market have no one but themselves to blame if they prefer to remain idle rather than  
accept a job they consider beneath them. "Maybe the reason many downsized people are downsized is  
because they simply no longer have the drive, ambition, and creative ability to withstand competition from  
younger, hungrier people," he speculates in the February issue of a monthly newsletter called Bill's  
Soapbox -- written, edited, and published by Bill Prince himself, at the ripe young age of 74!

<h2>
Myths About Crime
</h2>
<blockquote><i>
  
False ideas can have tragic consequences, say two respected criminologists, who argue that false ideas   
about crime have made the crime problem worse.  
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>  
 
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers,   
lobbyists, journalists, and judges has perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in   
the United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly   
Myths About Crime and Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice: The   
Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and DiIulio argue that "the consequences of these false   
ideas have been quite tragic indeed." They've made it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and they've   
concentrated crime "in economically distressed inner-city neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators   
of these areas to repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most enduring myths about crime in the United States is that it is caused by poverty. Logan and   
DiIulio report that many academic criminologists believe the myth that "capitalism produces pockets of   
poverty, inequality, and unemployment, which then foster crime. The solution [according to this view] is   
government intervention to provide jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce poverty and other social ills."   
The truth, as it turns out, is quite the opposite. Poverty does not cause crime; crime, on the other hand,   
does cause poverty.  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Logan and DiIulio note that "inner city areas where crime is rampant have tremendous potential for   
economic growth, given their infrastructure of railways, highways, electric power, water systems, and   
large supply of available labor. There is every reason for these areas to be wealthy," they say, "and, indeed,   
many of them have been rich in the past. But crime takes a terrible toll on physical, fiscal, and human   
capital, making it difficult to accumulate wealth and break out of the cycle of poverty. Criminals steal and   
destroy property, drive away customers and investors, reduce property values, and depreciate the quality of   
life in a neighborhood. Businesses close and working families move away, leaving behind a vacuum of   
opportunity." Inner cities need "physical protection and security" to make them viable again; instead, they   
get "economic intervention."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Another myth about crime in the United States is that prisons are filled with "petty offenders who should   
not be there." Logan and DiIulio say it isn't so. They cite data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics   
showing that "U.S. prison populations consist overwhelmingly of violent and repeat offenders."  
  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A third myth concerns the physical conditions within our nation's prisons. "There are two popular and   
competing images of American prisons," report Logan and Dilulio. "In one image, all or most prisons are   
hell holes. In the other image, all or most prisons are country clubs. Each image fits some prisons," they   
concede. "But the vast majority of prisons in the U.S. today are neither hell holes nor country clubs." They   
are what they're supposed to be: an effective means for isolating and punishing the criminal element.

<h2>
The Point of Punishment
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Most Americans believe that our criminal justice system works pretty well,  
and that punishments meted out to criminals generally fit the crime. Some  
liberal critics, however, hold a very different view of crime and  
punishment. 
</blockquote></i>
<P>


Some sophisticated liberals believe that "America is an oppressive, racist  
society, and prisons are a none-too-subtle way of subjugating the nation's  
poor and minority populations," say criminologists Charles Logan and  
John Dilulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly Myths About Crime and  
Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice:  
The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and Dilulio insist  
that "there is simply no empirical evidence to support the view that  
African-Americans, or the members of other racial and ethnic minorities in  
the U.S., are far more likely than whites" to suffer the legal consequences  
of criminal actions. Differences in conviction rates and sentencing, they  
say, are determined by "such mundane factors as the amount of evidence  
against a defendant, and whether or not a credible eyewitness testified." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Logan and Ditulio also rebut the common misconception that our prisons  
are "prohibitively expensive." They contend that "it is morally myopic, and  
conceptually and empirically moronic, to argue that public money spent on  
prisons and prisoners is public money wasted." They concede that, "if the  
typical offender committed only one petty property crime per year, then  
paying thousands and thousands of dollars to keep him confined would be  
a bad social investment. But, if he committed a dozen serious property or  
violent crimes each year, then the social benefits of keeping him  
imprisoned might well exceed the social costs of not doing so." Logan and  
DiIulio cite one study that calculated a "social cost" of $430,000 per year  
for a felon left at large -- roughly twenty times what it costs to keep him  
incarcerated. That figure may be overstated, but the fact remains that it is  
far less expensive for society to imprison a felon than to let him roam free. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  
The biggest myth or misconception of all, say Logan and DiIulio, is that  
"punishment itself is inherently wrong. It is largely because they are  
opposed to punishment generally and to imprisonment in particular that  
many people argue so strongly that we must address the root causes of  
crime, that our criminal justice system discriminates, that we are overly  
punitive and haven't considered alternatives, that prisons are too costly and  
overcrowded, and that we must look to the courts for reform." Logan and  
DiIulio see punishment as a positive good, however, one that "affirms  
important moral and cultural values. Legal punishment," they insist, "is a  
legitimate and . . . even a noble aspect of our culture." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  

Logan and DiIulio reject "the false dichotomy between punishment and  
'humanitarianism."' They argue that punishment, properly and fairly  
applied, is essential to the treatment of people "as human beings, rather  
than as objects. Punishment," they say, "is an affirmation of the autonomy,  
responsibility, and dignity of the individual."

<h2>New-Contract With America</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived    
at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government    
threatening their rights than they are of any other government?" A    
firebrand freshman Congressman answers his own question.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
"Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't    
see [those principles] reflected in their government," observes freshman    
Republican Representative Sam Brownback of Kansas in the March issue    
of Policy Review. ''Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral    
values, family, community, and free markets," says Brownback. "Yet    
their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government    
has become their master, not their servant. " Brownback is a staunch    
proponent of the three R's: Reducing, Reforming, and Returning. He says    
we should reduce the size of the federal government, reform Congress,    
and return to "the basic values that built the country: work and family    
and the recognition of a higher moral authority."   
  <p>
In a frenzy of false compassion, our once-limited government "now tries    
to do all things for all people," Brownback observes, arguing that it fails miserably in this task. "We have discovered, by spending trillions of
dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that    
government cannot solve all of our problems." The American people    
believe, and rightly so, that "they can handle most of their problems    
better than the federal government can."   
<p>   
If we return to our original principles of limited government, "then our    
nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow    
stronger than we have seen for a generation," predicts Brownback. The    
Congressman from Kansas contends that Americans must "look first to    
themselves and to each other for help," rather than rely on their elected 
representatives. He calls for the restoration of "the master-servant    
relationship between the people and the government," acknowledging    
that many of his colleagues need to be reminded that they hold the    
subordinate position. They also need to be reminded that the powers of    
the federal government are strictly limited by our Constitution.    
Observing that there is "no constitutional basis" for most of the federal 
government's current activities, Brownback argues that it is time to "re-   
limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, 
and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal    
government was never intended to perform."   
<p>   
Brownback calls for "a new Contract with America -- one that passes    
laws, not merely proposes them." Brownback's Contract would reduce    
federal spending "from 22 percent of our Gross Domestic Product to 15    
percent or less," restrict the tax code to the raising of revenue and    
"remove all social engineering" from it, cut the number of cabinet    
agencies from 14 to no more than nine "and restrict their regulatory    
powers under constitutional principles," require the citation of "precise  constitutional authority" for all proposed legislation, and eliminate all
government interference in private charity. Sounds like a pretty good    
contract. Where do we sign?

<h2>Libertine Libraries</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Your children cannot legally buy obscene rap music albums at a record    
store. They may, however, be able to check out the same revolting trash    
at your local library. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
Imagine your 12-year-old child coming home from the public library    
with a CD or cassette tape of 2 Live Crew's vulgar rap album As Nasty    
As They Wanna Be. Do you think it's impossible? Do you think no    
publicly-funded library would purchase music glorifying the rape and    
mutilation of women? Do you think no responsible librarian would    
release such material to children? Think again.   
<p>   
Public libraries all over America have multiple copies of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be and other violent and salacious recordings. They    
routinely loan these materials to children without the knowledge or    
permission of their parents. It's their policy to do that.   
<p>   
In the February issue of the Education Reporter, longtime teacher Helen    
Chaffee Biehle describes how she recently discovered that the public    
libraries she's loved all her life are no longer child-friendly forums for    
fact-finding and fantasizing. Having read in her local newspaper that a    
12-year-old boy had indeed been allowed to check out 2 Live Crew's    
filthy tape from one of the county libraries, Mrs. Biehle decided to call    
the library director herself and find out how this terrible mistake had    
occurred. She discovered that it was no mistake.   
<p>   
The library director was "completely calm and utterly unapologetic,"    
Mrs. Biehle recalls. Following the guidelines of the American Library    
Association's Intellectual Freedom Manual as regards the handling of    
complaints, the director offered three lines of defense. The first was an    
appeal to diversity. "Neither you nor I might approve of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be," she conceded, "but we serve a diverse population."    
Then there was the philosophical dodge. "Not to buy the tape would be    
making a moral judgment," she said. "We can't do that." The ultimate    
defense, however, was an American Library Association document called    
the Library Bill of Rights, which has absolutely no legal standing but    
purports to prohibit "censorship" on the basis of age.   
 <p>  
The great irony, of course, is that the guardians of intellectual freedom at    
the American Library Association are anything but tolerant when it    
comes to considering the opinions of others. It's not diversity that they    
believe in, but perversity. They make moral judgments -- or should we    
say, immoral judgments -- all the time. Censorship is the very essence of    
their profession. They decide which books, records, and videotapes will    
be made available to library patrons, and they routinely screen out    
materials that contradict their biases. Woe betide the independent-minded    
librarian who dares to defy them by respecting the values and opinions of    
the taxpayers who make their jobs possible. "The acceptance of moral    
responsibility for children in the library is now called 'unprofessional,"'    
notes Helen Chaffee Biehle; "making a responsible moral judgment about    
materials purchased for the library is called 'elitist,' and the librarian who    
is brave enough to do either is labeled a 'censor.'"

<h2>Terrorism Bill</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
If the House of Representatives passes the so-called "anti-terrorism" bill    
now under consideration, American citizens will experience "a profound    
loss of liberty, for no real gain in their security. "  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
   
 
<p>   
"It is astounding to see the 1 04th Congress move to expand the power    
and intrusiveness of the federal government,'' says David Kopel of the    
Cato Institute. "These are the same Republicans sent to Congress to    
reduce the federal government's erosion of individual rights."    
Nevertheless, many of these avowed opponents of Big Government are    
supporting a bill that Kopel says would "turn Uncle Sam into Big    
Brother."   
 <p>  
The House version of the proposed legislation would authorize federal    
agents to pry into the personal affairs of any American citizen, says    
Kopel, "without first obtaining a court order, and without even a    
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity." Such    
invasions of privacy would be just the beginning, for the bill also "gives    
the president the power to label a group a 'terrorist organization' and    
make it a federal felony to support the legal activities of that group." The    
Justice Department's unsuccessful effort to prove the existence of a    
criminal conspiracy among pro-life organizations is a clear indication of    
what sort of groups are likely to be targeted as "terrorists."   
<p>   
It gets worse. Kopel notes that "illegal wiretaps would be admissible in    
court, as long as the wiretapping federal official was acting in 'good    
faith.'" How can the victim of an inquisition prove that his persecutor    
acted in bad faith? He can't. That's the point. The bill also contains "gun    
control legislation that could never pass this Congress on its own merits,"    
says Kopel. "Currently it is illegal to sell someone a firearm if you know    
it will be used in a crime. This bill would apply a five-year sentence to    
cases in which the seller allegedly 'should' have known that the gun    
would be used in a crime." Standard background checks will no longer    
suffice, it seems. Will gun dealers now have to obtain psychological    
profiles of all potential customers? Will they be expected to detect that    
cliche of murder mysteries, the homicidal gleam in the eye?   
<p>   
Do you think that American legislators could never endorse warrantless    
searches, illegal wiretaps, presumption of guilt, detention without trial,    
unseen witnesses, or secret testimony? Alas, they already have, in the    
anti-terrorism bill pending in Congress. The Senate bill is worse; it    
demonstrates even less regard for our constitutionally-protected liberties.    
The Senate version of the bill, says David Kopel, "contains a number of    
seriously disturbing and dangerous provisions," including military    
involvement in local law enforcement, digital wiretapping capabilities,    
the reclassification of apolitical crimes as terrorism, and increased    
funding for the storm troopers at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and    
Firearms. Is the threat of terrorism really so great that we should give up    
many of our hard-won liberties to protect against it? Most Americans    
would not be happy with the result.

<h2>Kit Carson Scouts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"To be an enemy of the United States can be dangerous, " Senator 
Daniel  Patrick Moynihan once quipped. "To be an ally can be fatal. "
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
 
They were called the Kit Carson Scouts, these daring young Vietnamese  
men recruited into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to guide our combat  
units into enemy territory. They served us faithfully, and we abandoned  
them. 
<p>
Many of the Kit Carson Scouts were former members of the Viet Cong  
who had seen the evils of communism and turned against it, says James  
Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. Others were  
recruited from border villages because of their familiarity with the terrain  
occupied by the communists. Nearly 7,000 Kit Carson Scouts were  
recruited during the Vietnam War, and 4,000 of these courageous soldiers  
were still actively serving when American forces pulled out in 1975.  
"Since then," says Tyson, "the U.S. has done nothing to help these men  
get out of Vietnam safely." 
<p>
What's become of our faithful allies? No one knows for sure. What's  
worse, no one seems to care. "After the fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese  
communists started a campaign to round up all members of the South  
Vietnamese government and armed forces, or those who had worked for  
the Americans," reports Tyson. "Most were killed or thrown into deadly  
're-education camps.' The Kit Carson Scouts were a primary target. The  
communists put a bounty on them, so that many neighbors in their  
villages turned them in. Two thousand are believed to have been  
executed." 
<p>
Half of the Kit Carson Scouts, our former allies, may have been  
slaughtered because we made no provision for their deliverance. What  
about the other half? "Another 2000 are estimated to have survived  
undetected," says Tyson. "These men have faced deadly danger ever  
since and need our help. Many may still be in Vietnam, but some may be  
among the flood of refugees who have succeeded in getting out of the 
country, by risking their lives at sea or through other means." Getting out  
is one thing; staying out is another. Tyson concedes that "thousands of  
Vietnamese have been settled in the U.S. and other countries since the  
war. But 70,000 still languish in refugee camps in the neighboring  
countries of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Hong Kong." 
<p>
Repatriation means certain death for the Kit Carson Scouts. Nevertheless,  
those who have made it to the refugee camps must prove that they are  
"political" refugees, with the right to be resettled in other countries. Mere  
"economic" refugees, whose concerns about their personal safety in their  
native land are considered unwarranted, do not qualify for asylum. "The 
Kit Carson Scouts have an air-tight case as 'political' refugees, since they  
were employed by the U.S. military," says Tyson. "But our government 
has failed to do anything, either to help them escape from Vietnam or to  
assist those who have gotten out in being properly classified."

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Health care spending today is more than twenty times what it was in    
1965. The primary reason for that dramatic increase is the third-party    
payment system. 
</i></blockquote>
<p>   
Research analyst Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in    
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania argues that "people are never as careful in    
spending someone else's money as they are in spending their own." This    
simple fact of human nature is what's behind the spiraling cost of health    
care in America. "Between 1965 and 1995, total annual spending on    
health care in the U.S. rose from $41.6 billion to $938.3 billion in    
constant dollars," reports Barwick. "This dramatic increase in health care    
spending coincided with a sharp rise in third-party payment." The    
Pennsylvania researcher estimates that "79 cents of every dollar used to    
purchase health care is paid by someone other than the person receiving    
treatment."   
<p>   
Barwick sees a direct link "between rising health care costs and the    
increase in third-party payment." He argues that there is little incentive    
for economizing "when people only have to pay 21 cents to get a dollar's    
worth of coverage." When patients don't care how much a particular    
medicine or treatment will cost, "physicians and other medical    
professionals will have little reason to seek the most cost-effective ways    
to provide quality care."   
<p>   
The solution, Barwick believes, is Medical Savings Accounts (known as    
an MSAs), which provide "the individual consumer with the resources    
needed to pay directly for ordinary health care expenditures, together    
with the incentive to do so responsibly." Barwick describes MSAs as    
"tax-free accounts into which individuals may deposit money to be used    
to pay for everyday health care needs. Typically," he says, "MSAs are    
combined with a catastrophic insurance policy which covers all health    
care expenses beyond a high fixed deductible."   
<p>   
Barwick argues that "MSAs provide health care consumers with a strong    
incentive to conserve resources, since the consumer gets to keep whatever    
cost-savings he is able to achieve. By encouraging frugality among    
consumers, MSAs would also provide incentive to physicians and other    
health care professionals to utilize the most costeffective means of    
providing quality care." Barwick notes that other proposed health care    
reforms "seek to regulate patients, physicians, and hospitals more heavily,    
resulting in restrictions on the freedom of the patient to choose a    
physician and [the freedom] of the physician to select the type of    
treatment to be used. In contrast, MSAs leave these choices where they    
belong: in the hands of individual health care recipients and their    
physicians."   
<p>   
In addition to providing patients and doctors with an incentive to save,    
MSAs would reduce administrative costs, which account for as much as    
25 percent of health care spending. They would also reduce out-of-pocket    
expenses for "the vast majority of health care recipients." And they would    
solve the portability problem by allowing employees to "take any unspent    
MSA funds with them when leaving a job."

<h2>Union Electioneering</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The AFL-CIO recently announced that it plans to spend $35 million to   
influence the outcome of this year's elections. That's seven times what the   
labor federation normally spends on national elections!
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
  
 
  

<p>  
"After decades of declining political influence, labor unions have pledged   
to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest,"   
says Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The first real test of   
organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United   
States Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily   
backed by big labor. Similar efforts can be expected in numerous House   
and Senate races this fall." After all, new AFL-CIO President John   
Sweeney won election to his post late last year by "pledging more active   
organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and   
promising vocal political campaigns to promote the union movement's   
liberal agenda."  
<p>  
The AFL-CIO made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more   
than 350,000 pieces of mail on behalf of the Democratic candidate in the   
special election in Oregon to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob   
Packwood. "The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces   
with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable   
presence in this one targeted race," observes Griffin. "The considerable   
firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in more than $   
183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic   
candidate."  
<p>  
Griffin emphasizes that "impact is not measured in direct PAC spending   
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots   
organizing are all significant activities that labor used in Oregon and can   
be expected to use throughout this year to promote favored political   
candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In   
Oregon, these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more   
than direct, reported expenditures."  
<p>  
Griffin predicts that "the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations will   
continue to invest heavily in campaign activity" during the course of this   
election year, and concedes that they have every right to do so.   
"Unfortunately," he says, "much of this politicking will be funded   
through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and unregulated   
by federal election laws." Griffin argues that it is unjust for union   
members to be "compelled to surrender their own pay . . . to finance   
political activity to which they may well object." He urges Members of   
Congress, in addressing campaign finance reform, to consider "whether it   
is fair to force every union member to pay for the ideological warfare of   
union officials.'' Reform legislation, says Griffin, should stipulate that   
"only voluntary contributions are used for politics."  
<p>  
Organized labor promises to be a major player in the 1996 elections.   
While conceding that unions should be "as free as other organizations to   
pursue their political goals," Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation   
insists that "the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory   
advantages unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair."

<h2>World Trade Organization</h2>

<P>     
    

    
The World Trade Organization's recent ruling against the United States     
is a taste of things to come -- unless American voters can persuade their     
Congressmen to abrogate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade     
and say no to the New World Order.    
<p>    
The jig is up. The internationalists have jumped the gun. They've shown     
their hand too soon. And now their legislative lackeys in the U.S.     
Congress are obliged, in the middle of an election year, to defend the     
indefensible. Having sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the     
sovereignty of the United States, they must now figure out a way to     
justify their support for a treaty that undermines both -- or resign     
themselves to humiliating defeats in November.    
<p>    
Congress ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as     
GATT) during its lame-duck session in December 1994. That treaty     
established the World Trade Organization ( known as WTO) and gave it     
the power to settle trade disputes among signatory nations. Well, lo and     
behold, the WTO, in its first major decision, has ruled against the United     
States! The Members of Congress who ratified the treaty knew that such     
an outcome was a distinct possibility. It was widely predicted at the time.     
Nevertheless, they willingly voted to subject the economic, social, and     
legislative decisions of American citizens to the whims of an international     
tribunal.    
<p>    
What that international tribunal did was to order the United States to     
change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face sanctions     
against U.S. industries. The governments of Venezuela and Brazil had     
appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the U.S. to accept     
their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental standards.     
Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations regarding     
gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation" trade     
sanctions. Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela     
or Brazil, there is no direct way to exact revenge on U.S. petroleum     
interests. So, in the name of "free trade," the WTO will probably order     
trade sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to     
the gasoline industry or the EPA regulations.    
<p> 
Now, Democrats and Republicans both have egg on their faces. President     
Clinton promised his liberal supporters in 1994 that the WTO would     
never undercut our environmental regulations. The Republican leadership     
in Congress promised their conservative backers that American     
sovereignty would not be endangered by the agreement. Well, it turns out     
they were both mistaken, or less than candid.    
<p>    
William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade considers     
the recent WTO ruling truly ominous. Gill and his group tried to warn     
Members of Congress that the North American Free Trade Agreement     
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "were the first big steps     
toward a world government that would rob America of our cherished     
independence as a nation." But our elected representatives just wouldn't     
listen. By the time November 5th rolls around, they may wish they had.

<h2>UN Tax</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The proposal for a global tax to finance the operations of the United   
Nations went over like a lead balloon among average Americans. Many   
of our so-called leaders support the idea, however, seeing it as a   
necessary step on the road to a New World Order.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>         
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali thinks the UN   
could be a lot more effective if the world body did not have to answer to   
any of its member nations. If it had its own means of support, and its own   
army, then Boutros-Ghali and his fellow internationalists could give   
orders instead of taking them. The idea makes perfect sense to power-  
hungry globalists, who simply can't understand why it doesn't appeal to   
the citizens of nations expected to sacrifice their sovereignty.  
<p>  
Boutros-Ghali wants to finance the nearly bankrupt United Nations by   
imposing a global tax on foreign exchange transactions. A mere half-of-  
one-percent tax on these transactions would generate an astounding $1.5   
trillion. The Secretary General is willing to consider alternative means of   
raising revenue, of course, such as taxes on international travel, fossil   
fuels, international arms sales, and so on. The important thing is to   
establish an independent revenue source. "It is time to seriously address   
the need for a United Nations that can operate on a secure and steady   
financial foundation," said Boutros-Ghali when he floated his unpopular   
proposal. "I'm sure we will win in the end, and that we will obtain from   
the international community [an understanding] that we need to have our   
own income."  
<p>  
The international community may understand Boutros-Ghali's objectives,   
but so does the average American citizen, and he wants no part of it. "The   
ability to control territory and command an army, like the ability to tax,   
represents the exercise of sovereign power," observes Thomas Sheehy of   
the Heritage Foundation. "The UN should never have this power; it   
would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people.   
These rights are protected by the U.S. government, not the UN. The UN   
does not represent the interests of Americans; it represents the interests of   
its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic and repressive."  
<p>  
Sheehy denies that the UN suffers from "a lack of funding. In fact," he   
says, "UN spending has been mushrooming, and that is the real problem."   
Still, the UN wants more. "In September 1996, the UN Working Group   
on Finances will submit a report on financing to the UN General   
Assembly," observes Sheehy. "This report may very well recommend a   
UN tax scheme." Sheehy notes that legislation has been introduced in   
both houses of the U.S. Congress to prohibit U.S. compliance with UN   
efforts to implement a tax. He argues that "the last thing the UN needs is   
more money and less accountability." The real question, however, is what   
America needs: We need leaders who will respect and protect our nation's   
sovereignty. The best way to do that is by withdrawing from the United   
Nations and expelling this would-be world government from our shores.

<h2>Michael New </h2>
 
<P>
<blockquote><i>
The United Nations wants to be a truly autonomous world government,  
but first it needs to have its own authority, and its own military  
force. U.S. Army Specialist Michael New's refusal to don the UN  
uniform was a challenge that could not be ignored.
</i></blockquote>
<p> 
The court martial and conviction of U.S. Army Specialist Michael New  
for refusing to wear the UN uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping"  
mission to Macedonia was a necessary step on the road to the New World  
Order. Had New not been punished, the other 550 servicemen in his unit  
might have had second thoughts about donning UN helmets, trading their  
U.S. identification cards for UN I.D. cards, and marching off to  
Macedonia to serve as pawns in a conflict of no consequence to America.  
How would the UN ever put together an army of its own if every soldier  
in the world insisted on maintaining allegiance to his homeland? 
<p> 
To justify the order regarding the wearing of UN uniforms, Specialist  
New's commanding officer made vague references to the following  
phrases: "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN  
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security  
Council Resolutions." But Specialist New was not convinced. He argued  
that the order to alter his uniform violated U.S. Army regulations against  
wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, medal, or uniform. "I am  
not a UN soldier," New protested. "I am an American soldier." 
<p> 
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? Why all  
the fuss about a silly little emblem? Cuddy argues that obscuring the  
national identities of troops participating in a UN peacekeeping mission  
and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates "a change of  
command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops that it can  
truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted it to be --  
"a de facto world government." 
<p> 
"Michael New is an American hero," proclaims Congressman Roscoe  
Bartlett of Maryland. "A twice decorated soldier, Michael New took the  
extraordinary step of jeopardizing a brilliant military career to defend our  
Constitution." Now, if only our Congressmen will show such courage.  
Bartlett and more than 60 of his colleagues are co-sponsoring a bill that  
would make it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services  
to wear insignia, indicia, or headgear affirming allegiance to, or  
affiliation with, the United Nations. But why stop there? Why not take  
the one step that really would prevent American soldiers from being  
transferred to the command of an international force? Why not withdraw  
from the United Nations altogether, while we still can?

<h2>Family vs. "Village"</h2>
 


<P>

First Lady Hillary Clinton and her friends tell us that it takes a village to

government. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>  
It's a nice sounding proverb: It takes a village to raise a child. But what    
does it really mean? What does Hillary Clinton have in mind when she    
speaks of a "village"? How does she propose to "raise a child"? Do these    
terms mean the same thing to her that they do to the rest of us? Former    
Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services Kay James contends    
that the First Lady's interpretation of this traditional African proverb is    
anything but traditional.    
<p>    
"Three fundamental problems arise with the use of this proverb," writes    
Mrs. James in the February issue of Imprimis, the monthly journal of    
Hillsdale College. "First, children do not belong to the village or to the    
community or to the government. They belong to parents, and the village    
exists as a resource for these families." The second problem is that the    
village -- the small, closely-knit community many of us grew up in -- "no    
longer exists." The third problem is that liberals think they can replace    
the village of days gone by with "big government."    
<p>    
Mrs. James considers it ironic that "the more our families disintegrate, the    
more violence explodes in our homes and on our streets, the more our    
schools fail the grade, the more this old proverb is repeated." Invoking    
proverbs like a mantra will not change the fact that the village "has been    
utterly and completely destroyed." Mrs. James argues that, "rather than    
work to rebuild the village, we have instead taken the broken bricks of    
families, the mortar of cultural institutions, and the steel of houses of    
worship and used them to build up Town Hall." This, of course, is the    
worst thing we could have done, for our growing dependence on big    
government "has robbed us of the drive so necessary to sustain and    
strengthen the institutions of the village."    
<p>    
Hillary Clinton and like-minded liberals can sing the praises of the    
village, but that doesn't alter the fact that it was their policies that    
destroyed it. "Liberal theology has undermined our faith and destroyed    
the traditional role of churches," declares Mrs. James. "Liberal education    
policies have ravaged our public schools. Liberal social policies have    
sabotaged our families. Liberal public policies have fostered welfare    
dependency encouraged promiscuous behavior, and empowered criminals    
instead of citizens."    
<p>    
Mrs. James contends that Americans today know "the full cost of ceding    
our responsibilities to the federal government." We know that "the    
government cannot be our parents, cannot teach our children about    
responsibility and character, cannot regulate individual behavior, and    
cannot create entrepreneurial opportunities." We know that "the real    
solutions are not political," and that "real change must still come from the    
transformed hearts and souls of individuals."

<h2>
Education Reform
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
According to a national opinion poll conducted by USA Today in 
January, the quality of education in our country is the number-one 
concern for most Americans.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The quality of education in America is declining because "power in 
educational public policy rests with the producers, not the consumers," 
says Charles Greenawalt of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Public education should serve the public 
interest and be accountable for its performance, but this is not the case." 
The education establishment "possesses near-monopoly control of this 
area of public policy." Greenawalt argues that the primary objective of 
this establishment is "not to improve and strengthen their performance, 
but to preserve itself, its clout, the status quo, and the resources at its 
disposal. This status quo is facilitated by complex layers of local, state, 
and federal regulations that apply to the schools and are implemented by 
overstaffed and generally unresponsive school district bureaucracies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt calls for "major shifts of authority and control over resources 
from producers to consumers and from experts to civilians. This means 
giving parents, taxpayers, elected officials, and community leaders far 
greater say over what schools need to accomplish, how the schools will 
be held accountable for this task, and how children and schools will be 
matched with one another." One way to do this is by "breaking vast 
school systems into smaller and more manageable units," says 
Greenawalt. "Consolidation in many areas has gone too far [resulting in] 
numerous school districts that are too large . . . to educate students 
effectively."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For our educational system to be successful again, there must be 
reasonable standards of performance for students and teachers, genuine 
competition among the schools, and a renewed sense of professionalism 
among educators. Standards must "spell out in clear, unambiguous terms 
what students should learn and be able to do before they graduate," says 
Greenawalt. For standards to be effective, there must be "reliable and 
accurate assessments of student and school performance vis-a-vis those 
standards [which presupposes] trustworthy information about student 
performance [and] accountability mechanisms that will invoke 
meaningful consequences for all school personnel."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Noting that "children differ substantially in learning styles, temperament, 
and personal preference," Greenawalt argues that, "rather than attempting 
to standardize all schools, the state should welcome and promote 
educational diversity or pluralism. Let schools compete with one another 
based on their distinctive programs." According to Greenawalt, "School 
choice is an essential element for any comprehensive educational reform 
that is to be meaningful and long-lived. Families must be able to select 
their children's schools from a broad and varied array of choices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt says that teachers need to start thinking of themselves as 
individuals again. "Uniform salary schedules that treat everyone alike, 
regardless of performance, have no place in a true profession," he argues. 
"Likewise, the ability to strike and the presence of lifetime tenure are also 
antithetical to true professionalism. Schools must be operated for the 
benefit of their consumers -- the students -- not their producers."

<h2>
Conservation Economics
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
If environmental activists really cared about preserving endangered 
species, they wouldn't let an ideological commitment to socialism stand 
in the way.
</blockquote></i>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an 
increasing struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another 
being pushed to the brink of extinction," says Robert J. Smith of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Why are some species disappearing 
and others thriving?" Smith argues that "the problem of overexploitation 
or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather 
than private ownership." In the January issue of his organization's 
monthly newsletter, "UpDate," Smith distinguishes between "two totally 
different forms of property rights and ownership: public, communal, or 
open-access common property vs. private property. Wherever we have 
public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private 
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Wildlife problems resulting from public ownership have been "especially 
prevalent in America," says Smith, but less so in other parts of the world. 
"In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is 
managed under a combination of private and public property. Some 
European countries have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, 
regardless of population pressures and economic and political systems." 
There's a lesson to be learned here, says Smith.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An example of "how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife 
is found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and 
bird farms." Smith contends that "these game ranches produce many 
positive results. Many of the animals they stock are rapidly disappearing 
in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a rapidly 
expanding human population. Indeed, some of the more spectacular and 
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more 
stable populations on game ranches than in their native countries."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reluctance of conservationists to embrace private ownership of 
wildlife is one of the biggest threats to the preservation of endangered 
species. "If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can 
provide the economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on 
a sustained-yield basis, some species will be saved," says Smith. He notes 
that "the protection provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens 
has actually produced a glut of some animals. There have been well-
publicized efforts by some preserves to return their surplus animals to 
Africa." Smith predicts that "in the future the developing countries will 
be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving on 
game ranches and preserves."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservationists need to overcome their slavish devotion to big 
government. "The problems of environmental degradation, 
overexploitation of natural resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive 
from their existence as common property resources," says Robert J. 
Smith. "Wherever we have exclusive private ownership, whether it is 
organized around a profit-seeking or nonprofit undertaking, there are 
incentives for the private owners to preserve the resource. Self-interest 
drives private property owners to careful management of their resource."

Troubled by the Issues
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
When it comes to covering political campaigns, the members of the 
media have a way of focusing on the personalities of the candidates and 
ignoring the issues. Maybe it's because they don't want us to think about 
what's really at stake.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What are the issues in the 1996 Presidential election? The deployment of 
American troops to Bosnia is one. The court-martial of Army Specialist 
Michael New for refusing to wear the United Nations uniform is another. 
The UN itself is a big issue -- the funding of it, its so-called peacemaking 
efforts, its impact on U.S. sovereignty. Serious voters want to know if our 
next President will acknowledge that America has no strategic interest in 
Bosnia and bring our troops home. Will he make amends to Michael New 
and take steps to ensure that no U.S. soldier is ever again subjected to 
foreign command? Will he oppose independent taxing authority for the 
UN? Will he oppose U.S. funding for UN military ventures? Will he 
oppose treaties -- like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- that threaten U.S. 
sovereignty?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about NAFTA, GATT, and the World Trade Organization? The 
Mexican bailout? Illegal immigration and multilingualism? These are 
issues of major concern to many Americans. Will our next President 
acknowledge the real impact of so-called free-trade treaties on our 
economy? Will the jobs of American workers mean more to him than the 
bad investments of New York banks? Will he cut off all taxpayer benefits 
to illegal aliens and support a moratorium on legal immigration until the 
problem of illegals can be addressed? Will he endorse English as our 
official language and withdraw support for bilingual programs that retard 
the assimilation of immigrants?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about education and crime-fighting? Presidential candidates like to 
talk about these issues, even though both are properly handled at the local 
level. Will our next President acknowledge state supremacy in these 
matters? Will he terminate the unconstitutional federal intervention in 
education by abolishing the Department of Education and repealing 
Goals 2000? Will he condemn the killings carried out by federal agents at 
Ruby Ridge and Waco, and make sure that Americans are never again 
terrorized by their own government? Will he oppose legislation -- like the 
so-called anti-terrorism bill -- that would authorize federal agents to 
violate the constitutionally-protected liberties of Americans? Will he 
oppose the government's taking of private lands for bogus environmental 
reasons?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where does he stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? What's his position on taxpayer handouts to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? Does he 
support or reject affirmative action quotas and set-asides? These are just 
some of the issues that the press passes over as it plays up personalities, 
polls, and party platitudes. But serious voters know what the issues are, 
and they want a candidate who will address them.

<h2>
ENVIRONMENTALISM
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted for nearly one-
fifth of bills presented to Congress and almost one-quarter of those 
enacted into law."
</blockquote></i>
<P>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            
"The government's environmental activism has been costly," writes 
Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The 
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that Americans spend 
well over $150 billion per year complying with environmental 
regulations." In a new book called Environmentalism at the Crossroads, 
published by the Capital Research Center, Adler argues that businesses 
trying to absorb the costs of compliance "are likely to pass on the cost to 
consumers by raising the price of their products. And, when they are 
confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation and the 
regulatory enforcement of environmental law, they may decide to slow 
the development and application of new technologies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The cost of environmental regulation continues to increase, even as more 
and more Americans are questioning its effectiveness, "particularly in the 
area of risk reduction." Adler contends that "attempting to improve 
environmental quality in one area can hurt the environment in other 
areas." Even worse, regulations can sometimes have an effect quite the 
opposite of what was intended, as has happened with the Endangered 
Species Act. Adler notes that "landowners lose the right to use their land 
as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered on it. 
Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant crops, or cut down 
trees. Rather than protect wildlife, the Endangered Species Act punishes 
landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a species habitat. The 
Act creates disincentives for protecting endangered species," says Adler, 
with the result that "landowners who find an endangered species on their 
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before it's 
discovered by federal authorities."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adler asserts that "many policy experts and the public now recognize the 
failings of much environmental policy." Nevertheless, he says, 
"Washington's environmental lobbies are unyielding." They know that 
regulatory reform is needed to establish accurate methods of risk 
assessment, proscribe unfunded mandates, and protect private property 
rights, but they refuse to admit it. Rather than harness the time-tested 
incentives of the free enterprise system in the service of their mission, 
they remain blindly committed to government intervention. "Washington 
environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment, relief from 
unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property," Adler observes. 
"Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic 
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean 
environment."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without meaningful reform, however, regulators will continue to target 
risks that have "public relations or political value," in the process 
spending "millions of dollars that do comparatively little to improve 
public health and environmental quality." They will continue to impose 
unfunded mandates on state and local governments, with the result that 
"local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's dictates." And they 
will continue to issue environmental regulations that "override private 
land-use decisions," thereby violating the "takings clause" of the Fifth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<h2>
Environmental Myths
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"Mainstream thinking asserts that we must sacrifice at least some of our 
prosperity in order to protect the environment, " observes a noted 
economist. "Fortunately, this mainstream thinking is wrong."
</blockquote></i>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We can have both a growing economy and an improving environment," 
declares John Semmens of the Laissez-Faire Institute in Chandler, 
Arizona. In an article entitled "Prosperity Without Pollution," in the 
March issue of "The Freeman," Semmens suggests that "a growing 
economy may well provide the very means needed to improve the 
environment. 'Sacrifice' may not only be unnecessary; it may be 
counterproductive."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Semmens cites several "erroneous premises" of mainstream 
environmental thinking that pose obstacles not only to prosperity but to 
environmental improvement as well. One false premise is the idea that 
anything "natural" is better than anything "artificial." Civilization itself is 
artificial, Semmens observes, but far superior to the state of nature. The 
"artificial" laws and technology of civilization allow us "to lead lives that 
are less violent, painful, and precarious than would be natural. 
'Environmentalism' itself is an artifact of civilization. The abundance 
generated by our technologically advanced civilization allows people to 
contemplate more than just survival."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The idea that resources are finite is another false premise. Things do not 
even become "resources" until humans find a use for them and thereby 
give them value. The scarcity of any given resource is simply a challenge 
to be overcome. "The high prices of scarce resources stimulate the search 
for better or cheaper alternatives for meeting the same human wants," 
says Semmens. "So, in the final analysis, it is not the 'finiteness' of any 
substance that is critical. The critical factor is the scope of the human 
imagination. This scope seems to be getting broader. The accelerating 
pace of technological advancement should give us confidence that, 
barring the implementation of oppressive government meddling, we are 
not likely to run short of intellectual resources in the foreseeable future."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The so-called population bomb is another fallacy. "It is not population, 
per se, that could pose a problem for humanity, but the political and 
social institutions that affect human behavior," says Semmens. "In this 
regard, the paternalistic welfare state is a serious problem. Government 
programs that entitle people to consume without their having to produce 
turns them into drones and parasites." The danger here is that "the burden 
of the parasitic portion of the population may overwhelm the output 
capacity of the productive portion."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest fallacy of all is the idea that big government is the answer to 
environmental problems, real or imagined. "Government lacks adequate 
information on the subjective values of individuals, on the world's 
continuously changing circumstances, and on what the future might 
bring," says Semmens. "Further, government lacks sufficient incentives 
to avoid mistakes. The burdens of its errors fall on others. Its failures 
serve as a rationale for further meddling." Semmens insists that 
"prosperity and a cleaner environment" depend on "human creativity," 
which cannot flourish in a society stifled by government control.

<h2>
Constitution Not Outmoded
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
It's a familiar refrain. The Constitution, we're told, was designed for an 
18th-century agrarian society, not for the complex, technological world 
we live in today.
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The Constitution is based on three timeless truths," wrote Jackson 
Pemberton in an essay published in "The Freeman" during our 
bicentennial year. "First, it is founded on the fact that it is necessary, in a 
society, that the citizen must either control himself by his own moral 
self-discipline, or he must be restrained so that he cannot abuse his 
liberty. Second, it is the nature of man to seek recognition, then 
influence, and then power in his relationships to his fellows. Third, it is 
the nature of man to work untiringly for himself when he is confident in 
the usefulness of his effort. Those are the footings of the Constitution, 
and there is nothing there that is either 18th century or agrarian!"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In his essay, recently reprinted by the Foundation for Economic 
Education in a collection called The Foundations of American 
Constitutional Government, Pemberton argued that the Constitution was 
founded "upon an exquisite recognition of the dual disposition of man, 
his propensity for good and his capacity for evil." The objective of the 
Founding Fathers was "to place the forces of human nature in a 
framework which would cause those forces to lift man, to protect and 
release his conscience, his will, his talents, and his noble desires, and at 
the same time would discourage and punish him in his vices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers knew that, if Americans should ever "turn from 
morality and good religion, they would also turn from liberty," wrote 
Pemberton, "for, if man is to be free, he must control himself." For that 
reason, they strove to make sure that "religion should be thoroughly 
protected and even encouraged." They did not intend for "any particular 
religion to have the advantage over another, but that the citizens' rights 
to complete liberty of private and public belief and practice should in no 
way be infringed."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers, Pemberton explained, "set up the plan of 
government so that its powers were restricted, separated, and dispersed 
throughout the states in order to defeat the tendency of men to 
consolidate power and ordain themselves rulers over the people." They 
then applied "the checks and balances to set each branch of government 
as a watchman over the other two, and gave each certain prerogatives so 
as to place the ambition of self-aggrandizing men in opposition to the 
ambition of other similar men."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers recognized that "man is most inclined to produce 
an abundance when his property rights are held inviolate," wrote 
Pemberton. "Man, by nature, will strive with great energy and 
innovation to improve himself . . . so long as he has confidence that he 
will be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his labors." The Founding Fathers 
disdained "excessive taxation and regulation," because they knew that 
"the freest economies were the greatest source of plenty. "

<title>Duplantier: Creeping Socialism -- 4/12/96</title>

<h2>
Creeping Socialism
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Socialism is based on "a simple assumption: that certain people know 
better what is best for all other creatures, and that such people possess the 
right to enforce their 'enlightened ' beliefs because they shall lead the rest 
of us to a 'perfect' world."
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When they drafted the U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers "created a 
framework which sought to limit secular laws, rules, and regulations to 
the necessary minimum," notes Balint Vazsonyi in an essay titled "The 
Battle for America's Soul," published in the Winter issue of a journal 
called "Common Sense." "They recognized that the fewer the rules, the 
broader the potential agreement. Broad agreement, in turn, results in less 
strife. Less strife leaves people free to create and accomplish. The fewer 
obstacles placed in the path of individuals, the less energy wasted in 
trying to overcome them."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, individual opportunity has given way to group 
entitlement. "Instead of increased productivity, efforts are always directed 
toward increasing demands. These demands are for unearned 
participation in, and distributions from, the accomplishments of those 
who produce the nation's goods," says Vazsonyi. What results is "a 
downward spiral. With incentives shrinking, less and less is produced; 
consequently, there is less and less to distribute. This, in a nutshell, is 
why welfare states invariably increase poverty."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why don't Americans recognize creeping socialism for what it is? 
Socialism "persuades its intended victims that it has people's best interest 
in mind, that it seeks peace, justice, and equality, that it is motivated by 
caring and compassion. Its ability to camouflage true intent and adapt to a 
specific scenario is matchless," says Vazsonyi. It doesn't prohibit free 
speech; it establishes a "politically correct vocabulary." It doesn't impede 
individual opportunity; it promotes "affirmative action." It doesn't 
confiscate private property; it protects "the environment "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence of creeping socialism is all around us. "The Constitution 
does not provide for group rights," says Vazsonyi. "Yet, a steadily 
growing number of groups is being granted an increasing number of 
rights. Defense, for which the Constitution does provide, has been 
surrounded by an atmosphere of derision and hostility; the effectiveness 
of our armed forces is being diminished through inappropriate use." The 
executive and judicial branches of our federal government have usurped 
legislative power. Laws defining so-called "hate crimes" have narrowed 
the boundaries of free speech. Environmental regulations have 
circumscribed private property rights.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Education used to be based on the best available information, the 
consensus of generations, and rewards designed to extract the best effort 
from all participants," observes Vazsonyi. "Currently, information is 
being replaced by propaganda, consensus by the whim and din of activist 
groups, best effort by primitive egalitarianism." Americans are no longer 
judged by their abilities, but by membership in favored classes. Our 
traditional standards of morality "are being displaced by doctrines which 
do not even recognize the existence of values; the spirit of voluntarism is 
being choked by coercion." Sadly, says Vazsonyi, all these symptoms of 
creeping socialism are endorsed by American liberals.

<title>Duplantier: TAX-FUNDED LOBBYING -- 4/15/96</title></head>

<h2>
TAX-FUNDED LOBBYING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Do you ever wonder where your federal income taxes go? Billions go to 
programs that subsidize special interest groups lobbying the government 
to increase spending! Consider the implications of that vicious circle 
when you file your 1040 today.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used to 
subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest groups," reports Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward bigger government, more spending,
and increased regulation. Every American is forced to finance this system 
that allows well-connected Washington-based groups to use taxpayer 
funds to advance political causes to which many Americans object."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AmeriCorps received $427 million from American taxpayers in 1995. 
Griffin claims that "several AmeriCorps programs have engaged in 
advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers," and 
in violation of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
Also in 1995, the Legal Services Corporation funneled $400 million of 
our money to private groups that "engage in political and lobbying 
activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal services needed by the 
poor." Griffin describes the Legal Services Corporation as "the legal 
pillar of the welfare state," litigating and lobbying to expand the number 
of welfare recipients and drive up costs by "hundreds of billions of 
dollars."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly $200 million was allocated for Title X Family Planning in 1995. 
"Despite the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive 
to large numbers of Americans," observes Griffin, "this high-profile 
political organization receives a substantial portion of its revenue each 
year" from programs administered under Title X. The National 
Endowment for the Humanities used the $180 million it received in 1995 
to promote "a liberal political and ideological agenda," says Griffin. 
"Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant in the 
National Endowment's most prominent current project, the so-called 
National Conversation. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment 
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council on 
Aging, the American Bar Association, and the American Library 
Association."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $75 million allocated to the Market Promotion Program in 1995 for 
developing "commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural 
commodities" wound up in the hands of "some of the largest and most 
vocal special interests in the country," Griffin charges. Recipients of 
Market Promotion Program grants "opposed bipartisan efforts to reform 
farm subsidies. They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate 
[the Market Protection Program] outright, and they also fought reforms 
designed to decrease taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large 
corporate farms. Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were 
subsidized unwittingly by the American taxpayer."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Griffin insists that "government funding of political activism is 
indefensible. Yet, hundreds of groups now receive government grants 
which are used, and used effectively, to subsidize their political 
activities." The question is, why do we put up with this outrage?

<h2>
COST OF REGULATIONS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Federal regulations raise the cost of the goods and services we purchase 
by $400 billion annually. In other words, federal regulations cost the 
average American family $4, 000 per year!
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 
2,000 inspectors across the country," reports John Hood of the Heritage 
Foundation. But those 2,000 snoops will inspect fewer than 10 percent of 
the six million workplaces in America, and are not likely to have any 
beneficial impact even at those locations. OSHA's workplace safety 
crusade "has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector 
initiatives," says Hood. OSHA has "little value to add to the worker 
safety picture. But its costs -- measured in lower productivity and wages, 
as well as higher prices and taxes -- are significant."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gary Becker of the Hoover Institution explains the impact of minimum 
wage hikes. "Higher labor costs reduce employment," he says. "A higher 
minimum will further reduce the employment opportunities of workers 
with few skills." In other words, teenagers, high school dropouts, and 
other low-skilled workers will lose their jobs if "their productivity is not 
high enough to justify the cost to employers." When workers lose their 
jobs, they stop paying taxes and start receiving unemployment or welfare 
benefits.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Richard Lesher of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describes the 
Americans with Disabilities Act as "yet another weapon in the hands of 
disgruntled employees with personal axes to grind." Besides the cost of 
nuisance lawsuits, there is "the expense of retrofitting tens of thousands 
of workplaces and public facilities with wheelchair ramps, elevators, 
toilet stalls, and other special provisions to accommodate people with a 
wide variety of handicaps," says Lesher. "Together with the soaring cost 
of litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act is proving to be a major 
expense for both public and private enterprises."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Government banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 
1978, and an international treaty phased out their use entirely in all 
industrial nations at the end of 1995. Jane Shaw and Richard Stroup of 
the Political Economy Research Center say these drastic actions are the 
result of hysteria, not scientific documentation. They argue that it's 
foolish for our federal government to prohibit the production of the 
nontoxic CFCs "used in millions of automobiles and refrigerators" when 
the available alternatives are "more costly, more corrosive to cooling 
systems, less dependable, and less manageable. Some even appear to be 
less safe." The benefits of halting CFC production are negligible, but the 
costs are likely to be extraordinarily high.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Just as our forefathers rebelled against 'taxation without representation,' 
today, private property owners are revolting over 'confiscation without 
compensation,'" says Congressman Billy Tauzin, author of the Private 
Property Owners Bill of Rights. "Clearly, the federal government has 
become our master rather than our servant," says Tauzin. "But American 
property owners . . . are fighting back."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are just a few examples of the regulatory abuses financed by our 
taxes.

<h2>
BIG GOVERNMENT THREATENS RIGHTS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The Federal Government compels us to fork over fully one-third of our 
income, and it uses that money to infringe on the civil liberties protected 
by our Bill of Rights.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects our right to 
practice our religious faith freely; and yet, the Supreme Court has often 
invoked this amendment to justify decisions restricting our freedom of 
religion. The nation's highest Court has prohibited the teaching of 
religion in public schools, as well as the recitation of prayers and the 
reading of the Bible.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Second Amendment protects the right of the individual to own and 
make use of guns. Liberal politicians view gun ownership as an 
interference with the expansion of federal power, which of course it is, 
for an armed citizenry is much more difficult to subjugate than one 
without weapons. Those who don't like the Second Amendment exploit 
every public tragedy involving firearms as propaganda for tighter 
restrictions on their use.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Our right to privacy, protected by the Third and Fourth Amendments, is 
also under attack. The Federal Government seems determined to increase 
its control over all of us by prying into our daily lives. Tax collectors and 
regulatory agents have been snooping on us for years; and now, in the 
name of combating terrorism, the President demands wiretapping 
privileges for federal agents to investigate any suspected felony. There 
are 1,300 federal felonies. You could be guilty of one right now without 
even knowing it.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Fifth Amendment not only protects us against double jeopardy and 
self-incrimination; it also prohibits the confiscation of our property by the 
Federal Government without proper compensation. Yet, today, 
Americans frequently find their property devalued by governmental 
edicts restricting the use of it -- or even taken from them altogether in the 
interest of some putative public good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Sixth Amendment guarantees our right to a trial by jury in a criminal 
case. How juries are selected and instructed, however, often determines 
how effective they are. Unfortunately, jurors are routinely screened on 
the basis of their philosophical or religious beliefs, and those who show 
any propensity for questioning the evidence in the case or the validity of 
the law are usually dismissed posthaste. The Seventh Amendment 
protects our right to a trial by jury in a civil suit, but the growth of 
regulatory agencies has enabled unelected bureaucrats to bypass that 
safeguard -- and instead act as prosecutor, judge, and jury. There are over 
13 million federal bureaucrats meddling in the daily affairs of American 
citizens.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some federal judges and regulatory agents simply disregard the Eighth 
Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable fines and punishments. Some 
also ignore the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which stipulate that the 
people and the States reserve to themselves all rights not expressly 
granted to the Federal Government. One thing is clear: If Americans want 
to retain the liberties protected by our Bill of Rights, we'd better make our 
voices heard.

<h2>
UNCHANGING TRUTHS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The best protection against the designs of demagogues, do-gooders, and 
other self-styled reformers is a  firm grasp of eternal verities.
</blockquote></i>
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that the sovereignty of the law 
must supersede the sovereignty of the ruler. The law is a higher authority 
than the ruler because it; proceeds from a higher authority. "He who 
commands that law should rule [commands] that God and reason alone 
should rule," said Aristotle. Democracies inevitably decline when they 
cease to respect this higher authority and place the interests of any one 
group above the common good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The English philosopher John Locke went to great lengths to distinguish 
liberty from license and to demonstrate that the law is the liberator, not 
the oppressor, of man: "Law, in its true notion, is not so much the 
limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper 
interest, and prescribes no farther than is for the general good of those 
under that law." Locke argued that "the end of the law is not to abolish or 
restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom," though he emphasized that 
freedom is not "a liberty for every man to do what he [pleases]."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder," observed the French economist 
Frederic Bastiat. No matter how noble the justification, once the premise 
is accepted that a government can expropriate the wealth of some of its 
citizens and dispense it to others, theft has been legalized, and the signal 
has been sent that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the greatest 
evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as the 
ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon argued that all forms of 
government enshrine one or the other of "two different and opposing 
fundamental principles -- individualism and collectivism. By 
individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is carried to a 
maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism a man's 
least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses no 
initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results: "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
American patriot John T. Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop 
apologizing for our capitalist society." We should take no more steps 
down the road to socialism, he said, and turn out of office any politician 
who tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out "that we are in a 
social war, and that we must fight it as such." He said we should "put an 
end to the orgy of spending that is rapidly bankrupting the nation," quit 
letting bureaucrats plan our economy, and instead let "our free system of 
private enterprise operate at its fullest capacity."

<h2>
GAMBLING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Gaming fever has been sweeping the country for nearly 10 years now -- 
long enough for its true impact to be measured.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It starts with a state lottery, the proceeds pledged to education or some 
such worthy cause. Then the gambling boats roll up the river, supposedly 
regulated to lessen their mischief. At last, the land-based casinos appear, 
promising an economic renaissance for distressed communities. But it 
soon becomes apparent that legalized gambling is not the golden-egg-
laying goose it was claimed to be. The proceeds from the lottery are 
never as high as hoped for, and the worthy cause that was supposed to 
benefit often finds its annual appropriation from the state legislature 
reduced by a like amount. The riverboats, discovering all kinds of 
unanticipated navigational hazards, ultimately drop their anchors 
permanently. The land-based casinos usurp the patronage of local 
retailers and burden city coffers with the cost of vices generated by 
gaming.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Casino gambling has been sold as the answer to economic problems 
everywhere it has been tried. But casinos serve as a gigantic sump, 
sucking sales from surrounding businesses," asserts Blake Hurst in the 
April issue of The American Enterprise magazine. "People who spend 
money at a casino can't spend it at [local restaurants], or the ballpark, or 
the amusement park. Gambling cannibalizes existing businesses, and the 
overall economic benefit to the economy is nil."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic impact is actually negative, when the cost of social vices 
encouraged by gambling is factored in. One expert cited by Hurst 
"estimates that the average gambler with a problem has from $53,000 to 
$92,000 in gambling-related debt." Another authority on the subject 
reports that "the societal costs imposed by each problem gambler are over 
$13,000, with some estimates running as high as $52,000 annually." A 
survey of wanton wagerers "found that 75 percent of pathological 
gamblers have committed a felony to support their habit." According to 
Gamblers Anonymous, there are as many as 10 million problem gamblers 
in America.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The economic case against gambling is clear," says Hurst. "Gambling 
doesn't create economic wealth, but rather transfers wealth from existing 
businesses to those lucky or influential enough to receive gambling 
monopolies from the state. Gambling increases political corruption and 
crime, and is a strikingly regressive means of raising revenue." That, 
believe it or not, is just the beginning of what's wrong with legalized 
gambling.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most damaging is the misleading message that legalized 
gambling sends to the citizenry, especially the young. "When the state 
removes the stigma from gambling by promoting it as a way to help 
education, people who have never gambled develop the habit. 
Governments may not be able to control vice, but surely they ought not to 
encourage it," says Blake Hurst. "When governments present riverboat 
casinos as economic development, they diminish those who build farms 
and factories. When states spend millions urging their citizens to play the 
lottery, they devalue the efforts of those who work hard and invest 
wisely."

<title>Duplantier: TAIWAN -- 4/22/96</title></head>

<h2>
TAIWAN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The missile tests and naval exercises that China conducted in March 
were meant to intimidate the people of Taiwan, and certainly 
accomplished that objective. But they may have had another, unintended 
impact: reminding the rest of the world that the People's Republic is not 
to be trusted.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On Taiwan, the people enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to choose their 
politicians, and the freedom to engage in a market economy," says Robert 
Morris, chairman and president of America's Future, the producer of this 
broadcast. "On the mainland, in the People's Republic of China, people 
are repressed politically and economically by a brutal communist 
dictatorship. Any dissension results in jail." The dramatically superior 
living conditions of the free Chinese on Taiwan are a daily affront to the 
mainland communists.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's missile testing exercise amounted to a de facto blockade of the 
sea and air lanes leading to Taiwan, which derives 40 percent of its gross 
domestic product from exports. Shipping had to be diverted from the 
country's two major ports, and air flights had to be re-routed. The 
psychological impact was even greater. The Taiwanese stock market has 
fallen 625 points since China's first series of threatening missile tests in 
July 1995, dropping 62 points in one day after the second series of tests 
was announced in March. "There have been shows of force before," says 
Morris, "but not in recent history has anything so directly affected 
Taiwan's commerce and its people."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Taiwan is an "unlikely success story," observes Morris. "Isolated off the 
south coast of China, the 19,000-square-mile island has blossomed into a 
free and vigorous country. It had become by 1990 the world's 13th-
largest trading nation. During the postwar period, its economy grew more 
rapidly than that of any other nation -- an annual average of over eight 
percent." Morris reports that Taiwan's west coast "is covered with all the 
trappings of a successful industrialized nation. Everywhere new suburbs 
have sprung up, linked by modern highways. Rice farms, dating back 
hundreds of years, now sit next to new, modern factories that ship 
products worldwide."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Morris says Taiwan's 21 million people "increasingly enjoy a lifestyle 
similar to those in the West. Its per capita annual income of $11,000 
ranks it among the world's top 25 nations, and stands in sharp contrast to 
the mainland average of $370." But the freedom and prosperity of 
Taiwan are "threatened by the hostile People's Republic of China, with a 
nuclear arsenal and the world's largest armed force. The communists 
maintain unbendingly that Taiwan is no more than a breakaway province, 
arguing that the free Chinese must acknowledge Beijing's sovereignty 
and submit to 'peaceful unification.'"
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Morris of America's Future recommends that the United States 
"increase arms sales to Taiwan and help the free Chinese create a modern 
defense system." He says the United States "should also expand 
economic and trade cooperation, and encourage other nations to accept 
Taiwan into the world community."

<h2>
CHINESE BANDITS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The communists in China may have nothing but contempt for the 
democratic values of the West, but that doesn't stop them from lusting 
after the prosperity that only a free society can attain.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China long to get their hands on the wealth of Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. They don't seem to understand how that wealth was 
created, or how quickly it would evaporate under communist control. Nor 
do they realize that China itself could be equally prosperous, if they 
would only allow their people the freedom to enjoy the fruits of their own 
labor.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China also covet the wealth of the United States. 
Since they're not willing to take the steps necessary to create such wealth 
in their own country, however, they've decided to steal ours. The Chinese 
government is actively pirating products and technology patented, 
copyrighted, and trademarked in America. The Chinese have stolen 
computer programs, pharmaceutical products, agricultural chemicals, 
musical recordings, videos, automotive designs, and other intellectual 
properties created by, and rightfully belonging to, American citizens and 
businesses.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These works of genius are a tribute to the remarkable potential of our 
free-enterprise system. They are the envy of the world, and a mainstay of 
our economy. They are, of course, available for sale to China. And China 
is certainly welcome to compete fairly with us by creating similar 
products on its own. That would involve hard work, however, and a 
liberalization of the Chinese economy that might prove dangerous for the 
slave masters in Beijing. So, instead, China simply copies American 
products illegally. Chinese factories churn out counterfeit CDs, videos, 
and computer programs by the thousands every day, selling their bootleg 
booty around the world.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These Chinese bandits are undermining the markets of American 
manufacturers to the tune of $1 billion per year. That's how much their 
piracy of U.S. intellectual property is estimated to cost our economy in 
lost exports. Lost exports mean lost jobs, in this case as many as 20,000. 
Unfortunately, American businessmen anxious to tap into the vast 
Chinese market are playing right into the hands of these conniving 
thieves. The experience of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is just 
one example of how Chinese communists deceive American businessmen 
in order to steal U.S. technology and equipment. By pretending to be in 
the market for a fleet of passenger planes, the Chinese were able to 
negotiate rock-bottom prices on the items that they really wanted -- U.S. 
equipment that would enable them to augment their military capabilities. 
Once they had that equipment in hand, they canceled the order for planes.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, U.S. negotiators persuaded the Chinese to sign yet another 
agreement promising to put an end to their piracy. Getting them to sign 
was easy. Getting them to honor the agreement is another thing. U.S. 
officials keep threatening to impose trade sanctions, but the Chinese don't 
take them seriously, and go right on stealing.

<h2>
REP. SMITH ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
During hearings last May on the coercive population control program 
that Communist China has conducted for at least two decades, the 
chairman of a House Subcommittee posed the question. Should such a 
monstrous abuse of human rights affect our relations with that barbaric 
country?
</blockquote></i>

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Christopher Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on International Operations and Human Rights, began his opening 
remarks by noting that Communist China "routinely compels women to 
abort their 'unauthorized' unborn children. The usual method," he 
observed, "is intense 'persuasion' using all of the economic, social, and 
psychological tools a totalitarian State has at its disposal. When these 
methods fail, the woman is taken physically to the abortion mill. Forced 
abortions are often performed very late in pregnancy, even in the ninth 
month." The final indignity is forced sterilization for the woman or her 
husband.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Forced abortion was properly considered a crime against humanity at the 
Nuremberg war crimes tribunal," Congressman Smith continued. "It is 
employed regularly with chilling effectiveness and unbearable pain upon 
women in the People's Republic of China. Women in China are required 
to obtain a birth coupon before conceiving a child. Chinese women are 
hounded by the population control police and even their menstrual cycles 
are publicly monitored as one means of ensuring compliance. "
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Smith reported that the communist government in China 
has recently "issued a new law on eugenics which is now taking effect 
and which nationalizes discrimination against the handicapped. In a move 
that is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany, the Communist Chinese 
Government is implementing forced abortion against handicapped 
children and forced sterilization against parents who simply do not 
measure up in the eyes of the State. Despite all of this," said Smith, "the 
United Nations Population Fund continues to provide funds, materiel, 
people [and the] shield of respectability that the Chinese program so 
desperately wants."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Smith chastised the head of the UN Population Fund for insisting that 
China's birth control program is voluntary. "This is unmitigated nonsense 
and a big lie," said the congressman. "Degrading a few men, women, and 
children may be of no great matter for the Chinese communist regime, 
which has long regarded homicide and torture as among the basic tools of 
statecraft," conceded Smith, but that doesn't explain the willingness of 
Westerners to overlook -- or even facilitate -- such abuses. "So the most 
shocking thing about forced abortions and sterilization in China is not 
that they happen," said Smith, "but that otherwise humane societies such 
as the United States might forcibly return people who have managed to 
escape from them."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is exactly what our current government has done. "The Clinton 
administration, which campaigned on a human rights platform that was 
justly critical of some of the refugee policies of its predecessors," said 
Smith, "quickly reversed course and began mass forcible repatriations of 
people who had escaped from China." The President has thus made the 
American people a party to the slaughter of innocents in China.

<P><blockquote><i>  
Thousands of children will die in communist China's state-run 
orphanages this year, and it won't be any accident.

</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A former research specialist with the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 
"Chinese orphans are given sleeping pills instead of food, tied to cribs 
and chairs, left unchanged when soiled, denied medical care, and allowed 
to die of neglect." John Aird, author of a new book called "Slaughter of 
the Innocents: Coercive Birth Control in China," charges that "as many as 
90 percent of the children admitted to some institutions die there." That's 
because "China's leaders consider these children 'surplus' population. 
They try to prevent their birth by forced abortion." Chinese mothers-to-be 
who refuse to submit to government-mandated abortions are fined, 
beaten, imprisoned, and deprived of their homes and property. Even if 
they manage to deliver their babies alive, the newborns are still in danger. 
Writing in the April issue of The American Enterprise magazine, Aird 
asserts that Chinese doctors "work under orders by the authorities to kill 
all babies born without government permission."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More than 14 million abortions will be performed in communist China 
this year, and American taxpayers will pay for many of them. The U.S. 
Government contributes to the United Nations Fund for Population 
Activities, which supports China's coercive birth control program. "When 
the coercion in the program became undeniable in 1993, statements of 
protest were issued by the Clinton administration," notes Aird. "Yet 
President Clinton then went on to restore U.S. funding," which the 
Reagan administration had suspended in 1985.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Strong words followed by weak actions sending a contrary signal have 
become the standard response of the Clinton administration to human 
rights offenses in China," observes Aird. Why aren't Americans 
protesting our government's support for China's murderous methods of 
undermining maternity? Aird speculates that "the unsubstantiated but 
widely held belief in a world population crisis has dulled public outrage 
over violations of reproductive freedom in China." He also suggests that 
"business interests intent on seeking profits by investing in China's 
booming economy do not want to risk strained relations with China over 
its human rights violations."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whatever the reason, the American people have not sufficiently 
publicized their repugnance for these policies, and the indifference of our 
government has been interpreted as a tacit endorsement of Chinese 
methods. "China's rulers apparently now feel free to expand tyrannical 
practices not only in birth control but also in the treatment of political 
dissidents," observes Aird, and we are in part to blame. "Although 
Chinese leaders say publicly that foreign criticism of China's human 
rights record . . . will not be accepted, China has in practice shown itself 
to be extremely sensitive to determined criticism backed by potential 
actions."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aird argues that the U.S. should "amend our immigration laws to 
recognize persecution under compulsory family planning programs as a 
basis for granting asylum. And we should withhold all funding from the 
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation, and any other organization that provides 
assistance to China's harsh birth control program."

<h2>
MOSHER ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but reports of fetal cannibalism in 
communist China have been confirmed.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rumors circulated for months, and the decent Americans who heard 
them fervently hoped that they were fabricated. Then, documentation 
appeared, and reputable religious and conservative publications had no 
choice but to file their disturbing news reports. The mainstream media 
have yet to acknowledge the unpleasant reality, but even they will not be 
able to ignore it forever.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an interview published in the January issue of the Rutherford Institute's 
monthly journal, the executive director of Human Life International's 
Population Research Institute confirms that aborted fetuses are consumed 
for health purposes in China and blames the communist government in 
Beijing for making this revolting practice possible. With as many as 14 
million abortions performed in China in a single year, "there's an ample 
supply of aborted fetuses," says Steven Mosher. Noting that the Chinese 
government is "an avowedly atheistic one which regards human beings 
only as highly evolved apes," Mosher argues that the utilitarian mindset 
inculcated in the Chinese people by their government is what "gives rise 
to fetal consumption."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Don't say it can't happen here, because it can. American society is also 
infected with utilitarianism, and the symptoms of this morally bankrupt 
philosophy are all around us. Mosher warns that "there's very little going 
on in China that isn't happening to one degree or another in the United 
States." The Chinese perform late-term abortions, and so do we. The 
Chinese forcibly sterilize women of child-bearing age, and the practice of 
tying tubes without asking is not unheard-of in American hospitals. The 
Chinese use "surplus" babies for cruel experiments, and we use fetal 
tissue from "surplus" babies for our own sickening scientific studies.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In China," observes Mosher, "the use of ultrasound technology to detect 
defects in the unborn child is very common, and many fetuses are aborted 
for the sole reason that they happen to be female. But in the United States 
it's not illegal to abort children for reasons of gender, and it's quite 
common to abort children because a test has revealed a possible 
chromosomal defect."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's war on its own children will eventually spread to its elderly. 
Noting that "the population of China is aging more rapidly than any 
human population in the history of the world," as a direct result of its 
coercive birth control program, Mosher predicts that "China's future will 
involve a massive campaign of euthanasia." In fact, the elderly are 
already being denied medical treatment in Chinese hospitals "on the 
ground that treating them is not cost-effective."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mosher warns that China's self-consuming culture represents "one 
possible future of the United States." He notes that "there is a certain 
element of the radical environmentalist movement which believes that the 
population of the United States . . . should be reduced by half." If we 
don't make a convincing case for life, they may get their wish.

<title>Duplantier: Flat Tax -- 4/29/96</title>

<h2>Flat Tax </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"Americans are tired of our oppressive tax code and they want a new 
system. But to get there, they need an honest and open debate. They're 
not getting it from the politicians and the media."
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
Having recognized that they could no longer ignore the subject of the 
flat tax, the mainstream media have recently resorted to their second-
favorite tactic: misrepresenting the issue. They claim that the flat 
tax will hurt homeowners by eliminating the deduction for mortgage 
interest. They suggest that the flat tax will send philanthropy into a 
free fall by eliminating the deduction for charitable giving. They say 
that the flat tax isn't even a tax cut -- and, if it is, well, then, 
it's a tax cut that favors the rich! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Congressman Dick Armey of Texas thinks it's time to set the record 
straight on the flat tax. The House Majority Leader insists that, no 
matter what the media may say, the flat tax is indeed a tax cut: "With 
a flat tax the middle class will pay less in taxes, their wages will 
increase, and they will keep more of what they earn to save and invest 
in their families." If that's not a tax cut, what is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media attempt to foment class envy, but that doesn't change the 
fact that the flat tax does indeed tax investment income. "What it 
doesn't do," says Armey, "is tax it twice." Businesses will continue 
to pay taxes under a flat tax system. Since corporate income taxes are 
paid, ultimately, by investors, the current tax on investment income 
is actually a second tax on the same income. "Under a flat tax," says 
Armey, "all income, including investment income, is taxed once and 
only once." Why should investors be required, as they are now, to pay 
tax on income that's already been taxed? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media resort to scare tactics to unnerve the middle-class 
mortgage-holder, but the fact remains that "the flat tax is good for 
homeowners." Armey argues that the flat tax will "lower interest 
rates, reduce mortgage payments, and put more money in the pockets of 
working Americans." Lower rates, lower payments, more money left over 
-- how can that be bad? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media cynically assume that deductibility drives donations, but 
Armey argues that "the flat tax will not reduce charitable giving. 
Americans don't consult their tax tables and accountants before 
helping their neighbors in need. As our family incomes increase, so 
too will our generosity." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It doesn't matter what the mainstream media say, because the flat tax 
is an idea whose time has come. Congressman Dick Armey maintains that 
the flat tax is "bigger than any politician. It's bigger than any 
political party. And it's bigger than the Washington establishment. It 
belongs to the American people." Armey argues that "class-warfare 
rhetoric" and "narrow, special-interest propaganda" will only delay 
the day of reckoning. "The American people," he says, "deserve an 
open, honest debate on tax reform. Right now."

<h2>Michael New</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The case of Army Specialist Michael New is a lot more complicated 
than it looks. It involves considerably more than the mere question of 
a soldier disobeying a commanding officer.
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
"The case of Michael New appears simple at first glance," says 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland. "A soldier disobeys a direct 
order and is court-martialed, convicted, and given a bad conduct 
discharge." There's a lot more to it than that, however. "Michael New 
is the first American soldier prosecuted for declining to wear the 
uniform and badge of another government," observes Congressman 
Bartlett. "What is at stake is nothing less than whether we are a 
nation ruled by men, or one ruled by laws."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bartlett points out that Michael New is a decorated soldier who 
previously served in a United Nations peacekeeping mission. He 
participated in "Operation Southern Watch" in Kuwait in 1993 -- albeit 
"under an American commander wearing his American uniform." Bartlett 
notes that Michael New also agreed to go to Macedonia, as commanded, 
"but questioned his additional orders to wear a United Nations uniform 
including a blue beret and shoulder patch, to rely solely upon a 
United Nations identification card, and to serve under the overall 
command of a foreign officer." New concluded that these orders would 
unlawfully "transfer his allegiance to the United Nations."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As it happens, quite a few of our Congressmen agree with Michael New 
that these orders were illegal. Roscoe Bartlett addresses the issues 
one by one. First, the uniform: "Altering the Army Battle Dress 
Uniform with any foreign badge is prohibited under Army uniform 
regulations." Second, the UN I.D. card: "No American soldier, prior to 
the Macedonia mission, had ever been required to carry and rely upon a 
UN identity card." Third, the question of foreign command: "The 
president as commander-in-chief does not have the authority to deploy 
American soldiers to serve under foreign command."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of Congressmen also believe that the mission itself is 
unlawful. The deployment of U.S. troops to Macedonia was "authorized 
and always explicitly defined as a 'Chapter VII' peace enforcement 
operation under the UN Charter," observes Bartlett. "American military 
participation in Chapter VII UN Operations always requires prior 
congressional approval under Section 6 of the United Nations 
Participation Act and under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution." 
Bartlett concludes that "Mr. Clinton's order to deploy American combat 
troops to Macedonia beginning in July 1993 was illegal and 
inconsistent with U.S. statutes and the Constitution."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Roscoe Bartlett believes that "Americans should be grateful for 
Michael New's moral courage to obey his conscience and our 
Constitution." The Congressman has introduced a resolution in the 
House of Representatives called "The American Hero Restoration Act," 
which urges President Clinton to overturn the conviction of Michael 
New and "restore his place of honor in our military." Bartlett says 
it's time to affirm that "American soldiers enlist in our all-
volunteer military to fight for and defend the United States, not the 
United Nations."

<h2>Environmental Phobias</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
What do radon, second-hand smoke, global warming, and the hole in the 
ozone layer all have in common? Just this: The danger they pose has 
been greatly exaggerated in order to justify some unnecessary 
government action.
</i></blockquote>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"During 1995, scare stories about a future catastrophic greenhouse 
warming gained much momentum, while at the same time the evidence for 
such warming became weaker and weaker," observes Fred Singer of the 
Science and Environmental Policy Project in a recent Washington Times 
editorial. Those scare stories, unfortunately, provide seemingly 
justification for the Global Climate Treaty. The UN-sponsored 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year approved two 
summary reports that "convey the impression of impending doom and 
provide a spur for hasty and ill-advised action to cut the use of 
energy fuels." The reports created this misleading impression, says 
Singer, by "withholding crucial information (such as that the data 
show a warming rate of zero!)."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Singer points out that 1995 was also the year in which "the production 
of CFCs and other useful chemicals was banned -- in the mistaken 
belief that this policy would avert an epidemic of skin cancer. 
Scientific evidence does not support this hasty action," he says. 
"There is no data to indicate that ultraviolet radiation reaching the 
earth's surface is increasing by even a few percent -- as might be 
expected if the ozone layer were thinning."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November of last year, the Congressional Research Service released 
a report that reviewed published studies of the effects of "second-
hand" smoke. The report, says Singer, "found no support" for the 
Environmental Protection Agency's 1992 classification of second-hand 
smoke as a "Class A carcinogen" in the workplace. The risk of lung 
cancer posed by second-hand smoke was not statistically significant, 
it turns out, so the EPA simply redefined "statistical significance." 
Singer charges that the EPA "distorted science to establish a 
correlation and suggest a causation that cannot be proven with the 
data at hand."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Also in 1995, evidence was published demonstrating that low levels of 
radioactivity pose no health threat to humans. Ironically, says 
Singer, "the EPA is stirring up more fears just as we learn that 
naturally occurring radon is a very minor risk for lung cancer."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, is the earth getting warmer? No, but this is the excuse used to 
restrict access to energy. Is the ozone layer developing a hole? No, 
but this mythic menace sufficed to prohibit the production of CFCs. Is 
second-hand smoke a statistically significant carcinogen? No, but 
trumped-up findings to that effect could have led to mandated smoking 
bans in workplaces everywhere. Is radon the "number one environmental 
health hazard"? No, but EPA scare tactics will likely make radon 
mitigation a multi-billion-dollar industry. Fred Singer of the Science 
and Environmental Policy Project points out that "environmental 
regulation is now costing the nation more than $150 billion per year." 
That's a cost we can ill afford, especially for imaginary dangers.

<h2>Government Bureaucracy</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Few American taxpayers noticed much difference when thousands of 
government workers were declared nonessential and told to stay home 
until the federal budget crisis could be resolved. The only question 
was, how did so many unnecessary employees ever land a civil service 
job in the first place?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 In a recent editorial in the Washington Times, Gordon Jones of the 
Association of Concerned Taxpayers records the candid observations of 
one federal government employee regarding the low levels of 
productivity among his coworkers. "A large percentage of federal 
workers hurt rather than help get the work done," claims the 
exasperated civil servant, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain 
nameless. (We'll call him J.B., short for Jaundiced Bureaucrat.) J.B. 
complains that the worst one-third of the federal work force "actually 
drains energy and production from the efforts of their colleagues." 
Clearly, it would be better to pay such people to stay home; but, if 
that's the case, why pay them at all?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The worst offenders were probably born that way, but there's something 
about working for the government that devitalizes even the most 
competent and conscientious civil servant. "Most federal workers did 
not start this way," says J.B. "Most walked in the door on their first 
day of federal service with a strong work ethic and an optimistic 
vision of serving their fellow citizens." Eventually, however, "the 
dysfunctional work environment takes its toll. First they lose their 
optimism, and then many lose their work ethic. Why? Because they 
observe many nonproductive troublemakers going undisciplined, and 
hardworking individuals going unrewarded. They learn that the 
personnel policies and processes encourage frivolous grievances and 
insupportable accusations. They learn that, in most cases, it is more 
helpful to your federal career to maintain the status quo."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where are the managers, the persons responsible for motivating the 
work force and assessing individual performance? They're there, all 
right, but they're not doing their jobs. "The word 'management' is 
often used in the federal service by people who do not seem to 
understand what it means," observes J.B. "Individuals selected for 
their political connections instead of their management ability fill 
critical decision-making positions." Such persons are "guided by a 
perspective that demands a short-term 'fix' rather than a longer-term 
solution." The yes men they surround themselves with are happy to 
validate this self-serving approach.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may come as a surprise that many of the idlers feeding at the 
public trough in Washington feel themselves strangely put upon. 
Despite all evidence to the contrary, they're convinced that they're 
underpaid, compared to private-sector employees, and overworked. J.B. 
dismisses these complaints. "An amazing number of federal employees," 
he insists, "could not qualify for jobs in the private sector that 
paid anywhere near our current salaries." With 10 weeks' worth of 
vacation, holidays, and sick leave each year -- and precious little 
expected from him when he does show up at the office -- J.B. confesses 
that he is anything but underpaid and overworked.

<h2>College Education</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The National Association of Scholars has just published a devastating 
report on the dumbing down of 50 top undergraduate colleges and 
universities in America.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comparing the years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993, the National 
Association of Scholars concludes that students at our country's elite 
institutions of higher learning no longer receive a comprehensive 
liberal-arts education. The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that provide the historical, 
cultural, political and scientific basics of our society.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses plummeted from an average of 10 in 
1914 to fewer than three in 1993. Students are rarely required now to 
take basic survey courses in key disciplines. Few of today's courses 
require prerequisites, thereby diminishing the cumulative impact of a 
college education. In 1914, universities offered an average of only 23 
courses per institution that did not require a prerequisite course; 
today, the number is 582. Only 12 percent of universities now require 
a thesis or comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree. As 
late as 1964, more than half of universities did.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Few colleges teach writing or mathematics any more, a fact that is 
evidenced by the appalling number of graduates who can neither draft a 
coherent memo nor keep a basic ledger. In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; today, it's 
only 36 percent. In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; now, only 12 percent do. As late 
as 1964, more than 70 percent of the institutions required at least 
one course in the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 
34 percent. In 1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required 
history; now only one of the 50 schools has a required history course. 
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the institutions in 
1914; today, not one of the "best" institutions has a literature 
requirement.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has quintupled since 1914. That quantity, unfortunately, 
does not translate into quality. The majority of these additional 
courses feature arcane subjects of interest, and profit, only to the 
dilettantes who offer them. Many courses don't even offer college-
level material, but seek instead to remedy the many deficiencies of 
the average high school education. Sometimes these courses are called 
"remedial," but the institutions prefer euphemisms such as "second 
tier" and "sub-freshman." Unheard of prior to 1939, today such make-up 
courses are offered in 70 percent of the elite universities, and most 
of them award college credit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Association of Scholars concludes that our best colleges 
and universities now turn out graduates who are painfully ignorant of 
western civilization and heritage. They do not learn the highlights of 
our history, they do not understand the implications of our political 
and economic systems, and they cannot appreciate our literary and 
artistic legacies. Because our colleges have failed us, we now risk 
losing the common bond that unites us as Americans.

<h2>Free Trade</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Absolute free trade between countries does not exist. With the 
possible exception of the United States, all manage their trade to 
serve their own national interests.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sovereign countries should establish trade policies that serve their 
own best interests, and they should expect their trading partners to 
do likewise. So-called free trade really makes no sense. Fair trade, 
however, is something different. All countries should be held to a 
certain minimal standard in their trade practices, and those that fail 
to live up to such a standard should be penalized. Many of the foreign 
countries that trade with America routinely resort to unfair 
practices, such as devaluing their currency, nationalizing U.S. 
property, violating agreements, stealing our patents and copyrights, 
and counterfeiting our money. It is absurd to advocate "free trade" 
with countries that engage in such disreputable practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Free trade" was the slogan used to persuade Congress to pass NAFTA 
and GATT, but what these treaties have done is put U.S. trade under 
the control of powerful new international bureaucracies. GATT created 
the World Trade Organization, which has a legislature, an executive 
branch, and a judicial system to control global trade. GATT is also 
loaded with 22,000 pages of special-interest provisions. What kind of 
"free trade" is it that provides for U.S. taxpayer subsidies of 
foreign industries and governments?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes right down to it, the NAFTA and GATT gang are really 
protectionists. They use the power of government to protect their 
friends. They could care less about protecting American workers, but 
they didn't hesitate to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to protect New York 
investment banks from the consequences of their bad investments in 
Mexico. The GATT treaty was filled with hidden handouts and 
perquisites for the politically powerful, who trumpeted their support 
for "free trade" without publicizing the potential for profit that 
motivated them.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's Founding Fathers were all avowed protectionists. To a man, 
they believed that protection of American workers and industries from 
cheap foreign imports is essential to our prosperity, our 
independence, and our sovereignty. The first act passed by our first 
Congress established tariffs on foreign goods -- an essential rite of 
passage in the transformation of our country from dependent colony to 
sovereign nation. Unfortunately, for the last 25 years, U.S. trade 
policy has been dominated by giant corporations that want to take 
advantage of cheap foreign labor and still have open access to 
American markets. Congressmen and executive branch officials 
accommodate these interests with the expectation of future employment 
or other consideration from the companies they favor at the expense of 
their countrymen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More and more economists are beginning to recognize that "free trade" 
will bring about the total destruction of the balance between capital 
and labor, allowing capital to squeeze labor costs lower and lower. 
This will drive prices lower too, of course, but lower prices will not 
provide much solace to consumers in the long run, because consumers 
are also workers, and workers without jobs cannot take advantage of 
lower prices.

<h2>MSAs</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
 A march to protest the inequities of managed health care is planned 
for our nation's capital this month. Opposition to the tactics of 
health maintenance organizations is bubbling over.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Health maintenance organizations (known as HMOs) suffer from a built-
in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and the CEOs make more money 
when they deny their policyholders the right to see a specialist. 
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to the problem, however -
- one that would put extra money in the pockets of workers whose real 
wages have declined, and ease the strain of downsizing by allowing 
them to take some of their benefits with them when they leave a 
company.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The solution is Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), which most 
House Republicans campaigned on in 1994. Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, but Clinton 
vetoed the measure. Then the House passed it again in its health care 
reform bill, which is now pending. But President Clinton and the 
Washington press corps are trying to bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich 
Congress into passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill without MSAs, in an 
effort to resurrect the Hillary health-care plan resoundingly rejected 
in 1994.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care: the high cost, the choice of doctors, 
portability, pre-existing conditions, job lock, uninsured Americans, 
gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-payments, paperwork, long-
term care, the looming insolvency of Medicare, and even the decline in 
real wages. Here is how MSAs work: An employer buys his employee a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pays the deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
an individual Medical Savings Account. The employee can use this ready 
cash to visit the doctors, hospitals, and clinics of his choice, and 
the high-deductible policy covers any additional expenses. The 
employee owns his own MSA, and can take it with him when changing 
jobs, thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing 
conditions, and job lock. MSA funds are available for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans or by Medicare. Best of 
all, any MSA funds that an employee does not spend will accumulate in 
his own tax-free, interest-bearing savings account. MSAs thus restore 
consumer discipline to the medical marketplace, providing incentives 
to save.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans. Our present 
system unfairly grants tax-deductibility only to plans owned by 
employers, but not to plans that allow individual employees to own 
their own health insurance, control their own health care spending, or 
set up their own plan. The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-
plated health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
self-employed must buy health insurance with after-tax income. It's 
time for Congress to give us the solution to all these problems: 
Medical Savings Accounts.

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
More and more minority members are voicing their opposition to 
affirmative action, rejecting the patronizing racial preferences that 
are supposed to benefit them in college admissions and business 
employment.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February, an initiative prohibiting preferential treatment on the 
state and local level qualified for the November ballot in California. 
In March, a federal appeals court rejected the use of racial 
preferences in determining admissions to the University of Texas law 
school. Even as we speak, legislation is pending in Congress that 
would prohibit the use of racial preferences in the hiring of federal 
employees and the awarding of federal contracts. What's going on in 
the state legislatures, the federal courts, and the Congress?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's happening is that minority members themselves are becoming 
increasingly vocal in their opposition to racial preferences, 
recognizing these condescending concessions as the ultimate form of 
racial prejudice -- and rejecting the pandering posture of the self-
appointed minority leaders who promote them. With this groundswell of 
opposition among the supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences, it 
has now become politically feasible to denounce the injustice of 
affirmative action.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terry Eastland is the author of a new book called<i> Ending Affirmative 
Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.</i> In a recent editorial in the 
Wall Street Journal, Eastland observes that racial preferences "have 
never enjoyed majority support and are now in serious political 
trouble." For one thing, there's simply no denying that racial 
preferences are discriminatory. "Whatever might be said in support of 
preferences, they necessarily discriminate against those who lack the 
'right' race or sex. There is no getting around this fact," says 
Eastland, noting that the white female plaintiff denied admission to 
the University of Texas law school "had academic credentials superior 
to most of the black and Mexican-American students admitted under an 
affirmative action plan."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While encouraging what is called "reverse discrimination," preferences 
rarely provide any substantial remedy for actual discrimination 
against minorities. "Because preferences are often a response to 
presumed discrimination on the part of a company, a government, or 
society generally, they move the focus away from the real instances of 
discrimination," says Eastland. Not only that, but they tend to 
benefit the most gifted minority members, leaving the truly 
disadvantaged in some ways worse off than before.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Affirmative action has halted, and in fact reversed, progress toward 
the color-blind society that civil rights activists once claimed as 
their goal. "Preferences have made it harder to overcome the tendency 
. . . of judging people in terms of their racial and ethnic groups," 
says Eastland. The irrationality and injustice of affirmative action 
is apparent to any thinking person, and that is why "substantial 
numbers (sometimes large majorities) of those typically eligible for 
preferential treatment -- African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans -- tell pollsters they are opposed to preferences." Eastland 
concludes that "only law that neither advantages nor disadvantages on 
account of race or ethnicity is law that can equally protect everyone 
in our increasingly diverse nation."

<h2>Privatizing Prisons</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Privately run correctional facilities are cheaper, and better 
managed, than public prisons. There's only one reason there aren't 
more of them in America: politics.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Privately owned or operated prisons "are widespread throughout the 
United States," observes Steven Loux, a policy analyst for the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In a report published by the 
Key State's Commonwealth Foundation, Loux presents evidence showing 
that "such private facilities are advantageous to governments because 
they save a great deal of money, perhaps more than 10 percent per year 
in operating costs as compared to equivalent public facilities." Not 
only that, but "private prisons meet, if not surpass, the quality of 
services for prisoners and the protection to the general public 
provided by public prisons."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Loux argues that "government is simply not capable of delivering, 
running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as 
effectively as are private firms." For one thing, government does not 
have the benefit of the price system to help guide its decisions. 
Conversely, the private sector is not subject to the political 
considerations that often militate against cost-effective decisions in 
state bureaucracies. "Since political actors do not suffer economic 
pain from operating inefficient businesses, unlike private actors, the 
temptation to substitute the goals of politically influential players 
for cost-effectiveness is overwhelming," says Loux. "The authorities, 
the executive and the legislature, use their monopoly power over the 
delivery of prison services to assist certain ends -- those of 
politicians, bureaucrats, and prison employees."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though government itself does not respond automatically to profit 
considerations, it can take advantage of the profit-orientation of 
private-sector suppliers. "Profit can be used to discipline private 
firms in ways that it cannot discipline public bureaucracies," says 
Loux. "In fact, market competition can push private firms to not only 
meet government guidelines, but even exceed them." Such are the 
wonders of renewable contracts. "State bureaucracies cannot be fired," 
Loux laments, "but private firms that contract with the state can."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reason that private prisons are more economical to operate than 
public facilities is not because they pay their employees less. In 
fact, the evidence indicates that "private prison firms generally do 
offer equivalent salaries and benefits for individual employees." Loux 
cites "significantly different benefit programs" and "lower absentee 
rates among private employees" as two of the cost advantages of 
private prisons. "Economies of scale," he adds, "can play a role in 
reducing the cost of private prisons. Private firms can purchase in 
bulk for their entire operation, and can do so with less bureaucratic 
involvement in comparison to public agencies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other reasons, as well. Loux notes that "government 
agencies, in their desire to maintain their level of functioning in 
the upcoming year, want to prevent any decrease in their funding. 
Consequently, any surplus funding at the end of the year must be spent 
in some way." Also, "private firms, because they can be terminated and 
because they face competition, have the incentive to cater their 
operations to government cost standards."

<h2>Education Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
During the recent government shutdown, the Department of Education 
determined that 89 percent of its workforce was "nonessential. " Why, 
then, are 4500 extra bureaucrats receiving $240 million a year in 
salaries?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United 
States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the 
States and the people, and a Federal Department of Education is 
inconsistent with such principles," claim the sponsors of the "Back to 
Basics Education Reform Act" now being considered by Congress. 
"Tradition and experience dictate that the governance and management 
of schools in the United States are best performed by parents, 
teachers, and communities. The intrusion by the Department of 
Education into education policy has not benefited the quality of 
education in this nation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reform bill's numerous sponsors claim that the Department of 
Education has "weakened the ability of parents to make essential 
decisions about their children's education and has undermined the 
capacity of communities to govern their schools. In the 15 years of 
its existence," they report, "the Department of Education has grown 
from 130 programs and a budget of $14 billion to over 240 separately 
authorized programs which cost almost $32 billion annually. Meanwhile, 
education performance has stagnated or deteriorated."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reformers in Congress argue that the Department of Education has 
"fostered overregulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and 
litigation in United States education. The Department of Education 
spends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead. As 
an organization, it is inefficient, ill-managed, and wasteful." What's 
the solution? "Only through initiatives led by parents and local 
communities with the power to act can the United States elevate 
educational performance toward an acceptable level. The Department of 
Education," the Congressmen observe, "has been hostile to many 
promising reform ideas."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stated purpose of the Back to Basics Education Reform Act is four-
fold: "to improve the quality of elementary and secondary and higher 
education programs in the nation; to return the responsibility and 
authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, students, 
and States, and provide them greater control over education spending; 
to ensure that the Federal Government does not overregulate and 
interfere in the decision-making of parents, local communities, 
teachers, and students regarding education; and to ensure that 
Americans are able to compete in the global economy of the 21st 
century."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Back to Basics Education Reform Act would repeal Goals 2000, the 
School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and the National Education 
Statistics Act. It would also abolish the Department of Education. In 
addition, the bill recommends "a review and evaluation as to the 
feasibility of further enhancing the ability of States and local 
communities to fund education by reducing the Federal tax burden and 
commensurately eliminating Federal Government involvement in providing 
grants for education programs." Isn't it time we put an end to Uncle 
Sam's unconstitutional meddling in education -- and give those 4500 
nonessential education bureaucrats a chance to do something productive 
with their lives?

 <h2> MOTHERHOOD II</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>

 
Early in December of 1947, Dr. J.A. MacDougall promised a young  
woman dying of tuberculosis that, if she lived long enough, he'd let her  
leave the hospital for a few hours to celebrate Christmas at home with  
her family. </I></blockquote>
 
The numerous medical procedures the doctors had tried in an effort to  
seal the tubercular cavity in the lower lobe of this 23-year-old woman's  
right lung had failed. "Amazingly, she was still alive on Christmas Eve,  
but just barely," Dr. MacDougall recalled, so he kept his promise to let  
her spend Christmas Day at home with her husband and their only child.  
She was grateful for that brief respite, but continued to decline. By the  
end of February, she was down to 80 pounds, and "new complications  
developed. She became nauseous -- even without food in her stomach." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Dr. MacDougall dismissed as "ridiculous" a colleague's suggestion that  
his patient might be pregnant. "Everything I knew about medicine added  
up to one conclusion: she was so ill, so weak, that she couldn't possibly  
have conceived. Her body wasn't up to it. Nevertheless, I ordered a  
pregnancy test. To my astonishment, it was positive." The doctor and his  
colleagues were confronted with a moral dilemma. "Legally, medically,  
we could have taken the child through abortion; it imperiled a life that  
was already in jeopardy. But we didn't do it," Dr. MacDougall confided.  
The doctors shared the woman's religious objections, but they also were  
convinced that "the operation would kill her [and that] her body would  
reject the child anyway." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Somehow, the woman clung to life -- her own and that of her unborn  
child. "And in late June, 1948, an incredible thing happened," said Dr.  
MacDougall. "She began to eat, and to gain weight. A chest X-ray  
showed that the growth of the TB cavity had stopped. Not long after,  
another X-ray showed why: the diaphragm was pushing up against the  
lower lobe of her diseased lung to make room for the child she was  
bearing. Nature was doing exactly what we'd failed to do: it was pressing  
the sides of that deadly hole together. The child was saving the mother." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What prompted Dr. MacDougall to recount the details of this amazing  
incident forty years after it occurred? "I'm concerned about the  
liberalization of abortion laws and the growing clamor for even greater  
liberalization," he explained. "I'm against it on medical grounds: a  
doctor doesn't exist to take life, but to save it. I'm against it on religious  
grounds: I believe that human life is sacred, that only He who creates life  
has the right to take it away. I'm against it, finally, because of the case  
I've described. The child didn't destroy the mother. It saved her. Call it  
the will of God; call it human love; call it the mystical quality of  
motherhood, the turning in upon herself to fight still more because she  
had still more to fight for; call it what you will. It happened." 
 <BR>

<h2> LAW OF THE SEA TREATY</h2>   
<P>
<blockquote><I>
   
The Clinton administration is trying to persuade the United States    
Senate to ratify a United Nations Treaty that Ronald Reagan refused to    
sign, with good reason, fourteen years ago!</I>   
</blockquote>

   
Despite abundant resources, America nevertheless lacks certain essential    
minerals, such as cobalt, bauxite, chromium, manganese, and platinum.    
Cobalt is essential for jet engines, magnetic materials for electronics,    
metal cutting, and mineral tools. Bauxite is essential to aluminum, and is    
also important to refractories, chemicals, packaging, mechanical    
equipment, and abrasives. Chromium is essential to metallurgical,    
refractory, and chemical industries. Manganese is essential to steel, pig    
iron, dry cell batteries, and various chemical processes. Platinum-group    
metals are essential to automobiles, chemical processing, the electrical    
industry, and petroleum refining.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
We import most of our manganese from Russia and South Africa. Yet,    
the ocean floor extending from our West Coast to Hawaii is rich in    
deposits of this mineral. U.S. security interests may depend on our access    
to such vital resources at the bottom of the sea, but the financial    
investment required to bring them to the surface is tremendous, because    
the minerals are scattered on the ocean floor at depths of as much as    
20,000 feet. Nevertheless, American mining concerns have the capital    
and the technology to take on this challenge, if they can be assured of    
realizing a profit in the venture.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty, currently being pushed by the Clinton    
administration, would give Third World nations control over the    
development and use of the deep seabed mineral resources now being    
mined by American firms. The Treaty's international controls and    
regulations would hamper the efforts of U.S. ocean-mining companies to    
continue harvesting strategic ocean minerals essential to our industry    
and to our military defense.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would surrender major political and strategic    
advantages to Russia, which is self-sufficient in the minerals that    
America extracts from the ocean floor. The Treaty would deny U.S.    
ownership of ocean minerals, while forcing American companies to use    
their technology and capital to mine these minerals for the benefit of    
unfriendly, anti-American countries.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would establish an International Seabed    
Authority, which would set both general production controls and specific    
production limits for ocean mining sites. Any American corporation    
intent on making the tremendous investment involved in mining the    
ocean floor would first have to seek approval from the Executive Council    
of the International Seabed Authority. If its request is approved, the    
American corporation would begin operations with the understanding    
that one-half of the approved mining tract will be set aside so that an    
international mining operation (set up by the Seabed Authority) can use    
the American company's geological data, technology, and money to    
compete against it!
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty threatens the sovereignty and    
security of our nation. It also jeopardizes the legitimate financial    
interests of U.S. businesses and the health of our country's economy. Any    
American politician who supports this treaty has some explaining to do.

<h2>Moscow Bound</h2>


<i><blockquote>


 
With over 1000 pages, including notes and index, Moscow Bound, by  
Vietnam veteran John M.G. Brown, is the most thoroughly documented  
and comprehensive book ever written about American soldiers who  
disappeared in Soviet captivity from 1918 onward. It's not available in  
bookstores, however, we offer the following excerpt. 
 </blockquote></i>
<P>
"American and Allied war prisoners of 1918-1920 were treated [by the  
Soviets] as potential political assets to be exploited for use in a  
worldwide propaganda war. For the first time, the United States was  
confronted with an ideological enemy that held certain American  
prisoners of war secretly, to gain the use of their minds in understanding  
the enemies of Bolshevism, and which also held other U.S. prisoners of  
war and civilians openly, for use as hostages to gain diplomatic  
concessions and ransom. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The official American response to this situation in 1919 was to 'classify'  
all information about the existence of such prisoners of war, or missing  
men suspected of being held prisoner, as a state secret. The public was  
not allowed to know this fact, which resulted in many misconceptions  
about Soviet methods and intentions. Admission of their existence would  
have revealed the impossibility of recovering the prisoners without  
resorting to another major war, less than a year after the 1918  
Armistice.... 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"At the end of World War II, as the Red Army overran eastern Europe,  
hundreds of thousands of western Allied and American prisoners of war  
and interned civilians were liberated by the Soviets, but many thousands  
disappeared while under Russian control. Faced once again with  
impossible Soviet demands for diplomatic concessions, financial aid and  
other conditions for the release of prisoners they publicly denied holding,  
President Harry Truman chose once again to avoid a military  
confrontation so soon after the Second World War. The entire body of  
information concerning U.S. POWs and MIAs, who had been in eastern  
European German POW camps when the Soviets took control, was again  
'classified' in the name of national security, and remained secret for more  
than four decades to come. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The emboldened Soviets, under dictator Josef Stalin and his successors,  
thenceforth kidnapped American military and civilian personnel,  
including aircrews from U.S. Cold War reconnaissance missions, almost  
with impunity, secure in the knowledge that an unspoken 'wink and nod  
diplomacy' existed between the superpowers: that prisoners thus captured  
would remain secret, and unless publicly acknowledged, were 'gone  
forever.' The results of the Korean War further indicated the United  
States was willing to abandon U.S. prisoners of war known to have been  
alive in Soviet, Chinese and North Korean control, rather than submit to  
blackmail demands that would establish a precedent that the United  
States was willing to 'trade in human lives.' President Dwight D.  
Eisenhower, the former U.S. commander in Europe during World War  
II, this time made the decision that the families of POWs and MIAs held  
in China and Russia should not be informed about the fate of their loved  
ones, since it was then believed that the KGB would never release  
them...." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>Media Violence</h2>


<i><blockquote>


A new report from Focus on the Family charges that the content of our  
popular media is becoming increasingly violent.
 </blockquote></i>

<P>

"Three decades ago, not one popular song encouraged robbery, rape,  
murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle disputes," says Focus on the  
Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "In today's popular music,  
all these themes can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo.  
Unfortunately, America's streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect  
this fact. What's more, since violent lyrics are a relatively new  
phenomenon, no one knows the results of raising a generation on this  
type of musical diet. In addition, teenagers have greater access to (and  
are listening to) far more music than they have in past generations." By  
the end of high school, the average teenager has listened to more than  
10,000 hours of rock music. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Waliszewski argues that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence,  
and sexualized violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its  
early pioneers." But ugliness and depravity are pervasive on television  
today, and "TV talk shows are just the tip of the iceberg." Waliszewski  
warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to those being  
taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message to believe."  
Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem to suggest  
that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the lion's share  
of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most impressionable  
years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average American child  
graduates high school, he or she will have spent nearly 20,000 hours in  
front of a television" -- twice the amount of time spent in school. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood.  
Waliszewski notes that films like "Natural Born Killers" and "Menace II  
Society" have encouraged impressionable viewers to imitate the  
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there.  
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a  
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws  
and lawkeepers." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Jerry Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family cites research identifying "a  
short-term relationship between playing violent video games and  
increased aggressive behavior in younger children." The data suggest  
that "the ill effects of video games are worse than those of TV because  
children actively control the violence rather than passively view it. In  
other words, the more children practice violent acts, the more likely they

The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only  
noneducational diversion available to them. Pornographers and  
pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse possibilities of electronic  
mail. Waliszewski and Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family warn that  
"parents must not look to the government to protect their children. They  
must take an active role in monitoring" the content of the various  
popular media available in their own homes.

<h2>Corporate Giving</h2>


<i><blockquote>



You'd think that Big Business interests would support our free   
enterprise system and our constitutional form of government, but they   
don't. In fact, the bulk of their annual corporate giving goes to nonprofit   
groups that promote increased regulation and higher taxes.  

   </blockquote></i>

<P>

An expert on corporate philanthropy claims that "corporate America is   
funding its enemies." Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center reports   
that "many corporations give away their investors' dollars to special   
interest advocacy groups that favor irresponsible government policies   
harmful to a corporation's own best interests." In a recent issue of   
Human Events, Fulk charges that "big business is undermining   
American values by freely contributing to tax-exempt groups that work   
against a free and competitive market." He points out that "tax-exempt   
groups receiving the biggest share of corporate charitable dollars   
repeatedly offer status quo proposals to solve America's most pressing   
problems: racial quotas, increased welfare and entitlement programs,   
higher taxes and more government spending, command-and-control   
environmental laws, and regulations on employers."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


More than 300 nonprofit advocacy groups received contributions from   
America's top 250 corporations in 1993, but only 35 of those groups   
received more than $250,000 apiece. Austin Fulk reports that nearly two-  
thirds of these 35 groups "favor the liberal, tried-and-failed policies of   
bureaucratic government. Groups such as the Nature Conservancy, the   
NAACP, the Center for Community Change, and Planned Parenthood   
get big corporate grants."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Liberal groups with a Big-Government bias aren't the only beneficiaries   
of corporate largesse, however. "Corporations not only fund groups   
working against the general interests of business, but some also support   
radical activist groups that are principled opponents of America's   
enterprise tradition," says Fulk. "Corporate funding, even in small   
amounts, affects the fortunes of radical activists far out of proportion to   
the actual dollar amount. A corporate gift lends respectability to radical   
groups. It gives them a credential so that they can ask other corporations,   
individuals, and grantmaking foundations for funding."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Donations to nonprofit groups that promote big government also   
undermine the work of legitimate charities. "Private charities have a   
record of effectively delivering services," says Fulk. "But too often their   
work is overshadowed by failed government programs that perpetuate the   
social problems they were supposed to address. The mission of charity is   
hurt when government programs replace private programs, and when   
taxpayer funding replaces private contributions and individual   
voluntarism."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center urges American investors to   
hold corporate management responsible for foolish and self-defeating   
philanthropy. If managers can't make charitable contributions wisely,   
they should make none at all. "Corporate managements do shareholders   
and the nation a grave disservice when they fund leftist advocacy   
groups," says Fulk. "If the welfare state is to be replaced by an   
opportunity society, support for nonprofit institutions must become more   
discerning. Individuals as well as corporations must champion charities   
and advocacy groups that encourage self-reliance. And they must refuse   
support to nonprofit groups that draw strength from government."

<h2>Holding Criminals Responsible</h2>
<blockquote><i>

Noted criminologists say it's time to quit finding excuses for the   
behavior of criminals and start holding them responsible for their   
actions.  </i></blockquote><P>
  
The criminal shares certain personality traits in common with the   
psychopath, says Robert James Bidinotto, editor of a book called   
"Criminal Justice: The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility."   
Those common characteristics include: "a short-range, self-indulgent   
outlook on life; a lack of any sense of self-responsibility; the desire to   
manipulate and dominate others through chronic deception and force;   
and the ability to shut off his conscience at will." Treating a person who   
exhibits those traits as though he were a responsible citizen is a grave   
error, and yet, that's exactly what our criminal justice system does.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular 
Bidinotto asserts that the criminal justice system has been captured by   
"intellectuals in the social science establishment," who have convinced   
themselves -- without any evidence whatsoever -- that the criminal is not   
responsible for his own actions, but that society is somehow to blame.   
This "Excuse-Making Industry," as Bidinotto calls it, has recklessly   
abandoned the punishment of criminals in favor of a fervently hoped-for,   
but ever-illusive rehabilitation. Needless to say, this change in policy has   
found favor with the self-indulgent, irresponsible, manipulative, and   
remorseless personalities who make up the criminal element.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-  
prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers, lobbyists, journalists, and judges has   
perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in the   
United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio, two   
of the authors featured in the book "Criminal Justice." Logan and DiIulio   
argue that "the consequences of these false ideas have been quite tragic   
indeed," making it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and   
concentrating crime "in economically distressed inner-city   
neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators of these areas to   
repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"When a person commits a particularly sordid crime, his sanity may be   
questioned," but even the most violent criminal "is rational, calculating,   
and deliberate in his actions," observes clinical psychologist Stanton   
Samenow, in another chapter of the book "Criminal Justice." "Criminals   
know right from wrong," Samenow insists. "In fact, some know the laws   
better than their lawyers. But they believe that whatever they want to do   
at any given time is right for them. Their crimes require logic and self-  
control."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Criminals are not "mentally ill," nor should they be excused as "victims   
of poverty, broken homes, racism, and a society that denies them   
opportunities," says Samenow. "Sociological explanations for crime,   
plausible as they may seem, are simplistic. If they were correct, we'd   
have far more criminals than we do. Criminals come from all kinds of   
families and neighborhoods. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most   
kids from broken homes are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars   
of neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals."

 May 22, 1996<br></i> 
 <h2>
 SLAVE-LABOR GOODS 
 </h2><blockquote></i><P><I>
Legislators in California and Massachusetts are considering bills to  
prohibit their state governments from buying slave-labor goods. 
 </i></blockquote><P>
Legislation proposed in California requires that all state contracts "shall  
contain a statement in which the contractor attests that no foreign-made  
equipment, materials, or supplies furnished to the state pursuant to the  
contract have been produced in whole or in part by forced labor, convict  
labor, or indentured labor under penal sanction." Legislation proposed in  
Massachusetts would likewise require state contractors to "swear under  
penalty of perjury" that their goods have not been produced by forced  
labor. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch, a nonpartisan foreign policy  
watchdog group, suggests that these proposed bills have been "prompted  
by the Federal government's indifference about slave labor overseas and  
its threat to American workers and firms." While acknowledging that  
"the importation of slave-made goods is banned by federal statute,"  
Olsen argues that "the ban has been easily circumvented by cumbersome  
Customs Service regulations and uncooperative foreign governments.  
The Chinese government," he points out, "has not allowed any  
inspection of its laogai facilities in over a year even though the Customs  
Service has demanded to see numerous ones." Olsen reports that "the  
largest forced labor systems in the world are in China and the former  
Soviet Union. The Chinese laogai factories and farms hold 20 million  
workers, equal in number to the entire workforce of California. Many  
gulags in the former Soviet Union are still in operation." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress has shown much  
concern with "slave labor overseas and its unfair economic threat to  
American workers and firms," says Olsen. At a February 29th World  
Affairs Council luncheon in Los Angeles, then-U.S. Trade  
Representative Mickey Kantor "stated that forced labor was not an issue  
in his bilateral negotiations with China. " Olsen notes that Most Favored  
Nation tariff status "was granted to China in 1994 with no human rights  
reservations as in years before," and he predicts that such reservations  
will again fall by the wayside when China's Most Favored Nation status  
comes up for renewal in June. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch says that the State Department's  
1992 Memorandum of Understanding with China regarding the  
inspection of suspected slave-labor facilities "has been ignored by the  
Chinese government without any consequence. The State Department,"  
he adds, "has no regulation to avoid purchasing slave-made goods for its  
own use or for foreign aid programs. It does not intend to insist on anti- 
slave labor policies for multinational organizations such as the United  
Nations and the Organization of American States." Olsen also points out  
that "no agency in the federal government has any contract provision,  
regulation, or monitoring program to prevent the purchase of slave-made  
goods or services. For the billions of dollars of purchases overseas for use  
overseas by the Federal government, there is absolutely no prohibition  
under current law against purchasing and using slave-made goods since  
the goods are not imported into the U.S."

<h2>RITALIN</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>
  
  
The Chuck E Cheese pizza chain bills itself as the place "where a kid   
can be a kid. " Elementary school used to be such a place, but not   
anymore. Nowadays, when a kid acts like a kid, the public schools   
diagnose him as having an attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Remember, when you were a kid, how you never ran out of energy? How   
you could never sit still for more than a few minutes at a time? How your   
mind would race from one subject to the next? How you loved to   
daydream? You had no idea you were suffering from a disease, did you?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
As many as two million children have been diagnosed as having   
Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   
The preferred form of treatment for these alleged disorders is a powerful   
drug called Ritalin -- a Schedule II controlled substance, as are cocaine   
and methadone. The U.S. Department of Education formally recognized   
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a handicap in 1991 and made   
federal funds available for local school districts to provide special   
educational and psychological services for children afflicted with the   
normal characteristics of childhood. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
Needless to say, many school systems liked having extra cash to play   
with, and were perfectly willing to add special physical and mental   
health programs to their ever-growing menu of services if that was what   
would keep the funds flowing from Washington. Goals 2000 has   
provided a convenient umbrella for new programs in which school health   
officials test children for emotional, social, mental, and physical   
disorders -- and, when they deem it necessary, prescribe and administer   
medications such as Ritalin, Valium, and Prozac. New rules allow nurse   
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs. Goals 2000   
proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, Medicaid,   
Maternal and Child Health block grants, state programs, and private   
foundations. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160; 
  
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education gave the Chesapeake   
Institute of Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two videos called   
Facing the Challenges of Attention Deficit Disorder and One Child in   
Every Classroom. The completed videos included enthusiastic   
endorsements of Ritalin from parents whose children take the drug. A   
PBS documentary subsequently revealed, however, that these same   
parents were board members of a group called Children and Adults with   
Attention Deficit Disorder, which has received cash grants of $900,000   
plus in-kind services from the manufacturer of Ritalin. John Merrow,   
executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that Ritalin is now   
so plentiful that a black market has developed on the school playground.   
At many junior high schools, Ritalin is the first drug a child experiments   
with. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
It's bad enough that the public schools have intentionally dumbed down   
their curricula in order to turn our children into intellectual zombies.   
Now they're pinpointing the kids with energy and spunk and drugging   
them into a state of lethargy. Parents of a child who has been diagnosed   
by school personnel as having Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention   
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should seek a second opinion.

<title>Duplantier "CAREERS" Bill -- 5/24/96	 </title>

<h2>"CAREERS" BILL</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>  
  
Americans are lucky to live in a society in which education is available   
to all and the individual is free to choose what he will make of himself.   
In totalitarian countries, the State determines who will get the benefit of   
education and what job opportunities a person will have.</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
There is no clamor in the heartland for radical restrictions on the   
freedom Americans enjoy to improve their minds and plot the course of   
their careers. There is no grassroots support for turning our public   
schools into vocational training centers for a docile national workforce.   
How, then, to explain the progress of the CAREERS bill and the   
Workforce Development Act?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Under these bipartisan education bills now moving through Congress,   
the Federal Government would collect taxes, issue educational   
regulations, and then pass the proceeds and the power to State   
Governors, circumventing their legislatures altogether. This massive   
legislation would restructure public schools throughout America,   
building on the Goals 2000 and School-to-Work Acts passed in 1994.   
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last   
September by a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S. 143 (called the   
Workforce Development Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
More than 60 Republican members of the Missouri House of   
Representatives recently fired off a letter to House Speaker Newt   
Gingrich, objecting to the fact that H.R. 1617 "centralizes unprecedented   
powers at the federal level" and "supersedes state laws and further takes   
us, the local elected officials of the people of this state, out of the process   
of education." Noting that the CAREERS act "amends out the state   
legislature, replacing it with the Governor," the State Representatives   
assert that "this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and   
flies in the face of the principle of local control of education." 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
The Missouri Republicans also charge that unelected bureaucrats are   
attempting to grab power over school curricula though a grant   
application process. The grant applications that Governors now submit   
in a bid for federal funds bind the states to conform to "standards" and   
"assessments" written by federal or state bureaucrats insulated from the   
influence of local citizens and their elected representatives. The grant   
applications also bind the states to spend money not yet appropriated by   
their legislatures.
<BR>

Fourteen California State Senators also dispatched a letter calling on   
Congress to "kill" H.R. 1617. They too objected to the transfer of   
legislative prerogative into the hands of the Governor, and opposed the   
establishment of a "National Electronic Data Base" to monitor the   
progress of students along predetermined career paths.

Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois voted for the CAREERS bill last year, but   
has since reversed himself. He is now urging the repeal of Goals 2000   
and the School to Work Act, as well as the defeat of H.R. 1617 and   
S.143. Such legislation, he contends, would turn schoolchildren into   
"guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the global labor   
market." Is that really what we want for our children?

<h2>The Working Rich</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There are many kinds of bigotry in the world, but most of them, in 
America at least, are recognized as morally repugnant. There is one kind 
of bigotry, however, that seems to be socially acceptable -- the irrational 
prejudice against people who are wealthy.
</blockquote></i>

The vast majority of rich people in America acquired their wealth the 
old-fashioned way: they earned it. Industriousness, determination, 
shrewdness, and daring -- these are the qualities they cultivated to 
achieve self-sufficiency and, ultimately, abundance. The relatively few 
Americans fortunate enough to inherit great wealth have had to display 
these same qualities in order to maintain their positions. Nevertheless, it 
is quite common -- among people who are lazy, aimless, dull, and timid -
- to bemoan their unfortunate lot in life and rail against the undeserved 
luck of those who happen to be rich.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economist and syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell has had enough of 
this nonsense. "Far from being the idle rich, those in the top fifth of 
income-earners work more than most people and far more than those in 
the bottom fifth," says Sowell. "They work more time and they have 
more people in the same family working. When people are putting in 
long hours of work often after having put in long years of schooling, 
followed by long years of building up the skills and experience that put 
them where they are today, we are not talking about lottery winners or 
people who got lucky some other way. We are talking about 
achievement. And we are talking about the kind of work that other 
Americans benefit from."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sowell cites Bill Gates as one man whose wealth is richly deserved. With 
his innovative computer software products, the Microsoft 
multimillionaire has provided enormous benefits, directly or indirectly, 
to every single American. "The economy is not a zero-sum game, where 
every gain is somebody else's loss," says Sowell. "We are all better off 
because of those [supposedly] 'fortunate' people who work long hours at 
difficult tasks that not everyone is capable of doing."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The generation of wealth generally requires long, hard work. For this 
reason, improved economic standing is usually associated with 
advancing age. The rich and the poor "are often the same people at 
different stages of their careers," says Thomas Sowell. "People in their 
60s have earned far more than people in their 20s, even though everyone 
in his 60s was once 20. This is not an injustice by 'society.' It is a 
reflection of the mundane fact that there is a huge difference in 
competence and efficiency before and after spending years doing what 
you do." Precious few people start out rich, and the vast majority of 
Americans who begin their careers in the bottom fifth in income "are out 
of there before a decade has passed. For one thing," says Sowell, "they 
have 10 years more experience at the end of a decade."

<h2> Welfare Reform/PA & OR </h2>


<i><blockquote>


Welfare as we know it is not long for this world. State governments all 
across America are redesigning so-called entitlement programs to make 
sure that they promote self-sufficiency rather than dependence.
</blockquote></i>
 
"Over the past five years a new consensus has emerged in the welfare 
debate," reports Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "In sharp contrast to the traditional view of 
welfare as an entitlement," says Barwick, "many experts now agree that 
welfare must require work, and that the single most important step that 
can be taken to reform welfare is to impose up-front work requirements 
on all able-bodied recipients. Support for this view comes not from a 
mean-spirited desire to punish welfare recipients, but from a concern to 
help welfare recipients achieve long-term self-sufficiency."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Barwick argues that the welfare reform plan proposed in Pennsylvania 
"falls short in its effort to replace welfare with work. To his credit, the 
Governor insists that welfare recipients work a minimum of twenty hours 
a week in order to receive benefits. Unfortunately, the significance of this 
requirement is vitiated by the fact that it can be satisfied with all sorts of 
substitute activities." Barwick contends that "the Governor's plan gives 
far too much wiggle room to those who would coddle recipients with 
notoriously ineffective and expensive 'education' and 'training' programs, 
or confine them to public-sector make-work programs which fail to give 
participants marketable skills and experience."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One program that does effectively link welfare to work is Oregon's Full 
Employment model, known as JOBS Plus. This program, Barwick 
explains, "takes the money already allocated for the three largest welfare 
programs -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and 
Unemployment Insurance -- and uses this money instead to subsidize 
jobs for welfare recipients in the private sector." Having proven quite 
successful during its two years as a pilot program, JOBS Plus is now 
being implemented statewide. Barwick notes that Oregon's Full 
Employment model "has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a 
dozen other states to date."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How does the program work? "Participation in JOBS Plus is required of 
virtually all those who qualify for AFDC, Food Stamps, or 
Unemployment Insurance," observes Peter Barwick. "Participants are 
initially given assistance in finding regular full-time jobs. Those unable 
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with private-
sector employers. These employers -- who volunteer for the program and 
have final say in all hiring decisions -- are reimbursed by the state for the 
minimum wage plus the employer's share of Social Security, 
Unemployment Insurance, and Workers' Compensation premiums. 
Subsidized jobs under JOBS Plus are temporary, lasting four months, 
with an optional two-month extension. Employers are free to hire 
satisfactory participants at any time during the process."
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

                                                                           
Poor people crave self-respect just like anyone else. Why not give them a 
chance to achieve it, with welfare reform programs that offer a hand-up 
rather than a handout?

<h2> Welfare Reform/MI & MA</h2>


<i><blockquote>


Why does private charity work so much better than public assistance? 
It's because the private benefactor expects to see results from his 
almsgiving. .</blockquote></i>

Private poverty-relief programs emphasize "character-building, one-on-
one mentoring, and a spiritual dimension," says Lawrence Reed of the 
Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Michigan. Government 
relief programs, on the other hand, generally promote the personal 
imperfections that perpetuate poverty. In the April issue of "Alternatives 
in Philanthropy," published by the Capital Research Center, Reed reports 
that his home state has drastically revamped its welfare program. 
"Michigan abruptly ended the General Assistance program for able-
bodied, childless adults in October 1991 and adopted a 'social contract,' 
whereby welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or 
perform community service in exchange for benefits," says Reed. "Nearly 
25 percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working. This is 
three times the national average."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reed thinks the Governor of Michigan is committed to "further reducing 
the role of government and making welfare a largely private initiative." 
He notes that "a growing number of private initiatives to help the poor 
are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct response to the 
state's abolition of General Assistance." Welfare as it currently operates 
"has produced such disastrous consequences that it's hard to imagine 
how a radical overhaul could make things worse," says Larry Reed. "If 
we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help, we might end 
up spending less for success than the government now spends for 
failure."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," David Tuerck of the 
Beacon Hill Institute in Boston reports that Massachusetts began its own 
welfare overhaul in 1995. "Able-bodied welfare recipients whose 
youngest children have entered school must work at least 20 hours per 
week in a job or community service program," notes Tuerck. "Parents 
under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or in a supervised group 
home. They must stay in school or in a GED program." They receive no 
additional benefits for children born after August 1996.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though supportive of these reforms, Tuerck insists that the main 
problem with welfare is the way it is funded. "Under the existing system, 
taxpayers send their money to Washington, where most flows into a 
welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction eventually reaches the pockets of 
the poor." Tuerck would retain taxpayer funding of welfare, but make it 
taxpayer-controlled as well. He proposes that "individual taxpayers, both 
itemizers and non-itemizers, receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for 
contributions to eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax 
liability." David Tuerck argues that such a tax credit would not only 
increase private charitable giving beyond the level of the current public 
dole, but would also guarantee that a far greater percentage of those alms 
actually reach the intended recipients.

<h2> Welfare Reform/IN, WI, CO </h2>


<i><blockquote>





What is the real purpose of welfare? Is it meant to help the unfortunate 
get back on their feet, or was it designed from the beginning to create a 
permanent underclass? </blockquote></i>
<P>


"The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families become 
self-sufficient," says Andrew Bush of the Hudson Institute in 
Indianapolis. "Government can best achieve this goal by recognizing its 
own limitations and by drawing on the strengths of charities, 
community-based organizations, and other private service providers." In 
the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Bush reports on the Indiana Independence 
Initiative, a graduated work-based plan that "would dramatically change 
the orientation of welfare." This Initiative would help "able-bodied 
parents find immediate work," says Bush. It also "would open public aid 
to a wide range of non-government service providers that would help 
families pursue self-sufficiency."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Michael Hartmann 
of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute in Milwaukee reports that the 
Badger State "has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare 
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients into 
productive work." Wisconsin's welfare caseload fell nearly 25 percent 
during a period in which state caseloads across the country "increased by 
an average of 35 percent." In 1988, Wisconsin implemented the Job 
Opportunities and Basic Skills program, which, as Hartmann explains, 
"required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate welfare recipients 
in their search for employment." In 1993, the state implemented a 
program called Work, Not Welfare, which "limits AFDC payments to 
two years and offers major job-training services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The state legislature recently approved a new program called Wisconsin 
Works, which provides "four graduated work options" for welfare 
recipients. "Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining work will 
engage in work activities, vocational rehabilitation, and counseling," 
says Hartmann of the first, transitional phase of the program. "Recipients 
will learn work habits and job skills necessary for employment in the 
private sector" by doing community-service jobs in the second phase. A 
period of subsidized employment follows, after which participants "will 
be guided to the best available immediate job in the private sector."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also in the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Tom Tancredo 
and Dwight Filley of the Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado 
point out that social pathologies such as juvenile delinquency, drug 
abuse, teen pregnancy, and welfare dependency have all been linked to 
"the absence of a married father in the household." Given this 
documented correlation, they ask, "why does government policy seem 
geared toward driving fathers away?" Despite the "oppressive burden of 
federal laws," Colorado still has "considerable latitude to end the 
perverse incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills," 
say Tancredo and Filley. "AFDC, for example, is a matching fund 
program. If the Colorado legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC 
would end in the state."

<h2> Welfare Reform/WA</h2>


<i><blockquote>
 

Demagogues may dismiss welfare reform as "discrimination against 
families, " but the truth is quite the opposite. </blockquote></i>
<P>
It isn't welfare reform that discriminates against families, but welfare 
itself, says John Carlson of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies in 
Seattle. "A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she doesn't 
marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a job, and doesn't save 
any money. You can't get much more anti-family than that," says 
Carlson. "Young men who father children out of wedlock don't have to 
take responsibility for their actions. The welfare system does it for them. 
And the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child. Again, 
you can't get much more anti-family than that."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Carlson argues that "we should apply the same 
kind of common sense to welfare reform that we would use if someone in 
our own family experienced trouble." A welfare reform bill now under 
consideration by the Washington State House of Representatives "would 
limit welfare benefits and include an additional period of reduced 
benefits for welfare recipients who are working. Recipients who don't 
look for work would have their benefits reduced. They could save money 
without being penalized, but cash benefits would not be increased for 
recipients who have more children."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Lynn Harsh and Bob 
Williams of the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington 
agree that the welfare reform proposed in the State House "moves in the 
right direction." It provides for "a maximum of 36 months on 
assistance," requiring recipients to "sign contracts outlining their 
responsibilities" and to "participate in a job-training and job-search 
program." The legislation would require unwed mothers to identify "the 
fathers of their children," while denying cash payments to unmarried 
mothers who are minors. Harsh and Williams recommend that the 
reforms also include stringent enforcement of child support laws, the 
easing of restrictions on adoption, "greater tax incentives for charitable 
contributions," and the changing of program incentives "so that state 
welfare agencies redefine success as the number of people removed from 
welfare rolls and placed in long-term employment." The two policy 
analysts note that "the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to be 
having an effect. Fewer people are applying for welfare in Washington 
State than last year despite no significant changes in the law or the 
economy."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why not support what works? "Hundreds of charities, nonprofit 
organizations, and private-sector job-training and placement programs 
already serve the needy," observe Harsh and Williams. "Many of them 
have a proven record of operating efficiently and with a high degree of 
accountability. In the long run we advocate abolishing government-run 
welfare entirely. Far from being a cruel or reckless approach, this change 
would help renew our families, neighborhoods, churches, and 
communities -- the institutions best able to serve the needy."

<h2>"McCarthyism" </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
When liberals accuse conservatives of "McCarthyism, " they're 
engaging in the very practice they claim to abhor. They're employing the 
infamous smear tactics of innuendo and guilt by association.
</I></Blockquote><P>


"McCarthyism" is a noxious term, so much so that any public figure 
accused of it becomes an instantaneous pariah. "McCarthyism" is also an 
ironic term, for two reasons. First, Senator Joseph McCarthy never 
engaged in any of the tactics associated with the term "McCarthyism." 
He did not make wild, unsubstantiated charges against hundreds of 
innocent people. He smeared no one. Second, the few dozen government 
employees that McCarthy did accuse of being Communists were just 
what he said they were. There was sufficient evidence at the time to 
warrant investigation of the figures he named. In the last four decades, 
the guilt of these person has been firmly established, and materials 
recently released from Soviet archives only add to the crushing weight of 
existing evidence.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If anything, McCarthy did not go far enough, concludes former FBI 
Assistant Director Ray Wannall. "The National Security Agency's 
release of the 'Venona' documents, intercepted communications of Soviet 
KGB officers in the United States to their bosses in Moscow, suggests 
that McCarthy's charges of government infiltration understated the 
reality," says Wannall. The Venona papers "underscore the fact that our 
government was massively riddled with Americans in high-ranking 
positions who were tilting policy to serve Soviet ends and engaging in 
espionage, including sharing our atomic secrets with Stalinist Russia."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wannall argues that McCarthy had good reason to be "especially 
concerned about the State Department. Not only had the department 
been infiltrated by such high-ranking officials as Alger Hiss," but 
thousands of government personnel "had been merged into the 
department from other agencies following World War II," without first 
being screened for Communist affiliations and other security risks.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1948, two years before McCarthy leveled the charges that provoked a 
storm of simulated outrage, the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities reported that "there have been numerous Communist 
espionage rings at work in our executive agencies which have worked 
with and through the American Communist Party and its agents to relay 
to Russia vital information essential to our national defense and security. 
Russian Communists have worked hand in hand with American 
Communists in these espionage activities."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the wake of what we knew about communism and how thoroughly 
our government had been penetrated by Soviet agents before Joe 
McCarthy exploded onto the political scene," Wannall observes, "it is 
difficult to understand how so many Americans rallied to the anti-
McCarthy cause, or how the term 'McCarthyism' has taken on such a 
derisive tone." Wannall contends that many of McCarthy's critics were 
"apprehensive about what he might reveal concerning them and their 
friends, and they reacted with fury," using the very tactics that we have 
all been conditioned to associate with Joe McCarthy. History will one 
day record, however, that the only person smeared during the McCarthy 
era was McCarthy himself.

<h2> Truth About Communism </h2>


<i><blockquote>



John T. Flynn did not have access to the Venona documents, but he did 
have plenty of other evidence, when he tried to convince his skeptical 
countrymen of the truly insidious nature of the Communist conspiracy.
</blockquote></i><P>

John T. Flynn knew that "one of the greatest difficulties in explaining 
this menace is the inability of the normal, decent American to fully 
understand the peculiar nature of Communist methods." Nevertheless, in 
a nationally syndicated radio broadcast in 1954, Flynn charged that 
"among us is a sizable number of people [who] hate our American way. 
They want to end our free system and introduce a system more nearly 
resembling that of Russia. The State . . . will be supreme. It will own all 
the large industries . . . and, eventually, everything. This is socialism."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn pointed out that Communists "seldom get elected to office. They 
cannot get power to act, at least not so long as they admit they are 
Communists. So their policy is to deny they are Communists or socialists 
and to insert themselves into influential positions in the Democratic or 
Republican parties and to get into bureaus where decisions on policy are 
made." Once they've weaseled their way in, "they use their weight to 
influence those policies of the government which will serve their ends 
and the ends of Soviet Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn charged that "secret cells began to operate in the important 
agencies of our government" in 1933. By the time of his broadcast, 
eleven years later, "thousands of these Reds had made their way into 
almost all of the most important spots in our government." Ensconced in 
positions of influence, "they took their orders directly from agents of the 
Russian espionage system stationed in New York and Washington."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The alarming extent of this penetration of our government was "brought 
out in a series of investigations in which the members of the House and 
the Senate who made the investigations were pilloried and denounced by 
the same newspapers and political leaders who [later denounced] Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. It was the influence of these cells which enabled the 
Soviet government, when World War II ended, to take over all of Eastern 
Europe and most of the continent of Asia, to penetrate our colleges, our 
public school system, many of our leading magazines and newspapers 
and news services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn recalled Senator McCarthy's famous 1950 speech in which "he 
charged that Communists in the State Department were helping to shape 
our policy in Asia and he put the number of Communists in a position to 
do this at 57. But he did not name them publicly. For this and a 
subsequent speech he was greeted by a storm of abuse." Flynn argued 
that "it takes a brave man to stand up against the savage abuse and the 
underground assaults which these Red conspirators pour out upon any 
loyal American who attempts to oppose them." He expressed intense 
admiration for "the undaunted stand [McCarthy took] against the 
malignant defenders of Russia and their confederates and dupes in the 
United States."

<h2> The Real McCarthy</h2>


<i><blockquote>



What exactly did Senator Joseph McCarthy do to provoke such a storm 
of protest in the early 1950s? Just his job, that's all!
</blockquote></i>
<P>
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy was responsible for "watching this vast 
bureaucracy -- to spot graft, incompetence, extravagance, and disloyalty. 
As chairman of this committee [McCarthy was] merely carrying out his 
mandate in searching for cases of disloyalty inside the government." 
McCarthy did not wage his "war on communism any place but inside the 
government of the United States," asserted John T. Flynn in a nationally 
syndicated radio broadcast in 1954.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of the slightly more than 200 witnesses who were examined publicly by 
the committee, more than a third refused to answer, most of whom 
invoked the Fifth Amendment. Flynn reminded his listeners that "almost 
all of these were government workers at various level of importance -- 
and in bureaus or agencies peculiarly subject to secrecy. The evil 
McCarthy [was] shooting at [was] treason. The people he [was] stalking 
[were] traitors -- most of them dedicated to the interest of our deadliest 
enemy at home and in the world, Communist Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to exposing the communist conspirators at the Institute of 
Pacific Relations (who had betrayed China and most of Asia to the 
Russians), McCarthy also uncovered agents in the Government Printing 
Office. "A great number of highly secret documents are printed in the 
Government Printing Office," Flynn observed. "The Senator found there 
persons with impressive records of Communist activity. The FBI had 
reported these persons repeatedly but nothing was done about it." Flynn 
noted that, as a result of McCarthy's investigations, "the entire security 
panel in the department was removed and all the security regulations 
overhauled. The penalty [for stealing secret documents] was changed 
from a few days suspension to dismissal." McCarthy's Committee also 
"conducted investigations at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where highly 
secret radar equipment [was] developed. This resulted in the suspension 
of 33 security risks from this very sensitive U.S. Army spot."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The recently released Venona documents confirm what Flynn concluded 
in his 1954 broadcast: that "the most important objective of the 
Communist conspiracy has been to get Communists or Communist dupes 
inside our government departments. Their aim [was] to keep Russia 
advised of what the American government [was] doing and, even more 
important, to actually take part in shaping the decisions on policy of our 
government. The decisions to abandon Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Eastern Germany, and a part of Austria to Russia 
as World War II ended were all accomplished by Communists and pro-
Reds in our State Department."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Infiltration of our government was "the most important enterprise of the 
Communist conspiracy in America," said John T. Flynn. "It has cost 
millions of dollars, the lives of numerous men, and incredible labor and 
patience on the part of the Communist leaders." Flynn insisted that 
"McCarthy was not persecuting radicals or even Communists. His aim 
was only at Communists and spies inside the American government."

<title>Duplantier: CORELESS CURRICULA -- 6/06/96</title>

<h2> Coreless Curricula </h2>


<i><blockquote>


"In demolishing the notion of a relatively stable body of knowledge, a 
traditional set of disciplines to which developing thinkers must 
apprentice themselves, [American universities] have invited their 
students, though half-formed and ill educated, to indulge in a fantasy of 
their own extravagant powers." </blockquote></i>
<P>

In the Spring issue of the Manhattan Institute's "City Journal," 
contributing editor Kay Hymowitz examines the American university 
system and laments "the complete disappearance of a fixed, coherent 
curriculum and with it any shared notion of the well-educated man or 
woman. All that once ordered higher education -- requirements, majors, 
the traditional disciplines, the core curriculum -- is vanishing into the 
chaos of postmodernism. The structured, comprehensive, directed course 
of study has been replaced by a "do-your-own-thing curriculum."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do the universities explain this great shirking of their responsibility, 
and the intellectual aimlessness to which they've condemned a 
generation? It's all for the best, they say. They did it on purpose! "The 
college brochures yield plenty of examples of how the academy has tried 
to transform the shattering of the curriculum into a boon for students," 
reports Hymowitz. These glitzy sales packets promise the unformed, 
undisciplined student suffocating amounts of the very things he doesn't 
need: "flexibility, openness, independence, freedom." By encouraging 
their students to believe that "they can, in all their ripe perfection, step 
outside society and each create his own one-man culture," the 
universities renounce their very reason for being, which is to encourage 
breadth of learning and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of 
things. <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The sheer proliferation of courses . . . amplifies the illusion of 
undergraduate freedom," says Hymowitz, adding that "the hundreds of 
thousands of choices available to students stretch the distribution 
requirement to the borders of triviality." Even when a student is required 
to take a specified number of courses from each of certain broad 
categories -- such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences -- he can 
satisfy the requirement with courses so lame or esoteric that he fails to 
acquire even an overview of the discipline.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


"The myth of the college brochure begins with an illusory student: not 
just independent but self-motivated, passionate, self-aware, well-
informed. Consider instead the reality of the college student just 
graduated from an American public school," Hymowitz urges. "Surveys 
suggest he knows little about, among many other things, American 
history. Does he ponder his ignorance in this area and sign up for an 
American history course? Of course not. The libertarian curriculum 
neglects the obvious: the student doesn't know what he doesn't know. 
Further, he doesn't know what he needs to know to be a well-informed 
member of society. That's why someone invented required courses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The rapidly multiplying menu of course offerings perpetuates "the 
mystique of specialization, which renders archaic the entire notion of a 
shared world of knowledge," says Kay Hymowitz. "Such an approach, 
with its glorification of unencumbered autonomy and individual choice, 
provides no foundation for social solidarity and active citizenship."

<h2>Great Awakening</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There have been three dramatic religious revivals in American history, 
and some social commentators claim that we are, right now, in the midst 
of a fourth "Great Awakening." </blockquote></i>

<P>


Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition believes that America is "a nation 
in which one becomes American not by accident of birth or by ethnic 
heritage, but by subscribing to an idea." In the April issue of "Imprimis," 
the monthly journal of Hillsdale College, Reed argues that America is 
the embodiment of  "a vision -- a vision of a society based on two 
fundamental beliefs. The first is that all men, created equal in the eyes of 
God with certain unalienable rights, are free to pursue the longings of 
their hearts. The second belief is that the sole purpose of government is 
to protect those rights."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed asserts that our Founding Fathers "possessed a view of the world 
and government that necessarily presupposed a people obedient to an 
internalized code of conduct . . . that made a large central government 
superfluous." That internalized code of conduct is based on the Ten 
Commandments. America was at the outset, and still is, "a nation 
undergirded by faith, built by faith, and enlivened by faith."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, the connection between faith and government "is a 
source of vigorous controversy," says Reed. He notes that "a crucial 
debate rages in the land over the role of religion in our public life and 
the role that religious believers should play in our politics. The religious 
conservative vote . . . is now one of the largest, if not the largest, single 
voting bloc in the electorate." Reed predicts that the election in 
November "will not be decided by the union vote, the feminist vote, the 
minority vote, or the third-party vote. It will be decided by the religious 
vote." The upcoming election will be characterized by "the largest 
mobilization of active religious believers in recent memory. And, if 
history is any guide, this mobilization is the sign of another period of 
great transformation in America, for political change in the United 
States has always been rooted in religious upheaval."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed concedes that "mainline church membership has declined by one-
fourth" in recent decades. But this decline has been "more than made up 
for by the skyrocketing popularity of conservative and evangelical 
churches in which membership has doubled." What has resulted "is a 
complete transformation of America's churchgoing population. Today, 
the typical American churchgoer is orthodox in faith, traditionalist in 
outlook, and conservative on cultural and political issues. Yet, as active 
religious believers move beyond the pews and into public life, a strange 
and disturbing hostility greets them," says Reed. "People of faith have 
become victims of the worst forms of stereotyping, marginalization, and 
demonology." It's time, he argues, to ''reaffirm the role of religion in 
public life" and to "encourage those with strong spiritual beliefs to re-
enter politics after too many years of self-imposed retreat. Religious 
believers must become full citizens."

<h2>Kinsey Part I</h2>


<i><blockquote>
<p>
Sex education programs in schools across America are based in part on studies published by Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953 called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.  
</I></Blockquote>
<p> 
Representative Steve Stockman (R-1X) thinks the world-famous Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana should be investigated for possible fraud and criminal child abuse. Late last year, Stockman introduced the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995 ( H.R. 2749), calling for a General Accounting Office probe of the government funded  studies of human sexuality conducted by Alfred Kinsey   
nearly 50 years ago. If the GAO concludes that "criminal wrongdoing or scientific fraud" did occur in the preparation of the Kinsey Reports, then "any organization or school [that] uses these studies, without indicating the unethical and unscientific nature, will be denied federal funds for any educational purpose."  
<p>
Congressman Stockman tried to determine on his own the source for the data in Table 34, a chart in the original Kinsey Report that purported to measure the sexual responsiveness of infants, children, and teenagers. His efforts turned into a wild goose chase. "First, I was told by the Kinsey Institute  that the data were compiled from the notes of a single pedophile who is deceased," recalls Stockman. "But, according to Kinsey's book, the table was composed from the observations of 'several adult males who have had sexual contacts with younger boys."'  
<p>
Either way, Kinsey's research into the sexuality of children -- upon which professionals rely heavily for their understanding of normal childhood development -- apparently rests on the testimony of at least one sexual deviant. "This indicates that the basis of sex education in America is a study of the systematic molestation of children as young as four months old," says Stockman. The only other alternative is that Table 34 is a complete fabrication. "Other scholars who worked  with Kinsey in the early '50s have said that the numbers . . . were made up -- fraudulent research," he observes. Stockman  says the purpose of the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act is "to determine to what extent the United States Government funded these fraudulent and criminal studies and what liabilities should be assessed."  
<p>
In a letter to his colleagues in Congress, Stockman pointed out that the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (known as SIECUS) bases its own widely-used and often-imitated sex-ed programs on the studies of Alfred Kinsey. "These texts," he observed, "form the basis of sex education in the public schools of America." Stockman urged his fellow Congressmen to view a videotape called The Children of Table 34, produced by the Family Research Council. The 30-minute expose charges that data recorded in the Kinsey Reports are based on "systematic molestation of infants and children." The documentary concludes that the evidence of fraud and ethical violations in Kinsey's research  warrants an inquiry into the Kinsey Institute.

<h2>Kinsey, Pt. II </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
According to a videotape expose released by the Family   
Research Council in 1994, Alfred Kinsey's famous research   
on human sexuality was either fraudulent or based on   
"criminal experimentation on children funded by taxpayers. " 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 30-minute documentary entitled The Children of Table 34   
charges that Kinsey incorporated into his research data from   
the rape of children and infants, that he used these records of   
perversion and criminality as the basis for his influential   
observations on normal childhood development, and that he   
not only concealed the full extent of his experiments but   
shielded the adults involved in them from criminal   
prosecution. 
<p>
In a booklet that accompanies the videotape,   
Robert Knight of the Family Research Council observes that   
Kinsey's 1948 report, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,   
and his 1953 study, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,   
"ignited a controversy over sexual morality that persists to   
this day. Both painted a picture of Americans of all ages   
awash in secret sexual experimentation." The philosophy of   
Kinsey and his cohorts "placed all sexual acts on the same   
moral, social, and biological level." The Kinsey Reports, says   
Knight, "provided the [seemingly] 'scientific' foundation for   
America's sexual revolution."  
  <p>
That foundation remained unchallenged until 1981, when Dr.   
Judith Reisman offered a critique of Kinsey's research at the   
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem. "She began   
asking questions that have yet to be answered," says Knight.   
"How did the Kinsey team obtain the data on children? Did   
parents give consent? Was there any follow-up on the   
recorded experiments? Where are the children now?"  
  <p>
Nearly 10 years later, Dr. Reisman attempted to answer some   
of these questions with a book called Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.   
The book, says Knight, "reveals shocking evidence that   
children were sexually abused by adults in the name of   
science." But that was just the beginning of the tragedy.   
Kinsey's bogus and/or criminal research became the basis for   
a burgeoning sex-education industry. "The Kinsey data are   
the sole source of child sexuality data, since no other   
researchers have been willing to risk criminal prosecution for   
reporting on or conducting systematic molestation of   
children," Knight explains. Kinsey's conclusions "have   
permeated America's educational institutions and are the   
major behavioral model on which sex education programs are   
designed for children."  
 <p> 
Today, sex education programs in schools across America   
"systematically strip children of sexual modesty, ridicule the   
idea of sexual restraint . . . and reduce parents' roles to that of   
consultants, not authorities in their children's lives. The   
[rationalization] for this radical departure from traditional   
sexual morality begins with the Kinsey Reports," says   
Knight. "Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many   
ongoing federally-sponsored research programs," he adds,   
noting that a group with close ties to Kinsey, the Sex   
Information and Education Council of the United States   
(known as SIECUS), was chosen in 1994 "to evaluate sex   
education programs throughout the United States and to make   
recommendations to the federal government."

<h2>SIECUS</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Sex Information and Education Council of the United   
States (known as SIECUS) applauds the dramatic increase in   
the number of states that require or recommend sex education   
in public schools. 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 1994 SIECUS survey of state sex-ed programs reported   
that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rieo have   
gotten on the bandwagon since 1986, when only three states   
required such curricula. The focus of the SIECUS   
assessment, however, was on the alleged "shortcomings" of   
the state curricula, as determined by deviations from the   
group's own Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality   
Education, K-12, which SIECUS published in 1991. Those 
guidelines include six "key concepts," subdivided into 36   
topics. The key concepts are Human Development,   
Relationships, Personal Skills, Sexual Behavior, Sexual   
Health, and Society and Culture.  
 <p>
The 1994 SIECUS study, entitled Unfinished Business,   
consisted of three major components: the responses of state   
education officials to a 20-question survey; the analysis by   
SIECUS of various state-developed sex-ed curricula; and   
SIECUS's own recommendations for changing curricula to   
conform with their biases about sex education. Resources   
cited for the study include the Alan Guttmacher Institute,   
Planned Parenthood, the Center for Population Options, the   
National Education Association, and People for the American   
Way. Funding for the study was provided by the Carnegie   
Corporation.  
<p>  
The SIECUS study complained that many state curricula   
guides "omit sexual behavior topics; exclude topics that are   
considered controversial, such as sexual identity and   
orientation and abortion; lack thorough coverage of topics   
throughout grades Kindergarten-Twelve, particularly in the   
elementary grades; and lack [what SIECUS calls] balanced   
coverage of abstinence and safer sex." SIECUS says such   
shortcomings represent "unfinished business."  
<p>  
The study laments the absence from most curricula of   
"detailed age-appropriate developmental messages." That is   
the SIECUS euphemism for statements that lay the   
foundation for easier acceptance of permissive sexual   
practices at a higher grade level. When it comes to coverage   
of sexual behavior, SIECUS complains that most curricula   
are guilty of a "fear-based" approach, which means that they   
emphasize abstinence and portray sex as something more   
profound than a recreational activity. To achieve what   
SIECUS calls "balance," the curricula would have to present   
"safer sex" as a more realistic option than abstinence.  
 <p> 
SIECUS rejects the "just say no" approach in sex education,   
asserting that it does "not provide corresponding refusal skills   
or assertiveness messages." For SIECUS, refusal skills are   
sexual negotiation techniques that students can acquire   
through role-playing and instruction in the art of explicit   
conversation. SIECUS ignores the fact that such techniques   
undermine the natural modesty of children (their most potent   
defense), and the likelihood that mastery of refusal skills   
would enable an aggressive negotiator to overcome them.  
 <p> 
Few sex-ed curricula begin early enough for SIECUS. The   
group deplores the benighted parents and right-wing pressure   
groups that have impeded "comprehensive" sex education.   
SIECUS urges a state-funded effort to combat these so-called   
obstructionists.

<h2>Student Rights</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The education establishment is kicking up a ruckus over a bill   
that received nearly unanimous support in the House of   
Representatives. They're determined to make sure that this   
sensible legislation doesn't get past the Senate.
</I></Blockquote><P>


The Family Privacy Protection Act would prohibit schools   
from questioning minors about political or religious   
affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological problems,   
sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or self-incriminating   
behavior, or their opinions of other family members --   
without first obtaining the permission of their parents. The   
need for such a law is clear when schools make a practice of   
bypassing the informed consent of parents to distribute   
condoms to adolescents and subject even younger children to   
coercive physical exams.  
 <p> 
The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires   
in the public school classroom started in the mid-l 970s and   
led to the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights   
Amendment in 1978, sponsored by former university   
president and Senator Sam Hayakawa. The public school   
establishment was powerful enough to prevent regulations   
from being written until President Ronald Reagan demanded   
them in 1984. National Education Association agents in the   
Department of Education and public school administrators   
nationwide still managed to thwart the enforcement of this   
law.  
  <p>
Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which   
has been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th,   
9th and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents protested the   
survey's invasion of privacy, as well as its underlying   
assumption that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal   
tendencies are normal teenage behavior. They also objected   
to way in which the survey encouraged pupils to inform on   
their parents.  
  <p>
Among other things, the survey inquired about the drinking   
habits of family members, to ascertain if their use of alcohol   
had "repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems."   
Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of   
teenagers are using illegal drugs. Some questions interrogated   
the child about his religion. Certain questions -- particularly   
those relating to severe depression and attempted suicide --   
were undoubtedly traumatic for some children. The survey   
also sought to determine the sexual experience and practices   
of the students. It shouldn't need to be said -- though it   
obviously does -- that public schools have no business   
requiring children to answer any of these nosy questions   
without prior written parental consent.  
  <p>
The purpose of the Family Privacy Protection Act is to   
extend the scope of the law to all surveys and questionnaires   
that are federally funded, not merely those funded by the   
Department of Education, and also to remove some vague   
language that has enabled the public schools to circumvent   
the law for the past ten years. The Senate will no doubt be   
besieged by self-styled researchers whose prurient interest in   
the sexuality of children is facilitated by unfettered access to   
our nation's schools. Let's hope our Senators recognize that   
these schools exist only to educate our children -- not to   
provide a steady supply of guinea pigs for behavioral   
scientists.

<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Clinton administration would have us believe that U.S.   
foreign aid promotes American interests around the globe,   
but this simply isn't so. Foreign aid is a luxury we can ill   
afford, especially when it has adverse consequences.
</I></Blockquote><P>
Believe it or not, most recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote   
against the United States in the United Nations most of the   
time. Roughly 64 percent did so in 1995, according to a   
recent report from the Heritage Foundation. Policy analyst   
Ryan Johnson offers several disturbing examples.  
  <p>
Nigeria voted against the U.S. 69 percent of the time in 1995,   
but we'll send Nigeria nearly $27 million this year despite its   
lack of support. The top ten countries voting against U.S.   
interests the most -- India, Laos, China, Lebanon, Seychelles,   
Pakistan, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, and Burkina Faso -  
- will receive a combined total of nearly $212 million in   
foreign aid this year. Why are we rewarding these ingrates?  
  <p>
Of-the ten nations receiving the most American aid -- Israel,   
Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, India, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Haiti,   
and South Africa -- only Israel, Russia, and Ukraine voted   
with us more often than not. Egypt, for instance, will receive   
over $2 billion in aid this year despite voting against us 67   
percent of the time last year. India will collect more than   
$150 million in U.S. aid, after having voted against us 83   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
Russia, surprisingly enough, voted against the U.S. only 33   
percent of the time. It's worth noting, also, that nine of the   
U.S.'s ten strongest supporters in the U.N. are former Soviet   
bloc countries! They are: Tajikistan, Latvia, Georgia,   
Uzbekistan, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and   
Macedonia. Israel, which will receive over $3 billion in aid   
this year, is our strongest supporter, voting with the U.S. 97   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
If the U.N. voting records of aid recipients accurately reflect   
their support for U.S. policies, "the U.S. is not getting its   
money's worth," says Johnson. "There may be many reasons   
why a country votes with or against the U.S. at the UN," he   
observes. "But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does   
not win friends where it counts: in supporting U.S.   
diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations. Clearly, the   
foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton   
administration in particular, has done little to justify public   
confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by   
America's foreign aid bureaucracy."  
  <p>
In short, foreign aid is not working. "Why, then, is the U.S.   
spending so much money on countries that obviously care   
little about America's interests abroad? And why is the   
Clinton administration fighting to save this program when   
most Americans are opposed to it?" asks- Bryan Johnson of   
the Heritage Foundation. "Last year, Congress tried to cut the   
U.S. foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful   
government spending and balance the federal budget deficit,"   
notes Johnson. "Because the Clinton administration fought   
these proposals, Congress was unable to make more   
significant cuts in foreign aid."
