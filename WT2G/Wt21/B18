Take George Gilder's Aug. 28 ForbesASAP piece, &quot;The Coming Software Shift.&quot; Lucky Forbes readersgot their copies in mid-August, smack between the year's two biggest technologyevents--Netscape's record-hot IPO and the release of Windows 95. Gilderused the timing to explain why creative energy and profits in desk-top softwarewould soon migrate from Microsoft to the Internet and toward companies likeNetscape. Needless to say, Gilder's point is controversial, drawing fireand praise from a host of computerdom's biggest names </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Nathan Myhrvold, Group Vice-President, Applications and Content Group,Microsoft </H3><BR><BR>As usual, George Gilder's diagnosis is dead-on. The software industry functionsby turning its fuel-cheap processing power, as described by Moore's Law--intovalue for consumers. In turn, software soon soaks up CPU power, fuelingmarket demand, which sustains Moore's Law. The software-hardware twosomeis about to become a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, with the addition ofcommunications. The three-way cycle will drive growth and value creationin each area at an even faster rate than we've seen so far. I begin to differwhen George frames the computer industry in lurid terms of battle. In reality,computer industry shifts are quite dull affairs. The multidecade declineof the mainframe has been a lot like watching a glacier melt. A leadingcompany fails to invest in new technology and ultimately finds its productobsolete. New entrants might capitalize on this, but most--including Netscapeand HotJava--blaze new trails instead. When an established leader does fall,the proximate cause is almost always slow suicide or atrophy through internalmismanagement; not the wounds of combat. The Internet means opportunityfor all software developers--new and old. Mosaic and its commercial descendantsare currently at the center of the cyclones, but their day in the sun willpass just as surely as it did for previous Internet standards like Gopheror FTP. The instant rise of Mosaic and Netscape foreshadows what Georgemight dub another Law of the Telecosm: In a world with easy electronic distribution,it is very hard to hang onto your position--easy come, easy go. A particularweakness of HTML is that it is a data format no different in spirit fromthe protocols of 1970s-vintage mainframe terminals. Next-generation Internetsoftware will use programmability at both ends of the pipe. Java is noteworthyand may play a role, but its hype falls into a very old trap. Every newprogramming language is heralded as a breakthrough. Fortran was going tocomputerize science and engineering, Cobol would revolutionalize business,and Lisp (and later, Prolog) would deliver us to the promised land of AI.The reality is quite different--new languages offer some modest benefits,but all of the real value resides in the programs created with them. Finally,I must comment on the obsession with finding the next Gates. Bill has beenmy friend and colleague for nearly 10 years, so the topic is familiar. Writinggreat software and founding a company is a first step, but that only matchesBill Gates circa 1976. The secret that made the Bill Gates of 1995 is tohave the technical and business skills to develop new product lines repeatedly.Microsoft is unique in this accomplishment. Our competition is invariablysingle-product companies, or ex post facto assemblages of them. I don'tdoubt that the next Gates will eventually appear, and the Internet may fuelher rise, but it's one hell of a tough act to follow. Scott Mcnealy, ChiefExecutive Officer, Sun Microsystems I'd like to compliment George Gilderfor so eloquently articulating Sun's nearly decade-old credo: &quot;Thenetwork is the computer.&quot; I believe in Gilder's thesis that we are,indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed, disposable software.Desktop operating systems, utilities and applications will soon be relegatedto peripheral status. The network will be the operating system, and, asGilder points out, this change is being brought about the almost incomprehensiblemomentum of the Internet. The ultimate change agent, Gilder suggests, mayin fact be Java, yet another technology that Sun has offered to the industryin an open and barrier-free way. Java is a programming language that createsthe first true network operating system for the globe, because it is safe,secure, robust, fault tolerant and, among many other attributes, platform-independent.Here's how we see it playing out. three computer science students from Berkeleyhacking code late at night will create a Java word processing program. Let'scall it &quot;NetWord.&quot; They put it on their Web server at http://www.netword.com.It will be free because these kids want fame first, knowing that will leadto fortune as with their hero, Marc Andreessen. It will be 100,000 linesof code versus 1.5 million for WordPerfect, because NetWord isn't boggeddown with all the APIs [applications programming interfaces] and other extraneousbaggage of typical applications that must interoperate with a specific operatingsystem, or have become overfeatured. So you're shopping for a new word processingprogram. You've seen the ads offering Word on sale for $249. Of course,you know that means you get the privilege of upgrading in a year for another$89. Your buddy sends an e-mail and says check out NetWord. You take a testdrive. It works! Cool! You are not alone. A few million others have heardabout NetWord. Now the makers have a following and in a few months theystart a company and offer NetWord 2.0 for a mere $2 per copy. You and 10million other avid followers have no qualms about paying the nominal fee.It sure beats the competition. In fact, at that price, you'll be checkingthe NetWord home page monthly to download the latest copy. As of the threecollege kids, they are now millionaires. Suddenly the OS that controls theCPU on your desktop is a legally of an old paradigm, relegated to a secondarytier in the software food chain. This means that Microsoft is now a severelyoverpriced personal productivity tools applications vendor with an OS businessthat is no longer able to &quot;captivate&quot; the end user by being theonly platform to run desired applications. Keeping API's secret won't workanymore. Controlling the interfaces won't work anymore. The wall is downand there's no turning back. So where will that leave Microsoft? Scramblingto explain to investors why the company's market cap is 10 times revenues,scrambling to explain how they can survive in the world of disposable, run-anywhereInternet software. Of course, the marketing muscle up in the Northwest willtry to figure out a way to play in this space. But playing now means playingon a level field. The rules are the same for everyone. They're spelled TCP/IP,Mosaic, WWW, HTTP, HTML and now Java--all the open protocols and languagesthat make up the Internet. It's barrier-free computing. It's consumer choice.It's a free-market economy in the information age, finally. From there,just about anything is possible. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Tesler, Vice President and Chief Scientist, Apple Computer </H3><BR><BR>To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring percipience,perspiration and perspective. Gilder has done it. He has combed throughthe attics of computing and assembled for the family a gripping album ofthe events and circumstances that created the phenomenon we call the Web.If the past is buried in clutter, however, the future is still more difficultto perceive, especially before the dazzle of Netscape and Java. In my view,the Web is a catalyst, but it is not all that matters about the Internet.The browser is to the Internet what the spreadsheet was to the desktop computer.Mosaic is the new VisiCalc, Netscape Navigator the new Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoftwould like to make Explorer the new Excel. Wall Street is as enamored withNetscape today as it was with Lotus when that company went public. Netscapeis a winner, but is the winner? With the aid of its ally, the Sun King,will it inherit the throne? Not necessarily. Where is the proprietary operatingsystem that runs not merely the equivalent of spreadsheets, but thousandsof applications? Where is the PI that some megalomaniac weaves into, well,a web, to attract, ensnare and ultimately consume hapless applications developersand most of the profits they worked so hard to earn? I hope that the namelessidealists who create the Internet on a daily basis succeed in their resistanceto central control more successfully than did their computer club counterpartsa decade ago. If they do, there may be no single successor to Bill Gates.If they don't then it's anyone's guess who will maneuver into that role.The drama promises to remain gripping. <BR><HR><H3>Howard Anderson, Founder, Yankee Group </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George - what took you so long? What is so surprising isthat you were so surprised that the Netscape revolution may supersede theMicrosoft revolution. Think back! Fifteen years ago, the office automationhype was about word processing, but the real revolution was electronic mail.Today 36 million Americans get their mail electronically and no one reallygives a damn about new word processing packages. Your beatification of MarcAndreessen is a little premature, don't you think? There are many visionaries,but few company builders. We in the venture community intuitively know thatthere is little likelihood that the visionaries will turn into the operatingmanagers new industries need. Other than Gates, who? What you have proposed(correctly) is that the peripheral becomes the major focus. Five years ago,the thought that IBM and the clone industry would become &quot;value-addedresellers&quot; for Intel and Microsoft would have been heresy. Now youare suggesting that the Internet will become the major focus--and Inteland Microsoft will be relegated to that &quot;value-added&quot; focus. Youare right. Nonetheless, quite frankly, the Internet needs three years tobe ready for prime time. Meanwhile, we will go through a sine curve of hype,backlash, then reality. Just when the naysayers sound and seem logical,the Internet will begin to fulfill its destiny, and that destiny is to becomethe most potent force in technology. And George, invite your mother to dinnerfor me. Of your technobabble family, she seems the most interesting! <BR><HR><H3>John Perry Barlow, Rancher, Writer, Web Guru, <BR>Grateful Dead Lyricist </H3><BR><BR><BR>I am enormously encouraged by George Gilder's discovery of the World WideWeb. I'm tempted to stoop to catty remarks about how long it took him. Lately,he's seemed almost alone among intelligent commentators in continuing tocredit the myth of the information superhighway--a belief that you can sustainonly if you don't know about the Web or if your perceptions have been profoundlyaltered by the reality-distortion fields generated within large contentconglomerates, telcos or cable companies, or the vast cluelessness thatis Washington, D.C. In fact, anyone using the phrase information superhighwayis almost certainly in the thrall of some large and doomed institution,or is a complete nimrod who knows only what he hears on television. Whichis, for obvious reasons, filled with people who believe in it. They're notgoing to be roadkill on it, by golly. They're going to find that on-ramp. . . hey, they're going to be the on-ramp! No way, San Jose! The futureof the Industrial Era media megaliths, whether Disney, Time Warner or, moreto the point, Microsoft, will arrive over the Web, not the mythical infobahn.The Web will be the end of them. We are up against a discontinuous leapas we hit the next layer of interactive complexity, both in software andin thought. It has now reached a point where about the only way to developall the scripts, scraps and code objects from which the next World WideOperating System (WWOS) will assemble itself is to grow them in the distributed,massively parallel amalgam of minds and processes that make up the Net.The Web is alive, and filled with life, nearly as mysterious, complex and,well, natural as a primordial swamp. Microsoft is a factory. You can't manufacturelife in a factory. You have to grow it in nature. This ___________ so new,really. _______________'s proprietary claims notwithstanding, I take thefirst WWOS, Unix, as proof that if enough graduate students type into enoughterminals long enough, they will eventually produce an operating system.And given enough graduate students, you can be sure that somewhere amongthem will be a Bill Joy or a Marc Andreessen. In accordance with Joy's Law,they won't be working at Microsoft. Furthermore, the Web and most browsersgive them a way to crib from one another, lavishly and easily. All that'snecessary to see the code that generated what's on your screen is to click:&quot;View source.&quot; All that's necessary to get your page employingsome of the same innovations is to copy and paste. This creates an environmentof dense autocollaboration. To see how productive it's already been in lessthan two years of existence, get on the Web now. This will make the micromputerrevolution look like a good start. Gilder's article is a fine thing. I'vebeen talking about the End of Microsoft for a couple of years and have feltlike a madman parading a ragged sign. When it starts coming from such impeccableseersuckers as George Gilder, it may be time to short a little of that Microsoftstock. <BR><HR><H3>Bert C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman &amp; CEO MCI Communications </H3><BR><BR>Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will becomesubordinate to the network; that the network will, in effect, become subordinateto the network; that the network will, in effect, become everything andthe only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution and impact of theInternet and the resultant focus on content. Gilder's allusions to Gatesand Microsoft, however, yield a very real question: Can they deal with thecoming transformation? Doing so will require a new vision of the futureand a new understanding of merging industries, evolving ways of computing,and some hard new facts. Here's a key one: Companies that don't addressand act on the need for collaborative work from a widening universe willfall hard--and fast. Confronting any rival with the market dominance ofMicrosoft will be very difficulty. But trying to run in place could be evenharder. The challenge is not only to understand, as Gilder writes, &quot;thatyour computer will never be the same&quot;--but also that it's your companythat will never be the same. Dan Lynch, Founder, Interop Chairman, CybercashGilder has got it figured out. His article is dead-on about how the Internetis the architecture of the future for information dissemination. Want proof?Pouring huge resources into its Microsoft Network and Microsoft Navigatorofferings, Microsoft admits that it does not really know the business modelfor how to make money in this new arena, but it is determined to get onthe playing field in a big way. Meanwhile, Sun is too hooked on hardwareprofits to make a new fortune on this round. No doubt that Java is the righttechnology for making the Net be the center of the universe. Sun shouldsimply spin that group out as a new company unfettered by dragging alonghardware. The only fault I find with Gilder's article is his picking MarcAndreessen as the next Bill Gates. Marc only has a few percent of Netscapestock; Bill has tons of Microsoft stock. Marc will make a lot of othersmuch richer and he surely won't suffer, but he will not become a feared/lovedmogul because of Netscape. Maybe he and Bill Joy should bolt and start theirown company? Marc is still younger than Gates was when Microsoft got itsplum from IBM. I asked Marc one question when I met him during his briefstint at EIT in Menlo Park. What was the central design assumption for Mosaic?He said 45 megabits per second! I asked why. He said that it makes it easyto program because you do not have to develop hairy mechanisms to mask outthe slowness of the network. Then commercial reality set in when he andJim Clark got together and they recentered their Netscape Navigator forthe 14.4 kilobit world, thus giving us the MS-DOS of the Internet. It isa good start, but Marc was right about 45 megabits--only it is not justto make the programmer's life easy, it is to make the consumer's life joyful.<BR><HR><H3>Nicholas Negroponte, Director, MIT media Lab Author, Being Digital </H3><BR><BR>Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past and futureof the Net is on the digital dime and, as best I hear from my colleaguesat the MIT Media Lab, Java is really hot. We're betting our house on it.The Net, however, is no place for kings. It is a collective intelligencethat will work in spite of government and any attempts to control it. NoCarnegies, Rockefellers or Harrimans this time. The white envelope, George,is empty. When Larry Roberts invented the Internet in 1969, his decentralistapproach made the idea interesting for the military, because it was fail-safe.More than 25 years later, after the Vietnam and Cold wars, the Net is alsosafe from dominance of any kind. Supercomputer &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Unixhackers and Media Lab alumni have moved it forward (not Windows or Mac users),because they are made of the right stuff. This is serious media and computerscience, not the world of Windows applications. Here is where George iswrong. The next Bill Gates is not Marc Andreessen. Yes, Marc will do verywell. However, if you were a sucker to pay $75 per share for Netscape atthe opening on Aug. 9, keep it to yourself (if I hadn't been traveling betweenRio and Buenos Aires that day, I would have sold short and made 25 pointsin a few minutes). There will be many browsers, hundreds of them. Today,I'll bet on Niki Grauso's, which will come out in 37 languages. Browsersare the surface of a much deeper phenomenon. Sun Microsystems has it right:Java. Why? Because Java is a language and many smart people will expressthemselves and invent new applications in that language. Netscape is butone awning on the Virtual Boulevard of Digital Cafes. Java is the coffee.<BR><HR><H3>Andy Grove, President and CEO, Intel </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George--you haven't met a new technology you didn't like,and conversely you haven't met an older one that you don't think is readyto be toppled by the new. Do you remember when you wrote that &quot;specializedcomputers-to-a-chip will become the prevailing product category&quot;? Well,it didn't happen. Not that silicon compilers were back, not that ASICs areinsignificant, but the general-purpose computer that you pooh-poohed hasbecome the prevailing paradigm of the subsequent six years since the publicationof Microsm. Now you predict that the PC will become a peripheral attachedto an all-knowing, all-powerful Internet. I don't think so, George. Notthat the Internet won't be important; I look at it as one of the most importantapplications that will be used on my PC in the future. And that is the differencebetween us. What matters to me is my computer. I use my computer. I am usinga word processor to write this response; I use e-mail to communicate withhundreds of coworkers from my desk and from my home; I use CompuServe toget updated industry news; I use ProShare conferencing to do business withpartners across the world in real time. And I use Netscape to check outa new home page that I have hears about. A couple of years from now, I mayspend more time in the Net-based applications than in some of the others,just as today I spend my time differently among my applications than I didfive years ago. My computer will evolve and adapt (as PCs have been so goodat doing) to the ever-changing mix of applications with which I work. Youare wrong in another area. Implicit in so much of your writing is a fantasy:the notion of high-bandwidth communications reaching every PC. Today mycomputer is connected with ISDN to other computers; it is also connectedto LANs and to an ordinary phone line. Five years from now, my computerwill still be connected to an ordinary phone line and to ISDN, but alsoto broadband networks via a cable modem and to an ATM network to reach otherluck computer users; and probably to do some kind of wireless connection.Ten years from now, it will be another set of communications transport media.But it will never be a single superconnection, because goodness doesn'tarrive in a sing step. It comes a little at a time. To be sure, if God erasedall computers and networks and forced us to start from scratch, we wouldcertainly come a lot closer to your utopian view of broadband to the computer,with intelligence cleverly distributed between network and computers. Butthen, if God erased New York City, it would not be rebuilt the way it istoday. In real life, both cities and computer networks evolve, incrementby valuable increment. The bottom line is this: The magic of the PC businessis that there is a computer that I can look at, put my hands on and say,&quot;This computer is mine, and it opens the universe of tens of millionsof computers to me through its screen and keyboard--and whatever connectionscheme is available to me.&quot; Don't bury this magic; cherish it. <BR><HR><H3>Andy Kessler, Partner, Unterberg Harris </H3><BR><BR>Once again, my colleague and trendtender, George Gilder, has eloquentlyset forth the next wave of innovation. But in the process, the PC or clientdevice will not be hollowed out. Rather than living with fast servers andPCs acting as relatively dumb terminals, which is the architecture of Mosaicand the Web and even Java so far, the endgame is instead a network whereevery device is a server, even your own lousy PC. This means terribly intelligentand &quot;fat&quot; clients, enabling rather than just hanging off the network.Moreover, it is much too early to be handing out crowns to the new kingsof the network. George's trends are dead-on, but the kings are coronatedby natural selection, not by just showing up and claiming the throne. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen Manes, Columnist, New York Times, Author of Gates</H3><BR><BR><BR>Slow down, George! Sake's alive! Ma missed signs four and five! What sprangto mind upon reading Gilder's latest panegyric was not the rosey technologyfuture, but a Burma Shave ditty from my youth. I don't know Colombian beansabout Java, but I've been watching this industry too long not to reach formy methane detector when somebody announces in the language of corporatepropaganda that &quot;your computer will never be the same.&quot; This particularlocution almost always signifies too much time spent amid the rarefied gasesthat hove around chairmen and CEOs. A particularly toxic dose is to be suspectedwhen the proclaimed agent in change is an interpreted language. Interpretedlanguages have a long line of champions, not the least of whom is that greatBasic patron, William Henry Gates III (who seems less &quot;Archimdean&quot;than Charles Foster Kancan). But their magic has its limits, as Gates himselffound out when Microsoft developed its Multiplan spreadsheet on the interpretedruns-on-everything (but kinda slow) model and watched the compiled runs-on-DOS-only(but really fast) Lotus 1-2-3 force some massive recalculations at Microsoftheadquarters. Wasn't it only a few months ago that the press went gaga overGeneral Magic's interpreted Telescript, which now reportedly has, uh, someproblems? The runs-everywhere promise of interpreted languages generallymanages to get broken when it hits some Least Common Denominator--say, anotherLCD, the liquid crystal display. If you want to run Gilder's helicoptermodel on your crappy little Personal Digital Assistant, you may not haveto worry about having AutoCAD on your hard drive, but you probably willhave to worry about having a hard drive, not to mention a screen with enoughdetail and contrast to make the thing look vaguely like the original. TheIBM PC version of Multiplan was no prize, but it looked and felt great comparedwith the on that ran on the toy Commodore 64. Software is never truly independentof the hardware it runs on, interpreting programs tend to run with all thespeed of a tricycle, and bandwidth is still a long, long way from beingfree. <BR><HR><H3>Jesse Berst, Editor, Windows Watcher </H3><BR><BR>Mr. Gilder's article on the coming software shift is 10% fact and 90% wishfulthinking. Fact: Windows's dominance will come to an end when it is renderedirrelevant by a new platform. Wishful thinking: hoping the new platformwill be owned by somebody other than Microsoft. Gilder's fantasy of a Microsoft-freecomputer industry might come to pass if Bill Gates spent his time in hisvault counting his money. he doesn't He obsessively watches the horizonfor threats to his hegemony. When he spots a danger, he works feverishlyto use his current monopolies to leverage his way into the new arena. Hespotted the Internet danger about two years ago and has already spent morethan $100 million to make sure that Microsoft isn't left out. Yes, George,we will all eventually emigrate from the Windows desktop empire. But whenwe get to the new promised land, we're likely to find that Bill Gates hasalready acquired the prime real estate. Scott Cook, Chairman, Intuit Gilderchronicles invention like no other. He finds the history in the most recentevents. He finds the significance in invention before that significanceis real or realized. But Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future tellshow the innovations that reshape our lives follow their enabling inventionsby years or decades. Gutenberg invented movable type. It took another 40years for an entrepreneur named Aldus to assemble what created book publishingas we known it. Marconi invented radio exactly 100 years ago. It took another25 years for entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh and New York to create broadcasting.It was through broadcasting that radio reshaped our lives. None of us expectit will taken 25 years for this chapter of the Internet story. But I hopeGilder will tackle the next question: How will these inventions change ourlives? Gordon Bell, Research Fellow, Microsoft, Inventor of Digital VAXcomputer Telecosm, like microcosm, is another interesting Gilder story.Like transistors that follow Moore's Law, bandwidth increases at 60% peryear. The Gilder Fallacy is that transistors and bandwidth will also becheap. This may be true in the very long run, and I hope to live long enoughto see it. Meanwhile, the memory cartel has kept prices constant at $50per megabyte and the telephone cartel has metered out bits in 64 kilobitPOTS [plain old telephone service] = chunks for decades. For example, fullISDN lines (two voice lines) cost at least twice POTS. ISDN is also veryinelegant since it makes poor use of the precious last mile, and is notadequate or scaleable. Only modems, created by a new datacom industry, havegotten faster. My version of the Internet story is at http://www.uvc.com.It is called &quot;Internet 1.0 (Arpanet), 2.0 (today), and 3.0 (what weneed),&quot; subtitled: &quot;It's bandwidth and Symmetry, Stupid.&quot;In 1987, I chaired the cross-agency federal task force that proposed NREN[National Research and Education Network], aka NII [National InformationInfrastructure], aka GII [Global Information Infrastructure]. Our recommendationwas &quot;that an advanced network be designed and developed to interconnectacademic, industrial and government research facilities in the U.S.,&quot;with the plan for a factor of a ten thousandfold increase in bandwidth by2002. Things have gone according to our &quot;vision&quot; to maintain constantdoubling for the last 25 years. Thank goodness Berners-Lee created the http://wwwnetwork, aka the Web, so that Andreessen could build Mosaic and its viewers;that's the serendipity part. Public funding of research (this time at Illinois'National Center for Supercomputing Applications) &quot;saved&quot; us again.Intermixed in Gilder's piece is another story about a new Sun programminglanguage, Java, which when combined with the Web, will render Microsoftineffective. If that's the case, then Sun needn't support the anti-Microsoftlegal consortium and should concentrate on toppling it with their products.However, as a newly hired Microsoft researcher, anxious to work his waydown the corporate hierarchy to programmer, I hope that he's wrong aboutour undoing. Microsoft is its own greatest enemy if it fails to make everyproduct embrace the Internet. In an organization that has to keep with chaotichardware platform evolution, having an external standard and threat is thebest thing that could happen. Of the 50-plus million Word and PowerPointusers, however, perhaps 10,000 will see Java as an Internet developmenttool. More likely it's a tool for developing Internet tools. Word alreadyproduced HTML pages and PowerPoint should have the goal of being the mostused Internet content editor. I'll bet that Windows NT (created by DaveCutler, who also happens to be the world's greatest programmer) will becomethe &quot;standard&quot; server platform, just as the Wintel platform, likethe Gilders use, runs nearly all the viewers. As for staying in the centerof the sphere---Gilder's right: Andreessen's there, but I wouldn't countGates out . . . yet. <BR><HR><H3>Charles Mann, Contributing Editor, Atlantic Monthly </H3><BR><BR>The vision Mr. Gilder proposes is wonderfully attractive--who could notlike the idea of a future in which nobody has to struggle with the maddeninglimitations and incompatibilities of the PC? But the idea of plugging everyoneinto the Net for their work and play poses problems of its own, pride ofplace perhaps going to security. The number of Internet crackers and wannabecrackers is rising; worse, the very speed and ubiquity of the Net meansthat each new break-in technique becomes instantly available to all of them,as the spread of Root Kit an its analogues attests. Putting the whole worldonline will increase the opportunity for mischief enormously. At present,we have two basic means for fending off these guys--firewalls and encryption.Put crudely, firewalls are small computers that stand between you and theNet, scanning for unwanted incoming bits. (CheckPoint Software Technologiesin Israel, makes one of the more interesting examples). In one way or another,firewalls intercept and read parts of every Internet packet that comes yourway. If everyone's software is based somewhere &quot;out there&quot; onthe web, the computing power and bandwidth required to filter every screendump and rewrite through the firewall is interesting to contemplate. A worseproblem comes when the information is encrypted--how is the firewall toread it without decoding it? And if it does decode it, aren't you decodinginformation outside the intended recipient network? It's a problem. Forthis reason, most Net aficionados argue that some form of public-key encryptionis the answer. Leaving aside the extraordinary reserves of computing powerthat will be required to encrypt every bit of info going in and out of everysystem in the world--and the even more vexing question of who will pay forit, a subject on which I am not nearly as sanguine as Mr. Gilder--one hasto worry about the possibilities of breakthroughs such as those reportedrecently in Science, where researchers took advantage of the vagaries ofquantum mechanics to reduce the time required to factor large numbers enormously.Because encryption in its present form depends on the huge amount of timeit now takes to factor such numbers, these advances have dismaying implications.We could face a future in which advances in encryption and decoding raceeach other, Red Queen-style--hardly a situation favoring the confident useof a global network. Until these problems are resolved, they will be a bigdamper on the kind of bustling, productive, interconnected future that Mr.Gilder and I both hope is just around the corner. <BR><HR><H3>Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet Inventor and 3Corm Founder, <BR>InfoWorld Columnist </H3><BR><BR>To refind Gilder's model for how Gates gets dethroned, I'll briefly explainhow Gates made his billions. Gates came of age just as Grosch's Law aboutthe scale economies of bigger computers was giving way to Moore's Law aboutthe volume economies of smaller computers. Gates saw early and clearly theprofit potential in controlling standards, like the horizontal protocolstandards for communicating back and forth among computers, and like thevertical interface standards for communicating up and down between applicationssoftware and underlying computer operating systems software. I went withhorizontal protocol standards, namely Ethernet, which I advanced by givingit away to all other comers. Gates went with vertical interface standards,namely IBM's PC-DOS, which he advanced more shrewdly by giving it away toIBM but selling it to all comers. To build the value of PC-DOS, Gates gathereda huge flock of application software developers and got them committed tohis interface standards. Then by controlling changes to DOS's interfaces,upgrading them step-by-step all the way up to Windows 95, Gates was alsoable to sell them over and over again in upgraded forms. With that money,he could exploit inside knowledge of his own interface changes to pick offone after another of the larger application developers, like those in wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentations and, now, electronic mail and databases.His only major failure to date has been in networking, where he's failedso far to kill Novell. That failure involved control of Novell's protocolstandards rather than interface standards where Microsoft is king. Gildersays that Moore's Law is giving way to Metcalfe's Law, which projects therunaway value of numerous internetworked computers. According to Gilder'spoint of view, this exponential effect shifts importance from the verticalprogramming interface standards upon which the Redmond Rockefeller's fortuneis built to horizontal communication protocol standards which the likesof Marc Andreessen might be expected to dethrone Gates, perhaps becomingthe Microsoft of the Internet. But Gates, of course, aims to be the Microsoftof the Internet. And he need only broaden his tried-and-true interface strategyto include the protocols from the World Wide Web, now threatening his standardsdominance. Gates has the advantage of his current Windows monopoly, whichhe is now trying to leverage into control of the Web--let's hope our antitrustsheepdogs eventually arrive on the scene. Andreessen and company have thedisadvantage of coming from the virtuously open but fractious Unix world.Unless they can keep their Web standards act together, they will lose theWeb to the Windows Microsoft Network in the same way they lost Unix to DOS.MSN and Netscape will likely shape up to be the major opponents in the comingWeb Wars. MSN is making its play to replace Berners-Lee's Web standardswith its own under Blackbird. Microsoft is now giving away MSN browserslike Netscape and can be expected at some point to sell MSN servers andtools directly opposite Netscape's servers. Netscape, on the other hand,with its very busy Web pages is looking more and more like an on-line servicein competition with MSN, advertising and all. I must say that this battleis one that my InfoWorld readers will enjoy, as the fierce competition willdrive the Web toward its full potential. Gates doesn't need it, and certainlydoesn't expect it from me, but I do have to defend him. Andreessen and companyhave not yet made their billions, and they now look innocently charming,gregarious and eager, attractive compared with the shrewd and intense Mr.Gates. But, I've seen close up what even $1 million can do to people, andfrankly Gates handles his billions about as well as it is reasonable toexpect. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen S. Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. </H3><BR><BR>Gilder's gushing hype has finally come full circle. He has come to the keyrecognition that there's more to the information age than the alluring powerof Moore's Law. This time-worn mantra of a vendor-driven rhetoric extolsthe miracles of performance of payback--the productivity paradox wherebystartling advances in computational speed fail to deliver the value-addedsolutions that truly matter for society as a whole. But now Gilder heraldsa new &quot;killer app&quot; in user-friendly browsers and new &quot;minimalist&quot;programming languages such as Java. But don't count on it--at least notyet. In the fast-track 1990s, technology must still come to grips with aprofound upheaval in American lifestyles. For the first time ever, white-collarworkers--fully two-thirds of the U.S. workforce--are being asked to up theante of their own productivity contributions through longer and harder work,squeezing family and leisure time as never before in the last 50 years.Surfing the Net in a quest for the &quot;best&quot; application--and learninghow to use each of the new tools--takes considerable time. And that's therub: Time-intensive surfing is in direct conflict with the harsh realitiesof a time-constrained era. In the end, it all boils down to return. Theaverage U.S. worker who has toiled under the burden of stagnant real wagesfor more than a decade will insist on measurable improvements in personalproductivity before squandering ever-greater amounts of leisure and familytime on an open-ended journey on the telecosm. However alluring the latestbreakthroughs in electronic shopping, banking, and video selection may seemto be, my guess is that they don't meet the hurdle rate for the averageAmerican. That's the crux of the dilemma that Gilder still doesn't get:The promises of the telecosm will ring hollow until new means of incomegeneration and wealth creation for society as a whole are created. At best,a flexible software paradigm is merely another means to automate existingtasks. The big steps come with applications that truly change the functionsof work and leisure. And they have yet to be taken. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Ellison, Founder, CEO and Chairman, Oracle Systems Corp. </H3><BR><BR>I believe George has it half right. The center of gravity is indeed shiftingaway from the personal computer and toward the network--specifically towardthe Internet's World Wide Web. Despite the Clinton administration's mostdetermined regulatory efforts, networks are getting faster and cheaper.Various telecommunication bills pending in Congress will decrease regulation,increase competition and accelerate this trend. Cost and ease-of-use improvements,plus video capability, will make the World Wide Web as popular as the familiarTV and telephone networks for communication and commerce, as well as forinformation and entertainment. Bandwidth will expand exponentially and sowill the quality and quantity of information on the Net. The informationage will move from dawn to full daylight. And our world will be changed.But probably not by Netscape: Wall Street and Mr. Gilder are greatly charmedby he most exciting startup since 3DO, but it is important to remember thatNetscape's improbably $2.4 billion valuation comes without earnings or anyquick hope thereof. In the absence of any commercial competition, Netscapewas able to achieve a 70% =&quot;market share&quot; by distributing itsbrowser for free via the Internet. When a clearly superior Browser becomesavailable, people will replace their Netscape browser just the way theygot it--with the touch of a button. The most important new feature announcedfor a future version of the Netscape browser in Sun's hot new Java programminglanguage, which Sun is trying to make an open standard. We're all for it,but you don't get to be the next Microsoft by distributing Sun softwareand helping create open standards. You get to be Microsoft by creating yourown proprietary standard, while convincing everybody it's actually an openstandard. Fortunately, this trick usually works only once, so there willbe no new Microsoft. One is quite enough, thank you. Marc Andreessen isnot Bill Gates. It's probably possible to be great without being Bill. Butit takes a lot of work. Gates is the chairman of Microsoft, the CEO, itsfounder and the man who makes every key hiring decision. Andreessen is neitherchairman (that's Jim Clark), nor CEO (that's Jim Barksdale), but a hiredgun. Hired, in fact, by Jim Clark. History generally shows us only one Rockefellerper industry--the first one tends to get rid of future rivals. If a cosmicshift causes King Bill to lose his throne, it will not be filled by Andreessenor anybody else. There is no next Bill Gates--in software--at least. <BR><HR><H3>Steve Case, President and CEO, America Online </H3><BR><BR>I have a simple request: Let's not forget about the customer. A &quot;realitygap&quot; exists between technologists (breathlessly enchanted with thelatest and greatest revolutionary developments) and the mass consumer market(inevitably preferring evolutionary incrementalism). Invariably, developershave powerful workstations, superfast networks, and a certain affinity forcomplexity. Meanwhile, tens of millions of people out there struggle withmemory-deprived 386s, painfully slow modems (in the real world 14.4 kbpsis considered pretty fast, and 28.8 kbps is the promised land), and a tremendousthirst for simplicity. Yes, telephone companies are getting more aggressivewith ISDN pricing and marketing, and developers are reaching for plug-and-playsolutions, but it's still too hard and still too expensive. Yes, cable companiesare testing cable modems, but the tests are going slowly and broad deploymentis likely to take many years. Switching gears to software, Gilder embracesthe commonly held notion that Netscape's browser is the standard, commandinga dominant (&quot;70%&quot;) market share. But all of the commercial on-lineservices now provide Web access, and they have overnight become the dominantforce in the consumer Web. Neither of the two largest existing players (AOLand CompuServe), nor the most significant entrant (Microsoft), are Netscape'slicensees, so Netscape's market share is therefore zero in this emergingsegment. The already fragmented Web market is likely to get even more fragmented,creating havoc for publishers and confusion for consumers. Ultimately, theservices with the largest audiences will drive standardization. So whenI read about the &quot;dynamically portable&quot; Java, linked with theNetscape browser &quot;standard&quot; and coupled with a &quot;bandwidthtidal wave,&quot; leading a &quot;telecosmic advance&quot; towards a worldchock-full of custom applets filled with tasty morsels of &quot;executablecontent,&quot; Exciting, but I wonder how -- and when -- it will all cometogether into a mass market for interactive services. People don't buy browsers.They don't buy objects. They don't buy bandwidth. They buy services. Theywant access to a broad range of content, packaged and presented in a friendly,useful, engaging manner, priced simply and affordably, with a strong underlyingsense of community. At AOL, our aim is to reach tens of millions of peopleand help shape this new medium. We will continue to leverage technologyto do -- but we'll also remind ourselves that although technologists believethe journey is the reward, for everybody else, the destination is what reallycounts. <BR><HR><H2><CENTER>George Gilder Replies: </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>When the responses to an article exceed the original in pith and pertinence,the writer may be tempted merely to step back, point and applaud. However,at the risk of revealing Forbes ASAP trade secrets, I will correct the impressionthat I am some kind of sappy seersucker who gets his information from dotingCEOs, perhaps in the telephone and TV industries. In fact, much to the irritationof the PR firms surrounding large companies, I invariably rely mostly onengineers, programmers and other technologists and consult the imperialsuits chiefly en route to the illuminati in the nether reaches of theircompanies. <BR><BR><BR>As Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has noticed with some impatience, I alsogive short shrift to the kind of macrovisions, strategies and statisticsthat float up to the top of economic models. These data are too light onthe technical details in which reside the angels and devils of industrialdestiny. For example, Roach remains perplexed by the &quot;productivityparadox,&quot; the lack of evident payoff of information tools, the failuresof the industry to surmount the hurdle rates of humbler households, allin the face of some 60 million worldwide prospective PC sales in 1995, exceedingTV unit sales in the U.S., with e-mail passing the U.S. Postal Service inmessage units. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are capturing some 50% of all theprofits of the industrial world and maintaining market share between 60%and 90% in most leading-edge products, while deploying three times as muchcomputer power per capita as either Europe or Japan. <BR><BR><BR>Roach trusts government productivity data and wage levels more than thedemonstrable achievements of U.S. companies and calls the conflict a portentousparadox. I say that both the wage and productivity data are largely bunkum,based on silly deflators that mostly fail to capture the plummeting pricesin the industry, while U.S. leadership in PCs, peripherals, networks andsoftware is the real payoff. PC companies alone have generated some $250billion in market caps over the last decade; Internet companies will generatetrillions. These bonanzas answer all the questions on hurdle rates and socialyields (though if you want to see some real high-speed hurdling in homes,wait until cable modems proliferate next year). The payoff of informationtechnology is the global leadership of the U.S. economy despite appallingpolicy mistakes from the Bush and Clinton administrations. <BR><BR><BR>Like me, Andy Grove likes to wrangle and I hesitate to deny him his pugilisticjollies. Among the new technologies I did not like from the outset are HDTV,interactive TV, TV shopping, game machines, Japanese fifth-generation computers,NMOS, videophones, flash memories, serial Crays, Thinking Machines, 3DOand pencentric PDAs. But perhaps we can make a deal. I will concede to himand Andy Kessler that the use of the term &quot;hollowing out of the computer,&quot;borrowed from the estimable Eric Schmidt of Sun, is hyperbolic, even misleadingin an absolute sense. But they should acknowledge that in relative terms,the balance between desktop and network is shifting sharply. After all,in five out of the six PC uses Grove cites, most of the value originateson the network. Nonetheless, I do cherish the PC; indeed, using the Internet,I believe it will displace both the telephone and television over the nextfive years or so.<BR><HR><BR><H4><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="177"HEIGHT="54" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>

&quot;I was trying to conceive of how one could approach it in a way that
would be fundamental . . . like being at the center of a sphere, where there
were opportunities--and problems, of course!--in all directions.&quot; <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>What will it take to launch a new Bill Gates--an Archimedean man who
sharply shifts the center of the sphere, alters the axes of technology and
economy, and builds a new business empire on new foundations? Who can inherit
the imperial throne in the microcosm and telecosm currently held by the
Redmond Rockefeller? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will open the envelope in a minute. But first I want to tell you about
a new software program called Netscape Navigator Personal Edition. I brought
it back from Silicon Valley in late June and put the package next to my
PC. The PC was proudly running a beta version of Windows 95. I had presented
Windows 95 with great fanfare to my 11-year-old son Richard as his route
to the most thrilling new frontiers of the computer world. Multitasking,
32-bit operation, flat memory! Object linking and embedding! &quot;Information
at your fingertips!&quot; But, all in all, he preferred his Mac Quadra 840AV
or even Windows 3.1. They don't crash so often, he explained. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live out in the boondocks of western Massachusetts where there are no
convenient full-service connections to the Internet. So I was much less
excited about Netscape than I was about Windows 95. I hoped Windows 95 would
put me on line through the Microsoft Network system. Some 10 minutes later,
though, Richard wanted to know my credit car number so I could choose an
Internet service provider. A couple of minutes after that, linked through
internetMCI's 800 number, Richard was on the World Wide Web, using the InfoSeek
service to examine my chapters from Telecosm on line, searching the secrets
of Sim City 2000 at Maxis, exchanging messages with Microsoft Flight Simulator
buffs, and exploring Disney. As far as I know, he is still there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, my brother Walter came by. He worked for a computer
company, New World Technologies in Ashland, Mass., that builds customized
Pentium machines and delivers them to value-added resellers within 48 hours.
Walter wanted the Netscape program. He took it back to my parents' farm
down the road and booted it up on a four-megabyte 386SX Dynatech previously
used to map the pedigrees of a flock of Romney sheep. Soon he was on the
Web scouting out the competition from Dell and Micron and showing off the
Gilder Web page. This intrigued my 77-year-old mother, who had scarcely
even noticed a computer before. I don't know how it happened, but before
the night was out, she too was on the Web, exploring catalogs of British
colleges for her namesake granddaughter who was soon to leave for London.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let me tell you about my introduction to Java, a new programming language
that menaces Microsoft's software supremacy. I encountered Java in early
June at a Sun Microsystems conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
downtown San Francisco. For a speech I was to give, I had planned to use
a multimedia presentation, complete with Macro-Mind Director images and
QuickTime video that I had contrived with an expensive professional some
months earlier. The complexities of Director prompted me to convert the
program to Astound. However, it required an external disk drive and ran
erratically with the eight megabytes of RAM on my PowerBook. I decided to
speak nakedly from notes on the coming technologies of sand and glass and
air. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following me immediately to the stage was Sun's amiable chief scientist,
John Gage. He decided to illustrate his speech entirely from the World Wide
Web. He began with a handsome page, contrived minutes before, giving an
account of my speech, headlined: &quot;Gilder Addresses Sun, Tells of Technologies
of Opaque Silicon and Transparent Silicon.&quot; Then he moved to the Gilder
Telecosm archives run by Gordon Jacobson of Portman Communications at a
Web site of the University of Pennsylvania's engineering school. Gage illustrated
his talk with real-time reports on traffic conditions in San Diego (where
I was about to go), weather conditions in Florida as a hurricane loomed,
and developments on Wall Street as IBM bid for Lotus. He showed the Nasdaq
ticker running across the screen. He showed animations of relevant charts,
cute little Java gymnasts cartwheeling across the screen, three-dimensional
interactive molecular models and an overflowing coffee cup, entitled &quot;HotJava.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
None of his information and images used a desktop presentation program,
whether from MacroMind or from Microsoft. None of them used a database engine,
whether SQL or Oracular. Indeed, except for the Gilder speech report, none
were created beforehand. Incurring no memory or disk drive problems, Gage
summoned all the illustrations to his PowerBook directly from the Internet.
The animations employed a new computer language, Java, written for the Web
by the venerable Sun programmer James Gosling. Java allows transmission
of executable programs to any computer connected to the Net to be interpreted
and played safely and securely in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clifford Stoll, calls it &quot;Silicon snake oil.&quot; But I call it a
fundamental break in the history of technology. It is the software complement
of the hollowing out of the computer described in Forbes ASAP (&quot;The
Bandwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December 5, 1994). Almost overnight, the CPU
and its software have become peripheral; the network, central. I had spent
working on a presentation on my desktop computer, using an array of presentation
software. But Gage improvised a more impressive and animated presentation
without using any desktop presentation programs at all. The World Wide Web
and the Java language were enough. Restricted to the files of my computer,
I struggled with storage problems and incompatible research formats, while
he used the storage capacity and information resources of more than five
million host computers on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly for my family, the limitations of my parents' barnyard four-megabyte
386SX didn't matter. The operating system also didn't matter. What was crucial
was the network gear and software. My brother Walter had installed a modem
that linked to the Web at an average of 24.6 kilobits per second. With the
Netscape Navigator, that was enough. Actually 14.4 would have been enough.
Enough to launch a new Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Admit it, the legacy version, once so luminous, is beginning to lose its
shine. You thrill no longer at his vaporware $50 million house, fenestrated
with $40 billion Windows, offering misty views of Daytona, Memphis, Cairo,
and other far-off places you no longer really care to go, even if--OLE--they
are swimming with GML 3D screensavers from London's National Gallery endlessly
hurdling the 640K barrier as if it were flat as a Mac. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the most essential level, Bill Joy of Sun illuminated Gates's dilemma
at Esther Dyson's PC Forum conference in 1990. Known as one of the great
minds in software, yet losing share inexorably to Microsoft, Joy seemed
to be moving into the role of conference crank. Year after year, he lamented
the prolix inelegance of the triumphant waves of Microsoft programs sweeping
through the industry: &quot;As we add more and more of these features to
older systems,&quot; he said, &quot;the complexity gets multiplicative.
I have 10 different packages that interact in 10-to-the-10th different ways.
I get all sorts of surprises, and yet because these things don't play together
well the power is only additive. I get this feature and that feature but
the combinations don't work. What I'd really like to see is a system where
the complexity goes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In software, complexity has long been rising exponentially, while power
has been rising additively. In response, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of
Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's
Laws for software: &quot;Software expands to fill the available memory,&quot;
and &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster.&quot;
Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their
previous releases. Compare Word 6.0 for the Mac, for example, with Word
5.0 or WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows with WordPerfect for DOS. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But none of this matters. Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly
exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the
Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every
18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.
The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on
the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates travels in the slipstream behind Moore's Law, following a key rule
of the microcosm: Waste transistors. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, &quot;Every
time Andy [Grove] makes a faster chip, Bill uses all of it.&quot; Wasting
transistors is the law of thrift in the microcosm, and Gates has been its
most brilliant and resourceful exponent. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, in the face of Gates's ascendancy, Bill Joy seemed to grow curls
and shed influence, as Sun played rope-a-dope with Hewlett-Packard and other
workstation rivals. In 1990, he retreated to a sylvan aerie in Aspen, Colo.,
to pursue &quot;advanced research&quot; for Sun. But his talk of small programs
and handheld consumer appliances seemed irrelevant to the company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, in early 1990, showing up late--in a Hawaiian shirt--to address
a formal dinner in Silicon Valley, Bill Joy had a great prophetic moment.
He cited the Moore's Law trends as grounds for granting the first five years
of the 1990s to Bill Gates. &quot;It's pretty much determined,&quot; he
said. Indeed, in the late 1980s, Joy had personally made a separate peace
with Microsoft by selling a large portion of his Sun holdings and buying
Microsoft shares, thus becoming the second richest of Sun's four founders.
(The richest, Andy Bechtolsheim, jumped even deeper into Microsoft.) But
then, around 1995, predicted Joy, everything would change. There would be
a &quot;break-through that we cannot imagine today.&quot; He even acknowledged
that the breakthrough would not come from Sun, but &quot;from people and
companies we cannot know today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to software innovation, he said, was smart programmers. Smart programmers
are hundreds of times more productive than ordinary programmers. And &quot;let's
be truthful,&quot; said the sage of Sun, propounding what has become known
as Joy's Law, &quot;most of the bright people don't work for you--no matter
who you are. You need a strategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere.&quot;
To the Justice Department, Microsoft's overwhelming OS market share and
its teeming armies of programmers seem a barrier to entry for other software
competitors. To Joy, Microsoft's size and dominance could become a barrier
to entry for Microsoft, blocking it from the key new markets of the late
1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is now clear that Joy was on target. The breakthrough is here in force,
invading and occupying all the commanding heights of the information economy,
from the media to the universities. It is the World Wide Web and its powerful
browsers, servers, languages and programming tools. Software on individual
machines still bogs down in the macrocosmic swamps of complexity. But in
the telecosm, yields rise exponentially almost without limit in proportion
to the number and power of the machines on the network. No matter how much
memory and other storage is created on the desktop, no matter what information
resources are assembled on CD-ROMs, no matter how powerful are the database
tools created for the LAN, the desktop imperium will pale and wither before
the telecosmic amplitudes of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, the number of machines on the network has been
rising between five and 10 times faster than the number of transistors on
a chip. With 1,300 miles of fiber-optic lines being laid every day in the
U.S., band-width is sure to rise even faster than the number of networked
computers (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The Bankwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December
5, 1994). This awesome transition presents a supreme chance for new leadership
in developing software focused less on wasting transistors than on wasting
bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A computer on every desktop and in every home? Information at your fingertips?
SQL Server 6.0? My son Richard yawns. Let's face it, Bill, that stuff is
yesterday. In the new era, Microsoft cant continue to feed on the microcosm.
But the leading-edge companies will move to the frontiers of the telecosm,
where collectively they will grow far faster than Microsoft. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, open the envelope. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's find a new Bill Gates. Start by adding 100 pounds of extra heft, half
a foot of height and two further years of schooling, then make him $12.9
billion hungrier. Give him a gargantuan appetite for pizza and Oreos, Bach,
newsprint, algorithms, ideas, John Barth, Nabokov, images, Unix code, bandwidth.
Give him a nearly unspellable Scandinavian name--Marc Andreessen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Put him to work for $6.85 per hour at Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) writing 3D visualization code on a Silicon Graphics
Indy for a Thinking Machine C-5 or a Cray YMP16. Surround him on all sides
by the most advanced computers and software in the world, under the leadership
of cybernetic visionary Larry Smarr. What will happen next? &quot;Boredom,&quot;
Andreessen replies. Supercomputers, already at the end of their tether,
turned out to be &quot;underwhelming Unix machines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then, for a further image of the end of the world, take him in the fall
of 1990 off to Austin, Tex., for two semesters at IBM. &quot;They were going
to take over the 3D graphics market, they were going to win the Malcolm
Baldridge Award, they were going to blow Silicon Graphics [the regnant Silicon
Valley 3D workstation company] off the map, all in six months.&quot; Andreessen
began by doing performance analysis and moved on to work on the operating
system kernel. In mid-1991, after constant delays, the company was finally
ready to ship a world-beating 3D engine. But the new IBM machine turned
out to be four times slower at seven times the price of the equivalent Silicon
Graphics hardware that IBM had bundled a year and a half earlier with its
RS6000 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) workstation. Austin IBM
returned to the drawing board and Andreessen returned to Illinois to get
his degree. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In both commercial and academic settings, Andreessen thus had the good fortune
of working at the very heard of the old order of computing in its climactic
phase. As Andreessen saw it, little of long-term interest was going on at
either establishment. But both did command one huge and felicitous resource,
vastly underused, and that was the Internet. &quot;Designed for all the
wrong reasons--to link some 2,000 scientists to a tiny number of supercomputers,&quot;
it had exploded into a global ganglion thronged by millions of people and
machines. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many people saw the Internet as throbbing with hype and seething with problems--Clifford
Stoll's book, Silicon Snake Oil, catalogs many: the lack of security, substance,
reliability, bandwidth, easy access; the presence of porn, fraud, frivolity
and freaks guarantees, so he says, that no serious business can depend on
it for critical functions. But to Andreessen the problems of the Internet
are only the other side of its incredible virtues. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;By usual standards,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;the Internet was
far from perfect. But the Internet finds its own perfection--in the millions
of people that are able to use it and the hundreds of thousands who can
provide services for it.&quot; To Andreessen, all the problems signaled
that he was at the center of the sphere, gazing in wild surmise at &quot;a
giant hole in the middle of the world&quot;--the supreme opportunity of
the age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen saw that, for all its potential, there was a monstrous incongruity
at the heart of the Internet. Its access software was at least 10 years
behind. &quot;PC Windows had penetrated all the desktops, the Mac was a
huge success, and point-and-click interfaces had become part of everyday
life. But to use the Net you still had to understand Unix. You had to type
FTP [file transfer protocol] commands by hand and you had to be able to
do addressmapping in your head between IP addresses and host names and you
had to know where all the FTP archives were' you had to understand IRC [Internet
relay chat] protocols, you had to know how to use this particular news reader
and that particular Unix shell prompt, and you pretty much had to know Unix
itself to get anything done. And the current users had little interest in
making it easier. In fact, there was a definite element of not wanting to
make it easier, of actually wanting to keep the riffraff out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The almost miraculous key to opening up the Internet was the concept of
hypertext, invented by Theodor Holm Nelson, the famously fractious prophet
of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; network, and son of Celeste Holm, the actress.
A hypnotic speaker, with a gaunt countenance and flowing golden hair, Nelson
seems an Old Testament Jeremiah from Central Casting as he rails against
the flaws and foibles of current-day computing. Hypertext is simply text
embedded with pointers to other text, instantly and full available by a
point and click. For the source of the concept, Nelson quotes an essay by
Vannevar Bush written in 1945 and read to him by his father as a boy: &quot;The
human mind . . . operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it
snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of
the brain.&quot; Projecting this idea from a single human brain to a global
ganglion, Nelson sowed the conceptual seeds of the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen can explain both the power of hypertext and its slow emergence
in commercial products: &quot;Xanadu was just a tremendous idea. But hypertext
depends on the network. If the network is there, hypertext is incredibly
useful. It is the key mechanism. But if the network is not there, hypertext
does not give you any of the richness.&quot; Hence, Apple's HyperCard and
similar schemes failed to ignite. The link is not hyper if it is restricted
to your hard drive or CD-ROM. Connected to millions of computers around
the globe, it becomes exponentially hyper. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The other thing about hypertext,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;is that,
even on networks, traditionally it had been developed by theoreticians and
people very deep in the computer science community, and they tended to worry
very deeply about problems like, 'Well, what happens if the information
moves?'&quot; As Gates put it in 1992: &quot;The idea of locating things
that move by their properties and dealing with the security and efficiency
issues, including using replication to do this stuff well, is a very tough
problem. That's what Windows's Cairo is all about. Three or four Ph.D. theses
talk about this, but a commercial system has never done it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen brings the issue down to earth: &quot;You've got a pointer at
a piece of information on the network, but Joe, who's running that information,
moves it somewhere else. Computer scientists would take a look at the problem
and say, 'Oh, the system doesn't work.' On the Internet, we look at that
problem and say, 'Oh well, here's another 20,000 pointers that do work.'
And may be we can send e-mail to Joe and he'll put his information back.&quot;
In other words, you don't wait for Cairo or Xanadu to try to solve every
problem. You go with the fabulous flow of opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's idea led to what Gary Wolf, a contributing writer of Wired, calls
&quot;one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century&quot;--a universal
library, a global information index and a computerized royalty system. But
Nelson's quest for perfection led to a 20-year adventure in futility. &quot;The
opinion of the Xanadu people to this day is that the Web and the Internet
are much too simple. They don't solve the problems. For instance, the links
aren't fully bidirectional. You don't know exactly who's pointing to your
page, and there's two ways to look at that. The way that Ted Nelson looks
at it is 'That's bad!' The way I look at it is 'That's great!' All of a
sudden anyone can point to your page without permission. The Net can grow
at its own rate. You get the network effect, you get Metcalfe's Law, it
spirals completely out of control. Isn't that fantastic?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1988, Xanadu found funding from John Walker, the charismatic recluse,
taxpatriate in Switzerland, and founder of Autodesk, the desktop computer-aided
design (CAD) company. As Walker prophetically declared in 1988: &quot;In
1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal
of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product.
And by 1995, it will begin to change the world.&quot; All truer than Walker
could have imagined, but it would not happen, alas, at Autodesk. Haunted
by dreams of perfection and hobbled by hyperventilation at the helm, Xanadu
misted over. Autodesk sustained the effort until it was mercifully terminated
by the new CEO, Carol Bartz, in 1993 at the very moment that a real Xanadu,
deemed hopelessly imperfect and inadequate by Nelson, was about to burst
forth efflorescently on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demiurgic step came from Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, creating
the World Wide Web based on a universal hypertext function. He launched
initial HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) governing transport on the Web.
He developed URLs (uniform resource locators) as a common addressing system
that joined most of the existing Internet search and linkage technologies.
He conceived the HTML (hypertext markup language), a kind of PostScript
for the Web. He made the system ignore failures (Joe's moving data could
not crash your machine). Thus, invoking a browser (i.e., a hypertext reader),
the user could point and click to information anywhere on the Net, unconscious
of whether it was in the form of a file transfer, an e-mail, a Gopher search
or a news posting, or whether it was in the next room or in Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Berners-Lee addressed a basic problem of the Internet from the point of
view of an academic researcher. But the real opportunity was to open the
Internet to the world and the world to the Internet, and that would require
more than a facility for cruising through textual materials. After all,
the bulk of human bandwidth is in a person's eyes and ears. For absorbing
text, as Robert Lucky, author of Silicon Dreams, has pointed out, the speed
limit is only some 55 bits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To burst open the Internet would require reaching out to the riffraff who
travel through pictures and sounds at megahertz speeds. To critics of a
more vulgar Net, such as Stoll, more riffraff sending a callipygian naked-lady
bitmaps and voluminous digital ululations from the Grateful Dead and QuickTime
first-step baby videos traipsing down the lines and wriggling through the
routers would soon cause a gigantic crash. Even some of Andreessen's main
allies at the NCSA shared some of these fears. At CERN, Berners-Lee opposed
images and video on these grounds. The technologists all held a narrowband
view of the world, imagining bandwidth as an essentially scarce resource
to be carefully husbanded by responsible citizens of the cybersphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Tim Berners-Lee alone could not burst open the Internet pi&ntilde;ata
and give it to the world. As Richard Wiggins, author of Internet for Everyone:
A Guide for Users and Providers, observes, &quot;During 1992 and early 1993,
graphical Gopher clients for the Macintosh and Windows evolved, and it appeared
that Gopher would outstrip the fledgling Web.&quot; It was the ultimate
broadband booster, Marc Andreessen, working with NCSA colleague Eric Bina,
who ignited the Web rocket. One late December night in 1992 at the Espresso
Royale cafe in Champaign-Urbana, Andreessen looked his friend Eric Bina
in the eye and said: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every Gates has to have his Paul Allen (or Jobs, his Steve Wozniak). Andreessen's
is Bina--short and wiry where Andreessen is ursine, cautious where he is
cosmic, focused where he is expansive, apprehensive where he is evangelical,
bitwise where he is prodigal with bandwidth, ready to stay home and write
the code where Andreessen is moving on to conquer the globe. Wildly contrasting
but completely trusting and complementary, these two--in an inspired siege
of marathon code-wreaking between January and March 1993--made Mosaic happen.
A rich image-based program for accessing the World Wide Web and other parts
of the Internet, Mosaic requires no more knowledge of its internal mechanics
than is needed by the user of the steering wheel of a car. With a mere 9,000
lines of code (compared to Windows 95's 11 million lines, including 3 million
lines of MSN code), Mosaic would become the most rapidly propagated software
program ever written. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen could defy all the fears of an Internet image crash because he
lived in a world of bandwidth abundance and fiber galore. He fully grasped
the law of the telecosm. Every new host computer added to the Net would
not only use the Net; it would also be a new resource for it, providing
a new route for the bits and new room to store them. Every new flood of
megabyte bitmaps would make the Net more interesting, useful and attractive,
and increase the pressure for backbones running at gigabits per second and
above. The Internet must be adapted to people with eyes and ears. They won't
abuse it, he assured Bina without a smile. After all, he knew he would have
to rely on Bina for much of the graphics coding. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was right,&quot; Bina says now. &quot;People abused it horribly.
People would scan in a page of PostScript text in a bitmap, taking over
a megabyte to display a page that would take maybe 1,000 bytes of text.
But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands
of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information
on the Web, and millions of people use it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working night and day at the NCSA, wrangling over issues, arts and letters,
music and Unix code at the Espresso Royale down the street, the two programmers
achieved a rare synergy. &quot;We each did the job that most appealed to
us,&quot; says Bina, &quot;so each of us thinks the other did the hard stuff.&quot;
Bina wrote most of the new code--in particular, the graphics, modifying
HTML to handle images, adding a GIF (graphics interchange format) decoder,
incorporating color management tools. Andreessen took the existing library
of communications code from CERN and tore it apart and rewrote it so it
would run more quickly and efficiently on the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As time passed, they brought in other young programmers from the NCSA--among
them Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Chris Houck and Aleks Totic--to port
the system to Windows and Mac machines. With help from them, they designed
dynamic forms with type-in fields, check boxes, toggle buttons and other
ordered ways of entering simple text for searches and other functions, beyond
simple hypertext pointing at a URL. For example, a dynamic form is now used
by Pizza Hut for ordering a pizza on line. Finally, because every change
in the browser required complementary changes in the servers at CERN--where
the physicists tended to be busy and glitz-averse--Bina and Andreessen decided
to do their own servers. The NCSA's Rob McCool took charge of this crucial
project. I<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
n the end, they had created an entirely new interface for the Internet and
new communications software to render it crisply accessible--a look and
feel that almost immediately struck everyone who used it as an amazing breakthrough.
In February 1995, Bob Metcalfe wrote a column in InfoWorld predicting that
Web browsers would become, in effect, the dominant operating system for
the next era. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browsers are now ubiquitous. Every major company and many minor ones are
building them. Some eight million people use them. IBM, AT&amp;T, Novell,
Microsoft, NetCom, Sun, Silicon Graphics, America Online, Net-Manage, Quarterdeck,
Quadralay, Apple, SPRY-CompuServe, Frontier Technologies, Delphi, MCI, Wollongong,
even the Spyglass spinoff from the NCSA--you name it--all these companies
are building, licensing, enhancing or bundling a browser. Many of these
ventures, led by Quarterdeck's smart hotlists and &quot;drag-and-drop&quot;
ease of use, have outpaced Mosaic and prompted a leapfrogging contest of
can-you-top-this. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what happens when an entrepreneur performs a truly revolutionary
act, supplies the smallest missing factor, as Peter Drucker puts it, that
can transform a jumble of elements into a working system--the minimal mutation
that provokes a new paradigm. In 1977, the relevant jumble was small computers,
microprocessors and assembly language programming. Bill Gates and Paul Allen
supplied the key increment: software tools and the Basic language for the
embryonic personal computer. In 1993, Andreessen and Bina set out to supply
the minimal increment to convert the entire Net, with its then one to two
million linked computers (today it's an estimated seven million computers)
and immense information resources, into a domain as readily accessible to
an 11-year-old as a hard drive or CD-ROM on a Mac or Windows PC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the same forces of exploding bandwidth, the same laws of the
telecosm that are wreaking revolution in hardware, hollowing out the computer--rendering
the CPU peripheral and the network central--are also transforming software.
All forms of desktop software--operating systems, applications and utilities--are
becoming similarly peripheral. The ever-growing gigapedal resources of the
Internet will always dwarf any powers and functions that can be distilled
on a desktop or mobilized on the backplane of a supercomputer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, for example, four researchers at MIT, Iowa State, Bellcore and
Oxford (U.K.) triumphantly claimed a $100 reward for solving a grand challenge
problem. They announced that they had broken an RSA encryption code of 129
digits that one of RSA's inventors, R.L. Rivest, when offering the $100
prize in 1977, calculated would take four quadrillion years for a supercomputer
to crack. They did not accomplish their feat on a single machine (none yet
exists that can perform these computations) but on a virtual machine consisting
of 1,600 mostly modest workstations scattered around the Internet. Similarly,
Gordon Bell in 1992 for the first time granted his achievement award for
price and performance in the application of supercomputers, not to a single
machine, but to a distributed Internet virtual system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Internet model even in these high-powered processing
applications portends and symbolizes a definitive reality, which gathers
increasing force as network bandwidth begins to exceed the internal bandwidth
on computer backplanes. From now on, the relevant computer is the network
and the ascendant software is Internet software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving the program away on the Net, Andreessen released Mosaic in binary
form, already compiled for any popular computer platform, and helped bring
more than a million newcomers to the Web in six months. In that time, such
an upheaval would even reach the notice of the management of the NCSA. At
the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C., a friend eagerly showed
Mosaic to Larry Smarr, who was visiting from Illinois. He was startled to
see that this new marvel was a creation of his own shop at the NCSA. Perhaps
he should look into it. Perhaps there was more to sell to Washington than
Fiber Channels between scientists and Crays. From that moment on, pushing
Mosaic became the chief &quot;grand challenge problem&quot; of the University
of Illinois Supercomputing Center. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After Andreessen's college graduation in December 1993, Joseph Hardin, head
of the NCSA, asked him to stay on at the center. But he added one condition,
namely, that the young programmer leave the Mosaic project. &quot;Some 40
people had a role in creating Mosaic,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't you think
it's time to give someone else a chance to share the glory?&quot; Reasoning
that they would have a still better chance in his absence, Andreessen left
for Silicon Valley. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After a few months doing Internet security functions at a company called
EIT, Andreessen attracted the attention of the legendary Jim Clark, founder
of Silicon Graphics Inc. and inventor of the Geometry Engine, capable of
3D graphics, that impelled SGI's growth. At loose ends, like most of the
industry's venturers, Clark was looking for opportunity in all the wrong
places--3D games, interactive TV, Hollywood. He found himself increasingly
entranced with the Mosaic browser. Hearing that the author of Mosaic had
arrived in Silicon Valley, he sent Andreessen an e-mail in early February
1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rest is history, in the accelerated from familiar in the Valley. Jim
Clark met with Andreessen and signed him up as the first employee of a new
company. &quot;What has happened to the other NCSA programmers?&quot; he
wanted to know. Hearing that Chris Wilson, who had helped port the system
to the PC, had left the center to join SPRY, Clark decided to act fast.
He invited Bina to come to Silicon Valley and meet with him on his yacht.
Avoiding temptation (Bina's wife was a tenured professor of database technology
at Champaign-Urbana and is wary of snake oil), Bina spurned the invitation.
Andreessen wrote him a glum e-mail: &quot;Sorry. It would have been nice
to have had you here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing Bina knew, Andreessen called him to announce that he and
Clark were flying to Champaign-Urbana and wanted to meet with Bina and the
rest of the key programmers the next day at the local University Inn. &quot;When
I got off the elevator at the hotel,&quot; Bina recalls, &quot;this blond
guy who reminded me of my dad stepped back, looked me slowly up and down,
and spoke: 'Marc said you could walk on water. I have never seen anyone
who could do that before.'&quot; Clark soon assured him he could stay in
Illinois. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to Bina, Clark spread a contagion of entrepreneurial excitement.
Then one by one he made seven of them offers. All signed up. By the first
week of April, Mosaic software was on the way and Jim Clark forgot about
interactive TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Greeting this bold new company, however, were rumblings about a possible
intellectual property suit from the NCSA. This surprise banished any idea
of using Mosaic in any form. That was fine with them. They knew Mosaic was
a quickly written hack designed for T1 and T3 lines running at up to 45
megabits a second at the NCSA. &quot;We knew that everyone had Mosaic,&quot;
says Bina. &quot;We were glad to start from scratch again.&quot; Moving
into a small office in Mountain View at a cost of less than $1 per square
foot, they set to work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the new company, then called Mosaic Communications, Andreessen ascended
to management. Bina, working in Illinois for all but one frenzied week a
month, immersed himself in creating the new code. They revised it to work
over a 14.4 modem. They focused on making it the only system that is fully
secure. They added new supports for more elegant layouts and richer documents.
Giving the program away on the Net, within a few months Netscape won 70%
of the Web browser market, which it still holds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important for the future of the company, they developed a stream of
new server products, which they sold to most of the existing and aspiring
on-line services and Internet service providers, from internetMCI and marketplaceMCI
to IBM's Prodigy and Murdoch's Delphi. Altogether, they had released a total
of 11 new products by midsummer of this year, from $50,000 secure server
applications to the $39 Netscape Navigator Personal Edition complete with
TCP/IP stack for full connection to the Internet in 10 minutes anywhere
in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street began pouring money on any rival company with an Internet
Product, the stock market became a Netscape imperative. This posed a problem
from Clark. There would be no difficulty attracting a frenzy of interest.
The question was, Where would they hide Andreessen during the road show?
Introducing him to John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and
other Silicon Valley clout, however, Clark instead resolved to teach the
young bear how to chew with his mouth closed, tie a tie and get to work
earlier than 8:30 . . . p.m. Then he prepared to place him in the nose cone
of an Initial Public Orbiting that would value the gang at hundreds of millions
of dollars, point Andreessen towards the Millenium and, with luck and the
right characterological chemistry, have a new Bill Gates for the late 1990s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is, well after 8 p.m., roaring down El Camino Real in his '94 red
Mustang, filled with pizza rinds, empty cans of Sprite, a mostly shredded
copy of the San Jose Mercury News and a bulging issue of MicroTimes smeared
in popcorn butter, talking with both hands to a writer from Forbes ASAP
hunched amid the clutter and stealthily searching for a seat belt. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly free of the NIH (not invented here) syndrome afflicting many of
his elders--his browser combines products from some 17 sources--Andreessen
was discoursing on the virtues of Java, a language he says portends a telecosmic
advance even more profound and enduring than the browser and related servers
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For creating innovative stuff on the Web, Andreessen explains, &quot;The
alternative languages are grim, Perl is limited to text strings. Telescript
from General Magic doesn't pass because it's proprietary. Tickle [Tcl] lacks
power and features. Scheme and LISP are dead. Visual Basic lacks expressiveness
and it is too much controlled by Microsoft. Dylan is still an Apple research
project. None of them are truly suited to the Web environment. Java is as
revolutionary as the Web itself.&quot; Tying Netscape to Java assures the
company a central role in a coming efflorescence of the Web more significant
in its implications than even the current manifestation. In the process,
it will invert the entire world of software in a way that may permanently
displace Microsoft from the center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Behind this development is not some 24-year-old geek from a supercomputer
center, but the industry's most venerable leader after Bill Gates, not only
Microsoft's most persistent critic and nemesis, but also its most eminent
defeated rival: Bill Joy of Sun. In engineering Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
streamlining the communications functions and putting it all on the Net,
Andreessen was following in the codesteps of Joy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy was not only a founder of Sun Microsystems, he was also the primary
champion of the Berkeley brand of Unix--BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
Unix--that he husbanded as a student at the university. BSD Unix was not
only Sun's essential software technology, but also the reference code for
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the basic protocol
stack of the Arpanet in its evolution toward the current Internet). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By upgrading the TCP/IP protocol to run on an ethernet rather than on only
50-kilobit-per-second Arpanet lines and then giving away the Code, Bill
Joy made the Internet possible. When Sun declared in 1988 that the network
is the computer, the network it had in mind was run by Bill Joy's Network
File System (NFS), and it incorporated TCP/IP. Says Eric Schmidt--Bill Joy's
Berkeley colleague, now chief technical officer at Sun and leading prophet
of the coming software inversion--&quot;Sun was selling the Internet before
the Internet was there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, because Sun computers running BSD Unix were the most robust vessels
for TCP/IP, the lion's share of all host computers on the Web are still
Sun's, and Sun is experiencing an unexpected surge of earnings in the wake
of the Web. Now the computer world is wielding Marc Andreessen's browser
to rush toward the Net, wrenching the sphere from its moorings in Redmond,
and allowing it to oscillate toward a new center in Silicon Valley. Even
Bill Gates, the last holdout against Joy's network standard, is now bundling
TCP/IP with Windows 95. Joy must feel that the industry is coming home at
last. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Gates ignited the person computer market by writing Basic for the
PC, Joy is launching a new era on the Net by supplying a suitable software
language, Java. Joy foreshadowed Java at the 1990 PC Forum conference when
he said, &quot;Large programs are embarrassing because they have a fixed
set of ideas and so much code that it's very difficult to change them. And
they all tend to reflect existing metaphors, not the new metaphors. Everybody's
using C++. That's a 'crufty' language. It's very hard to understand. &quot;I'm
starting a small group to try to do something small--Sun Aspen Smallworks.
I believe it's possible to do small systems of a few hundred thousand lines
of code that live in this world of persistent distributed objects with open
protocols [and] make an incredible difference--much more than an extra 100,000
lines on a 10-million-line system. So I'm looking for a few great hackers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The one he found was redoubtable Sun engineer James Gosling. Called by John
Doerr of Kleiner Perkins &quot;perhaps the world's greatest living programmer,&quot;
Gosling is a bearded man with shaggy blondish hair. He displays a subtly
wounded look that is possibly the effect of a career that, to that point,
had consisted mostly of brilliant failures. But, like Joy, Gosling was eager
to do something small to bring Sun into the world of consumer electronics
where a large program used no more than a few thousand lines. In 1992, the
company spun out a subsidiary named FirstPerson Inc. to pursue this market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to conceive a way to take news, images, animations and other
real-time functions in cell sites and base stations and download them to
handheld devices such as digital cellular phones. But with the Newton fiasco,
personal digital assistants began to fall from favor and Sun and the rest
of the lemmings decided to pursue the suddenly seductive siren of interactive
TV. Again, they would use the Java (at the time called &quot;Oak&quot;)
programming language, this time running not on cellular phones, but in set-top
boxes. Here, too, the programs would have to be elegant and compact to use
the sparse memories affordable for a consumer appliance. However, Like Jim
Clark--and everyone else--Sun would soon discover that interactivity merely
offers cosmetics for the corpse of a dying television industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At this point, the project was in turmoil and former Apple designer Wayne
Rosing, its first manager, was on his way out. In May of last year, Sun
technical chief Eric Schmidt entered the breach, collapsed the set-top project
into a joint venture with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had bought
RCA, and summoned Joy from Aspen. Joy returned and spent the entire summer
last year in Palo Alto working with Schmidt and Gosling to figure out a
strategy for Java. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the characteristics
of a language suitable for PDAs not only gratified Joy's Laws of software,
but also fit almost perfectly the needs of the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like many technology projects that seem to spring full-blown from the brow
of a genius, Java is in fact the fruit of a near-lifelong quest. Gosling's
career began at age 14 in Calgary when, during a high school tour, he memorized
the code to the locks on the doors of the computer center at the University
of Calgary. He then regularly admitted himself to read computer texts and
use DEC PDP-8s. He became so proficient that he was hired a year later by
Digital Equipment to write machine code to be used for analyses of data
on the aurora borealis from Isis satellites. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on to Carnegie Mellon University to study under the eminent Robert
Sproull and Raj Reddy, he wrote a text editor called EMACS, a Pascal compiler
and a thesis entailing the creation of a program to do drawings of levers
and strings in visual, interactive models. After graduation in 1981, he
joined an IBM lab in Pittsburgh, where he developed the Andrew Windows system.
The first major program that could control a window on a computer remotely
across a network, it never found a home. But it launched Gosling on a 15-year
struggle with the challenge of how to send programs across a network that
could be executed on other computers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling had a breakthrough in 1983 at a Sun Microsystems conference at the
Red Lion in San Jose. There, Joy observed Gosling's Andrew Windows system
dramatically outperforming a workstation running Sun View, and began a concerted
effort to recruit him. Soon after, Gosling came to Sun to develop a remote
windows system called NeWS (Networked Extensible Windows System). Initially
received with great critical acclaim in the industry, it was eventually
blocked by the X-Windows consortium despite performing far more efficiently
over a network. Long a student of object-oriented programming beginning
with the Simula language, Gosling followed his NeWS project with a compound
doc<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ument architecture, joining text and images. It, too, garnered much praise
and paltry use. Then came Sun's ill-fated pursuit of consumer electronic
products. Gosling set out to develop appropriate programs in C++. But it
soon became clear to him that this language failed on nearly all the crucial
criteria. In particular it was neither reliable nor secure, which, funnily
enough, turned out to be two sides of the same coin. &quot;The gun you shoot
the burglar with can also shoot you in the foot.&quot; That was C++. It
had pointer code that allowed rogue programs to invade and corrupt a target
operating system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Gosling began revising C++ code into something that has been termed &quot;C++
minus minus.&quot; Returning to the inspiration of Andrew and NeWS, he adapted
the language to enable real-time operations across a network. In order to
run a variety of different programs on a variety of linked devices, from
set-top boxes to palmtop remotes, he made it inherently platform-neutral
and nomadic. It would have to be a language at home on a network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The project ended with Java, an efficient programming language that is safe,
simple, reliable and real-time, yet familiar to anyone who has used C or
C++. Designed for PDAs on infrared networks, it turned out to be perfectly
adapted for the Internet. Many of Java's virtues are made possible by the
fact that it is interpreted rather than compiled--that means that it is
translated line by line in real time in the user's computer rather than
converted to machine language in batch mode by the software vendor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most languages are written in two stages. The first is source code, couched
at a level of abstraction that rarely reveals its purposes or algorithmic
procedures. Normally, source code is proprietary and not revealed to the
user. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second stage is compilation. The compiler translates the abstractions
of the source code into &quot;binaries&quot;--the machine language of a
particular computer, locked into the set of instructions that its central
processing unit can perform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java, by contrast, is compiled not to an instruction set peculiar to a particular
microprocessor but to a virtual machine or generic computer. Putting the
language into an intermediate binary form allows creation of programs that
are not locked into any particular hardware platform, but that can still
be adapted to run fast. The intermediate code is translated line by line
by a software program called an interpreter located in the target computer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java's interpreters take up a parsimonious 45 kilobytes of memory. Sun already
has Java interpreters in the works for Microsoft Windows 95, the Mac, Windows
MT and several flavors of Unix. Netscape will include the appropriate interpreter
in future versions of the Netscape browser. This means that any program
written in Java will be portable to any common computer platform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, this portability does not seem remarkable. All programs
written in C, C++ or other compiled languages can be ported to any target
platform simply by running the source code through the appropriate compiler,
just as Mosaic was compiled for various platforms at the NCSA. The difference
is that Java can be &quot;compiled&quot; line by line in real time. That
is, it is interpreted in byte-level code in the client machine. This makes
all the difference. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It means that programs no longer have to reside in the machine where they
are used, or be written for that machine in order to be executed by it.
Potentially, a Java program can reside anywhere on the entire Internet and
be executed by any computer attached to the Internet. The little interpreters--sure
to become cheap and ubiquitous as they are distributed by Netscape and by
other suppliers of browsers--make Java programs &quot;dynamically portable&quot;
in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamically portable programs are suitable for a nomadic existence on the
Net, rather than a mere settled life on the desktop. Java thus emancipates
software from computer architecture. It offers a software paradigm radically
different from the Microsoft model, which is based not only on static compilation,
but on often-concealed, proprietary source code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the entire world of new software is potentially available to every
computer owner. Rather than being restricted to the set of programs you
own, you can use any program on the Net, just as now you can tap any information
on the Net. You not only have data at your fingertips, you have programs
at your fingertips. This means &quot;executable content,&quot; as Joy describes
it and as John Gage demonstrated in his speech at the West St. Francis Hotel
this June. Whether a film, a graph, an animation, a real-time bit stream
on the Nasdaq ticker or the Reuters wire, a virtual reality visualization,
or a game, it can be downloaded to your machine with its program in tow.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Owning the operating system and associated tool libraries becomes irrelevant
to selling applications. Owning the application or channel becomes irrelevant
to selling the content. To the extent that Java or a similar language prevails,
software becomes truly open for the first time. The Microsoft desktop becomes
a commodity; the Intel microprocessor becomes peripheral--the key &quot;microprocessor&quot;
is the software code in the Java interpreter. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Interpreted or not, however, nomadic programs will not be permitted to range
the Net unless they are also secure programs. By several judicious alterations
of C++ procedures, Gosling made Java above all a secure language. Many viruses
depend on taking an integer in the program and using it to &quot;point&quot;
to a low address in the memory where operating code resides. Java removes
this pointer conversion function. In addition, incorporated into the Java
interpreter is a code verifier. As soon as an application shows up in a
machine, the interpreter does an instant virus scan. Finally, when Java
binary arrives at a machine, it will bear an RSA data signature that verifies
the source of the code and guarantees that it has not been altered or corrupted.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These security provisions make Java programs the first certifiable citizens
of the Net. As Java interpreters become ubiquitous, any application program
that is anchored on a particular platform and desktop will eventually become
a cripple, like a pro athlete who fears to fly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The computer hollows out, and you no longer are concerned with its idiosyncrasies,
its operating system, its instruction set, even its resident applications.
Instead, you can focus on content--on the world rather than on the desktop
architecture. If you want to run a helicopter model on your screen, you
don't have to worry about whether you have AutoCAD on your hard drive. You
can run a video of the helicopter without owning the right decoder, whether
Indeo (Intel's standard) or MPEG-4 (designed for portable appliances) or
dynamic JPEG. The helicopter flies over the Net with its own executable
code. The network is no longer a threatening place. If you want to use a
program from Finland, you don't have to worry that it will introduce a malignant
virus to your machine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your computer will never be the same. No longer will the features of the
desktop decide the features of the machine. No longer will the size of your
hard drive or the database in your LAN server determine the reach of your
information processing. No longer will the programs in your machine determine
the functions you can perform. The network is the computer. The computer
becomes a peripheral to the Internet and the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the release of Java and a demonstration Web browser called HotJava,
written in the language on the Sun home page, Gosling has experienced the
kind of sudden Internet celebrity undergone by Andreessen and Bina. Unlike
Andreessen, he seems somewhat baffled by it all. But in the long run, his
contribution may be greater. Browsers and servers may come and go, but successful
new languages are extremely rare. Java, or something like it, is the key
to a truly interactive Internet and a fully hollowed-out computer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Bill Joy made a presentation to the Sun board, outlining an upgrade
path for the future of the language. Joy is resolved that Java will not
go the way of Andrew and NeWS. Like Jim Clark, he has even turned to the
troubled supercomputer arena to find a treasure trove of new hackers. Sun
hired some 20 new programmers from the recently defunct but boldly pioneering
Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research. Presumably, they can learn
to think small. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling shakes his head at all the uproar. He now finds himself falling
thousands of messages behind in his e-mail. Linked to the Net by a mere
T1 line, even Sun's Java server broke down under the overload. But Gosling
himself seems to be holding up better. His speaking schedule has multiplied
to a rate of three talks a week. Scores of people tell him they are using
the language as a replacement for C, for IR (information resource) tools
and for other general-purpose applications. Giant Japanese companies such
as Sony and Sega besiege him. Finally, late in June, even Berners-Lee gave
Java his imprimature as &quot;one of the most exciting things happening
on the Web right now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A movie buff, Gosling sees Java, Netscape and similar programs changing
the image of the cypersphere from an alien and menacing dystopia, as depicted
famously in Blade Runner, into a realm resembling Star Trek, where computers
are trusted tools. Perhaps this transformation will favor the emergence
of the amiable and gregarious young Marc Andreessen as the paladin of cyberspace,
replacing the fiercely brilliant but widely feared Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Andreessen admits, a more likely outcome is a massive move by Microsoft
onto the Net where the two will enter battle with scores of contenders.
This month, Microsoft announced an array of Internet services, under the
rubric Blackbird, with many interesting features. But it works only with
Microsoft Network Services, which will not become truly widespread for another
year. Beginning with virtually no market share and a year or so behind,
Gates will become an under dog at last. Perhaps even the Justice Department
will notice. In the age of the hollowed-out computer, the king of the desktop
rules an emigrating empire. <BR>

<P>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska wants to know: With deregulation of telecommunications,
who will bring connections to Unalakleet, to Aleknagik and to Sleetmute?
Who will bring 500 channels up the Yukon with the salmon to the people in
Beaver? What will happen to the Yupik, the Inupiat and the Inuit? Will we
leave them stranded in the snow while the world zooms off to new riches
on an information superhighway?<BR>
<BR>
A senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Stevens is a key figure in the telecom deregulation debate on Capitol Hill.
As he contemplates the issues of restructuring communications law, he has
reason to be suspicious of the grand claims of an information age. He knows
that universal service--the magic of available dial tone in your own home--has
hardly reached rural Alaska at all. As George Calhoun points out in his
sort invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881 and now extended to some
95% of American households) are simply not feasible, either technically
or economically, in many remote regions.<BR>
<BR>
In Beaver, for example, there is one telephone in a hut linked to a nine-foot
satellite dish. Permafrost and cold economic reality make it impossible
to extend dial tone to the several hundred households of this town, even
though its average household income, mostly from salmon fishing, is some
$120,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ted Stevens is right to be concerned. Portentiously sharing his concern
are other powerful Republicans from rural states, including Larry Pressler
of South Dakota, the chairman of the subcommittee. Extended now from phone
service to broadband digital superhighways, their concerns could pose a
deadly obstacle to true deregulation of communications and thus to continued
American leadership in these central technologies of the age. At stake is
some $2 trillion of potential value to the U.S. economy (see Forbes ASAP,
April 10). The problems of universal service in Alaska disguise the more
profound paradox of telephone service in most of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the universality of telephones is crucial to their usefulness;
yet universal service using current technology is totally uneconomical and
impractical. Snow and ice are the least of it. The basic problem is the
architecture of the system, with a separate pair of lines, on average two
miles long, devoted exclusively to each user. It simply does not pay to
lay, entrench, string, protect, test and maintain miles of copper wire pairs,
each dedicated to one household that uses them on average some 15 or 20
minutes a day.<BR>
<BR>
Connections in cities are one thing. Urban access systems comprise a bramble
of millions of wire loops, each linking a home or business telephone to
a nearby central office switch. Under a half mile in length, these lines
still represent some 80% of the cost of the system. But because the lines
are short and often bundled together, city telephony benefits from economies
of scale and convenience. In rural areas, however, the copper lines cost
between 10 and 30 times as much per customer as they do in cities.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Calhoun reports that in general, phone companies cannot supply
ISDN (integrated services digital network) and other digital services over
twisted-pair wire more than 18,000 feet (some 3.5 miles) from the central
office. Perhaps a third of all the nation's phones are more than 3.5 miles
from a central office.<BR>
<BR>
What saves us is socialism. Closing the huge differential between the costs
of serving rural and urban customers is a Byzantine web of cross-subsidies,
whereby inner-city and business callers in urban areas subsidize the worthy
citizens of Kirby, Vt.; Vail, Colo.; Mendocino, Calif.; Round Rock, Texas,
and Tyringham, Mass., among other bucolic locales, to the tune of billions
of dollars. Overall, subsidies from business and urban customers to rural
and other expensive residential users total some $20 billion a year. In
case the cross-subsidies do not suffice to guarantee universality, Congress
has established a $700 million &quot;Universal Service Fund.&quot; For all
that, some 5% of homes still lack telephone service (compared with 2% unreached
by TV, which faces no universal service requirement).<BR>
<BR>
Lending huge physical authority to this Sisyphean socialist scheme are some
65,049,600 tons of copper wire rooted deep in the rights of way, depreciation
schedules, balance sheets, mental processes and corporate cultures of the
regional Bell operating companies and other so-called local-exchange carriers.
The minimum replacement cost of these lines deployed over the last 50 years
or more--and still being installed through the mid-1990s at a rate of at
least five million lines a year--is some $300 billion. By comparison, Calhoun
estimates, the telcos could replace every telephone switch for one-tenth
that amount while radically upgrading the system.<BR>
<BR>
In this cage of twisted copper wires writhe not only the executives of the
telephone companies, but also the addled armies of telecommunications regulators,
from the Federal Communications Commission and other Washington bodies to
50 state public utilities commissions and the towering hives of lawyers
in the communications bar. The coils of copper also subtly penetrate the
thought processes of MIT Media Lab gurus, libertarian lobbyists from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and myriad political analysts who see this
massive metal millstone as a fell weapon of monopoly power. The copper colossus
even intimidates scores of staunch Republicans who have arrived in Washington
determined to extirpate every government excess, but who bow before the
totem of universal service in their districts.<BR>
<BR>
Like any socialist system, the copper colossus will die hard. But die it
must.<BR>
<BR>
Some 20 years ago, AT&amp;T's long-distance lines comprised a similarly
imperious cage of copper wires, installed over the previous 50 years and
similarly impossible for rivals to duplicate. Then too, analysts termed
telephony a natural monopoly because the system could handle additional
calls for essentially zero incremental cost and because network externalities
ensured that the larger the number of customers, the more valuable the system.
These assumptions had led to government endorsement of the Bell monopoly
as a common carrier committed to universal service.<BR>
<BR>
Regulators, politicians and litigators always imagine that they can control
the future of telecom, awarding monopoly privileges in exchange for various
high-minded goals, such as universal or enriched services. But their actual
role, as Peter Huber and his associates show in their new text, Federal
Broadband Law, is mostly to promote monopoly at the expense of such values
as universality, which ultimately depend not on law but on innovation. As
a form of tax, regulations reduce the supply of the taxed output. It is
technological and entrepreneurial progress, impelled by low tax rates and
deregulation, that brings once- rare products into the reach of the poor,
always the world's largest untapped market.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, the decline and fall of the long-distance monopoly was not
chiefly an effect of politics or litigation but of technology. Effectively
dissolving the copper cage of long distance were the millimeter waves of
microwave radio. Over the years, it turned out you could set up microwave
towers anywhere and duplicate long-distance services at radically lower
cost without installing any new wires at all. But this realization came
woefully slowly to the regulators.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;above-890-megahertz&quot; decision of 1959, made possible by
new Klystron tubes and other devices that opened up higher frequencies to
communications, the FCC permitted creation of private microwave networks.
On the surface, it was a narrow decision affecting a few large corporations.
But as AT&T planners noted at the time, it represented a clear break from
the previous principles of common carriage, cross-subsidy and nationwide
price averaging in the telephone network.<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, over the next two decades a cascade of further decisions climaxed
with the authorization of MCI to emerge as a direct competitor to AT&amp;T.
Within less than a decade, MCI added to its panoply of aerial microwaves
the yet more advanced technology of single-mode glass fibers. Issuing some
$3 billion of junk bonds over a four-year period, MCI built the first nationwide
network of advanced fiber optics. GTE made comparable investments in Sprint,
and AT&T rushed to excel its new rivals. Combining microwave with fiber,
long-distance telephony became a technologically aggressive and openly competitive
arena; AT&amp;T's monopoly was a thing of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the remaining monopolies in local phone service face a threat from
radio technology still more devastating than the microwave threat to AT&T in
long distance. As with microwaves, the government--in the name of preventing
monopoly--dallied for decades before acting to allow elimination of the
monopolies it had earlier established. After the invention of cellular at
Bell Labs in 1947, some 34 years passed before the FCC finally began granting
licenses for cellular telephony. By the 1980s, the FCC and Judge Harold
Greene, managing the Modified Final Judgment breaking up AT&amp;T, permitted
limited competition in wireless telephony. However, the FCC allocated half
the metropolitan licenses to existing RBOCs, which had no interest in using
wireless to attack the local loop monopoly. The other licenses it assigned
by lottery to gamblers and financiers with no ability to create an alternative
local loop. The process of buying out the spectrum speculators required
leading wireless carriers to hobble themselves with huge amounts of junk-bond
debt. Although McCaw Cellular Communications created a robust national system,
its financial structure prevented aggressive price competition with wireline
service.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the idea persists that wireless telephony is an expensive supplement
to the existing copper colossus rather than a deadly rival of it. The installed
base of twisted-pair wire still appears to many to be a barrier to entry
for new competitors in the local loop, rather than a barrier to RBOC entry
into modern communications markets. The conventional wisdom sees the electromagnetic
spectrum as a scarce resource. Few believe that it will soon emerge as a
cheaper and better alternative to the local loop, in the same way that microwave
emerged as a cheaper and better substitute for copper long-distance wires.

Making Waves</B></PRE>
At the foundation of the information economy, from computers to telephony,
is the microcosm of semiconductor electronics. It reaches out in a fractal
filigree of wires and switches that repeat their network patterns at every
level from the half-adder in a calculator chip or the SLIC in a telephone
handset to the coaxial trees and branches of a cable TV system or the mazes
of switched and routed lines in the global Internet. In computers, engineers
lay out the wires and switches across the tiny silicon substrates of microchips.
In telecommunications, engineers lay out the wires and switches across the
mostly silicon substrates of continents and seabeds. But it is essentially
the same technology, governed by quantum science and electrical circuit
theory.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor engineers may still spend more of their time with circuit
theory, contemplating the operations of resistors, inductors and capacitors
on currents and voltages in the device. But quantum theory is most fundamental,
because it allows humans for the first time to manipulate matter from the
inside--to control the conduction bands and energy-band gaps of the internal
atomic structure of silicon and other elements, and to make electrons, holes
and photons leap and lase at the behest of the designer. It is quantum theory
that allows chip engineers to control with exquisite precision, gauged in
tenths of microns and trillionths of seconds, the movements of electrons
at the heart of electronics.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of quantum theory, however, is a perplexing duality. Most of
contemporary physics seems to deal with particles--electrons, quarks, leptons,
neutrons, protons. In 1994, for example, scientists at Fermilabs in Chicago
announced &quot;discovery&quot; of the &quot;top quark,&quot; which they
described as the &quot;last building block of matter.&quot; Yet these entities
manifest themselves only in the midst of explosions in which their wave
signatures can be identified. So-called quantum particle theory is unintelligible
without quantum wave theory.<BR>
<BR>
The elements of quantum physics intrinsically combine the characteristics
of particles--definite specks of mass--with the characteristics of waves--
an infinite radiance of fields and forces. Entirely unlike particles, waves
merge, mingle and mesh in vectors and tensors propagating boundlessly through
space.<BR>
<BR>
It is this paradoxical combination of the definite with the infinite that
gives the microcosm its promise as a medium, not only for computation in
one place, but for communications everywhere. Spectrum unfolds in a global
ethersphere of interpenetrating waves that reach in a self- similar fractal
pattern from the plasmas of semi-conductor lasers through the ethers of
the planet.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the telecosm of modern communications brings decisively to the fore
the wave side of the quantum duality. Wires may seem more solid and reliable
than air. But the distinction is largely spurious. In proportion to the
size of its nucleus, an atom in a copper wire is as empty as the solar system
is in proportion to the size of the sun. The atmosphere and wires are alternative
media, and to the electron or photon are only arbitrarily distinguishable.
Whether insulated by air or by plastic, both offer resistance, capacitance,
inductance, noise and interference. In thinking about communications, the
concept of solidity is mostly a distraction. The essence of new devices
emerges more and more as manifestations of waves.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in the air or in a wire, the electrons or photons do not travel;
they wiggle their charges, causing oscillations that pass through the medium
at close to the speed of light. As in waves of water, the wave moves, but
the molecules of water stay in the same place. Thus belied is the analogy
of particles or even bullets favored by physics teachers who give primacy
to the mass rather than to the wave. Since the age of carrier pigeons and
catapults, communications systems have transmitted masses only in the postal
services.<BR>
<BR>
Today, even in entirely stationary electronic systems, the wave action is
increasingly dominant. The microchip itself--a Pentium processor, say--now
runs at 120 megahertz, a rate in cycles per second that puts it in the middle
of the FM radio band. New computers must pass the FCC requirements for radio
emissions. Texas Instruments now advertises its 486 SXL-66 microprocessors
as selling for under 50 cents per megahertz. Increasingly in the world of
computers, people speak of bandwidth and cycles, reserving the discussion
of mass chiefly for the batteries. The world of the telecosm is subtly shifting
from electronics, with its implicit primacy of electrons, to what might
be termed spectronics, seeing the particle as an expression of the wave
rather than the other way around--moving from Bohr's atom and Heisenberg's
electronic uncertainty to Maxwell's rainbow and Schrodinger's wave equation.<BR>
<BR>
In a global marketplace increasingly unified by telecommunications at the
speed of light, the vision of waves as fundamental affords not only a better
image of physics, but also a better purchase on economic reality than a
spurious search for solid states, physical resources, national economies
and commodity products.<BR>
<BR>
Conceived as some irreducible essence, the particle of mass, whether in
the form of a top quark or Higgs boson, wire conduit or central switch,
pushes our thinking about the world toward a vision of ultimately discrete
and confinable entities, with electrons moving through the p-n junctions
of microchips like so many steel ingots crossing a national border. Conceived,
by contrast, as a continuous span of waves and frequencies, tossing and
cresting, reflecting, diffusing, superposing and interfering, the telecosmic
vision accords with the ever-rising global commerce in information services--ubiquitous,
simultaneous, convergent, emergent.<BR>
<BR>
To grasp the next phases of the information economy, one begins not with
the atom or any other discrete entity, but with the wave. In 1865, in a
visionary coup that the late Richard Feynman said would leave the American
Civil War of the same decade as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by
comparison, Scotch physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic
spectrum. This spread of frequencies usable for communications is both the
practical resource and the most profound metaphor for the global information
economy.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a domain of limits, to be husbanded by governments and appropriately
allocated by auctions at a price of billions of dollars for a tiny span
of wiggle rates? Is it beachfront property to be coveted as a finite and
unrenewable resource? Is it a constricted domain to be exploited under the
iron laws of diminishing returns? Is it a zero-sum game to erupt in Star
Wars and street fights as satellite magnates and personal communications
entrepreneurs crowd into a feudal fray of frequencies? At the heart of the
gathering abundance of the information economy, would it sustain a new economics
of scarcity?<BR>
<BR>
So one might imagine from today's conventional wisdom. Contemplating these
limits, diminishing returns and zero-sum economics at Richard Shaffer's
Mobile Forum in March was industry guru Carl Robert Aron. He sees the world
of wireless entering a &quot;new ice age,&quot; like the recent ordeal of
the tire industry in the face of radials. He predicts that customers, capital
and revenues will become increasingly scarce and many species of company
will become extinct. Offering a similarly grim vision, BellSouth Vice President
of Corporate Development Mark Feidler declares that the price elasticity
of demand for telephony is negative--you lower the price and revenues will
sink. On the same panel, AT&amp;T-McCaw executive Rod Nelson asserted that
he could see no threat from personal communications services, because McCaw
was already offering &quot;a low-priced, high-quality service.&quot; Even
Martin Cooper of ArrayComm saw spectrum as a limited resource sure to grow
more valuable over time.<BR>
<BR>
What would Maxwell say? As he discovered it, the spectrum is infinite, ubiquitous,
instantaneous and cornucopian. Infinite wave action, not the movement of
masses, is the foundation of all physics. It ushers in an age of boundless
bandwidth beyond the dreams of most communications prophets. As industry
guru Ira Brodsky concludes in his authoritative new book, Wireless: The
Revolution in Personal Communications, &quot;We are quickly moving from
the era of spectrum shortage to the age of spectrum glut.&quot; This expanding
wavescape is the most fertile frontier of the information economy. In its
actions are the essential character of the coming economics of abundance
and increasing returns.<BR>
<BR>
In contemporary networks, as Nicholas Negroponte stresses in his best-selling
book, Being Digital, all bits are fungible. In spectronics, all spectrum
is fungible. In particular, the distinction between wireline and wireless
service dissolves. A wire is just a means of spectrum reuse. Down adjacent
wires, appropriately twisted or insulated, you can transmit the same frequencies
without fear of interference or noise.<BR>
<BR>
Using new digital radio technologies, such as code division multiple access
or smart and directional antenna systems, you can similarly beam the same
frequencies through the atmosphere, insulated by air. The chief difference
is that the wire system costs far more to install and inhibits mobility.<BR>
<BR>
The only wire technology commanding a decisive edge over wireless for critical
applications is fiber optics. The intrinsic bandwidth of a fiber thread
is nearly 1,000 times larger than the bandwidth of all the &quot;air&quot;
currently used for terrestrial radio communications. In both media, capacity
is largely governed by the need to avoid the water molecules that absorb
many frequencies of electromagnetic <BR>
waves--in air, from humidity or precipitation; in fiber, from the unremovable
residue of water in the structure of the glass.<BR>
<BR>
Compared with perhaps 30 gigahertz of currently accessible frequencies in
the air, every fiber thread can potentially bear 25,000 gigahertz. This
huge bandwidth derives from the possibility of using infrared light frequencies
for long-distance communications rather than radio or microwave frequencies.
When you are dealing in terahertz (infrared light encompasses some 50 trillion
hertz worth of frequencies between 7.5 X 10[11] and 3.5 X 10[14]), there
is a lot of room for sending messages.<BR>
<BR>
One fiber thread the width of a human hair can potentially use about 25
trillion of those hertz for communications (the rest tend to be fraught
with moisture). This span is enough to carry all the phone calls in America
on the peak moment of Mother's Day, or to bear three million six-megahertz
high-definition television channels--all down one fiber thread the width
of a human hair. As Paul Green sums it up, fiber commands 10 orders of magnitude
greater bandwidth than copper telephone lines and 10 orders of magnitude
lower bit-error rates. Optical engineers have packed as many as a million
such threads in one bundle with a cross-section a centimeter square. Such
feats plausibly support the assertion that, as a practical matter, spectrum
is infinite.<BR>
<BR>
The capacity of fiber is so large that the best way to think of it is as
a radio system in glass--a fibersphere that can potentially accommodate
as many as 10,000 separate wavelength bitstreams. Under a system called
wavelength division multiplexing, users will tune in to a chosen frequency
band in the same way they currently time in to a chosen radio or television
channel, whether in the air or in a coaxial cable. Indeed, engineers can
take the same infrared frequencies used in fiber and move them to the air
for shorter distance applications such as local-area networks, point-to-point
connections between buildings, links between handheld computers and desktop
hosts, and even television remote controls. As tunable laser transmitters
and photodiodes, along with other optoelectronic gear, become more sensitive
and efficient, airborne infrared will become more robust and useful. Experiments
by the Israelis with ultraviolet frequencies suggest that even these superhigh
frequencies above visible light might someday be used for communications
through the atmosphere (offering tens of thousands of TV channels, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Now the FCC has auctioned off 120 megahertz of frequencies for personal
communications services. The most prominent winning bidders were consortia
led by Sprint, TCI, Comcast and Cox (a long-distance carrier and three cable
companies going under the name Wireless Co.); by AT&T; and by AirTouch,
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S West as PCS PrimeCo. Most analysis has focused
on what is called the wireless market and has assumed the major competitor
to PCS to be the current cellular companies. Aron's ice-age ruminations
stemmed from contemplation of this radical increase in competition for a
limited number of cellular customers who currently cost some $540 each to
sign up (counting handset subsidies) and whose per-capita revenues are declining
at a pace of some 8% per year. Remember BellSouth's Feidler's vision of
a negative elasticity of phone markets, meaning that lower prices bring
lower revenues?<BR>
<BR>
From a spectronic perspective, all this analysis is deeply misleading. Whether
channeled down wires or through the air, spectrum is spectrum. Digital wireless
is a cheaper and better way of delivering service. The market for PCS is
not the cellular customer, but the one billion wireline customers in rich
countries and the several billions of potential phone and teleputer customers
around the globe. In pursuing these customers, the price elasticities will
be dramatically positive, with various price points reachable with new wireless
technologies releasing torrents of new demand and new revenues. What Aron
calls an ice age will in fact prove to be a gigantic global warming, unleashing
huge new growth in telephony, using spectrum in all its various forms (except
perhaps the twisted-pair copper wires that currently dominate the installed
base of the industry).<BR>
<BR>
The winning bidders from AT&T and Sprint did not put up their $3.7 billion
in order to join a zero-sum straggle for new cellular customers. These bidders
are dominated by long- distance businesses that can use PCS to reduce their
some $30 billion in access charges to the local exchange carriers by creating
an alternative local loop. Similarly, MCI, though avoiding the auction,
created a subsidiary called MCI Metro that may seek to manage service for
spectrum winners in 17 cities, again harvesting the benefits of obviated
access charges. Then all these companies can use their PCS technologies
to pursue customers around the world without any thought of wire.<BR>
<BR>
A chart created by industry analyst Herschel Shosteck illustrates the opportunity.
The Shosteck chart is a bell curve relating the incomes of the world's households
to telephone penetration rates. He shows that telephony has so far penetrated
only to countries representing the top tail of the curve, where national
wealth suffices to reduce the cost of telephony to a threshold of between
4% and 5% of incomes. As incomes rise around the globe, more and more people
cross the telecom threshold. A chart of GDP in real dollars per capita versus
telephone penetration shows that a 40% rise in incomes could bring a 1,600%
increase in potential customers.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the surge in incomes, however, will be the plummeting cost of
wireless telephony. Shosteck estimates that between 1985 and 1994 the price
per customer dropped 80%, from $5,000 to $1,000. Combining these two trends,
he calculates that there will be between 400 million and 800 million new
wireless subscribers by the end of the year 2000. These numbers represent
an awesome upsurge from the world's current level of some 60 million cellular
customers. Any further acceleration in income growth or decline in telephone
prices will increase these numbers. A 50% further drop in telephone prices
combined with a 50% rise in incomes would quickly thrust the vast bulk of
the world's population above the Shosteck threshold. Far from the negative
elasticities that U.S. phone executives see in their saturated wireline
voice business, the world-wide communications market will be a financial
trampoline.

In an ordinary industry, a 50% drop in price seems a major obstacle. But
telephony is becoming a branch of the computer industry, which doubles its
cost effectiveness every 18 months. The wireless convergence of digital
electronics and spectronics will allow the industry to escape its copper
cage and achieve at least a tenfold drop in the real price of telephony
in the next seven years.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Stevens should meet Martin Cooper, a former research chief at Motorola
and now CEO of ArrayComm. Located in San Jose, ArrayComm is devoted to drastically
reducing the cost of telephone access over the next two years while entirely
obviating the problems of twisted-pair wiring that afflict Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
The current pitch of ice-age cellular providers is &quot;pay more and get
less. . .and don't even think about universal service.&quot; Although they
claim penetration rates in industrial countries of nearly 10%, most cellular
users make most of their calls on wireline systems. The real market share
of cellular is in fact under 1% in the industrial world. The cellular companies'
formula for success is to exploit the public hunger for mobility by charging
more money for worse service--extracting premium prices for calls with acoustics
and reliability far inferior to wireline telephony. Followed by both sides
of the cellular duopoly--by Bells, McCaws and other suppliers--this pay-more-
for-less-and-worse formula has concealed from much of the industry the basic
technological fact that wireless will soon be acoustically better than wireline
and drastically cheaper as well. As the CD example shows, after all, digital
sound systems are superior to analog. And without wires, phones finesse
the largest capital and labor costs of conventional telephony.<BR>
<BR>
In economic terms, the intrinsic cost advantage of wireless is concealed
by the colossal installed base of copper. Already mostly paid for and largely
written off, the 154 million twisted-pair access lines will allow the Bells
to compete in price for some time with wireless rivals that have lower real
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, technical reality will prevail in the end. Spectronics offers
technologies in four dimensions for dividing and conquering spectrum: Frequency
division, time division, code division and space division. All address in
various ways the issue of frequency rouse--how many times in a system particular
frequencies can be roused without causing interference in other calls using
the same frequencies. Of the four techniques, so far only frequency division
has been widely exploited. As these other methods come on line, the cost
of telephony will go over the same kind of digital cliff long familiar in
computers.<BR>
<BR>
Surveying all these proposed schemes and their promised upgrades (see sidebar
next page), it is safe to project between a 60% and 90% drop in the cost
of wireless telephony over the next five years, depending mostly on the
progress of CDMA. Qualcomm's CDMA could reduce costs tenfold, compared with
the threefold gains from current global services mobile (GSM) technology,
which contemplates an upgrade path chiefly through downgrading the voice
quality with a half-rate vocoder.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains in wireless efficiency from dividing by time, code or frequency
are compounded by dividing spectrum by space. Mathematically, every 50%
reduction in the cell radius yields a 400% increase in the number of customers
who can be served in a given area with a given technology. Huge theoretical
gains accrue from cell-splitting--reducing the physical extent of cells
and multiplying their numbery--converting current macrocells as large as
35 miles in diameter into microcells a mile or so in width, and into picocells
measured in hundreds of yards in buildings, shopping centers or congested
urban streets.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains, however, could be nullified by the expense and difficulty
of implanting base stations all over cities and neighborhoods. The key to
the gains of space division, therefore, is creation of base stations drastically
cheaper, smaller, more discreet and more functional than the current cell
sites, costing between $500,000 and $1 million, occupying 1,000 square feet
and containing between 55 and 416 radios, depending on the frequency reuse
factor. The most notable breakthrough in base stations is the Steinbrecher
MiniCell, to be demonstrated in July and launched at the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Putting a base station into a briefcase, Steinbrecher uses a single broadband
digital radio to perform the functions of between 55 and 416 analog transceivers.
The key breakthrough is a proprietary mixer that can flawlessly down-convert
all the waveforms in the entire cellular spectrum into a stream of baseband
digital bits without losing any information or introducing spurious signals.
Containing all the electromagnetic contents of the cell, this digital bitstream
is broken into channels by a 0.4- micron technology application-specific
integrated circuit and is interpreted by digital signal processors. Governed
by the learning curves of semiconductors, the MiniCell promises to reduce
the cost of a cell site by an initial factor of 10 and by an eventual factor
governed chiefly by the Moore's Law exponentials manifested in the PC industry.<BR>
<BR>
In an important article in the April issue of IEEE Personal Communications,
Donald Cox, former Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford, calculated
that such digital base station technologies soon could lower capital costs
per wireless customer to $14, compared with a current cellular cost of $5,555
(assuming, in both cases, 180 channels per unit).<BR>
<BR>
Using leading-edge silicon technology, the broadband digital radio can transform
the entire landscape of wireless. It takes the channeling, tuning, filtering,
modulation, demodulation, coding, decoding and other processing out of the
analog radio domain, where a different radio system is needed for each frequency
band or modulation scheme. Moved into a digital signal processor or ASIC,
these functions yield to the huge efficiencies of the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate in space division, for example, is devoting the entire available
spectrum to every caller. Using broadband digital radios fed by arrays of
smart antennas, Cooper's ArrayComm is approaching this ultimate. &quot;We
believe that over the next few years, everyone will be using broadband radios,&quot;
Cooper says, pointing to Watkins- Johnson and Airnet joining Steinbrecher
in this business (though with far narrower bandwidths).<BR>
<BR>
All base stations, one way or another, have to find all the callers in a
cell and link them to callers outside. Broadband digital radios move the
search function from an array of radios to a single computer. Cooper contrasts
the technology with radar. As he puts it, traditional radar systems use
active beams to scan a location and find a targeted object; ArrayComm uses
a passive array of antennas and a digital radio to provide a broadband snapshot
of a cell 20 times a second, and employs computers to locate the targeted
object, in this case a handset.<BR>
<BR>
Like the Craig McCaw-Bill Gates low-earth-orbit satellite scheme called
Teledesic, the ArrayComm IntelliCell originated with work done for the Strategic
Defense Initiative program. Inventor Richard Roy developed algorithms for
rapidly calculating the source and trajectory of missiles from their electromagnetic
emissions as detected by satellite antennas scanning the surface of the
earth. Now he is using similar algorithms to identify the position, direction,
distance and amplitude of electromagnetic emissions from handsets in a wireless
cell, as collected by arrays of smart antennas at a base station. Once the
information is digitized, Roy's algorithms can sort out all the calls by
their location in the cell, excavating signals otherwise buried in neighboring
noise or shrouded in cross- talk, and conducting several calls at once on
the same frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper gives the analogy of human hearing. &quot;You close your eyes and
I walk around talking, and you can point to me at any moment. Add another
voice and you can still listen to me, or shift to the other voice. You can
hear the voice you want to hear twice as loudly as the voice you want to
suppress. You null out the interference. This is not a physical process.
You don't move your ears. Your brain calculates and correlates the different
sounds or signals. That's what Dick Roy's algorithms do in our smart base
stations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Roy explains further: &quot;That works if you have a variety of frequencies.
Suppose, though, you were faced with a chores of monks all chanting in monotone
in the same frequencies. This is more like the cellular telephone or PCS
situation in the presence of interference or cross-talk. This is what prevents
frequency reuse in adjacent cells. Amid the drone of the monks, you could
not isolate the sound of one monk. What you need is more ears. Then you
could resolve the source of a particular sound by its location. That is
what we do with antenna arrays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adding a spatial dimension to the frequencies, time slots or codes tracked
by ordinary cell sites, an ArrayComm system can distinguish signals entirely
unintelligible to other systems. For example, an array with eight antennas
can effectively magnify the signal by a factor of eight. There is no theoretical
limit to the number of antennas, but as a practical matter, the size of
the array becomes a problem in urban cells. By moving up spectrum from 900
megahertz 15 centimeters to 1,800 megahertz, PCS reduces the size of the
antenna array from two meters across to one meter across (antenna size drops
in proportion to the decline in wavelength at higher frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the effective magnification of signals, an eight-antenna
array could double the range of a base station, quadruple the area covered,
reduce to one-third or one-fourth the number of cell sites, and raise frequency
reuse to 100%, without CDMA. Because CDMA doesn't define channels by frequency
at all, but by codes, its limit is the number of codes that can be differentiated
in the cell. Thus, Roy believes that among all the competing technologies,
CDMA can benefit most from using the spatial dimension. Spatial processing
can help differentiate the calls in a cell as the noise of call codes accumulates
toward the limit where further traffic is impossible. As Qualcomm leader
Andrew Viterbi declared in a paper released on Jan. 13: &quot;Spatial processing
remains as the most promising, if not the last frontier, in the evolution
of multiple access systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm is part of what Don Steinbrecher calls &quot;the transformation
of wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot; As a computer
business, wireless will share in the gains of Moore's Law. It will double
cost effectiveness every 18 months, rather than continuing on the stagnant
price curves of wireline telephony in its cage of copper, dominated by the
costs of rolling out trucks, digging trenches, laying wire and climbing
poles.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper predicts that over the next five years, the combination of broadband
digital radios, ArrayComm smart antennas and a stream of other advances
in wireless telephony will reduce the cost per minute of wireless phone
calls to a penny a minute, one-quarter the average wireline level and one-twelfth
the current cellular price. This price collapse will ignite huge positive
elasticities in demand, reaching for the first time billions of new customers
in India, China and Latin America who are now untouched by telephony.<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm's first customers are Alcatel in Europe, which is creating a system
for GSM, and DDI Tokyo Pocket Telephone. The fastest growing company on
the Tokyo stock exchange for the last five years, DDI is often termed the
MCI of Japan. Using transceiver chipsets from Cirrus Logic's PCSI subsidiary,
DDI is already the world leader in low-cost wireless telephony. The ArrayComm
technology should lower its costs to the point where these pocket telephones
can break through as a wireless local loop throughout the huge new markets
of Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the DDI technology, called Personal
Handy Phone, was combined with a Bellcore-Motorola proposal as a new low-end
wireless standard under the name Personal Access Communications Systems.<BR>
<BR>
By transforming the technical landscape of communications, spectronics are
also transforming the lawscape. Indeed, by entirely closing the gap between
the costs of serving rural and urban customers, digital wireless phones
will obliterate the need for cross-subsidies that underlie the entire regulatory
edifice. In the new world of bandwidth abundance, the only group that will
need cross- subsidies and emergency aid is the communications bar.<BR>
<BR>
As a guide to the era ahead, telephone executives, regulators and Washington
politicians should contemplate the computer industry. The market share of
centralized time- shared computer systems dropped from 100% in 1977 to less
than 1% in 1987. International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp.
lost nearly $100 billion in market cap in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Or, for a more recent example of the power of wireless technology in the
digital age, the telcos, regulators and politicians should consider the
video distribution industry, Last year, Washington was so obsessed with
the cable industry and its apparent monopoly power that Congress enacted
a reregulation bill that ultimately imposed 700 pages of new rules on the
distribution of video news and entertainment. Politicians and pundits let
forth a stream of lamentations about the future access of the poor and the
rural to the new services of digital television and proposed a series of
new requirements for universal service.<BR>
<BR>
A year later, however, the very survival of the cable industry as a distributor
of point-multipoint video is in doubt. Before Congress could enact broadband
universal service rules, Direct Broadcast Satellites were propagating 150
channels of digital video with supreme universality over the entire expanse
of the continental United States. Attaching 18-inch dishes to the tops of
their igloos, the Inuits might acquire television images of a variety and
resolution far excelling any offering of cable television in the midst of
the nation's capital. With a software upgrade to MPEG-2 video planned later
this year, the number of channels will rise to some 200.<BR>
<BR>
Privately dubbed &quot;deathstar&quot; by cable industry executives, digital
DBS became the fastest growing product in the history of consumer electronics.
Just seven months after its introduction, it had already surpassed the combined
first-year sales of VCRs, CD players and big-screen TVs.<BR>
<BR>
Today, in the name of deregulation, politicians are preparing to impose
a series of new competitive requirements upon the Bell operating companies,
on the assumption that they still wield monopoly power. Pundits still seem
to believe that the copper cage protects local telephone companies from
outside competition. But in fact, the cage incarcerates them in copper wires,
while the world prepares to pass them by.<BR>
<BR>
The digital future is not wired or wireless. It is spectronic and spectacular.
To participate in this explosive market, all telephone companies will have
to escape from their copper cages into the infinite reaches of the spectrum.<BR>

<PRE></PRE>
MICHAEL MILKEN IS BACK! Back, so the story goes, from the orgies of '80s
greed, back from the best-selling den of thieves, back from his preening
at the predators' ball, back from soft time at Pleasanton pen, back from
prostate cancer and plagues of litigation, back to tell his own book to
William Novak and to buy his redemption with the spoils of his crimes. Yes,
so they say, Milken is back, while thousands of plundered companies and
communities labor to regain their standard of living and jobs, long lost
in the shuffle of his dismal deals and loaded down with his &quot;high yields.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Milken is back. Back from the gutters of Ponzi finance, the rot of
junk and S&L sleaze, angling: to launder his weaseled wealth with educational
hype and charity hustles. Back, aiming now at history and posterity rather
than at new opportunity, but hitting it big instead with Michael Jackson,
Doonesbury laughs and Clifton compassion photo ops. Meanwhile, even the
ascendant Republicans in Washington try to steer clear of &quot;eighties
excesses&quot; of debt and deficits and supply-side economics.<BR>
<BR>
Or so it looks to media observers of the Milken saga. And yet slowly and
arduously, there is emerging from the carrels of the Harvard Business School
and other institutions a distinctly different tale.<BR>
<BR>
Under the leadership of Michael Jensen, a small group of Harvard Business
School scholars has been scrutinizing all the statistics of corporate behavior
during the 1980s. They have laboriously appraised the results of all the
leveraged buyouts, junk bond issues, venture capital, and other tools of
corporate making and remaking. They have arrived at unexpected conclusions
and have developed a new body of theory to explain them. From this perspective,
the events of the 1980s--and Milken's role--assume a wholly new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen puts the Milken episode in the context of another form of wretched
excess for which Milken was the remedy: namely, the excesses of corporate
waste and conglomeration by empire-building managers with scarcely any ownership
stake in their companies. Amid the sieges of deregulation and tax rate reduction,
amid the obvious tumult in the markets for oil, tires, tobacco, real estate,
gold and commodities, many industries needed profound restructuring. But
their entrenched managements were set to expand their domains through acquisition
and investment in new capacity. Meanwhile, a thousandfold rise in the cost-
effectiveness of microchips, governed by the centrifugal law of the microcosm,
rendered obsolete the dominant architecture of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
Most conspicuously, between 1977 and 1987 the percentage of total computer
power commanded by centralized systems dropped from nearly 100% to under
1%. Less obviously, but no less profoundly, the equally centralized structures
of television and telephony were also falling before the distributive force
of the microcosm. Ordaining that the price performance of microchips rises
by the square of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip,
the law of the microcosm exalts single chip systems, led by the PC. Pushed
into obsolescence were all monopolies and hierarchies, pyramids and power
grids of the old information structure, epitomized by the mainframe computer,
the broadcast network and the central telephone switch.<BR>
<BR>
The old establishment of AT&amp;T, the big three TV networks and some 1,400
over-the-air broadcast stations was breaking down into a new formation of
cable and wireless schemes. Affecting virtually every company in the economy
and threatening most existing management plans and practices, these trends
created huge opportunities for wealth creation and disruption.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with his move to Century City in Los Angeles in July of 1978,
Milken aggressively rode the microcosm--inside and outside of Drexel. Inside,
he concentrated on what Jensen describes as a key role of information technology:
&quot;taking the specific knowledge previously scattered through a firm
and making it into general knowledge usable by all.&quot; In this case,
it was a matter of turning Milken's command of the details of hundreds and
then thousands of high-yield issues into the foundation for a company that
could make these bonds the prime venture capital in the U.S. economy. From
the beginning, crucial to this goal was computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
A specialist in finance, information systems and operational research at
Wharton, he had begun his career at Drexel in 1970 with a computerized move
to speed up the delivery of securities to its customers, thus saving the
company some $ 500,000 in interest charges and setting a new standard in
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
In Los Angeles, he created an advanced system for trading based on what
was then a state-of-the-art Prime 550 Model 2. Through the RS-232 9600-baud
serial ports of up to 250 Televideo terminals, the Prime computer time-shared
a Fortran database containing the trading history of all Drexel customers,
some 1,700 high-yield securities and some 8,000 securities in the public
market.<BR>
<BR>
With a quick query, a member of Milken's team could determine the customer's
history, the amount of his potential profits or losses, his investment philosophy
and ability to buy new issues. Thus the team could link the buyers and sellers
of securities in a uniquely targeted and opportunistic way and could command
the detailed knowledge needed to counteract the strong prejudice and ratings
stigma against high-yield securities.<BR>
<BR>
Under William Haloc, a former systems analyst for Prime who joined Drexel,
the team also developed real-time analytics to allow instant calculation
of pricing for these intricate securities. These functions allowed salespeople
to view the name, issue and ratings of a security and to compute complex
yields and cash flows involving call features, sinking funds, refund schedules,
puts, warrants and prices, all instantly calculable on line. Meanwhile,
at rival firms, many dealers still fumbled with the levers on $ 3,000 Monroe
calculators.<BR>
<BR>
The entire system was monitored by Drexel Burnham's New York headquarters
and linked indirectly to the floors of the exchanges by Quotron, Reuters
and 10 other on-line services, each with a separate Rich monitor, switchable
from a keyboard. These arrays of small black monitors spread across the
desk collectively functioned like a present- day Windows display.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the features of Milken's system are Common today. But in 1980 they
were novel. This customized $ 2 million computer scheme, with five times
that amount for programming and maintenance, gave the Drexel team a mastery
of 5 the high-yield market that sometimes seemed positively sinister to
outside observers and competitors. But it was not magic or malfeasance;
it was the microcosm of the new technology joined with the knowledge and
investment genius of Michael Milken.<BR>
<BR>
More famously, Milken's grasp of the information age extended well beyond
Drexel's IS department. Focusing on emergent information companies responding
to the tectonic and regulatory turmoil unleashed by the microchip in TV
and telephony, Milken channeled a total of some $ 26 billion into MCI, McCaw,
Viacom, TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Cablevision Systems, News Corp. and other
cable, telecom, wireless, publishing and entertainment companies. At the
time, virtually none of these firms commanded substantial collateral acceptable
to a bank, and thus they could have raised these billions nowhere else.
Now, these companies are collectively worth some $ 224 billion and comprise
the foundations of a national information infrastructure unrivaled in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
With an eventual $ 2.5 billion from Drexel, MCI built the first national
single-mode fiber-optic network and spurred AT&T and Sprint into action
to give the U.S. a global lead in the technology. With another $ 1.2 billion,
McCaw launched the first national wireless telephone system. And with $
8 billion, TCI, Viacom, Time Warner, Cablevision Systems and Turner, followed
by many other Drexel high-yield issuers, made U.S. cable television a unique
national asset, with unequaled programming and broadband links. Redeemed
in the process were troubled companies providing equipment and services.
One of them was Corning, which supplied 62, 112 miles of state-of-the-art
fiber to MCI's pioneering network at a time when Corning had no other customers
for this crucial technology developed over the previous 17 years.<BR>
<BR>
Milken's influence reached well beyond his actual transactions. A once-lame
Disney was restructured with Milken's guidance and takeover pressure in
some three years of 5 a.m. meetings with Roy Disney, Frank Wells and Stanley
Gold. Then worth $ 1.8 billion, Disney emerged as a revamped Hollywood colossus
worth $ 30 billion 11 years later in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Comprising more than half of all high-yield bond issues, Milken's activities
also embraced thousands of companies beyond the telecom, cable TV and entertainment
field--for example, building Hasbro into the world's leading toy company
and Barnes & Noble into the leading independent bookseller. His example
helped inspire many rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann
Little, and Morgan Stanley, who also made heroic contributions to this campaign
of corporate renewal. In particular, Morgan Stanley channeled crucial billions
in high-yield funds to the computer, semiconductor and hard-disk drive industries
during extreme industry crises in the mid- and late 1980s as Drexel was
leaving the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1976 and 1993, Jensen calculates that in these campaigns of corporate
restructuring, American corporations conducted 42,621 merger and acquisition
deals worth a total of $ 3.1 trillion. In these transactions, selling: firms
won premiums of some 41%, generating $ 899 billion in constant dollar gains
to the shareholders. Since buying firms also gained on average, by increments
that increased over the years, Jensen's estimate represents a lower bound
on the yields of the restructuring movement.<BR>
<BR>
No substantial evidence supports the speculations by Larry Summers (now
Treasury Undersecretary) and others that these gains disguise large wealth
transfers from bondholders, workers, suppliers and communities. Indeed,
the evidence assembled by Jensen, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago,
Harvard economist Andre Schleifer and Jensen colleague Karen Wruck, among
others, shows that capital expenditures, employment, and research and development
all rose in the aftermath of these transactions.<BR>
<BR>
As Jensen now sums it up: &quot;These are lower-bound estimates because
they do not include gains that came about later or voluntary gains that
were achieved as a result of hostile offers. I don't know any way to add
up all these benefits. But it is clear that the impact was dramatic and
it left us much more competitive as a country. Today the Japanese and the
Europeans are suffering from their delay of restructuring and the U.S. is
much leaner and more efficient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Jensen and Milken agree that the opportunities today exceed even the
gains of the 1980s. Impelled by the restructuring campaign, the real value
of the equity of public firms more than doubled between 1981 and 1990, rising
by $ 1.6 trillion, or from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 3 trillion. Since then the
pace of technical change has accelerated and the possibilities for a deregulatory
breakthrough have soared with the election of a new Congress. Forbes ASAP
projects possible stock market gains for the rest of this decade of another
$ 2 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
The heightened pace of change, however, creates a desperate need for restructuring.
This $ 2 trillion opportunity depends on emancipating into the markets the
resources currently trapped in obsolete structures by capital gains taxes
near 40%, compounded by inflation, and by new antitakeover rules and outdated
telecom regulations. Flowing again into a new communications infrastructure,
into venture funds and into restructuring campaigns, freed capital can endow
entrepreneurs with the power to align their companies with the most potent
force in the history of technology.<BR>
<BR>
But first, America needs a new Milken. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Onrush of the Telecosm
</B></PRE>
With chip densities still doubling every 18 months and chip sales up nearly
30% each of the last two years, with computer MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) per dollar doubling every year and computer sales up over 25%
in each of the last two years, with hard-disk cost- effectiveness doubling
every nine months, and fiber-optics bandwidth exploding a thousandfold while
fiber deployment spreads at a pace of 1,300 miles a day--the onrush of technology
is now accelerating well beyond the pace of the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm is now potentially converging with
the law of the telecosm. This law ordains that the value and performance
of a network rise apace with the square of the increase in the number and
power of computers linked on it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers
and communications can ride an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
The 50 million new computers sold into America's homes and offices over
the last two years guarantee a huge market for broadband networks. Half
of the PCs sold in December bore Pentium microprocessors, and 60% of the
PCs went into homes. These computers process data at a pace rapidly approaching
100 MIPS. Early in the next century, just five years from now, most American
households will command multimedia teleputers processing data in billions
of instructions per second and pouring it out at gigabit-per-second rates--or
as much as a million times the current digital dribble of 9.6-kilobit modems.<BR>
<BR>
But not today. This computer-rich, bandwidth-poor situation means a crippling
and unnecessary mismatch between microcosm and telecosm, between the power
of PCs and the bandwidth of the networks that serve them--between PC instructions
per second on single-chip silicon and telco bits per second on twisted-pair
copper wires. Tens of millions of PC owners are demanding electronic commerce,
distance learning, full-motion videoconferencing, and ready access to the
graphics and hypertext of the Internet. World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Yet phone and cable executives dawdle with market surveys and experiments
with interactive TV that amazingly manage to prove that people don't even
want full-motion movies. Meanwhile, the values and sales of their companies
languish. In the last 12 months, for example, the 24 leading telecom and
cable companies, led by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, lost an average
of 12.8% of their market value. Facing a world of shining broadband opportunities
in their own businesses, narrowband executives grope for glamour in Hollywood
and grasp for growth overseas.<BR>
<BR>
American industry is still cowed by overreaching regulators obsessed with
corporate power. In a world of exploding competition in the telecosm -galvanized
by new wireless and wireline technologies emerging every week--the administration,
the FCC and Congress have long been paralyzed by nightmares of John Malone
of TCI and a possible single- wire stranglehold in St. Louis or of a blight
of disinvestment in phone service for South Dakota or Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
If current fears of monopoly result in a contrived two-wire mandate on America's
communications infrastructure, however, all the hopes for an integrated
broadband two-way net will die until well into the next century. With oceans
of bandwidth languishing just out of reach, the tremendous resource of broadband
home computers will waste away, gasping on the beach for two-way channels
for teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine and telecommerce, while
the telephone and cable companies &quot;compete&quot; with rival offerings
of mostly one-way floods of movies, shopping and the Sega Channel for TVs.
By betraying its precious world- leading endowment of PCs in order to save
its existing telcos and TV companies, the U.S. still could make a literal
$ 2 trillion mistake. 
<PRE><B>

The Amazing Vindication of Junk
</B></PRE>
To grasp the size of possible opportunity and the possible mistake, let
us return to Milken and his achievement of the 1980s, which set the stage
for the current drama. Never in history has a convicted white- collar felon
been so luminously vindicated by the passage of time. His six alleged felonies
dwindled to a series of debatable violations, devoid of insider trading
and essentially costing their victims nothing (or a total of $ 318,082,
according to a dubious estimate by the court that forced him into a plea
through RICO threats against him, his family and Drexel). Returning to the
volumes of the 1980s peak, his supposed Ponzi scheme of junk finance became
the most profitable class of domestic fixed-income securities of the early
1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if the few Savings & Loans that held a substantial portfolio of
junk had been permitted to keep it, they would have survived, prospered
and paid millions of dollars of taxes rather than collapsed into the hands
of the FDIC. For example, the shareholders of Columbia Savings & Loan may
have suffered from Thomas Spiegel's undue extravagance in company jets and
bullet-proof bathrooms. But the government crackdown cost them $ 700 million
and cost the taxpayers $ 1 billion, though the bank was on track to profit
massively from falling interest rates on its deposits and thriving high-yield
securities.<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs such as ex-Drexel luminary Leon Black, who purchased the bonds
from the government at bargain-basement rates, became billionaires on the
proceeds and were charged with gulling the regulators. Meanwhile, the companies
that Milken financed with these securities now form the foundations of a
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
A minor triumph came at the end of 1994 when Vanity Fair magazine, avid
vessel of many a lurid exposed of Milken and his team, published a lavishly
photographed story on &quot;America's New Establishment.&quot; Among the
19 names were Ted Turner, Craig McCaw, Sumner Redstone, Gerald Levin, John
Malone, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Ronald Perelman and
Bill Gates. Although Milken was never mentioned, all these high fliers--with
the exception of Gates--rose to prominence largely or partly on a cresting
tide of Milken's junk.<BR>
<BR>
Why does junk work! Primarily because it frees capital from corporate bureaucracy
and gets it into the hands of entrepreneurs. During the 1980s, lower taxes
and new technologies had transformed the economic environment. What was
precious in the 1970s--metals, minerals, real estate and collectibles, all
mashed together in diversified conglomerates and tax shelters-became disposable
junk in the 1980s. What was junk in the 1970s and early 1980s--Milken's
array of leveraged cable, fiber, wireless and content schemes--became the
precious foundations of a new information infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
How could this be so? How could one man with a poorly named venture-debt
financing vehicle contribute so hugely to the U.S. economy while, according
to Jensen's analysis, the nation's 500 largest corporations, led by a $
100 billion opportunity loss at General Motors in 11 years, incurred negative
returns with their free cash flow (cash flow beyond the amount needed to
fund all internal investments with a positive net present value)?<BR>
<BR>
Did not Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller win a Nobel prize for their
so-called M&M theorems showing that the performance of corporations is independent
of their capital structure? Have not scores of economists pursuing the Efficient
Market Hypothesis demonstrated that in general the capital exchanges are
fully efficient, that company prices reflect all of the available information
and no individual investor can systematically outwit the tape without illegal
manipulation or insider trading?<BR>
<BR>
In his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 1993,
however, Jensen answered all these arguments. On the basis of new research
on the experience of the 1980s, he declared that the M&amp;M theorems, &quot;while
logically sound, are empirically incorrect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The central problem of the corporation, according to Jensen, is the &quot;agency&quot;
dilemma-the divergence between the interests of the managers and the owners
of large businesses. This problem is inherent in all cooperative human endeavor:
the interests of the individuals always deviate at the margin from the goals
of the group. But in times of rapid technological and political transformation,
as Jensen argues, the agency gap becomes a gulf. The structure of the corporation,
the training of its engineers, the skills of its executives, the costs of
its processes all become misaligned with the realities of a new technological
base, a rapidly changing state of the art, and a political environment in
upheaval.<BR>
<BR>
General Motors was the worst example, investing $ 121.8 billion during the
1980s in R&amp;D and capital equipment while the value of the company dropped
to $ 22.9 billion. IBM invested $ 101 billion while its value was dropping
to $ 64.6 billion by the end of 1990 (on the way to further collapse to
$ 41 billion in early 1995). Collectively, the 500 largest U.S. corporations
wasted hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow. What was needed,
according to Jensen, was a total overhaul of most of these companies, their
strategic redirection, and the replacement or redeployment of roughly half
of the existing managers. What occurred was a prodigal waste of resources
in defense of the obsolete structures and practices of the incumbent management.<BR>
<BR>
Creating most of the new value during the 1980s were companies funded or
restructured by corporate raiders, venture capitalists and even--in the
case of a $ 75 billion gain from the AT&T breakup--the courts (disbanding
a monopoly previously created by government). Using equity, venture capitalists
overcome the agency gulf by playing an active controlling role on company
boards and managements and by insisting that executives are compensated
chiefly through stock and options. Using venture debt and an array of complex
securities, Michael Milken overcame the agency gulf by similarly active
intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Millken channeled billions of dollars into companies such as McCaw or MCI
largely owned by the management, to compete with industry leviathans. For
companies not owned by their executives, he funded leveraged buyouts that
transformed nonowner managers feeding on free cash flow into heavy owners
of equity with virtually no liquid resources. Contracted to divert all their
free cash flow to the holders of high-yield debt, the new owner-managers
were forced to please the capital markets in order to fund any new projects.
<PRE>
<B>
The Productivity Boom</B></PRE>
With the agency problem solved, these companies became lean and mean leaders
of the global economy. Contrary to the claims of many economists, from Alan
Blinder to Lester Thurow, productivity soared. Mired in the murky data on
service-sector productivity--which was stultified by the practice of measuring
most outputs by the cost of the inputs--economists tended to miss the prodigious
real growth of the 1980s. For example, in the brokerage and finance arenas,
productivity stagnated in the data, but between 1973 and 1987 the number
of shares traded daily grew from 5.7 million to 63.8 million, while employment
only doubled in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Manufacturing productivity numbers, though more accurate, also suffer from
severe miscalculations. In a world of creative destruction, they tend to
assume that products, such as computers, that decline in price are dropping
in value. And while registering every new steel ingot, automobile or chocolate
bar, they assume that novel products represent no productivity gain at all.
These are not trivial mistakes. During the past 20 years, the cost of computers
has dropped approximately one millionfold. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics
shows merely an annual drop varying between 14.9% in 1992 and 6.7% in 1994.
The government has finally recognized the flaws in this statistical series,
and is moving ever so slowly to correct it. But the problem is fundamental.<BR>
<BR>
Using the criteria applied to productivity in the auto industry, the statisticians
would have to multiply the improvement in computing cost-effectiveness by
the increase in the number of computers sold. Thus, with the explosion of
sales of billions of microcomputers of all kinds, from desktop systems to
embedded devices, a consistent BLS would find that the contribution of computers
to gross domestic product was close to a billion times larger than the entire
GDP of 1970. Of course, such an exercise would be preposterous. But hardly
more preposterous than mostly ignoring the productivity gains in these industries
of rapid advance, plummeting prices and cornucopian innovation.<BR>
<BR>
Even using existing data, total factor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing
sector more than doubled during the 1980s from the level during the previous
30 years. From 1950 to 1980, this productivity index rose an average of
1.4% per year; between 1981 and 1990, it rose at a rate of 3.3%. Labor productivity
rose from 1.4% per year in the earlier period to 3.8% in the `80s. Contrary
to the usual claims, wages rose at least 10%, according to Social Security
system data, while the number of jobs rose by 18 million.<BR>
<BR>
But the most striking productivity surge came in the growth of the productivity
of capital. In essence, Milken, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann Little
and others took the vast incarcerated capital resources trapped in old-line
businesses and put it back into the markets. Not only was the productivity
of the capital left behind hugely enhanced by the disciplines of restructuring,
but the freed capital flowed into venture funds and high-yield markets where
it fueled what Jensen calls &quot;a Third Industrial Revolution.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The results were dramatic. In decline for 30 years, at an annual rate of
minus 1.03%, the capital productivity index has long been beloved by Marxists
as a portent of the collapse of capitalism. During the 1980s, however, this
decline was decisively reversed. The productivity of capital as measured
in the data rose by 2.03% annually as computerized information systems transformed
the technology of finance.<BR>
<BR>
Decisively reversed as well was a long decline of U.S. market share in the
global economy. By the period between 1987 and 1992, U.S. corporations were
generating 47.7% of all the profits in the industrial world on 37.5% of
the revenues. Spearheading the U.S. economy were information firms, with
some 70% of global profits.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was overthrown by the restructuring of the 1980s all the indifference
theorems, Efficient Market Hypotheses, corporate optimality concepts, macroeconomic
monotheories wielded in business schools and economics departments to explain
away the power and &quot;wash&quot; away the paramount worth of individual
entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, the giant corporation, with managers
largely free of ownership claims, gained its preeminence as a way of diffusing
risk among millions of stockholders with diverse portfolios. But with the
securitization of venture debt by Michael Milken and others, these behemoths
emerge as marketplace survivors largely because of their prowess at politics,
litigation and media management--core competencies that in the course of
a decade succeeded both in derailing the Milken threat and enacting laws
and regulations to forestall any followers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because of a bias in favor of the capitalists, Jensen's course vies
with Michael Porter's similarly entrepreneurial class as the most popular
in the last 15 years with students at Harvard Business School--a fact which
bodes well for the future of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen and Milken agree that today's economy faces technological transformations,
agency misalignments and restructuring chances even greater than the economy
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;The opportunity is truly huge,&quot;
says Jensen. ASAP estimates that in this 40% larger economy, there should
be a chance for Milkenesque investors to raise stock market value by more
than 67%, implying both a revitalized U.S. economy, a Dow level over 6500,
a Standard & Poor's Index exceeding 700, and a Nasdaq over 1400.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains, however, how to realize these gains. Because of the
incredible continuing grip of obsolete regulations and the huge mismatch
between microcosm and telecosm, the fabulous new fiber and wireless technologies
have yet to force a corresponding industrial restructuring. The same old
players are still on the field protected by the same government rules, administered
still by Judge Harold Greene in the Modified Final Judgment breaking up
AT&T 11 years ago, and regulated still by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Justice Department and 5O state Public Utilities Commissions as if history
had stood still. Forty million computers with multimedia powers remain stranded
in homes with four-kilohertz copper connections to the world while communications
companies still ponder the perplexities of interactive TV and regulators
ruminate about how to prevent monopoly and preserve universal service. 
<PRE><B>

Cable TV's Impending Death</B></PRE>
Capsizing this entire teetering apparatus of petty fears and pettifoggery
will be this year's ascent of new wireless technologies. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs 10 to 30 times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
By nature, the U.S. Senate is dominated by rural customers. Many are Republicans.
Therefore, universal service has posed a paralyzing problem for programs
of deregulation. But new wireless digital technologies have utterly banished
this problem.<BR>
<BR>
At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the gap in costs between rural and urban customers. At
the same time, with supreme universality across the entire continent, Direct
Broadcast Satellite already delivers service superior to cable. Already
in the sky, DBS is a big bang that will ultimately transform the entire
corporate landscape of U.S. communications with a cascade of imperious new
realities.<BR>
<BR>
In digital DBS, GM Hughes, Hubbard Broadcasting and Thomson's RCA have delivered
a knockout new conduit for delivering one-way video. In image resolution,
in audio quality, in number of channels and in raw reach and efficiency
of point-to-multipoint transmission, DirecTV not only decisively outpaces
even the studio offerings at cable company headends but also vastly and
instantly excelled them in coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the only weakness of DBS is a lack of certain critical content
such as local and broadcast network programming. The lack will be addressed,
with the help of Michael Milken, by major new restructuring this year.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely devastating to broadcast cable TV, a still more powerful DBS
will send reverberations throughout the broadcast industry and profoundly
affect computers, government regulators and telephone companies as well.
As Milken explains, &quot;Everything in the information economy is connected
to everything else.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As government regulators will be the last to notice, DBS utterly overthrows
the prime premise of cable regulation: the view that cable commands some
kind of monopoly in delivering one-way video programming. Far from a monopoly,
one-way cable TV is essentially dead. In response to DBS, cable has no choice
but to change its business radically to two- way computer services.<BR>
<BR>
The market opportunity is obvious and immense. The Internet boasted five
million host computers and over 30 million estimated users in January, and
growth of 26% in the last quarter of 1994. The largest spurt of expansion
in recent history, this surge came despite acute frustration at the narrow
bandwidth of available phone connections.<BR>
<BR>
At present, only the cable TV industry commands conduits to homes capable
of accommodating these multimedia teleputers. One-gigahertz cable TV coax
can accommodate some eight billion bits per second of two- way data or some
5,000 channels of the kind of MPEG1 video now offered in one direction by
DBS. Such bandwidth could accommodate ubiquitous videoconferencing and commerce.
By contrast, your phone line modem labors to transmit 14.4 thousand bits
per second, or enough to send one MPEG movie in two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Reaching 63% of U.S. households, including at least 92% of homes with PCs,
cable supplies the obvious conduit for the exploding computer business.
Intel, General Instrument, Digital Equipment, Hybrid and Com21, among other
companies, are supplying cable modems and software for high-speed bidirectional
traffic over the existing cable plant. But consummation of the network will
entail large investments in fiber and switching at a time when cable is
just emerging from its regulatory shadows into the deadly Ku-band radiance
of DBS.<BR>
<BR>
The most obvious source of capital is the RBOCs, the local telephone companies
(though Milken stresses that the public utilities are a major alternative).
The Bells already command nine times as much fiber as cable TV does and
invest every year more money than the total $ 23 billion of cable revenues.
What they lack is bandwidth for broadband access to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The key to access to these huge new computer markets, therefore, is forthcoming
congressional action to permit collaboration between the RBOCs and the cable
companies within their own regions. If necessary, the telephone companies
must be allowed to buy cable companies and merge their systems. The coming
ascent of DBS should relieve the fears of monopoly that have long deterred
action. If it does, the cascade of change spurred by DBS will lead to a
flood of new commerce and communication on the networks of America.<BR>
<BR>
The endowment of DBS with new programming clout, however, will prove to
be the last triumph of conduit-content convergence. The restructuring paladins
of the broadband era will devote much of their efforts to dismantling the
content-conduit conglomerates that currently dominate the cable industry
and that are now in formation by the telephone companies.<BR>
<BR>
In a broadband era, content-conduit combines no longer make sense. Consider
that you are Warner Entertainment, a content company. You do not want to
restrict your movies to one conduit. You want to sell them through everyone's
conduit. Consider that you are Warner Communications, a cable firm. With
eight gigabits per second--enough for 5,000 movie channels--you want to
sell everyone's movies, not restrict yourself to Warner's.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to mix content and conduit--artists and engineers-produce misaligned
companies that need restructuring. Content follies crowd into the agency
gulf. Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis gave superagent Michael Ovitz
$ 14 million to pursue more &quot;content&quot; while Ameritech, BellSouth
and Southwestern Bell (SBC) romanced Disney.<BR>
<BR>
What would a new restructuring king do in the face of such ham- handed diversification?
Bring on the raiders. Sic some junkyard Doberman on the succulent bells
and whistles acquired by cable and telephone firms. Let him spin off their
recent acquisitions and interactive TV experiments and game channels and
refocus these companies on the computer networking business where they belong,
and where they can harvest the bonanza of a global economy rapidly uploading
onto the Net. 
<PRE><B>


The Two-Wire Delusion
</B></PRE>
Washington has to make a choice. Is it going to allow a freedom model that
permits telephone companies and cable companies to combine as common carriers
to build a true broadband infrastructure, in which millions of entrepreneurs
can cavort and compete in content and context? Or will regulators impose
a spurious competitive model, with two or more wires to every home, all
imitating the current cable strategy of wannabe content-conduit monopolies.<BR>
<BR>
As venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned in the Feb. 27 issue of ASAP:
&quot;There is an unspoken assumption in government circles that we can
move local loop communications to a fiercely competitive business model
and build an information superhighway at the same time...an implicit assumption
that the regional Bell operating companies and the cable companies are a
bunch of knuckle-dragging dimwits who will build the superhighway no matter
what... [But] telecom businesses are characterized by high fixed costs.
There is no such thing as limited competition... As you infuse competition...the
value model of the industry collapses. And when it does, the effect will
be exactly the same as stepping on a large cow pie in your hiking boots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Congressman Jack Fields, new Republican chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee,
disagrees: &quot;I am convinced that the [industry] people we talked with
will respond to telecom reform. They have tens of billions of dollars parked
on the side of the information superhighway waiting for us to pass a piece
of legislation to give definition and certainty to the scene.&quot; But
the people he consulted--chiefly the leaders and the lobbyists of the RBOCs
and cable companies--are not the ones who will decide whether the highway
is built.<BR>
<BR>
Making that decision will be the same capital markets that punished Bell
Atlantic and TCI for their broadband plans and thwarted the merger between
them. As soon as it became clear--through the passage of the cable re-regulation
act of 1992 and related policies of the FCC--that the regulators would permit
collaboration only in regions where the two companies had no competitive
advantage, the case for the combine collapsed. Under a regulatory system
in which the government can sweep down and confiscate profits and channel
them into quixotic schemes of universal service in three dimensions for
the homeless or require irrational competitive behavior in a two-wire multisubsidiary
world, a true broadband two-way network makes no business sense. What will
emerge instead is an array of dueling brands of 500-channel TV, claiming
to be interactive for the benefit of Congress and the press.<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets will avoid cow-pie competition at all costs. Under these
circumstances, a true broadband system will not be completed until 2020
in the U.S. But the competitive model is fundamentally misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
To the Washington regulators and their elected allies, competition has always
meant rivalry between the existing competitors--long distance, broadcast,
Baby Bells and Cable TV--and the regulation succeeds as long as all the
teams stay on the field. But all technological competition--all innovation--consists
of the pursuit of fugitive positions of monopoly. Current legislative proposals
from the administration and its congressional allies resemble a broad national
effort in 1981 to defend the mainframe BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell) from imperial IBM. Just as the IBM &quot;monopoly&quot;
was about to fall before the microcosm, led by Intel and Microsoft, so the
RBOC and broadcasting &quot;monopolies&quot; are about to fall before the
telecosm of broadband digital computer networks, which will also sorely
challenge Intel and Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
The new information infrastructure will bring a cornucopia of new services
from a variety of new sources that cannot even be defined as yet. All we
know is that none of the existing rivals is likely to survive in recognizable
form. Only a true freedom model that allows a complete reconstruction of
the world of communications--with anyone collaborating or competing, merging
or metamorphing with anyone rise--can allow this new era to come to fruition.
Only a freedom model can release the $ 2 trillion of new asset value that
the scholars of restructuring promise for the U.S. economy of the 1990s
and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
This result the Republicans on Capitol Hill command the unique and precious
and passing opportunity to achieve. So open the floodgates of capital for
new corporate raiders and remakers, venturers and reinventors. Rejoice in
the return of Milken and pray that he be joined by scores of rivals, including
those allowed to use the securities markets. Virtually all the cable and
telephone companies, from MCI to TCI to SBC, should be up for grabs, by
each other and from outside firms. Sitting on $ 10 billion of cash, IBM
could fruitfully enter the fray, or be frayed itself. IBM could combine
its global ATM network with cable access to homes. For many of these companies,
capital is far less scarce than vision.<BR>
<BR>
Milken cites MCI. &quot;Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with
billions of dollars of capital expenditures to make. They had a clear understanding
of what their business was. We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital and that fueled the spread of fiber optics throughout the country
during the 1980s. Today their situation is far less clear. They have $ 3
billion in cash, they could borrow $ 6 billion more; they've got a strategic
worldwide partnership with British Telecom. Today the challenge is not capital.
It is vision. It is, what should MCI's future be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With MCI's current resources, it could buy cable facilities across the country,
join them with its fiber network, complement them with wireless personal
communications services and Internet connections, and outwit AT&T as brilliantly
as it did in the 1980s. But it has to be willing to bet the company again.
The question is whether the current management, with Bill McGowan in his
grave, can escape the agency trap, shun the cushions of large corporate
life, and become a real competitor again rather than a protected player
in a continued government sham of &quot;competition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When a visitor at one of the Capitol Hill offices in charge of telecom policy
points to the benefits of real competition and restructuring, the politician
will usually respond: &quot;The companies do not tell us that.&quot; The
dirty little secret of all too many telephone and cable companies is that
they prefer government-regulated &quot;competition&quot; to real entrepreneurial
risks and rewards. As long as telco and cable lobbyists fail to urge true
competition, these companies deserve much of the blame. for the Third World
regulations that still limit the horizons of their industry.<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly, however, the situation is changing from an unexpected source.
While much of industry still lags, the politicians seem ready at last to
seize the day with a new freedom model. Now the congealed glaciers of telecom
can begin to break up under the blows of a reinvigorated market for corporate
control.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, the best solution will be again to deregulate Milken.

Postscript: The Return of Mike Milken</B></PRE>
One morning, in his office on a quiet street in Los Angeles near Bel Air,
Milken is probing some of the outward edges of the new regime, delving into
a business plan for ridefilms. Ridefilms are a brand new industry of convergence
that blends features of theatrical films, theme- park rides and arcade games.
Giving the viewer the sensation of plummeting motion and soaring flight
on platforms that move in sync with motion on the screen, these systems
are virtual reality that really works.<BR>
<BR>
Presenting the project of the day is Whitmore Kelley of Berkshire Motion
Pictures, the firm that created the pioneering &quot;Back to the Future:
The Ride&quot; for Universal Theme Parks. He is proposing Ridetime, a low-cost
system of theater capsules for children between the ages of four and 10.<BR>
<BR>
These turnkey theaters could bring ridefilms to malls, shopping centers,
toy stores, theme parks, resorts, restaurants and family entertainment centers
at a toll of $ 1.50 per child, eight children at a time. Offering four-minute
musical adventures with engaging plots and educational themes, these systems
would be the first to shun the &quot;testosterone market&quot; of the arcades
and focus on young children.<BR>
<BR>
Milken had heard enough. He confessed he had only been able to read five
sections of the business plan during the two or three minutes that had elapsed.
But with a quizzical Columbo look, he said he had some questions. He had
recently seen similar systems in Norway and Sweden. Small groups of parents
and kids together paid the equivalent of $ 4 apiece to plummet down an Olympic
Alpine downhill or bobsledding course. No, they weren't real ridefilms,
with synchronized physical movement, but they were cheap to produce and
offered a similar experience and there would be a lot more where those came
from. How would Berkshire compete with these? Let's say he owned space in
an arcade. Teenagers pump in money all day long and deep into the night.
Why would he give space to a children's ride that takes up twice as much
room and closes down at bedtime? Interactivity? Watch out for that. Kids
today get real interactivity on their computers and Nintendo machines at
home. Any effort to provide interactive features for eight kids at once
might well turn them off. Where would the parents be? They would see the
show for nothing, standing behind the kids, without the motion that makes
it interesting. That's a downer. A four-year-old will demand that the parents
sit with him. The parents are your customers. Make them pay and let them
ride.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting that Kelley had described other ridefilm companies as the competition,
Milken demurred. The computer software industry would be the competition.
He grilled Kelley on the size of the capsule, its cost per square foot,
its yield to the owner of the space in a mall, the quality of the images,
the nature of the liquid crystal projection technology.<BR>
<BR>
As Kelley described it, &quot;Milken is so mentally aggressive and determined
I was astonished. I came in and he began playing the flute and several other
instruments at once, and I had to figure out what the dance was and start
moving and shaking in time. Teaching, learning and testing at the same time.
. .he was amazing.&quot; At the end of the presentation, Milken announced
that he was impressed and would go visit a prototype of the new system nearby
in the L.A. suburbs.<BR>
<BR>
Or watch him on President's Day in a paneled room in Atlanta's Occidental
Grand Hotel. He is contemplating a new learning network as a climax to some
25 years and $ 250 million of Milken family ventures in the field of education.
Milken has assembled leading experts on education, film and finance to consult
with the CEO of the new project, Hamilton Jordan, recently of Whittle Communications.<BR>
<BR>
Milken began with the crucial rule that the educational network &quot;go
first to the home, later to the schools,&quot; rather than the other way
around (which was Whittle's mistake). &quot;The teachers themselves will
bring any good material into the schools,&quot; he said. He ended by suggesting
that the group had radically underestimated the size of their potential
market. He pointed to his earlier investment in Interface Group, the sponsor
of Comdex, recently sold to Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank
Corporation for $ 800 million. Virtual conferences and teleconferences for
training and education and lifelong learning could become a leading vehicle
of convergence, joining software, computers, consumer electronics, telephones
and even public utilities.<BR>
<BR>
As he summed up, he declared that the size of the educational market, appropriately
defined today to include corporate training, was not $ 400 billion as Jordan
had said, but more than $ 1 trillion. Visionary and trenchant as ever, lifting
the horizons of all around him, Milken was clearly back.

Breakup Candidates?
</B></PRE>
AT&amp;T: In both history and promise, AT&T may be the world's greatest
technology company, combining microcosm with telecosm more intimately than
any other. With Bell Labs, 59% of the long-distance market, and McCaw's
access to the local loop, AT&T today also should be one of the most valuable
companies in the world. But its management has reduced its market cap to
just over one times sales, making it nearly the cheapest major phone company
in the country. Bell Labs performed much of the early work on the vital
new multimedia communications technology of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM),
but a new startup named Fore Systems dominates the market with scores of
other companies. Judge Green broke up AT&T once. Smart management would
break it up again.<BR>
<BR>
TIME WARNER: Time Warner went to the well for high-yield securities in 1984
at the time of the Atari crash. It plunged deep into debt to save the company
and preserve it film assets. With Lorimar, it produced more than a third
of all TV programming; with Warner films, it was the dominant Hollywood
force; with Warner records, it ruled music; and with Warner Communications,
it was the second-biggest cable system. In other words, it followed the
content-conduit strategy. Unfortunately, this strategy twisted its Orlando
project into unprofitable knots. Mobilizing some of the best technology
in the world- Silicon Graphics 3D interface and servers, AT&amp;T ATM, Scientific
Atlanta's 64QAM transmission-Warner compressed it into a TV set-top box
and centralized server system focused on delivering movies over cable conduits.
This business won't pay for the plant. Perhaps belatedly recognizing this
problem, the company is now veering in the oppsite direction, ordering 1.5
million new analog set-top boxes for $ 250 million from General Instrument.
Don't they grasp the deadly meaning of the DBS big bang?<BR>
<BR>
This company needs restructuring to get ready for a broadband world. It
must spin off its precious content and transform its conduit to accommodate
the only real interactive machines with market penetration, namely PCS.<BR>

But I don't understand howIntel gets hurt unless it stops delivering the best price/performance microprocessors.The more network connectivity the more we need MIPS. Andy Grove is rightthat DSPs are just a complex way of getting more MIPS. Just because bandwidthreduces some of the need for compression doesn't mean bandwidth reducesdemand for cycles.<BR><BR>In any case Gilder is very stimulating even when I disagree with him, andmost of the time I agree with him.<BR><HR><B><TT>Nicholas Negroponte - Director,<BR>MIT Media Laboratory, Boston, MA</TT></B> <H3>Debunking Bandwidth:</H3>When our world is fibered, the planet is like a desktop. Earth is but abackplane for a single computer. True. But as mere humans, the bandwidthwe're really interested in is the one that exists between us and computers,be they the size of a cuff link or a country. That bandwidth is often onewe want to be smaller, not bigger. Most of us, most of the time, want lessbits, not more bits. Sure we want gigabits, but only for a few millionthsof a second at a time.<BR><BR>Remember the early days of computing when stacks of fanfolded output weredropped on an executive's desk? People caught on quickly; that was data,not information. Today, for some reason, we have forgotten some simple conceptsabout what constitutes meaning and understanding and where they come from.You. So while it is real easy to ship vast amounts of data and high-resolutionimages back and forth between computers and while it is suddenly possibleto ignore geographic constraints, let's not forget that in many cases &quot;lessis more&quot; when it comes to bandwidth.<BR><BR>Narrow channels force us to be smarter. Yes, bandwidth will be free, butso will computing. The future will not be driven by either MIPS or BPS,but information and entertainment content. Andy Grove does not need to worryabout John Malone or Bill Gates. He has to worry about Michael Ovitz.<BR><BR><HR><PRE><B>Mark Stahlman - President,New Media Associates,  New York, NY</B></PRE><H3>Bandwidth to Burn: Now What Do We Do?</H3>Gilder has made a case for vastly expanded bandwidth overwhelming the influenceof the steady march of computing power. [But] what new need will drive businessesto translate the inventions Gilder describes into significant new mediaopportunities?<BR><BR>Apparently, it's the need for video-on-demand. [But] if this were a plausiblemass market, the streets of New York would be filled with bicycle messengersdelivering Tom Cruise with bags of Chinese food. No, during the next fiveto 10 years, bandwidth will certainly be consumed in much greater quantities--butfor completely different reasons. We will dramatically extend ourselvesand our social relationships with video-telephones. We will consume substantialbandwidth by substituting bandwidth for gasoline--through telecommuting.We will network to multimedia databases (such as the current Internet-basedWorld Wide Web) and dramatically expand our range of social contacts--acrossborders, cultures and tribes.<BR><BR>Unfortunately for Gilder's bandwidth braggarts, these enormous markets willbe built using a telecommunications technology which began deployment over10 years ago--ISDN--and in which none of them has any important financialstake today. Unglamorous, ungainly, even downright ugly, ISDN (integratedservices digital network) will be supplied by old-time telephone companies(not cable companies) and it will be driven by the steady progress of personalcomputers--themselves now a 15- to 20- year-old industry. As has been widelynoted, we tend to overestimate (sometimes dramatically) the near-term impactof new technologies and underestimate the long-range effects.<BR><BR>In this age, new technology hype has become an epidemic. Reality itself,as it turns out, is far more interesting.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael Slater - President,MicroDesign Resources,and Editorial Director,Microprocessor Report,  Sebastopol, CA</B></PRE>Increasing bandwidth will provide computers with more information to process,and this will increase, not decrease, the computational requirements. Havinghigh bandwidth makes it possible for the interface nodes to be less intelligent,but this is not necessarily desirable. Furthermore, the time frame mustbe considered; high-bandwidth WAN (wide area network) connections are notgoing to be widely available for years, and in the meantime, computationalpower will continue to be critical as a way to mitigate bandwidth limitations.<BR><BR>No matter how much bandwidth is available, it is still very desirable tohave high-performance computational ability in desktop systems. Renderingof three-dimensional images from mathematical representations, for example,is something that has widespread application not only in games, but in otherconsumer applications (like home and garden design programs). Orders ofmagnitude more performance will result in direct improvements in such applications,and bandwidth is no substitute here.<BR><BR>Finally, with regard to the inclusion of signal-processing capabilitiesin general-purpose microprocessors, I disagree with Gilder's conclusionthat this will not occur. Minor extensions to general-purpose architectures,such as the ability to perform four 8-bit additions in parallel using thesame hardware that normally performs a single 32-bit addition, will providea significant boost for applications such as video decompression. The costof adding these features is small, and the benefit is great. Sun and HPhave already made such additions to their processors, and I expect Inteland other x86 vendors will do so in the future. Dedicated DSPs will alwaysbe able to provide higher performance, but the incremental cost/performanceof adding functions to the host CPU is superior.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael E. Treacy - President,Treacy &amp; Co.,  Cambridge, MA{Treacy is co-author of The Discipline of Market Leaders}</B></PRE>[Gilder's] view is rounded on the narrow philosophy of technological determinism.It is a peculiar and persistent form of myopia based on the wobbly assertionthat the best technology will win in the marketplace. He who rides the besttechnological wave will ascend to glory. Oh, if it were only so! If technologydetermined success, there would be no Microsoft today. By any reasonablestandards, MS-DOS, the foundation of Mr. Gate's empire, was an average technologywhen it was brought to market more than a decade ago. But Microsoft hadall the other elements that created a compelling value proposition for itscustomer.<BR><BR>Value is what customers want. Intel has got what it takes and has been avalue leader for many years. Andy Grove has already begun to direct Intel'sdevelopment portfolio toward communications opportunities. He has read thesignals and made the call, just as he did several years ago when he vacatedthe memory-chip business, in advance of grinding competition and shrinkingmargins. With constant vigilance and change, Intel's success can continuefor years to come.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Howard Anderson - Managing Director,The Yankee Group,and General Partner,Battery Ventures,  Boston, MA</B></PRE>George Gilder's analysis of the changes in the computing and communicationstradeoff is brilliant, concise, analytical--and flawed. His portrait ofthe rapid changes in communications and relative disadvantage of the old-linecomputer industry (Intel, etc.) does not overestimate the movement. It underestimateshow the next 10 years will be the decade of Bandwidth on Demand. Considerthis: <UL><LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of bandwidth will drop faster than the costof computing. <LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of switching will drop faster than the costof bandwidth. </UL>Historical examples: The cost of a T1 line (1.54 megabits) coast to coastin 1985 was $ 40,000/month. Today? Under $ 2,000/month, a drop of 95%.<BR><BR>Assume the following: by 2000, computing is free, and bandwidth is free.Now--design the future!<BR><BR>The amount of money spent on ATM Research and Development (Source: YankeeGroup ATM Planning Service): <UL><LI>1993:$ 335 million <LI>1994:$ 550 million <LI>1995:$ 950 million </UL>So Gilder is right on about the impact of ATM. In fact, Fore Systems, whereour sister company Battery Ventures is the second-largest outside stockholder,carries a market capitalization of $ 900 million--on a $ 60 million salesbase demonstrating that the ATM value is well known within the industry.<BR><BR>This past year, the Yankee Group trained 5,000 end-users on the use of ATMtechnology and the most frequently asked question was, &quot;How in theworld am I going to use all that bandwidth?&quot; But it was only 10 yearsago that users thought they would fall off the end of the earth if theywent faster than 2.4 kilobits!<BR><BR>Which leads to some immutable laws about networks, which Gilder alludesto: <UL><LI>Networks always grow. <LI>Networks always become more complex. <LI>Networks find applications that double the bandwidth needed every threeyears. <LI>The cost of bandwidth is artificially high. </UL>Andy Grove is right: &quot;Only the paranoid survive.&quot;<BR><HR><PRE><B>G. A. Keyworth, IIThe Progress and Freedom Foundation,Washington, D.C.</B></PRE>George Gilder's article goes yet another step in establishing him as theforefront signal-to-noise processor&quot; of information technology. Yet,I confess to being somewhat confused by it.<BR><BR>My dilemma resides in what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--thatwe humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through oureyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears. The kind of bandwidththat Gilder projects are important to machine-to-machine communications,i.e., to networks, but it is the computer (in some form, whether PC, PDA,digital-phone or digital-TV) that will continue to determine the &quot;match&quot;between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule.<BR><BR>Bandwidth is important, because it will make the connection a richer one,but the fact remains that we humans lack broadband input channel to accessall that bandwidth directly. And it is the computer that must bridge thatgap, keeping it in the driver's seat as we enter the realm of ubiquitous,connected computing.<BR><BR>Gilder's article makes an additional point, and one that falls too oftenon deaf ears in Washington. That is that bandwidth scarcity, the basis formuch of our telecommunications regulation, is an outdated concept. Onlymajor revamping of the government's role in telecommunications will permitthe natural competition between computing and communications to play out.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Eric Schmidt - Chief Technical Officer,Sun Microsystems,  Mountain View, CA</B></PRE>Gilder's article does a wonderful job showing the potential impact of thebandwidth revolution. Let me give you two examples of approaches in computersystems to exploit enormous bandwidth increases:<BR><BR>The speed of light is not doubling every 18 months. There is a revolutionin system design for small, fast machines just as significant as the onefor broadband networks in your article. What we call today &quot;large servers&quot;will in fact have to become physically very small. We are now approaching&quot;design for light speed&quot; in computer systems, and we have to keepour handy ruler, measured in nanoseconds, ready for each new board design.Light travels about four inches in a nanosecond in today's wires, so that,in a 500-megahertz (two nanosecond) computer design, we have less than eightinches of room for our signals to travel in a synchronous processor design(as most are). This means that the fastest computers in our future willalso have to be the smallest!<BR><BR>The backplanes of these machines have to be physically very short. The limitof a single backplane makes it hard to keep up with the improvements inprocessor speeds, using traditional backplane designs.<BR><BR>Switching becomes a core strategy for computer systems. Two approaches thatmerge switching and architecture are now popular. One, called DistributedShared Memory, uses a switching network to link cache-coherent memoriestogether. In DSM computers, the power of shared memory designs can be extendedover very high- speed switched memory networks. The other, called clustering,has been around for at least 15 years, and uses a switching network to linkcomputer systems. In this approach, applications are modified to share commondisks, peripherals and software.<BR><BR>Small size and switching are the future of high-performance computing. Bothare based on networking as their core. As the switched networks get fasterthese architectures will come to dominate computing. The fastest improvingtechnology, in this case networking, always drives the architecture. Thehollowing out of the computer occurs when high-performance computers trulyspan networks. ATM asynchronous transfer model, now in its infancy, is thelikely network for us to bet on.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Steven Dorfman - President,Hughes Telecommunications and Space Co.GM Hughes,  Los Angeles, CA</B></PRE>In &quot;Ethersphere&quot; (Oct. 10) Gilder offers the view that high- poweredgeostationary satellites--the mainstay, high-capacity platforms of our past,current and future service offerings--are already antiques, and soon willbe displaced entirely by thousands of low earth orbiting satellites. Thatthese highly touted systems are nonexistent, unlaunched and unproven [andrequire major technical breakthroughs] are details that conveniently escapeGilder's scathing assault on geostationary systems.<BR><BR>Gilder should recognize that new technology products are designed and broughtto market based on a host of considerations in addition to pure technicalfeasibility. Tradeoffs are--must be--made. But to Gilder, &quot;tradeoff&quot;would appear to be synonymous with &quot;sellout.&quot;<BR><BR>In the corporate world, this is business naivet&Ccedil;. In deciding whatform Hughes's new Spaceway and DirecTV services, for example, should take,our goal was to deploy systems that: maximized technology insertion, therebyminimizing risk; provided a low-cost service for which there was demonstratedconsumer demand; and faced minimal regulatory, technology-development, orfinancing delays, thereby expediting service introduction.<BR><BR>A Ka-band GEO system, evolved from U.S. defense communication satelliteapplications, Spaceway is the logical extension of Hughes's universe of120,000 very small aperture terminal antennas worldwide, used for privatenetwork, two-way voice, data and video. Our me-satellite regional approachprovides global coverage at a cost of $ 3 billion. Because service can berolled out incrementally, revenues can be generated before full system deployment.(By contrast, virtually all 840 Teledesic satellites must be operational--ata $ 9 billion system cost--before service can begin.)<BR><BR>Our comparatively low investment cost and highly efficient spot beam architecture,whereby we cost-effectively target our capacity to the world's most populatedregions, yield significant savings and low user costs. . .critical becausedeveloping nations with limited communications infrastructure are a keymarket.<BR><BR>For voice, we expect that developing regions without access to low-costterrestrial voice service will embrace Spaceway despite the fractional timedelay--at least until terrestrial infrastructure is available. This is asignificant, revenue- generating window of opportunity for us. As for dataapplications, our VSAT experience has shown that custom developed protocolsprovide totally acceptable throughput efficiency and seamless interactivity.In short, we believe &quot;the delay issue&quot; has been overstated. Thereis a different delay issue, however, that cannot be overstated. Gilder is,I believe, overly optimistic about how soon Teledesic's technology willbe ready--and hence, how soon service revenues can be generated.<BR><BR>I believe Spaceway is the best technological solution for this market atthis time. But if tomorrow the technology and market are in place so thatthe LEO system makes sense, rest assured that Hughes will introduce an innovativeLEO product of Our own.<BR><BR>Gilder attaches far too little import and value (in the form of operatingprofits) to today's technology. Nowhere is this more clear than in his assessmentof satellite direct-to-home television programming. Gilder calls DBS &quot;one-size-fits-allprogramming,&quot; stressing its lack of sufficient consumer choice andabsence of Interactivity. But in holding out for a fiber solution, Gilderis making a poor business decision.<BR><BR>Today, Hughes's two DirecTV GEO satellites are filled with 150 program channels.We are adding 3,000 subscribers a day, and will break even (three million)by mid-1996. With 10 million subscribers projected by 2000, DirecTV willbe a $ 3 billion a year business, with $ 1 billion in operating profit.<BR><BR>Waiting for the future, Gilder, carries a price tag most CEOs can't afford,and are not prepared to pay. <PRE><HR></PRE><H2><CENTER>GEORGE GILDER REPLIES:</CENTER></H2>I want to thank my correspondents for their alternately poetic, ironic,trenchant and pithy responses. So many of them, though, share the notionthat I predicted dire straits for Intel that I must assume a lack d clarityin my treatment of the issue. I predicted that new and larger opportunitieswould arise in the field of communications processors and systems that centralprocessing units would bear a declining share of total processing not thatthey would in themselves decline in any absolute sense. Indeed, CPUs shouldcontinue to improve their cost-effectiveness apace with Moore's Law, plusan increment for architectural advances in parallelism. Such advances, however,will fail to keep pace with the onrushing expansion of bandwidth, as furtherdetailed by Howard Anderson's intriguing letter. Bandwidth gains will befed on the demand side, as Mark Stahlman incisively observes, more by theneeds of teleconferencing and telecommuting than by the need for one-wayvideo-on-demand.<BR><BR>Thus I agree with Bill Gates that Intel can continue to thrive as long asit continues to produce the most cost-effective microprocessors. I did raisethe possibility, foreshadowed by Microunity's new semiconductor lab process,that Intel's existing technology might face rivals that could produce moreMIPs or gigabits per second per watt. Power efficiency will be a crucialindex in a time of seething CPUs and increasing demands for power- savingdesigns from producers of mobile appliances, such as the digital cellularcommunicators which will be the most common PCs of the next decade.<BR><BR>Focusing on gigabits per second as a prime spec, these devices may welleclipse CPUs in raw processing pace and find a wide range of applicationsin digital radio, real-time compression and decompression, pattern recognition,echo- cancellation and other digital signal processing uses. The demandsof these applications have already impelled an array of processing and architecturaladvances at Microunity, Texas Instruments and elsewhere in the pullulatingfield of DSP. Unconstrained by proprietary legacies and immense installedbases, perhaps other manufacturers will also find ways to excel the Moore'sLaw pace of Intel's majestic progress down the learning curve of three-voltCMOS technology.<BR><BR>Jay Keyworth and Nicholas Negroponte both eloquently point to the centralparadox of the information age. While production systems of the industrialage use scarce resources, such as land, labor, and capital, to create abundance,production systems of the information age use abundant resources, such asbits and bandwidth, to create knowledge scarce enough to fit the bandwidthof humans. This distillation function--delivering correct and useful datato human beings with their Keyworth window of roughly 30 kilohertz cochleaand 30 megahertz retinas--requires processing speeds orders of magnitudeabove the human rates, just to sample, quantize and codify the flow. Toscan, select, recognize, correct, decompress, echo-cancel, visualize orotherwise manipulate the data entails still further accelerations of processingpower.<BR><BR>Communications processors may well emerge as most efficient for many ofthese tasks. The idea that all such functions will be sucked into the CPUhas a long history, but motherboards and their buses remain as crowded asever. I suspect that the bandwidth explosion will offer many opportunitiesfor processors specializing in communications.<BR><BR>Steven Dorfman of Hughes, I predict, will do better both for his companyand his two-way communications from space by moving quickly rather thanslowly to low earth orbits. I fully share his admiration for the point-tomultipoint-powers of DBS and I have long cited them as a prime reason forthe obsolescence of cable TV regulations based on the assumption of monopoly.Indeed, I predict far more than 10 million users by 2000 if Hughes and itssuppliers can meet the demand. But satellite and cable TV vendors will prosperbest by providing two-way channels for the 110 million personal computersin the land. I expect that these channels--particularly CATV, not ISDN--willprovide the dominant access channel for computers over the next decade.<BR><BR>Above all, I hope that whoever Andy Grove fears most, it is not MichaelOvitz. Grove goes Hollywood and we'll all be in trouble.<BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="49" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<HR><BR>
Andrew Grove, Titan of Intel, is widely known for his belief, born in the
vortex of the Hungarian Revolution and honed in the trenches of Silicon
Valley, that &quot;only the paranoid survive.&quot; If so, the Intel chief
may soon need to resharpen the edges of fear that have driven his company
to the top. Looming on the horizons of the global computer industry that
Grove now shapes and spearheads is a gathering crest of change that threatens
to reduce the microprocessor's supremacy and reestablish the information
economy on new foundations. Imparting a personal edge to the challenge are
the restless energies of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Tele-Communications
Inc.'s John Malone, providing catalytic capital and leadership for the new
tides of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Grove's response is seemingly persuasive. &quot;We have state-of-the-art
silicon technology, state-of-the art microprocessor design skills and we
have mass production volumes.&quot; These huge assets endow Intel as a global
engine of growth with 55% margins and more than 80% market share in the
single most important product in the world economy. Why indeed should Grove
worry?<BR>
<BR>
One word only may challenge him and with him much of the existing computer
establishment. Let us paraphrase a 1988 speech by John Moussouris, chairman
and chief executive of the amazing Silicon Valley startup MicroUnity, which
gains a portentous heft from being financed heavily by Gates and Malone:
If the leading sage of computer design, in his last deathbed gasp, wanted
to impart in one word all of his accumulated wisdom about the coming era
to a prodigal son rushing home to inherit the business, that one word would
be &quot;bandwidth.&quot; Andy Grove knows it well. Early this year he memorably
declaimed: &quot;If you are amazed by the fast drop in the cost of computing
power over the last decade, just wait till you see what is happening to
the cost of bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, is one of the
few men who have measured this coming tide and mastered some of its crucial
implications. His key insight is that the onrush of bandwidth abundance
overthrows Moore's Law as the driving force of computer progress. Until
now progress in the computer industry has ridden the revelation in 1979
by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors on chips,
and thus the price-performance of computers, doubles every 18 months. Soon,
however, Schmidt ordains, bandwidth will be king.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth is communications power--the capacity of an information channel
to transmit bits without error in the presence of noise. In fiber optics,
in wireless communications, in new dumb switches, in digital signal processors,
bandwidth will expand from five to 100 times as fast as the rise of microprocessor
speeds. With the rapid spread of national networks of fiber and cable, the
dribble of kilobits (thousands of bits) from twisted-pair telephone lines
is about to become a firehose of gigabits (billions of bits). But the PC
is not ready. Attach the firehose to the parallel port of your personal
computer and the stream of bits becomes a blast of data smithereens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tsunami of Gigabits<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The bandwidth bottleneck of telephone wires has long allowed the computer
world to live in a strange and artificial isolation. In the computer world,
Moore's Law has reigned. At its awesome exponential pace, computer price-performance
would increase some one hundredfold every 10 years. This means that for
the price of a current 100 mips (millions of instructions per second) Pentium
machine, you could buy a computer in 2004 running 10 billion instructions
per second. Since today the fastest bit streams routinely linked to computers
run 100 times slower, at 10 megabits per second on an Ethernet, 10 bips
seems adequate as a 10-year target. All seems fine in computer land, where
users rarely wonder what happens after the wire reaches the wall.<BR>
<BR>
In the face of the 10 times faster increase in bandwidth, however, Moore's
Law seems almost paltry. The rise in bandwidth does not follow the smooth
incremental ascent that the heroic exertions, inventions and investments
of Andy Grove and his followers have maintained in microchips. bandwidth
bumps and grinds and then volcanically erupts. The communications equivalent
of those 10 bips that would take 10 years to reach according to the existing
trend would be 10-gigabit-per-second connections to their corporate customers
next year.<BR>
<BR>
During the very period of apparent bandwidth doldrums during the 1980s,
phone companies installed some 10 million kilometers of optical fiber. So
far only an infinitesimal portion of its potential bandwidth has been delivered
to customers. Moussouris estimates that the bandwidth of fiber has been
exploited one million times less fully than the bandwidth of coax or twisted
pair copper.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the tide is now gathering toward a crest. This year, MCI offers
its corporate customers access to a fiber connection at 2.4 gigabits per
second. Next year that link will run at 10 gigabits per second for the same
price. Two years after that it is scheduled to rise to 40 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, at Martlesham Heath in the United Kingdom, home of British Telecom's
research laboratories, Peter Cochrane announced in early September that
he could send some 700 separate wavelength streams in parallel down a single
fiber-optic thread the width of a human hair. Peter Scovell of Northern
Telecom's Bell Northern Research facility declares that by using &quot;solitons&quot;--an
exotic method of keeping the bits intact at high speeds through a kind of
surface tension counterbalancing dispersion in the fiber--it will be possible
to carry 2.4 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) on each wave length
stream. That would add up to more than 1,700 gigahertz on every fiber thread.<BR>
<BR>
Blocking such bandwidths until recently was what is called in the optics
trade the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot; The light signals had to be
converted to electronic pulses every 35 kilometers in order to be amplified
and regenerated. Thus fiber optics could not function any faster than these
electronic amplifiers did, or between two and 10 gigahertz. In the late
1980s, however, a team led by David Payne of the University of Southampton
pioneered the concept of doping a fiber with the rare earth element erbium,
to create an all-optical broadband amplifier. Perfected at Bell Labs, NTT
and elsewhere, this device overcomes the electronic bottleneck and allows
communications entirely at the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
IBM's optical guru Paul Green prophesies that within the next decade or
so it will be possible to send some 10,000 wavelength streams down a single
fiber thread. Long prophesied by fiber optics pioneer Will Hicks, these
developments remain mostly in the esoteric domains of optical laboratories.
But IBM recently installed its first all-optical product--its MuxMaster--for
a customer running 20 wavelengths on a fiber connecting offices in New York
to a backup tape drive in New Jersey. Telephone companies from Italy to
Canada are now deploying erbium-doped amplifiers. Long the frenzied pursuit
of telecom laboratories from Japan to Dallas and government bodies from
ARPA to NTT (now turning private), all-optical networks have become the
object of entrepreneurial startups, such as Ciena and Erbium Networks.<BR>
<BR>
Returning from the ethers of innovation to existing broadband technology
connecting to people's homes, Craig Tanner of CableLabs in Louisville, Colo.,
maintains that a typical cable coax line can accommodate two-way streams
of data totaling eight gigabits per second. In Cambridge and other eastern
Massachusetts cities, Continental Cablevision is now taking the first steps
toward delivering some of this bandwidth for Andy Grove's PC users. Today,
using Digital Equipment's LANCity broadband two-way cable modems, David
Fellows, Continental's chief technical officer, can offer 10 megabits per
second Ethernet capability 70 miles from your office. That increases the
current 9.6 kilobits per second speeds of most telephone modems by a factor
of 1,000.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term contributor to the tides of bandwidth is a
new communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode. ATM is
to telecommunications what containerization is to transport. It puts everything
into same-sized boxes that can be readily handled by automated equipment.
Just as containerization revolutionized the transport business, ATM is revolutionizing
communications. In the case of ATM, the boxes are called cells and each
one is 53 bytes long, including a five-byte address. The telephone industry
chose 53 bytes as the largest possible container that could deliver real-time
voice communications. But the computer industry embraced it because it allows
fully silicon switching and routing. Free of complex software, small packets
of a uniform 53 bytes can be switched at enormous speeds through an ATM
network and dispatched to the end users on a fixed schedule that can accommodate
voice, video and data, all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Available at rates of 155 megabits per second and moving this year to 622
megabits and 2.4 gigabits, ATM switches from Fujitsu, IBM, AT&amp;T, Fore
Systems, Cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications and every other major manufacturer
of hubs and routers will swamp the ports of personal computers over the
next five years.<BR>
<BR>
Why should all this bandwidth arouse the competitive fire of Andy Grove?
The new explosions of bandwidth enable interactive multimedia and video,
riding on radio frequencies, into every household--through the air from
satellites and terrestrial wireless systems, through fiberoptic threads
and cable TV and even phone-company coax.<BR>
<BR>
If the personal computer cannot handle these streams, John Malone's set-top
boxes, Sega or Nintendo game machines or Bill Gates's new communications
technology will. A communications technology that can manage multimedia
in full flood can also in time relegate one of Grove's CPUs to service as
a minor peripheral. The huge promise of the PC industry, with its richness
of productivity tools and cultural benefits, could give way to an incoherent
babel of toys, videophones and 3D games.<BR>
<BR>
Redeeming the new era for the general-purpose PC entails overcoming the
technical culture and mindset of bandwidth scarcity. In today's world of
bandwidth scarcity, arrays of special-purpose microprocessors constantly
use their hard-wired computer cycles to compensate for the narrow bandwidth
of existing channels and to make up for the small capacity of the fast,
expensive memories where the data must be buffered or stored on the way.
This is the world that Intel dominates today--a world of CPUs incapable
of handling full multimedia and radio frequency demands, a world of narrowband
four-kilohertz pipes to the home accessed by modems at 9.6 kilobits per
second and a world of what Moussouris call arrays of &quot;twisty little
processors,&quot; such as MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) decoders from
C-Cube and IIT, graphics accelerators from Texas Instruments and an array
of chips from Intel.<BR>
<BR>
By fixing the necessary algorithms in hardware, these devices bypass the
time-consuming tasks of retrieving software instructions and data from memory.
Thus these chips can perform their functions at least 100 times faster than
more general-purpose devices, such as Intel's Pentium, that use software.
But all this speed comes at the cost of rigid specialization. An MPEG-1
processor cannot even decode, MPEG-2. When the technology changes, you have
to replace the chip. Such special-purpose devices now handle the broadband
heavy lifting for video compression and decompression, digital radio processing,
voice and sound synthesis, speech recognition, echo cancellation, graphics
acceleration and other functions too demanding for the central processor.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, contemplate a world of bandwidth abundance. In a world of bandwidth
abundance, specialized, hard-wired processing will be mostly unnecessary.
In the extreme case, images can flow uncompressed through the network and
onto the display. Bandwidth will have obviated thousands of mips of processing.
The microprocessor instead can focus on managing documents on the screen,
popping up needed information from databases, performing simulations or
visualizations and otherwise enriching the conference. The arrival of bandwidth
abundance transforms the computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Grove's and Intel's bold investments in chip-making capability --
some $ 2.4 billion in 1994 alone--the entire information industry has waxed
fat and happy on the bonanzas of Moore's Law. Now, however, some industry
leaders are gasping for breath. Exkhard Pfeiffer of Compaq has denounced
Intel's avid campaign to shift customers toward the leading-edge processors
such as Pentium, embodying the latest Moore's Law advances. Gordon Moore
himself has recently questioned whether the pace of microchip progress can
continue in the face of wafer factory costs rising toward $ 2 billion for
a typical &quot;fab.&quot; He has pronounced a new Moore's Law: The costs
of a wafer fab double for each new generation of microprocessor.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, but the new world of the telecosm offers no rest for weary microchip
magnates or future-shocked PC producers. Driven by the new demands of video
and multimedia, the pace of advance will now accelerate sharply rather than
slow down.<BR>
<H4>Feeding the Tiger</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplate the advance of the Tiger, Microsoft's all-software scheme for
video-on-demand based entirely on PCs. Although Tiger has been presented
as merely another way to build a &quot;movie central&quot; for cable headends
or telco central offices, its real promise is not to redeem the existing
centralized structure of video but to allow any PC owner to create a headend
in the kitchen for video-on-demand. Today, such capability would mean buying
a supercomputer plus an array of expensive boards containing special-purpose
processors. Tiger's consummation as a popular product therefore will require
a new regime of semiconductor progress.<BR>
<BR>
Driven by this imperative, a pioneering combine of Gates, Malone and Moussouris
is making an audacious grab for supremacy in the telecosm. Just three miles
from Intel and fueled by ideas from a 1984 defector from an Intel fabrication
team, Moussouris's MicroUnity is a flagrantly ambitious Sunnyvale, Calif.,
startup launched in 1988. Fueled by some $ 15 million from Microsoft and
$ 15 million from TCI, among several other rumored backers, it plans a transformation
of chip-making for the age of the telecosm, optimized for communications
rather than computations.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity's goal is a general-purpose mediaprocessor, software programmable,
that can run at no less than 400 billion bits per second--some hundreds
of times faster than a Pentium--and perform all the functions currently
done in special-purpose multimedia devices. Escaping the tyranny of fixed
hardware standards, the mediaprocessor could receive decompression codes
and other protocols, algorithms and services over the network with the video
to be displayed in real time.<BR>
<H4>The Great Bandwidth Switch</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In launching Tiger and MicroUnity, Gates and Malone are signaling a fundamental
shift in the industry. Ruling the new era will be bandwidth or communications
power, measured in billions of bits per second rather than in the millions
of instructions per second of current computers. The telecosmic shift from
mips to bandwidth, from storage-oriented computing to communications processing,
will change the entire structure of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the industry has been driven by increases in computer power
embodied in new generations of microprocessors--from the 8086 to the Pentium
and on to the P-6 and new Reduced Instruction Set screamers such as the
Power PC, Digital Equipment's Alpha and Silicon Graphics new R-1000 (the
latest in the family from Moussouris's previous company Mips Computer, now
owned by Silicon Graphics). External computer networks typically run much
more slowly than internal networks, the backplane buses connecting microprocessors,
memories, keyboards and screens. These buses race along at some 40 megabits
per second, up to Intel's new gigabit-per-second PCI bus. Even when computers
are linked in local area networks in particular buildings at 10 megabit-per-second
Ethernet speeds, they face a communications cliff at LAN's end: the four-kilohertz
wires of the telephone company. Under this regime, the processor is king
and Moore's Law dictates the pace of change.<BR>
<BR>
In the age of the telecosm, however, all these rules collapse. When the
network increasingly runs faster than the processors and buses in the PC,
the computer &quot;hollows out,&quot; in the words of Eric Schmidt. The
network becomes the bus and any set of interconnected processors and memories
can become a computer regardless of their location. In this bandwidth-driven
world, the key chips are communications processors, such as digital signal
processors (DSPs) and MicroUnity's mediaprocessors, which must function
at the pace of the network firehose rather than at the pace of the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, communications processors have indeed been improving
their price/performance tenfold every two years--more than three times as
fast as microprocessors. This kind of difference add up. Soaring DSP capabilities
have already made possible the achievement of many new digital technologies
previously unattainable. Among them are digital video compression, video
teleconferencing, broadband digital radios pioneered by Steinbrecher (see
Forbes ASAP, April 11, 1994), digital echo cancellation and spread-spectrum
cellular systems that allow 100% frequency reuse in every cell. All these
schemes require processing speeds far in excess of the bit rate of the information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in accord with the prevailing MPEG standards, digital video
compression produces a bit stream running at between 1.5 and six megabits
per second. But in order to produce this signal manageable by a 100 mips
Pentium, a supercomputer or special-purpose machine must process raw video
bit flowing 100 times as fast as the compressed format--uncompressed video
at a pace of 150 to 600 megabits per second. The complex and exacting process
of compressing this onrush of bits--compensating for motion, comparing blocks
of pixels for redundancy, smoothing out the flow of data--entails computer
operations running 1,000 times as fast as the raw video bits. That is, the
video compression algorithm requires a processing speed of between 150 and
600 gigabits per second--hundred of times faster than the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, just to digitize radio signals requires a sampling rate twice
as fast as the radio frequency--at a time when new wireless personal communications
systems are moving to the two gigahertz bands and wireless cable is moving
to 28 gigahertz. A broadband digital radio must handle some large multiple
of the highest frequency it will process. Code division multiple access
(CDMA) cellular systems depend on a spreading code at least 100 times faster
than the bit rate of the message.<BR>
<BR>
In order to feed the Tiger and other such bandwidth-hungry systems, communications
processors will have to continue this breathtaking binge of progress beyond
the bounds of the microcosm. Grove does not believe this possible. He contends
that the surge in DSP will dwindle and converge with Moore's Law, allowing
the central processor to suck in functions currently performed in digital
signal processors and other communications chips. DSP is nice, Grove observes,
&quot;but it is not free--unless, that is, it is performed in the Intel
CPU, obviating the need to buy a DSP chip at all.<BR>
<BR>
But in an era when the network advances faster than the CPU, it is more
likely that communications processors will gradually &quot;suck in&quot;
and &quot;hollow out&quot; the functions of the CPU, rather than the other
way around. Echoing Sun's perennial slogan, Schmidt predicts that the network
will become the computer. In this era, Moore's Law and the law of the microcosm
are no longer the driving force of progress in information technology. Bandwidth
is king.<BR>
<BR>
As the great pioneer of communications theory Claude Shannon wrote in 1948,
bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Since ultimately a microprocessor
is a set of millions of transistor switches inscribed on a chip, bandwidth
can even serve as a substitute for mips. With sufficient communication,
engineers can duplicate any computer network topology they want. As the
network becomes the computer, they thus redefine the optimal architectures
of computing. As an example, take the problem of video-on-demand now being
confronted by every major company in the industry from IBM to Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992, Microsoft assigned this problem to Craig Mundie, a veteran of Data
General in Massachusetts, who had gone on to found Alliant Computer, one
of the more successful of the massively parallel computer firms. As a supercomputer
man, Mundie initially explored a hardware solution, hiring a team of computer
designers from Supercomputer Systems Inc. SSI was Steve Chen's effort to
follow up on his successes at Cray Research with a machine for IBM. Although
IBM ultimately closed SSI down, Chen commanded some of the best talent in
supercomputers. Mundie hired George Spix and a team from SSI.<BR>
<H4>Looking to Software</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, video-on-demand seems a super-computer task. It entails
taking tens of thousands of streams of digital images, smoothing them into
real-time flows, and switching them to the customers requesting them. Essentially
huge hierarchies of storage devices, including fast silicon memories, connected
through a specialized switching fabric to arrays of fast processors, supercomputers
seem perfectly adapted to video-on-demand, which as Bill Gates explains,
is &quot;essentially a switching problem.&quot; This is the solution chosen
by Oracle Systems, using its nCube supercomputer, and by Silicon Graphics,
employing its PowerChallenge server.<BR>
<BR>
According to Mundie, the SSI team developed an impressive video server design.
But they soon discovered they were in the wrong company. As Gates told Forbes
ASAP, &quot;Microsoft looks for a software solution to all problems. IBM
looks for a mainframe hardware solution. Larry Ellison owned a supercomputer
company so he looked for that solution. Fortunately for us, software solutions
are the most scaleable, flexible, fault-tolerant and low cost.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Enter Rick Rashid, a professor from Carnegie Mellon and designer of the
Mach kernel adopted by Next, IBM and the Open Software Foundation and incorporated
in part in Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Rashid joined Microsoft
in September 1991 and began to focus on video-on-demand in 1992. Like most
other people confronting this challenge, he first assumed that the huge
bit streams involved would require specialized hardware--RAID (redundant
arrays of inexpensive disk) storage, fast buffer memories and supercomputer-style
switches. Soon, however, he came to the conclusion that progress in the
personal computer industry would enable an entirely software solution.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the memory problem illustrates a tradeoff between bandwidth
and processing speed. Expensive hierarchies of RAID drives and semiconductor
buffer memories managed by complex controller logic can speed the bit streams
to the switch at the necessary pace. But Rashid and Mundie saw that bandwidth
offered a cheaper solution. Through clever software, you could &quot;stripe&quot;
the film bits across large arrays of conventional disk drives and gain speed
through bandwidth. Rather than using one fast memory, plus fast processors,
and hard-wired fault tolerance to send the movie reliably to a customer,
you spread the images across arrays of cheap, slow disk drives--Seagate
Barracudas--which, working in parallel, offer bandwidth and redundancy limited
only the number of devices. Having dispensed with the idea of contriving
expensive hardware solutions for the memory problem, Rashid recognized that
with Windows NT he commanded an operating system with real-time scheduling
guarantees that laid the foundation for a software solution. On it, he could
proceed to build Tiger as a continuous digital stream operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Liberated from special-purpose hardware, the team could revel in all the
advantages of using off-the-shelf personal computer components. Mundie explains:
&quot;The personal computer industry commands intrinsic volume and a multi-supplier
structure that takes anything in its path and drives its costs to ground.&quot;
A burly entrepreneur of massively parallel supercomputers, Mundie became
a fervent convert to the manifest destiny of the PC to dominate all other
technologies in the race to multimedia services, grinding all costs and
functions into the ground of microprocessor silicon.<BR>
<BR>
Video-on-demand has been heralded as the salvation of the television industry,
the supercomputer industry, the game industry, the high-end server industry.
It has been seen as Microsoft's move into hardware. Yet nowhere in the Tiger
Laboratory in Building Nine is there any device made by any TV company,
supercomputer firm, workstation company, or Microsoft itself. On one side
of the room are 12 monitors. On the other side are 12 Compaq computers piled
on top of each other, said to be simulating set-top boxes. Next to these
are a pile of Seagate Barracuda disk drives, each capable of holding the
nine gigabytes of video in three high-resolution compressed movies. Next
to them are another pile of Compaq computers functioning as video servers.<BR>
<BR>
All this gear works together to extend Microsoft's long mastery of the science
of leverage, getting most of the world to drive costs to ground--or grind
cost into silicon--while the grim reapers of Redmond collect tolls on the
software. Exploiting another of Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy's famous
laws--&quot;The smartest people in every field are never in your own company&quot;--Gates
has contrived to induce most of the personal computer industry, from Bangalore
to Taiwan, to work for Microsoft without joining the payroll.<BR>
<BR>
In the new world of bandwidth abundance, however, it is no longer sufficient
to leverage the PC industry alone. Gates is now reaching out to leverage
the telephone and network equipment manufacturing industries as well. Transforming
all this PC hardware into a &quot;Tiger&quot; that can consume the TV industry
is an ATM switch. In the Tiger application, once one ATM switch has correctly
sequenced the movie bits streaming from the tower of Seagate disks, another
ATM switch in a metropolitan public network will dispatch the now ordered
code to the appropriate display. Microsoft's Tiger and its client &quot;cubs&quot;
all march in asynchronous transfer mode.<BR>
<H4>The Masters of Leverage</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is this a brilliant coup? It positions Microsoft to harvest the fruits
of the single most massive and far-reaching project in all electronics today.
Some 600 companies are now active in the ATM forum, with collective investments
approaching $ 10 billion and rising every year. Not only are ATM switches
produced by a competitive swarm of companies resembling the PC industry,
ATM also turns networks of small computers into scaleable supercomputers.
It combines with fiber-optic links to provide a far simpler, more modular
and more scaleable solution than the complex copper backplane buses that
perform the same functions in large computers. ATM and fiber prevail by
using bandwidth as a substitute for complex protocols and computations.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft Technical Director Nathan Myhrvold points to the Silicon Graphics
PowerChallenge superserver as a contrast. &quot;They have a bus that can
handle 2.4 gigabytes per second and which is electrically balanced to take
a bunch of add-in cards (for processor and memory).&quot; The complexities
of this solution yield an expensive machine, costing more than $ 100,000,
with specialized DRAM boards, for example, that cost 10 times as much per
megabyte as DRAM in a PC.<BR>
<BR>
This problem is not specific to Silicon Graphics. All supercomputers with
multiple microprocessors linked with fast buses face the same remorseless
economics and complexities. By contrast, the $ 30,000 Fore systems ATM switch
being used in Tiger prototypes--together with the PCI buses in the PCs on
the network--supply the same 2.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth that
the PowerChallenge does. And, as Myhrvold points out, &quot;ATM prices are
dropping like a stone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Microsoft sage explains: ATM switches linked by fiber optic lines are
far more efficient at high bandwidth than copper buses on a backplane. ATM
allows &quot;fault tolerance and other issues to be handled in software
by treating machines (or disks, or even the ATM switch itself) as being
replaceable and redundant, with hot spares standing by.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Gates told ASAP, video-on-demand is essentially a switching problem.
You can create an expensive, proprietary, and unscaleable switch using copper
lines and complex protocols on the backplane of a supercomputer, or you
can use the bandwidth of fiber optics and ATM as a substitute for these
complexities. You can put the ATM switches wherever you need them to create
a system optimized for any application, allowing any group of PCs using
Windows NT and PCI buses to function as video clients or servers as desired.
As Microsoft leverages the world, it won't object if the world chooses to
lift NT into the forefront of operating systems in unit sales.<BR>
<BR>
Mundie and his assistant Redd Becker earnestly explain the virtues of this
scheme and demonstrate its robustness and fault tolerance by disabling several
of the disk drives, cubs and servers without perceptibly affecting the 12
images on the screen. They offer it as a system to function as a movie central
server resembling the Oracle nCube system adopted by Bell Atlantic, or the
Silicon Graphics system used by Time Warner in its heralded Orlando project.
But the Tiger is fundamentally different from these systems in that it is
completely scaleable and reconfigurable, functioning with full VCR interactivity
for a single citizen or for a city. It epitomizes the future of computing
in the age of ATM, a system that will soon operate at up to 2.4 gigabits
per second. Two point four gigabits per second is more than twice as fast
as the Intel PCI bus that links the internal components of a Pentium-based
personal computer.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, ATM technology can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and an external Barracuda, between a video client and a video
server. To the CPU, a local area network or even a wide area network running
ATM can function as a motherboard backplane. With NT and Tiger software,
PCs will be able to tap databases and libraries across the world as readily
as they can reach their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives. Presented as an
application-specific system for multimedia or movie distribution in real
time, it is in fact a new operating system for client-server computing in
the new age of image processing.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Bell, now on Microsoft's technical advisory board, sums up the future
of computing in an ATM world: &quot;We can imagine a network with a range
of PC-sized nodes costing between $ 500 and $ 5,000 that provide person-to-person
communication, television and when used together (including in parallel),
an arbitrarily large computer. Clearly, because of standards, ubiquity of
service and software market size, this architecture will drive out most
other computer structures such as massively parallel computers, low-priced
workstations and all but a few special-purpose processors. This doomsday
for hardware manufacturers will arrive before the next two generations of
computer hardware play out at the end of the decade. But it will be ideal
for users.&quot; And for Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of equipment that feeds the Tiger, however, what Bell
calls &quot;doomsday for hardware manufacturers: may well be as profitable
as the current rage of &quot;Doom,&quot; the new computer game infectiously
spreading from the Internet into computer stores. The new Tiger model provides
huge opportunities for manufacturers of new ATM switches on every scale,
for PCs equipped with fast video buses such as PCI, for vendors of network
hardware and software, and perhaps most of all for the producers of the
new communications processors.<BR>
<BR>
For all the elegance of the Tiger system, however, Gates understands that
it cannot achieve its goals within the constraints of Moore's Law in the
semiconductor industry. The vision of &quot;any high school dropout buying
PCs and entering the interactive TV business&quot; cannot prevail if it
takes a supercomputer to compress the images and an array of special-purpose
processors to decode, decrypt and decompress them. Facing an ATM streams
of 622 megabits per second--perhaps uncompressed video, 3-D or multimedia
images--Eric Schmidt points out, a 100 mips Pentium machine would have to
process 1.47 million 53-byte cells a second. That means well under 100 instruction
cycles to read, store, display and analyze a packet. Since most computers
use many cycles for hidden background tasks, the Pentium could not begin
to do the job. Gate's adoption of Tiger, his alliance with TCI, his investments
in Teledesic, Metricom, and MicroUnity, all bring home face-to-face with
the limits of current computer technology in confronting the telecosm. With
MicroUnity, however, he may have arrived at a solution just in time.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity seems like a throwback to the early years of Silicon Valley,
when all things seemed possible--when Robert Widlar could invent a new product
for National Semiconductor on the beach in Puerto Vallarta, and develop
a new process to build it with David Talbert and his wife Dolores over beers
on a bench at the Wagon Wheel. It was an era when scores of semiconductor
companies were racing down the learning curve to enhance the speed and functions
of electronic devices. Most of all, the MicroUnity project is a climactic
episode in the long saga of the industry's struggle between two strategies
for accelerating the switching speeds in computers.<BR>
<H4>A New Moore's Law?</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel Chairman Gordon Moore recently promulgated a new Moore's Law, supposedly
deflecting the course of the old Moore's Law, which ordains that chip densities
double every 18 months. The new law is that the costs of a chip factory
double with each generation of microprocessor. Moore speculated that these
capital burdens might deter or suppress the necessary investment to continue
the pace of advance in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Gerhard (&quot;Gerry&quot;) Parker, Intel's chief technical officer, however,
presents contrary evidence. The cost for each new structure may be approximately
doubling as Moore says. But the cost per transistor--and thus the cost per
computer function--continues to drop by a factor of between three and four
every three years. Not only does the number of transistors on a chip rise
by a factor of four, but the number of chips sold doubles with every generation
of microprocessor, as the personal computer market doubles every three years.
Thus there will be some eight times more transistors sold by Intel from
a Pentium fab that from a 486 fab. At merely twice the cost, the new fab
seems a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Intel gets paid not for transistors but for computer functions.
To realize the benefits of the new fabs, therefore, Intel must deliver new
computer functions that successfully adapt to the era of bandwidth abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it is worth noting that measured in telecosmic terms of useful
terabits per second of bandwidth, a MicroUnity fab ultimately costing some
$ 150 million might generate more added value than a $ 2 billion megafab
of Intel.<BR>
<H4>Return to Low and Slow</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since as a general rule, the more the power, the faster the switch, you
can get speed by using high-powered or exotic individual components. It
is an approach that worked well for years at Cray, IBM, NEC and other supercomputer
vendors. Wire together superfast switches and you will get a superfast machine.<BR>
<BR>
The other choice for speed is to use low-powered, slow switches. You make
them so small and jam them so close together, the signals get to their destinations
nearly as fast as the high-powered signals. This approach works well in
the microprocessor industry and in the human brain.<BR>
<BR>
Despite occasional deviations at Cray and IBM, low and slow has been the
secret of all success in semiconductors from the outset. Inventor William
Shockley substituted slow, low-powered transistors for faster, high-powered
vacuum tubes. Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments replaced fast germanium with
slower silicon. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild spurned the fast track of mountainous
Mesa transistors to adopt a flat &quot;planar&quot; technology in which
devices were implanted below the surface of the chip. Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce then substituted slow resistors and capacitors as well as slow transistors
on integrated circuits for faster, high-powered devices on modules and printed
circuit boards. Federico Faggin made possible the microprocessor by replacing
fast metal gates on transistors with slow gates made of polysilicon. Frank
Wanlass and others replaced faster NMOS and PMOS technologies with the 1,000
times slower and 10 times lower-power Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors
(CMOS) that now rule the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Low and slow finds its roots in the very physics of solid state, separating
the microcosm from the macrocosm. Chips consist of complex patterns of wires
and switches. In the macrocosm of electromechanics, wires were simple, fast,
cool, reliable and virtually free; switches were vacuum tubes, complex,
fragile, hot and expensive. In the macrocosm, the rule was economize on
switches, squander on wires. But in the microcosm, all these rules of electromechanics
collapsed.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, switches are almost free--a few millionths of a cent.
Wires are the problem. However fast they may be, longer wires laid down
on the chip and more wires connected to it translated directly into greater
resistance and capacitance and more needed power and resulting heat. These
problems become exponentially more acute as wire diameters drop. On the
other hand, the shorter the wires the purer the signal and the smaller the
resistance, capacitance and heat.<BR>
<BR>
This fact of physics is the heart of microelectronics. As electron movements
approach their mean free path-- he distance they can travel &quot;ballistically&quot;
without bouncing off the internal atomic structure of the silicon--they
get faster, cheaper and cooler.<BR>
<BR>
At the quantum level, noise plummets and bandwidth explodes. Tunneling electrons,
the fastest of all, emit virtually no heat at all. It was a new quantum
paradox; the smaller the space the more the room, the narrower the switches
the broader the bandwidth, the faster the transport the lower the noise.
As transistors are jammed more closely together, the power delay product--the
crucial index of semiconductor performance combining switching delays with
heat emission--improves as the square of the number of transistors on a
single chip.<BR>
<BR>
Since the breakthrough to CMOS in the early 1980s, however, the industry
has been slipping away from the low and slow regime. Falling for the electromechanical
temptation, they are substituting fast metals for slow polysilicon. For
better performance, companies are increasingly turning to gallium arsenide
and silicon germanium technologies. Semiconductor engineers are increasingly
crowding the surface of CMOS with as many as four layers of fast aluminum
wires, with tungsten now in fashion among the speed freaks of the industry
. The planar chips that built Silicon Valley have given way to high sierras
of metal, interlarded with uneven spreads of silicon dioxide and other insulators.
Meanwhile, the power used on each chip is rising rapidly, since the increasing
number of transistors and layers of metal nullify a belated move to three-volt
operation from the five volts adopted with Transistor Transistor Logic in
1971. And as the industry loses touch with its early inspiration of low
and slow, the costs of wafer fabrication continue to rise--to an extent
that even demoralizes Gordon Moore.<BR>
<BR>
In radically transforming the methods of semiconductor fabrication, John
Moussouris and James (&quot;Al&quot;) Matthews, MicroUnity's director of
technology, seem to many observers to be embarking on a reckless and self-defeating
course. But MicroUnity is betting on the redemptive paradoxes of the microcosm.
Returning to low and slow, Moussouris and Matthews promise to increase peak
clock speeds by a factor of five in the next two years and chip performance
by factors of several hundred, launching communications chips in 1995 that
function at 1.2 gigahertz and perform as many as 400 gigabits per second.<BR>
<H4>Matthews and Mead</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pursuing this renewal of wafer fabrication at MicroUnity, Matthews has
applied for some 70 patents and won about 20 to date. A veteran of Hewlett-Packard's
bipolar process labs who moved to Intel in the early 1980s and spearheaded
Intel's switch to CMOS for the 386 microprocessor, Matthews has also worked
as an engineer at HP-Avantek's gallium arsenide fabs for microwave chips.
Commanding experience in diverse fab cultures, Matthews thus escapes the
cognitive trap of seeing the established regime as a given, rather than
a choice.<BR>
<BR>
At Aventek, Matthews plunged toward the microcosm and prepared the way for
his MicroUnity process after reading an early paper by Carver Mead, the
inventor of the gallium arsenide MESFET transistor. Mead had prophesied
that the behavior of these transistors would deteriorate drastically if
the feature sizes were pushed below two-tenths of a micron at particular
doping levels (technically impossible at the time). In the mid-1980s, though,
Matthews noticed that these feature sizes were then feasible. Testing the
Mead thesis, he was startled to discover that far from deteriorating below
the Mead threshold, these transistors instead showed &quot;startlingly anomalous
levels of good behavior,&quot; marked by high gain and plummeting noise.<BR>
<BR>
Based on this discovery, he created a low-noise, gigahertz-frequency amplifier
for satellite dishes being sold in the European market. Matthew's process
reduced the cost so drastically that Sony officials were said to be contemplating
claims of dumping. Avantek was charging a few dollars for microwave frequency
chips that cost Sony perhaps some hundreds of dollars to make.<BR>
<BR>
Having discovered the &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot; of gallium arsenide
devices pushed beyond the theoretical limits, Matthews at MicroUnity decided
to experiment with bipolar devices. Bipolar devices are usually used at
high power levels with so-called emitter coupled logic to achieve high speeds
in supercomputers and other advanced machines. Inspired by his breakthrough
with gallium arsenide, Matthews believed that biopolar performance also
might be radically different at extremely low power--under half a volt and
at gate lengths approaching the so-called Debye limit, near one-tenth of
a micron.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, Matthews was startled by &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot;
as processes approached the quantum mechanical threshold. It turned out
that at high frequencies biopolar transistors use far less power even the
CMOS transistors, famous for their low-power characteristics. At these radio-frequency
speeds, however, he discovered that the transistors could not operate with
aluminum wires insulated by oxide. Therefore, he introduced a technique
he had used with fast bipolar and gallium arsenide devices: gold wires insulated
by air. Replacing oxide insulators with &quot;air bridges&quot; drastically
reduces the capacitance of the wires and allows the transistor to operate
at speeds impossible with conventional device structures.<BR>
<BR>
With these adventures in the microcosm behind him, Matthews was ready to
develop a new process and technology for MicroUnity. Based on combining
the best features of biopolar and CMOS at radially small geometries, the
new technology uses bipolar logic functioning at gigahertz clock speeds,
with CMOS retained chiefly for memory cells and with gold air bridges for
the metalization layers. Perhaps it is a portent that the gold wires across
the top of the chip repeat the most controversial feature of Jack Kilby's
original integrated circuit. (Matthews is also seeking patents for methods
of using optical communications on the top of a silicon chip).<BR>
<BR>
In essence, Matthews is returning to low and slow. He is shearing off the
sierras of metal and oxides and restoring the planar surfaces of Jean Hoerni.
Because the surface is flat to a tolerance of one-tenth of a micron, photolithography
gear can function at higher resolution despite a narrow depth of field.
Elimination of the aluminum sierras also removes a major source of parasitic
currents and transistors and allows smaller polysilicon devices to be implanted
closer together. A major gain from these innovations is a drastic move to
lower power transistors. Rather than using the usual three volts or five
volts, the MicroUnity devices operate at 0.3 volts to 0.5 volts (300 to
500 millivolts). In the microcosm, smaller devices closer together at lower
power is the secret of speed.<BR>
<BR>
Although MicroUnity will not divulge the details of future products, ASAP
calculates on the basis of information from other sources that the MicroUnity
chip can hold more than 10 million transistors in a space half the size
of a Pentium with three million transistors. With lower power transistors
set closer together, the MicroUnity chip can operate with a clock rate as
much as 10 times faster than most current microprocessors and at an overall
data rate more than 100 times faster. Low and slow results in blazing speed.<BR>
<BR>
For ordinary microprocessor applications, an ultrafast clock is superfluous.
Since ordinary memory technology is falling ever farther behind processor
speeds, fast clocks mean complex arrangements of cache on cache of fast
static RAM and specialized video memory chips. By using the MicroUnity technology
at the relatively slow clock rates of a Pentium, MicroUnity might be able
to produce Pentiums that use from five to 10 times less power--enabling
new generations of portable equipment.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity, however, is not building a CPU but a communications processor.
In the communications world, the fast clock rate gives the &quot;mediaprocessor&quot;
the ability to couple to broadband pipes using high radio frequencies. Most
crucially, the mediaprocessor can connect to the radio frequency transmissions
over cable coax.<BR>
<BR>
Along with Bill Gates, one of the leading enthusiasts of MicroUnity is John
Malone, who for the last year has been celebrating its potential to create
a &quot;Cray on a tray&quot; for his set-top boxes and cable modems. For
the rest of this decade, most Americans will be able to connect to broadband
networks only over cable coax. Thus the link of TCI to MicroUnity and to
Tiger offers the best promise of an information infrastructure over the
next five years, affording a potential increase in bandwidth of 250,000-fold
over the current four-kilohertz telephone wires.<BR>
<BR>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies and the cable companies agree that
cable coax is the optimal broadband conduit to homes and that fiber optics
is the best technology for connecting central switches or headends to neighborhoods.
Looping through communities, with a short drop at each home--rather than
running a separate wire from the central office to every household--hybrid
fiber-coax networks, according to a Pacific Bell study can reduce the cost
of setup and maintenance of connections by some 75% and cut back the need
for wire by a factor of 600.<BR>
<BR>
In order to bring broadband video to homes, companies must collaborate with
the cable TV industry. Collaborating with TCI, Microsoft once again has
chosen the correct technology to leverage. With Digital Equipment, Zenith
and Intel all engaged in alliances for the creation of cable modems--and
several other companies announcing cable modem projects--Gates may well
be leading the pack in transforming his company from a computer company
into a communications concern, from the microcosm into the telecosm.<BR>

<BR>
All the bandwidth in the world, however, will get you nowhere if your transceiver
cannot process it. By returning to the inspiration of the original Silicon
Valley, MicroUnity offers a promising route to the communications infrastructure
of the next century, overthrowing Moore's Law and issuing the first fundamental
challenge to Moore's company. As Al Matthews puts it: &quot;Bob Noyce [the
late Intel founder with Gordon Moore] is my hero. But there is a new generation
at hand in Silicon Valley today, and this generation is doing things that
Bob Noyce never dreamed of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Moussouris promises to deliver 10,000 mediaprocessors for set-top boxes
in 1995. As everyone agrees, this is a high-risk project (although Bill
Gates favorably compares MicroUnity's risk to his other gamble, Teledesic).
Even if it takes years for MicroUnity to reach its telecosmic millennium,
the advance of communications processors continues to accelerate. Already
available today, for example, is Texas Instruments' MVP system--the first
full-fledged mediaprocessor on one chip. It will function at a mere 30 to
50 megahertz but performs between two and three billion signal processing
steps per second or roughly between 1,000 and 1,500 DSP mips. Rather than
revving up the clock to gigahertz frenzies, TI gained its performance through
a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data approach associated with the massively
parallel supercomputer industry. The MVP combines four 64-bit digital signal
processors with a 32-bit RISC CPU, a floating point unit, two video controllers,
64 kilobytes of static RAM cache and a 64-bit direct memory access controller--all
on one sliver of silicon, costing some $ 232 per thousand mips in 1995,
when Pentiums will give you a hundred mips for perhaps twice as much.<BR>
<BR>
This does not favor the notion that microprocessors will soon &quot;suck
in&quot; DSPs. DSP mips and computer mips are different animals. As DSP
guru Will Strauss points out, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a microprocessor
mips rating must be divided by about five to get a DSP mips rating.&quot;
To equal an MVP for DSP operations, a microprocessor would have to achieve
some 5,000 mips.<BR>
<BR>
Designed with the aid of teleconferencing company VTEL and Sony, the MVP
chip can simultaneously encode or decode video using any favored compression
scheme, process audio, faxes or input from a scanner and perform speech
recognition or other pattern-matching algorithms. While Intel and Hewlett-Packard
have been winning most of the headlines for their new RISC processing alliance,
the key development in the microprocessor domain is the emergence of this
new class of one-chip multimedia communications systems.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. Over the next decade, computer speeds will rise about
a hundredfold, while bandwidth increases a thousandfold or more. Under these
circumstances, the winners will be the companies that learn to use bandwidth
as a substitute for computer processing and switching. The winners will
be the companies that most truly embrace the Sun slogan: &quot;The network
is the computer.&quot; As Schmidt predicts, over the next few years &quot;the
value-added of the network will so exceed the value-added of the CPU that
your future computer will be rated not in mips but in gigabits per second.
Bragging rights will go not to the person with the fastest CPU but to the
person with the fastest network--and associated database lookup, browsing
and information retrieval engines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm will eclipse the law of the microcosm as the driving
force of progress. Springing from the exponential improvement in the power
delay product as transistors are made smaller, the law of the microcosm
holds that if you take any number (N) transistors and put them on a single
sliver of silicon you will get N squared performance and value. Conceived
by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, the law of the telecosm holds
that if you take any number (n) computers and link them in networks, you
get n squared performance and value. Thus the telecosm builds on and compounds
the microcosmic law. The power of Tiger, MicroUnity and TCI comes from fusing
the two laws into a gathering tide of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
With network technology advancing 10 times as fast as central processors,
the network and its nodes will become increasingly central while CPUs become
increasingly peripheral. Faced with a CPU bottleneck, multimedia systems
will simply bypass the CPU on broadband pipes. Circumventing Amdahl's Law,
system designers will adapt their architectures to exploit the high bandwidth
components, such as mediaprocessors, ATM switches and fiber links. In time
the microprocessor will become a vestigial link to the legacy systems such
as word processing and spreadsheets that once defined the machine. All of
this means that while the last two decades have been the epoch of the computer
industry, the next two decades will belong to the suppliers of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The chief beneficiaries of all this invention, however, will be the people
of the world, ascending to new pinnacles of prosperity in an Information
Age. Although many observers fear that these new tools will chiefly aid
the existing rich--or the educated and smart--these technologies have already
brought prosperity to a billion Asians, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia
and China, previously mired in penury.<BR>
<BR>
Communications bandwidth is not only the secret of electronic progress.
It is also the heart of economic growth, stretching the webs of interconnection
that extend the reach of markets and the realms of opportunity. Lavishing
the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly productive
tools and unleashing creativity with increasingly fertile and targeted capital,
the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope to the masses of people
whom the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>

&quot;They'll Be Crowding The Skies.&quot;
</B></PRE>
THUS STEVEN DORFMAN, president of telecommunications and space operations
for GM Hughes_the colossus of the satellite industry_warned the world of
a new peril in the skies. Planning to launch 840 satellites in low earth
orbits, at an altitude of some 435 miles, were a gang of cellular phone
jocks and computer hackers from Seattle going under the name of Teledesic.
Led by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, they were barging onto his turf and threatening
to ruin the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
You get the image of the heavens darkening and a new Ice Age looming as
more and more of this low-orbit junk_including a total of some 1,200 satellites
from Motorola's Iridium, Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar and Teledesic, among
other LEO projects_accumulates in the skies. Ultimately, from this point
of view, you might imagine the clutter of LEOs eclipsing the geostationary
orbit itself, the so-called Clarke belt, some 21,000 miles farther out.
Named after science-fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke, the geostationary orbit
is the girdle and firmament of the Hughes empire.<BR>
<BR>
In an article in Wireless magazine in 1945, Clarke first predicted that
satellites in orbit 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers) above the equator,
where the period of revolution is 24 hours, could maintain a constant elevation
and angle from any point on Earth. In such a fixed orbit, a device could
remain for decades, receiving signals from a transmitter on the earth and
radiating them back across continents.<BR>
<BR>
The Clarke orbit also posed a problem, however_the reverse square law for
signal power. Signals in space attenuate in proportion to the square of
the distance they travel. This means that communications with satellites
22,000 miles away typically require large antenna dishes (as much as 10
meters wide) or megawatts of focused beam power.<BR>
<BR>
Now, however, a new satellite industry is emerging, based on gains in computer
and microchip technology. These advances allow the use of compact handsets
with small smart antennas that can track low earth orbit satellites sweeping
across the skies at a speed of 25,000 kilometers an hour at a variety of
altitudes between 500 and 1,400 kilometers above the earth. Roughly 60 times
nearer than geostationary satellites, LEOs find the inverse square law working
in their favor, allowing them to offer far more capacity, cheaper and smaller
antennas, or some combination of both. Breaking out of the Clarke orbit,
these systems vastly expand the total available room for space-based communications
gear.<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed possible to &quot;crowd&quot; the Clarke belt_a relatively
narrow swath at a single altitude directly above the equator. But even this
swath does not become physically congested; collisions are no problem. The
Clarke belt becomes crowded because the ability of antennas on the ground
to discriminate among satellites is limited by the size of the antenna.
Spaceway and Teledesic both plan to use the Ka band of frequencies, between
17 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second. In this
band, reasonably sized antennas 66 centimeters wide can distinguish between
geostationary satellites two degrees apart. That's some 800 miles in the
Clarke belt. Thus no physical crowding. But it means that there are only
a total of 180 Clarke slots for Ka band devices, including undesirable space
over oceans.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs, however, can be launched anywhere between the earth's atmosphere and
a layer of intense radiation called the Van Allen Belt. The very concept
of crowding becomes absurd in this 900 kilometer span of elevations for
moving orbits that can be 500 meters apart or less. Thus the 21 proposed
orbital planes of Teledesic occupy a total of 10 kilometers of altitude.
At this rate, 70 or more Teledesic systems, comprising some 65,000 satellites,
could comfortably fit in low earth orbits.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, it was clear that the LEOs, one way or another, were crowding
Hughes. Hughes commands satellite systems or projects that compete with
every one of the LEOs. Hughes responded to the threat of Teledesic by announcing
the expansion of its Spaceway satellite system, then planned for North America
alone, to cover the entire globe. Then, invoking the absolute priority currently
granted geostationary systems, Hughes asked the Federal Communications Commission
to block Teledesic entirely by assigning Spaceway the full five gigahertz
of spectrum internationally available in the Ka band.<BR>
<BR>
On May 27, Dorfman summoned the upstarts, Craig McCaw and Teledesic President
Russell Daggatt, to Hughes headquarters in Los Angeles for a talk. Busy
with Microsoft_the Redmond, Wash., company that in 1993 temporarily surpassed
the market value of General Motors_Teledesic partner Bill Gates did not
make the trip. But as the epitome of the personal computer industry, his
presence haunted the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Together with Spaceway chief Kevin McGrath, Dorfman set out to convince
the Seattle venturers to give up their foolhardy scheme and instead join
with Hughes in the nine satellites of Spaceway. Not only could Spaceway's
nine satellites cover the entire globe with the same services that Teledesic's
840 satellites would provide, Spaceway could be expanded incrementally as
demand emerged. Just loft another Hughes satellite. Indeed, Spaceway's ultimate
system envisaged 17 satellites. With &quot;every component proprietary to
Hughes,&quot; as Dorfman said, the satellites only cost some $ 150 million
apiece. By contrast, most of the $ 9 billion Teledesic system would have
to be launched before global services could begin.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the new LEOs marked as decisive a break in the history of space-based
communications as the PC represented in the history of computing. Moreover,
Teledesic would be the only LEO fully focused on serving computers_the first
truly &quot;global Internet,&quot; as McCaw's vice president Tom Alberg
depicted it. It brings space communications at last into the age of ubiquitous
microchip intelligence, and it brings the law of the microcosm into space
communications.<BR>
<BR>
If you enjoyed the New World of Wireless on the ground with its fierce battles
between communications standards, technical geniuses, giant companies, impetuous
entrepreneurs and industrial politicians on three continents_you will relish
the reprise hundreds and even thousands of miles up. Launching Teledesic,
McCaw and Gates were extending bandwidth abundance from earth into space.
Observers, however, often did not like what they heard.

Bad Press For Two Billionaires
</B></PRE>
Every so often, the media is taken by the notion of technology as a morality
tale. In place of a gripping saga of unjustly obscure geniuses enriching
the world by their heroic creativity in the teeth of uncomprehending bureaucrats
and politicians, the media treat technology ventures as a school for scandal.
We have mock exposes of computer hype, monopoly, vaporware, viruses, infoscams,
netporn, securities &quot;fraud&quot; and deviously undocumented software
calls. Pundits gabble endlessly about the gap yawning between the information
rich and the information poor, thus consigning themselves undeniably, amid
many yawns, to the latter category. While American market share climbs near
70% in computers, networks, software and leading-edge semiconductors, analysts
furrow the brows of the Atlantic Monthly with tales of farseeing foreign
teams, spearheaded by visionary government officials, capturing the markets
of American cowboy capitalists. They spiel implausible yams of tough-minded
trade warriors prying open the jaws of Japan for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us,
closing down vicious Korean vendors of low-priced dynamic RAMs, or blasting
through barriers to U.S. telecom gear in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, saving
the day for Motorola's soon-to-be cobwebbed factories for analog cellular
phones.<BR>
<BR>
One of these sagas began early this year with two Seattle billionaires,
McCaw and Gates, allegedly boarding McCaw's sleek yacht and going on an
ego trip. With McCaw pitching in an early nickel, and the boat, and Gates
hoisting his name as a sail, the two tycoons seemed to sweep away from the
shores of rationality, as the media told it, into a sea of microwaves and
arsenic. Spinning out Teledesic to build an information superhighway in
the sky, they proposed to strew the heavens with 840 satellites, plus 84
spares. All would whirl around the world at a height of 700 kilometers (435
miles), using what they told the FCC would be some 500 million gallium arsenide
microchips to issue frequencies between 20 and 60 gigahertz from some 180,000
phased-array antennas. The entire project seemed suffused with gigahertz
and gigabucks. &quot;We're bandwidth bulls,&quot; says Teledesic President
Daggatt.<BR>
<BR>
In case the hype of the sponsors failed to keep the system radiant and aloft,
fueling it also would be a total of 12,000 batteries fed by thin film solar
collectors stretching out behind the satellite &quot;birds&quot; in some
130 square kilometers of gossamer wings. Working at 4% efficiency, these
cells would collectively generate 10 megawatts of power, enough to light
a small city, but, so the critics said, insufficient to reach Seattle at
microwave frequencies in the rain. (The Teledesic frequencies are readily
absorbed by water in the air). To manage the elaborate mesh of fast-packet
communications among the satellites and ground terminals, the constellation
would bear some 282,000 Mips, or millions of instructions per second, of
radiation-hard microprocessors and a trillion bytes or so of rad-hard RAM.
In effect, Teledesic would be launching into space one of the world's largest
and most expensive massively parallel computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
At a mere $ 9 billion, to be put up by interested investors, Teledesic's
lawyers told the FCC, the price would be a bargain for the U.S. and the
world. (By contrast, current plans call for $ 15 billion just to lay fiber
for interactive TV in California). But former Motorola, now Kodak, chief
George Fisher fresh from pondering numbers for the apparently similar Iridium
projects_suggested that $ 40 billion for Teledesic would be more like it.
(Teledesic had the improbable result of making Iridium's 66-satellite plan,
greeted in 1990 with much of the scorn now lavished on Teledesic, seem modest).
Just rocketing the 840 satellites into orbit was said to entail a successful
launch every week for a year and a half at a time when hoisting satellites
is still a precarious and sometime thing.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Teledesic succeeded in getting the things up, so other scientists
suggested, the satellites would then be impaled on some 7,000 pieces of
space debris in the chosen orbits. In any case, so it was widely reported,
10% would fail every year, some tumbling out of orbit, others joining the
whirl of litter, where they would fly ready to impale the remainder of the
satellites and the remnants of the two billionaires' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Surely these sages know that by the year 2001, when the systems would be
up and running, the world will be swimming in the bandwidth of &quot;information
superhighways.&quot; Why support this lavish launch of technology for a
communications system that would be dwarfed by capabilities already demonstrated
on the ground?<BR>
<BR>
Summing up a near-consensus of critics, John Pike, director of the Federation
of American Scientists' Space Policy Project, declared to the Wall Street
Journal, &quot;God save us. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of!&quot;
Provoking Pike may have been the origins of the multisatellite architecture
in the Star Wars &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; program. Teledesic's most
amazing achievement to date has been to displace the Strategic Defense Initiative
as Pike's peak example of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
While McCaw and Gates could be dismissed as tyros in the satellite field,
Hughes is world champion. Since 1963, the company has put 107 communications
satellites into orbit. With 19 in 1994, this year should be its biggest
ever. In 1993, well before the Teledesic announcement, Dorfman announced
the first version of Spaceway_a $ 660 million, two-satellite system offering
voice, data and video services_as a contribution to &quot;information superhighways.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of all the terrestrial uproar surrounding superhighwaymen Al
Gore, John Malone of TCI, Raymond Smith of Bell Atlantic and scores of other
telco and cable magnates, however, no one paid much attention to Hughes.<BR>
<BR>
Then came Gates and McCaw with Teledesic and claims of 20 million potential
subscribers, two million simultaneous connections, billion-bit-per-second
&quot;gigalinks,&quot; bandwidth on demand and an array of other features,
all advertised at a cost for Spaceway-type services nearly three times lower
per bit per second. Everyone noticed Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of July, though, Hughes raised the stakes. With successful launches
under way in China, Brazil and French Guiana to provide exclamation points,
Hughes made a new submission to the FCC, extending Spaceway into a nine-satellite
global system costing $ 3.2 billion. McGrath plausibly claimed it could
be in place long before Teledesic and offer nearly all its functionality
at a third of the price.<BR>
<BR>
Already planned to be in place by 1998, however, were several other LEO
projects, led by Motorola's Iridium and Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar. As
mobile phone projects, these systems could not readily offer service at
T-1 data rates. But their sponsors promised availability for simple E-mail,
faxes and paging.<BR>
<BR>
By mid-1994, Motorola seemed to command the financial momentum. The company
succeeded in raising some $ 800 million in equity investments from companies
around the globe, including Lockheed and Raytheon (which would build the
satellites), Great Wall of China and Khrunichev Enterprises of Russia (which
together would launch a third of them), the Mawarid Group of Saudi Arabia
(which pitched in $ 120 million) and Kyocera, Mitsui and DDI, which together
put up another $ 120 million (Kyocera will build the dual mode handsets
for Japan and DDI will sell and service them). On August 10, an Indian consortium
purchased a 5% stake and a seat on the board for $ 38 million. Motorola
claimed its share of the equity was dropping to 28.5%, well on the way to
the company's final target of 15%. Motorola estimates that much of the additional
$ 2 billion in the plan could come from debt securities and loans.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's attractions are impressive. It provides ubiquitous global phone
service at a premium price with little or no dependence on local terrestrial
facilities. In times of disaster or political crisis, or in places with
sparse or unreliable local service, the system can route calls among the
66 satellites in space bypassing all infrastructure on the ground. For an
elite of government officials and corporate figures operating in remote
areas, the availability of Iridium should be worth the money. A bold and
visionary concept when it emerged in 1987 from a team in the company's satellite
systems engineering group, it endows many regions of the earth with voice
and limited data communications for the first time. For example, it actually
focuses on polar domains, such as parts of Siberia, poorly served by other
satellite systems. Kazuo Inamori, the venerable chairman of Kyocera, also
believes that Iridium will be popular in the 60% of territorial Japan not
currently covered by cellular. 
<PRE>

&quot;Give Us Spectrum, Let Others Fight&quot;

</B></PRE>
None-the-less, beyond the bold and ingenious concept (Daggatt calls Iridium
&quot;the real pioneer of LEOs&quot;), the system suffers from technical
flaws. Were it not for Globalstar, perhaps these flaws would not have become
evident until alter the 66 birds were aloft. A far simpler and cheaper solution,
Globalstar uses 48 satellites with no links between them. Each functions
as a &quot;bent pipe&quot; transponder, receiving signals from a phone on
the ground and passing them back to any gateway within the satellite's 1,500-mile-wide
footprint, linked to locally available telephone networks. Because Globalstar
uses local phone systems rather than bypassing them, the system has been
able to raise a total of some $ 300 million in support from Alcatel, France
Telecom, Vodafone (serving the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong),
Airtouch-U S West, Hyundai and DACOM in Korea, Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia.<BR>
<BR>
This amount may seem small beside the billion raised by Iridium. But Globalstar
has capital costs (at $ 1.8 billion) one-half Iridium's, circuit costs one-third
Iridium's, and terminal costs (at $ 750 each) one-fourth Iridium's. With
no intelligence in space, Globalstar relies entirely on the advance of intelligent
phones and portable computer devices on the ground; it is the Ethernet of
satellite architectures. Costing one-half as much as Iridium, it will handle
nearly 20 times more calls.<BR>
<BR>
The advantages of Globalstar stem only partly from its avoidance of complex
intersatellite connections and use of infrastructure already in place on
the ground. More important is its avoidance of exclusive spectrum assignments.
Originating several years before spread-spectrum technology was thoroughly
tested for cellular phones, Iridium employs time division multiple access,
an obsolescent system that requires exclusive command of spectrum but offers
far less capacity than code division multiple access.<BR>
<BR>
Like conventional cellular or radio transmissions that differentiate signals
by time slot or frequency, TDMA sharply restricts the reuse of spectrum
in nearby cells. By contrast, CDMA is a form of spread-spectrum communications
that differentiates signals by a spreading code and allows the use of the
same frequencies all the time, everywhere. Just as you can reduplicate wireline
spectrum merely by laying another fiber, you can now manufacture new spectrum
in the air merely by breaking large cells into smaller ones.<BR>
<BR>
Among some six companies seeking low earth orbit satellite approval from
the FCC in 1993, only Iridium used TDMA, requiring national and international
bodies to pick it as a winner from the outset and assign it exclusive spectrum.
By contrast, in a majority report issued to the FCC on April 6, 1993, CDMA
companies in the U.S., including TRW, Loral-Qualcomm, Celsat and American
Mobile Satellite, could all agree to share spectrum and let the market choose
winners. A Motorola lawyer explained to Space News, &quot;Give us the spectrum
and let the others fight for whatever's left.&quot; In the face of alternatives
with no need for exclusive spectrum allocations, Iridium could fly only
if it offered radically superior performance or capacity. But TDMA dooms
it to generally inferior performance and capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TDMA systems, which can &quot;see&quot; only one satellite signal
at a time, CDMA handsets have &quot;path&quot; diversity, using &quot;rake
receivers&quot; that can combine a number of weak signals into an intelligible
stream. Iridium and other TDMA systems compensate by using more power. But
no practical amount of power can propel a satellite signal through a tin
roof. And excess power means larger handsets or heavier satellites. Iridium
satellites together use 80% more power than Globalstar's, yet employ antennas
nearly twice as large and offer 18.2 times less capacity per unit area.
<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic also suffers from the use of TDMA. But Teledesic's T-1 capabilities
would compensate with 100,000 times more bandwidth and with a bit error
rate that can accommodate the new fiber standards such as SONET-ATM (synchronous
optical network/asynchronous transfer mode), which send packets without
retransmission. The issue is whether these features can justify the political,
financial, and performance costs of using a modulation scheme_TDMA_that
severely limits spectrum sharing and path diversity.<BR>
<BR>
So what is this, another saga of hubris on the information super-highway_to
go with the Raymond Smith-John Malone follies? Perhaps good new ideas are
harder to come by as company revenues grow into the billions, and Gates
and McCaw disinvest and diversify as fast as they can from their increasingly
cumbrous vessels of wealth. Having recently passed the billion-dollar mark
in his systematic process of disinvestment from Microsoft_he retains $ 8
billion or so_Gates at times seemed embarrassed by his link to this gigantic
project. He told us it was too early to write about Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
No, the story is in fact more interesting. Impelled by the onrushing rise
in the cost-effectiveness of individual chips compared to multichip systems,
the Law of the Microcosm dictates decentralization of all information architectures.
During the 1980s, this centrifuge struck the mainframe computer establishment
of IBM. During the 1990s, the personal teleputer, summoning and shaping
films and files of images from around the world, will collide with the centralized
establishments of TV broadcasting. At the end of the century, Teledesic
and the other LEOs will usher in the age of decentralization in space.<BR>
<BR>
From this point of view, Gates' participation becomes more readily intelligible.
Gates seems always to follow the microcosm wherever it leads. A vision of
software for decentralized systems of personal computers informs everything
Microsoft does. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, for example, Microsoft made an investment in Metricom, a wireless
terrestrial system that supplies links of up to 56 kilobits per second to
portable computers or personal digital assistants. Within cells, the devices
can communicate directly with one another; outside the cell, Metricom routes
its calls through an expandable mesh of nodes each the size of a shoebox
and costing less than $ 1,000. Based on spread-spectrum technology, the
system operates at power levels low enough to avoid the need for FCC licenses.
Yet it can be expanded to metropolitan-area dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
In many respects, Teledesic is Metricom in the sky. It is focused on computer
communications. It routes packets by the most convenient path through a
mesh of nodes. It is based on microprocessor technology. (Both Teledesic
and Metricom plan to employ devices from Motorola's 68000 family). As Gates
explains the system: &quot;Some functions are most efficiently performed
by large numbers of small processors working together, rather than a few
large ones.&quot; The entire new generation of low earth orbit satellite
systems relies on this centrifugal force of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
It was not supposed to happen this way. Just as Grosch's Law of the computer
industry implied that computer power rose by the square of the cost, there
was a similar law of the satellite industry that held satellite efficiency
to be proportional to see. In a popular text, &quot;Communications Satellite
Systems,&quot; published in 1978, James Martin cited an AT&T study showing
that just six satellites could carry all the long-distance traffic from
the American continent; no fiber optics would be necessary. &quot;The next
major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of
scale which today's technology offers,&quot; wrote Martin, urging creation
of &quot;massive hardware&quot; as heavy as several tons and &quot;immensely
powerful satellites with large antennas beaming as much information as we
are capable of using to our rooftops.&quot; Many satellite advocates, led
by Arthur C. Clarke, viewed with impatient scorn the expensive terrestrial
systems that somehow forestalled the manifest destiny of big birds to rule
the world of communications. 
<PRE>
<B>

Bringing The Microcosm To Space
</B></PRE>
In 1994, the big bird dream still flourishes in Spaceway, the international
consortium Inmarsat, and the new launch this summer of direct broadcast
satellite technology by Hughes's DirecTV, Hubbard's USSB, TCI's Primestar,
and Rupert Murdoch's imperial systems in Europe and Asia. Using centralized
satellites in geosynchronous orbits, DBS is the ultimate broadcast medium,
reaching billions of potential customers at the cost of reaching hundreds
of thousands through cable-TV systems. But these geostationary satellite
systems suffer from the same flaws as mainframes: sclerosis by centralization.
At a time when customers want the choice, control, convenience and interactivity
of computers, the big birds offer one-size-fits-all programming at specified
times, with little ability to control the flow or interact with it.<BR>
<BR>
The real showstopper in the long run, though, is a nagging half-second time
delay for Clarke orbit signals. Bad enough for voice, a half-second is near
eternity for computer communications; for the living-room and desktop supercomputers
of 2001, a half-second delay would mean gigabytes of information to be stored
in buffers. While companies across the country, from Intel to Digital Equipment,
are rushing to market with cable modems to allow computer connections to
CATV coax, geosatellites remain mostly computer-hostile. Even with the new
digital cosmetics of DBS, geosynchronous satellites are a last vestige of
centralization in a centrifugal world.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Teledesic brings the microcosm to space. Rather than gaming
economies of scale from using a few huge satellites, Teledesic gains economies
of scale by launching as many small birds as possible. Based on Peter Huber's
concept of a geodesic network_a mesh of peers equally spaced apart like
the nodes in a geodesic dome_Teledesic is not a hierarchy but a heterarchy.
Distributing the system responsibilities among 840 autonomous satellites
diminishes the requirements, such as message throughput and power usage,
for each one. Building redundancy into the entire constellation, rather
than within each satellite, yields higher overall reliability, while reducing
the complexity and price of each unit.<BR>
<BR>
As Craig McCaw explains, &quot;At a certain point, redundant systems create
more complexity and weight than they are worth. Rather than having each
satellite a 747 in the sky with triply redundant systems, we have hundreds
of satellites that offer self-redundancy.&quot; Eschewing the Hughes philosophy
of &quot;every component proprietary to Hughes,&quot; Teledesic will manufacture
and launch a large number of satellite peers, using off-the-shelf parts
whenever possible. This approach also provides economies of scale that,
according to a study by brilliant pebbles contractor Martin Marietta, could
lower unit costs by a factor of one hundred or more.<BR>
<BR>
Just as microcosmic technology uses infinitesimal low-powered transistors
and puts them so close together that they work faster than large high-powered
transistors, Teledesic satellites follow the rules of low and slow. Rather
than one big powerful bird spraying signals across continents, Teledesic
offers 840, programmably targetable at small localities. Just 435 miles
out, the delay is measured in milliseconds rather than half-seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The total computing power and wattage of the constellation seems large,
as is needed to sustain a volume of some two million connections at a time,
four times Spaceway's capacity. But with other link features equal, between
1,226 and 3,545 times more power is needed to communicate with a geostationary
satellite than with a LEO.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, unlike Iridium, TRW's Odyssey, and Globalstar, Teledesic
from the outset has targeted the fastest- growing market of the future:
communications for the world's 125 million PCs, now growing some 20% a year.
And Teledesic has correctly chosen the technology needed to extend computer
networks globally_broadband low earth orbit satellites. The real issue is
not the future of Teledesic but the future of Iridium.<BR>
<BR>
In the short run Iridium's voice services cannot compete with Globalstar's
cheaper and more robust CDMA system. But in the long run Iridium could be
trumped by Teledesic. Although Teledesic has no such plans, the incremental
cost of incorporating an &quot;L&quot; band transceiver in Teledesic, to
perform the Iridium functions for voice, would be just 10% of Teledesic's
total outlays, or less than $ 1 billion (compared with the $3.4 billion
initial capital costs of Iridium). But 840 linked satellites could offer
far more cost-effective service than Iridium's 66.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's dilemma is that the complexities and costs of its ingenious mesh
of intersatellite links and switches can be justified only by offering broadband
computer services. Yet Iridium is a doggedly narrowband system focused on
voice.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium eventually will have to adopt Teledesic's broadband logic and architecture.
To protect its global lead in wireless communications and equipment, Motorola
should join with Teledesic now, rather than later. Working with Lockheed,
Motorola is making impressive gains in satellite-manufacturing technology.
Supplying both handsets and space gear for computer networks, Motorola could
turn its huge investment of time, money and prestige in Iridium into a dramatic
global coup in wireless computer services. As part of a broadband system,
Iridium could still become a superb brand name for Motorola. But persisting
in a narrowband strategy in the name of avoiding Teledesic's larger initial
costs, Motorola's executives will end up inflicting serious strategic costs
on the company.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the famous objections to Teledesic are based on ignorance or misinformation.
Launch anxieties spring chiefly from the GEO experience. LEOs are 60 times
nearer and between a tenth and a third the weight. Teledesic satellites
are designed to be hoisted in groups of eight or more. From Great Wall in
China to Khrunichev in Russia, companies around the world will soon be competing
to supply low-cost launching facilities for the system. Orbital Sciences,
an entrepreneurial dervish near Washington's Dulles Airport with some $
190 million in revenues, has developed a low-cost method for lofting groups
of LEOs from an adapted Lockheed 1011 Tristar.<BR>
<BR>
Other fears are similarly fallacious. Teledesic will work fine in the rain
because the high minimum vertical angle (40 degrees) of its satellite links
from the ground reduces the portion of the path exposed to water to a manageable
level. By contrast, geostationary satellites must operate at eight degrees,
passing the signal through a long span of atmosphere. Made of tough new
composite materials, Teledesic satellites will endure the kind of debris
found in space mostly unscathed. The solar arrays can accept holes without
significantly damaging overall performance. All in all, Teledesic's designers
expect the birds to remain in orbit for an average of ten years. With most
of its key technologies plummeting in price along with the rest of electronic
components, the system may well cost even less and perform better than its
business plan promises or George Fisher speculates.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, widely charged with reckless technological presumption, the designers
of Teledesic in fact seem recklessly cautious in their assumptions about
the rate of microchip progress. For example, their dismissal of CDMA assumes
that the high speed of the spreading code functions_requiring digital signal
processors that race at least 100 times the data rate_pushes cheap T-1 performance
far into the future. Yet in early 1995, Texas Instruments will ship its
multimedia video processor, a marvel that combines four 64-bit DSPs, a 32-bit
RISC CPU, 50 kilobytes of on-chip memory, a floating-point unit and a 64bit
direct memory access controller all on one chip. This device now performs
two billion operations per second and, with an upgrade from 35 megahertz
to 50 megahertz clock rate, soon will perform three billion. The estimated
cost in 1995 is around $ 400, or a stunning $ 133 per bop (current Pentiums
charge three times as much for 100 mips). Five years from now, when Teledesic
gets serious, that kind of one-chip computing power can implement CDMA for
broadband data without any cost penalty. Future generations of CDMA systems
may be able to offer, at a dramatically lower price, the same broadband
services in mobile applications that Teledesic now promises for fixed services
only.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that Teledesic meets the CDMA challenge, the other fear is that
terrestrial systems will capture enough of the market to render Teledesic
unprofitable. This fear, however, can come true only if governments delay
this supremely beneficial system well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the competition, satellite systems can provide global coverage at
once. Whether for $ 9 billion or $ 90 billion, no terrestrial system will
cover the entire world, or even the entire U.S., within decades of Teledesic.
As soon as it is deployed, it will profoundly change the geography and topography
of the globe. Suddenly the most remote rural redoubt, beach, or mountain
will command computer communications comparable to urban corporations today.
The system can make teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine, and teleschooling
possible anywhere. Gone will be the differences among regions in access
to cultural and information resources. People will be able to live and work
where they want rather than where corporations locate them.<BR>
<BR>
This change transforms the dimensions of the world as decisively as trains,
planes, automobiles, phones and TVs changed them in previous eras. It will
extend &quot;universal service&quot; more dramatically than any new law
can.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Teledesic can eliminate the need to cross-subsidize rural customers.
Determining the cost of wire-line services are the parameters of population
density and distance from the central office. Rural customers now cost between
10 and 30 times as much to serve with wires as urban customers do. Teledesic
will bring near-broadband capabilities to everyone in the world at the same
price.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, this expansion of the communications frontier will foster
the very economic development that will fuel the demand for the service.
Today, it does not pay to bring telecommunications to poor countries that
might benefit most. Teledesic and other satellite services break the bottleneck
of development. Simultaneously opening the entire world, it enriches every
nation with new capital exceeding the fruits of all the foreign aid programs
of the era.<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic is a venture worthy of McCaw and Gates. In its impact on the world,
it may even rival the Herculean contributions of its sponsors in cellular
and software. The issue is not the technology or the commitment of the principals.
The issue is the readiness of the U.S. government to accommodate this venture.
Before Teledesic can be approved internationally, it will have to attain
a license from the FCC in the U.S. It has taken four years to approve Iridium.
It took 30 years to approve cellular. How long will it take to approve Teledesic?<BR>
<BR>
Currently Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar face several political obstacles.
The International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulation 2613 gives
GEOs absolute priority over LEOs. For Spaceway, Hughes is now demanding
an exclusive license for the full five gigahertz available in the Ka-band
worldwide, leaving no room for Teledesic or any other Ka-band LEO. Under
current law, Hughes or other GEO systems could usurp any LEO that was launched.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs are a major American innovation. The U.S. government should take the
lead now in spearheading a change in the regulations to accommodate LEOs.
This is no minor matter. As the dimensions and promise of Teledesic loom
more starkly, the Japanese or Europeans are certain to make similar proposals.
&quot;When they do,&quot; Craig McCaw predicts, &quot;they will immediately
have their government on board. They will be able to go to the ITU right
away. My greatest fear is that we will have the technology all ready, and
foreign companies will beat us out because they can get their governments
in line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government was on board for Apollo 25 years ago and the U.S. won
the first space race. This space race is just as important, but the government
is treating it as some sleepy-time infrastructure project. In fact, it is
the information superhighway going global and ubiquitous. It is the ultimate
promise of the information age, says McCaw.

Sustaining The U.S. Lead In Technology
</B></PRE>
McCaw explains: &quot;It'll mean ecological disaster if China mimics what
we did_building more and more urban towers and filling them up with people
who queue up every day on turnpikes into the city, emitting fumes into the
air, and then building new towers and new highways when you want to move
the company, and then digging up the highways to install new wires.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McCaw waves toward the window, out at Lake Washington. &quot;Look at that
floating bridge. It took $ 1.5 billion to cross Lake Washington, then it
got busted in a storm. Cross this lake, any lake, any ocean in the world
with broadband wireless. That's the promise of Teledesic. All you do is
to reconfigure the communications in software at zero incremental cost.
No wires for the final connections. It's what we do in Hong Kong and Shanghai,
where everyone uses a cellular phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Vice President Gore and other members of the administration
continually ask what they can do for technology. One thing they can do is
vastly streamline the process for approval of communications projects. At
the moment, Congress is determined to retain bureaucratic dominance over
the most dynamic enterprise and technology in the world economy_what they
like to term the information superhighway. They see it as a possible source
of congressional power, campaign finance, employment and pelf, like the
Baby Bells today or like existing construction projects. Rather than turn
telecom into a vast porkbellied poverty program, however, the administration
should deregulate the field. Communications companies must be permitted
to compete and collaborate wherever the technology leads.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the administration knows it or not, these technologies are its greatest
political asset. The high-tech industries unleashed in the 1980s by venture
capital and junk bonds are now the prime fuel of the economy of the 1990s.
Comprising perhaps 60% of incremental GDP and 48% of exports, the momentous
upsurge of computers and communications is even compensating for the mistakes
of the Bush and Clinton regimes and making plausible Clinton's continuing
claims of economic success. But now Clinton, Gore and FCC Chairman Reed
Hundt must make a choice. If they want to maintain this redemptive U.S.
lead in technology, they must be willing to forge new alliances in Congress
to get the politicians and bureaucrats out of the way of the future. A good
start would be to open the floodgates for the global onrush of low earth
orbit satellites dedicated to computer communications. If they do, they
can help make the world, as McCaw's Alberg puts it, &quot;a truly global
Internet in an ever-expanding ethersphere.&quot; 
<PRE>
<B>
And The Winner Is...
</B></PRE>
Globalstar is the easy winner for current offering of mobile phone services
under a CDMA regime of spectrum sharing. But Teledesic can add phone services
to its broadband computer system. Over time, Teledesic's 840 satellites
will outperform Globalstar's 48. Big question: When will microchip technology
advance enough to allow broadband applications over CDMA? When that happens,
Globalstar has a shot at the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium is both too expensive to compete in mobile phones and too narrowband
for data. Today's champ Spaceway is maturing. Big winner for the next decade
is... Teledesic.

<HR><BR>
Big Government and Mass Media always feed on fear of monsters. While politicians
promise to protect the people from the dreaded private sector, leading newspapers
such as the Washington Post and network shows such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
chime in with continuing reports on the economy as seen from the shores
of Loch Ness. Peering through the shifting, inscrutable murk of the marketplace,
pundits both private and public can descry beneath every ripple of industrial
change the spectral shape of some circling shark or serpent from which only
a new bureaucracy or liberal constabulary can save us.<BR>
<BR>
There are always many witnesses to the threat. In his campaigns of creative
destruction, any great capitalist provokes enough panic in the establishment
to fuel the beadles who would bring him down. Losing competitors, whether
in oil or software, are always in the vanguard of the monster hunt, which
is therefore usually launched in the name of &quot;competition&quot; and
is designed to stop it in its tracks before anyone wins.<BR>
<BR>
In the industrial era it was the so-called Robber Barons--creators of the
great industries of oil, steel and finance--who greased the growth of government
with their chimerical menace. Radically reducing the prices of their products,
such leaders as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan expanded the economy to
serve middle- and lower-income customers and laid the foundation for the
American industrial leadership that triumphed in two world wars. But at
the same time, charged with predatory pricing, collusive marketing dumping
and other competitive violations, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan emerged
as the monsters of monopoly who fueled the growth of government through
the first 40 years of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Now, with information technology driving private sector wealth and power,
there is a need for new monsters to fuel new sieges of government and regulatory
growth. This time the monsters bear the names of Milken, Gates and Malone--new
trolls to terrify little children and cause competitors to cozen Washington
and judges to reach for their RICO bludgeons and commissioners to salivate
and shuffle subpoenas and senators to tremble and wreak new tomes of law
and bureaucrats to sow the economy with minefields of abstruse new rules.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three new monsters, big government managed to deliver us first from
Michael Milken, depicted as a Banker Shark. But Milken's vision impregnably
survives in the form of the industries and infrastructures he financed,
chiefly cellular phones, fiber optics and cable television--the forces that
laid the foundation for a new broadband economy.<BR>
<BR>
With Milken laid low by cancer and the courts, Washington needed new monsters
for the 1990s. After serious and continuing contemplation of Bill Gates
as a possible MicroShark hidden amid the mazes of Windows and DOS, Washington
recently has focused on the formidable visage of John Malone.<BR>
<BR>
As the titan of cable and leader of Tele-Communications Inc., better known
as TCI, he was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Milken's bonds. At a time
when governments everywhere covet the huge, new wealth emerging from information
superhighways, Malone has become the favored target of the Loch Ness news
hounds and public-law pinstripes: an Abominable Snowman ranging down from
the Rockies to raid and ruin rival companies, terrorize politicians and
gouge his 21 million customers. Or, in the words of then Senator Albert
Gore, Malone is Darth Vader himself.<BR>
<BR>
This particular monster hunt, however, could not be more ill- timed. There
is no way that this administration can demonize the cable industry and micromanage
telecom without direly damaging all its hopes for an information superhighway
and thus the best prospects for the future of the U.S. economy. Just as
the automobile industry was the real heir to the triumphs of the &quot;robber
barons&quot; in oil, steel and finance, so the computer industry--the core
of U.S. world industrial leadership--will be the chief beneficiary of cable
and telecom ventures in broadband networks.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. now commands global dominance in computer technology. But as Andrew
Grove told Forbes ASAP, &quot;infinite processing power will only get you
so far with limited bandwidth.&quot; The next generation of computer progress
depends upon the efficient use of cable bandwidth to homes and home offices,
which comprise a fist-growing 60 percent of the current market for computers.
Even if computer executives fail to see the threat, the monster hunt against
cable thus jeopardizes the supreme achievement of the American economy over
the last decade--its global lead in computers.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government constantly reiterates its desire for information superhighways.
The problem is that punctuating the call for broadband nets is an insistent
mantra of &quot;competition&quot; that reverberates through the speeches
of nearly all participants in the debate. As Ward White, vice-president
of government affairs for the U.S. Telephone Association, points out, however,
this mantra of competition &quot;disguises a new scheme of market allocation
run by the regulators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In this competition no one can win or make any money. The $ 10 billion in
profits claimed by the Baby Bells still under the Greene thumb are highly
questionable. Most of their copper wires and narrowband switches--rapidly
obsolescing by any objective standard--are being written off over decades.
That means the real costs of the Bells should be much higher than their
announced costs, which do not adequately reflect the fact that their $ 300
billion worth of plant and equipment is rapidly losing market value. As
TCI's sharp and salty young COO, Brendan Clouston, points out, telephone
companies are used to pretending to make money under rate-of-return regulations
when they are really losing it.<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies, by contrast, are used to pretending to lose money when
in fact they are raking it in. A standing joke around the offices of John
Malone's cable empire, which comprises TCI and Liberty Media, asks what
Malone will do if the firm ever reports a large profit. The answer: Fire
the accountant. Indeed, TCI did not report even a cosmetic profit until
the first quarter of 1993. Cable firms were financed with junk bonds and
other debt that allows investors to be paid off with tax- deductible interest
payments rather than double-taxed dividends and capital gains favored by
the telcos.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Milken, the financial father of the cable industry, channeled some
$ 10 billion in high-yield securities to TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom
and other cable firms at a time when they were struggling for survival.
As a result, the cable companies are eight times more leveraged in their
debt-equity ratios than telephone companies are. But driven by the demands
of debt, the cable firms use their capital some two-and-a-half times more
efficiently. Generating $ 20 billion in revenues, one-fourth as much as
the telcos, cable firms use just one-tenth the capital.<BR>
<BR>
The cable companies are leveraged at a rate of between seven- and ten-to-one
on their cash flow. Moreover, some 60 percent of cable company assets are
&quot;good will.&quot; Included in the purchase price of new acquisitions,
&quot;good will&quot; represents the intangible value of cash flows and
synergies expected from new technologies and programming.<BR>
<BR>
Built on vision and debt, such entrepreneurial companies cannot invest without
the possibility of large returns. Attack the cable industry's cash flow
and prospects, and you attack its lifeline. Attack the cable industry's
cash flow and prospects, and you reduce its available investment by a factor
of five or more. Bell Atlantic was originally willing to pay for TCI nearly
12 times its cash flow. 
<PRE><B>

The Real Monster:  Government
</B></PRE>
In this highly leveraged arena government itself is the real monster: an
800-pound gorilla. Where does the 800-pound gorilla sit? Wherever it wants.
Early in April of this year it chose to sit on the cable industry. More
specifically, it plumped down in the middle of Brendan Clouston's desk in
the form of a 700-page FCC document reregulating the cable industry. It
was full of detailed regulations on everything from how fast he must pick
up his phones for customer complaints and what he should charge for each
tier of service and for each component of cable gear, to how large, implicitly,
his return on investment can be (about 11.5 percent). He faced the mandate
to adjust nearly every price and policy in the company within six weeks
and to justify each price by filling out 60 pages of forms. In a menacing
note for the future portending new government plans for redistributionist
pricing, he is required to report the median income in each of his service
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is not really to blame for this onslaught, since it resisted the
new congressional power grab. In any case, this agency is only part of Clouston's
problem. He also faces an aggressive new spirit at the Federal Trade Commission,
at the Department of Justice and in Congress, which permits him to collaborate
with any company as long as it is not a telephone firm with useful fiber
networks and switching systems in TCI's own regions. Full of rhetoric inviting
every industry from the telcos to the power companies into the cable trade,
many of the legislative proposals, FTC policies and FCC ukases converging
on Clouston's desk seem to be intended to transform cable from a galvanizing
entrepreneurial force in the U.S. economy into a sleepy-time public utility
run by lawyers. At stake is the future of the information superhighway and
thus the future of the U.S. economy. 
<PRE>
<B>

Superhighway Hype is Understated
</B></PRE>
Information superhighways are one of those rare technologies that are actually
far more powerful and promising than the hype surrounding them. The first
fruits of this development are already evident, as the U.S. has led the
world in deploying computer networks. Over the next five years broadband
networks can transform the entire economy, projecting it onto a higher plane
of growth and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For the last decade the performance of the economy has perplexed the economics
profession. Throughout the 1980s most economists predicted that U.S. interest
rates would soar as a result of world-lagging rates of personal savings.
When interest rates instead dropped, economists pointed to a &quot;dangerous
dependence&quot; on foreign sources of capital such as Japan, which were
investing close to $ 100 billion annually in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Today, adverse tax and regulatory policies in the U.S. have entirely reversed
capital flows, with funds now leaving the U.S. for foreign markets at an
annual rate of $ 80 billion. Meanwhile, as Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey has warned, personal savings have plunged to all-time lows. By every
rule of economics, interest rates should soar or growth should collapse.<BR>
<BR>
Yet despite a slight upward drift in recent months, U.S. interest rates
remain low by historic standards, and the U.S. continues to lead the major
powers in economic growth and has extended its lead in productivity. As
Michael Jensen of Harvard Business School has shown, a close analysis of
the figures from U.S. corporations now reveals a historic acceleration of
U.S. productivity growth during the 1980s. According to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley, between 1987 and 1992 U.S. corporations captured some 47.7 percent
of global profits and 37.4 percent of global sales. Continued slumps in
Europe and Japan combined with reviving growth in the U.S. indicate that
U.S. market share is still rising.<BR>
<BR>
This record of supremacy is entirely baffling to the economics profession
and its megaphones in the media. Focusing on the Loch Ness news, they have
spent a decade in lamentations over the prospects of the U.S. economy, reaching
a pitch of funereal keening during the 1992 election campaigns. But to analysts
focused on the ever-growing U.S. lead in technology, these results are no
mystery at all.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. supremacy is focused on information tools and spearheaded by computer
networks. U.S. companies command some two-thirds of the world's profits
in information technology, hardware and software, and entirely dominate
world markets in computer networks. Half the world's 110 million personal
computers are in the U.S., and between 1989 and 1993 the share connected
to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate information industry is finance. During the last decade the
U.S. employed information technology to transform its financial system.
Spearheaded by Milken and a $ 200 billion junk bond market, the U.S. drastically
reduced the role of banks and proliferated an array of more flexible and
specialized financial agencies. While over the last 12 years banks' share
of private credit for non-financial companies dropped from two- thirds to
less than 20 percent, the U.S. surged into global leadership in applying
information technology to the field of financial innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm shattered the financial system into
silicon smithereens and vastly enhanced its productivity. As the late Warren
Brookes has written, &quot;If every bank is nothing more than an information
system, then by definition every information system has the capacity to
be a bank, and every owner of an information system, from a desktop computer
to a mainframe terminal, can be a banker.&quot; What happened was that thousands
of brokers, mathematicians, financial consultants, insurance salespeople,
credit card merchants and bonds traders took this opportunity to break into
the field of financial entrepreneurship.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the U.S. set an entirely new world standard for capital efficiency,
generating far more economic growth per dollar of savings than any other
country. As explained two centuries ago by Adam Smith, key to productivity
growth is the refinement of the division of labor, the expansion of specialization,
the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and niches. The key force fostering
specialization in the U.S. is computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade computer networks will expand their bandwidth by factors
of thousands and reconstruct the entire U.S. economy in their image. TV
will expire and transpire into a new cornucopia of choice and empowerment.
Great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to
rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities. The most
deprived ghetto child in the most blighted project will gain educational
opportunities exceeding those of today's suburban preppie. Small towns will
become industrial centers in the new information economy. Hollywood and
Wall Street will totter and diffuse to all points of the nation and the
globe. Families will regroup around the evolving silicon hearths of a new
cottage economy. Video culture will transcend its current mass-media doldrums,
playing to lowest-common-denominator shocks and prurient interests, and
will effloresce into a plethora of products suggestive of the book industry.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or down the street or in their local office or corporation.
Instead, they will seek out and command their first choices in employment,
culture, entertainment and religion. They will reach out across the country
and around the world to find the best colleagues for every major project.
Productivity and efficiency will inexorably rise. A culture of first choices
will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward the mediocre,
convenient or crude.<BR>
<BR>
The entire centralizing force of the Industrial Revolution, which brought
capital and labor together in vast pyramidal institutions and reduced workers
to accessories of the machine and the tube, will give way to the explosive
centrifuge of the microcosm and telecosm. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and Machine Age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
The vision of information superhighways revitalizing the American economy
and culture is far more true and compelling than even its advocates comprehend.
People who underestimate the impact of bandwidth will miss the supreme investment
opportunities of the epoch. 
<PRE><B>

Decline and Rise of the Malone Model
</B></PRE>
Dominant in the industry are two essential models for fulfilling the promise
of the superhighway. One scheme, long associated with John Malone and other
cable executives, is the monster model: combining content and conduit in
order to gain monopoly rents.<BR>
<BR>
Because it reaches more than 20 percent of all cable customers, access to
the TCI conduit can heavily influence the success or failure of any content
venture. As Andrew Kessler, partner and multimedia guru at Unterberg Harris
and Forbes ASAP columnist, puts it, &quot;If you want to create a cable
channel, you may have to send it through Malone's bottleneck--a satellite
dish farm outside Denver. I suspect that could cost you some $ 4 million
in cash, or, alternatively, you can give Malone 30 percent of your company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This monster model is in essence the way Malone built up Liberty Media and
the content side of TCI, which together own parts of TNT, the Discovery
Channel, American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment TV, Court TV, Encore,
Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network, QVC, Video Jukebox and an
array of regional sports networks. It has been widely reported that AT&T
and financier Herbert Allen are creating a new classic sports network and
will give a chunk of it to Liberty in exchange for access to Malone's conduit.<BR>
<BR>
The other model is that of the common-carrier, upheld both by the telephone
companies and by Internet. In this model you build an open conduit and exercise
virtually no influence on content. Using the phone system or Internet, people
can communicate anything they want as long as they observe the protocols
of the public switched telephone network or of Internet's TCP/IP. Extended
to images, this model suggests a &quot;video dial tone.&quot; You can dial
up any other machine connected to the network and download or upload any
films, files, documents, pictures or multimedia programs that you wish.
Although telephone companies or Internet providers may own content. they
cannot privilege their own programming. Their content has to compete for
customers freely with all other content available on the network.<BR>
<BR>
The notoriety of the Malone model and the resentment it arouses far and
wide explain much of the hostility toward the cable industry and John Malone.
This may even explain the current rage to reregulate the industry. The great
irony today is that Malone and the rest of the cable leaders were in the
process of abandoning the Malone model at the very moment that many telephone
executives seemed to adopt it.<BR>
<BR>
It was Malone, after all, who was willing to sell his content to Bell Atlantic,
and it was Raymond Smith, above all, who insisted on acquiring the assets
of Liberty Media. It was Bell South that was willing to pitch in some $
2 billion to QVC's bidding for Paramount when John Malone left Batty Diller
high and dry. Ameritech, too, was reported to be preparing a pitch for Paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Malone was right in his attempt to sell out at the top to Bell Atlantic.
The idea of combining conduit and content was valid in a regime of bandwidth
scarcity. In a regime of broadband information superhighways, however, content
providers will want to put their programming on everyone's conduits, and
conduit owners will want to carry everyone's content. In a world of bandwidth
abundance Paramount will not want to restrict its films to Bell South's
network any more than Bell South will exclude films from other sources.<BR>
<BR>
The key condition for the success of the open model and the eclipse of the
Malone model, however, is real bandwidth abundance. If the federal government
prohibits the interconnection of conduits, then the Malone model gains a
new lease on life. In a world of bandwidth scarcity the owner of the conduit
not only can but must control access to it. Thus, the owner of the conduit
also shapes the content. It does not matter whether the conduit company
is headed by a scheming monopolist or by Mitch Kapor and the members of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Bandwidth scarcity will require the
managers of the network to determine the video programming on it.<BR>
<BR>
In a world of information superhighways, however, the most open networks
will dominate, and the proprietary networks will wither. Malone's understanding
of this fact--that his own model would soon expire in an environment of
bandwidth abundance--motivated his effort to merge with Bell Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm inexorably dictates mergers not between content
and conduit, but between conduit and conduit. In particular, today it mandates
the merger of the huge fiber resources of the telephone companies--which
are nine times as extensive as cable industry fiber and are estimated to
rise to 2.7 million lines by next year--with the huge asset of 57 million
broadband links to homes commanded by the cable industry. Obstructing such
mergers in the name of competition, or antitrust, or regulatory caprice,
is wantonly destructive to the future of the economy. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Siren Call From Foreign Shores
</B></PRE>
Most of the gains of the telecosm depend on government willingness to allow
the creation of coherent broadband networks with no prohibitions against
the convergence of cable and telco systems. For a while it appeared that
the Clinton administration was willing to accommodate this development.
Now it appears that it prefers to lead the U.S. government into a private-sector
monster hunt. Rather than releasing America's cable and telco firms to build
this redemptive infrastructure, Washington leaders seem chiefly concerned
with assuring themselves that no one will make any money from it. As a result,
with some $ 1 billion in annual funding from Wall Street, cable and telephone
firms are increasingly moving abroad to fulfill the promise of information
superhighways.<BR>
<BR>
TCI and U.S. West, for example, are serving some quarter- million British
citizens with combined telephone and cable functions over a hybrid network
of coax and fiber. The current regulatory climate dooms the proposed merger
of Southwestern Bell and Cox Cable and their plans to launch information
highways in Phoenix and Atlanta. But these companies continue to expand
their hybrid cable and phone networks In Liverpool and Birmingham in England.
In the U.S. NYNEX has been one of the most sluggish Bells in information
superhighway projects. But from Gibraltar to Bangkok, it is supplying an
array of wireless and wireline services. In the U.K. NYNEX Cablecomm holds
17 cable franchises passing 2.5 million homes and plans some $ 2 billion
in future investments. In the wake of the new regulations Bell Canada International
(BCI) reduced its offer for Jones Intercable by five percent, but the two
companies are barging ahead in East London, Leeds and Aylesbury. Time Warner,
Ameritech and other cable and telephone companies are also rushing to less
regulated realms to lay information infrastructure everywhere from Scotland
to New Zealand.<BR>
<BR>
In the U.S. such collaborations of cable and telephone companies would be
paralyzed by litigation and bureaucracy. It appears increasingly possible
that despite the huge lead created by the U.S. cable industry, which, unique
in the world, has extended broadband access to some 95 percent of American
homes, broadband networks will first be built outside the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
American politicians must face reality. With cable, the U.S. is far and
away the world leader in broadband technology. With cable, the U.S. can
have a national network reaching every American community by the year 2000.
Without cable, however, the U.S. can forget the idea of building a national
system of information superhighways in this decade. Without cable, the global
race is even, and several European and Asian countries command a significant
edge as a result of their integrated cable and telephone firms.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. panacea of &quot;competition&quot; without winners may work for
commodity markets, which require low levels of incremental investment and
offer returns commensurate with the rate of interest. Governing technological
progress, though, is the very different regime of dynamic competition and
creative destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling most technology investment is the pursuit of transitory positions
of monopoly that may yield massive profits. That's why in the late 1970s
and early 1980s Milken directed some $ 17 billion to the cable TV, fiberoptic
telephony and cellular telephone industries, giving the U.S. a decisive
lead in all these areas. That's why Intel Corp. has been investing $ 2 billion
a year in new wafer fabrication capacity to secure its global edge in microprocessors.
That's why Microsoft invests $ 1 billion a year or more (depending on definitions)
in new software technology to integrate ever-new functions into its dominant
operating systems. And that's why Bell Atlantic contemplated investing what
amounted to some $ 33 billion in John Malone's company, TCI.<BR>
<BR>
Until replaced by a better system, every innovation gives its owner a temporary
monopoly. Otherwise it is not a true innovation. Today, whether anyone likes
it or not, the cable industry has a temporary monopoly on broadband links
to the home. By interconnecting these links to the fiber networks of the
phone companies, the two industries together can create a national information
superhighway some five or 10 years sooner than can Japan or Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Some 79 percent of the costs of a network come in the final connections
to homes: the distribution and drops that the cable industry has installed
over the last 25 years. Joined with the telephone industry's fiber optics--nine
times more extensive than the cable industry's fiber deployment--this hybrid
cable-telco network would represent an authentic innovation and would trigger
a flood of real competition supplying a huge array of powerful new broadband
communications services. According to authoritative estimates cited by Vice-President
Gore and the FCC, these innovations would increase U.S. productivity growth
by 40 percent over the next decade. This immense undertaking would also
yield huge profits for as long as a decade to some of the companies that
master it.<BR>
<BR>
The government might regard these profits as &quot;obscene.&quot; But they
will be indispensable both to pay for the transformation of American media
and to attract the next generation of competitors into the business. These
rivals are already on the way: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), wireless
cellular &quot;cable&quot; at 28 gigahertz, low-earth-orbiting satellites
such as the Gates-McCaw Teledesic, all-fiber &quot;Internets&quot; and the
array of passive fiber- to-the-home technology summed up as the fibersphere.
Even broadcasters and utilities will enter the field. In a world where the
government micromanages communications in the name of &quot;competition,&quot;
however, all these capital-hungry competitors will languish. 
<PRE><B>

Dynamic Competition or Static Competitors?
</B></PRE>
The dynamics of competition on the information superhighway repeats the
previous dynamics of competition in computers. Preventing the dominance
of successful technologies--sustaining an artificial diversity--is anticompetitive.
If in the early 1980s the Department of Justice had ruled against the Microsoft
and Intel standards, for example, and had required a variety of microprocessor
instruction sets and operating systems, the result would have been less
competition in computers, not more. Perhaps Pick, Quarterdeck, Digital Research
and others would have gained share against Microsoft. But the applications
software business, with its floods of real competition in new programs for
everything from financial management to videogames, would have languished,
along with the parallel markets in hardware peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that Microsoft faces antitrust pressure at the twilight of its
dominance. Impelled by the new markets for multimedia and handheld communicators,
the industry is on the cusp of an entirely new landscape of competition.
In this new arena Microsoft's present market share and installed base are
barriers to entry for Microsoft rather than for its rivals. If Microsoft
is to prevail in these new areas, it must cannibalize its own systems and
compete on an equal basis with everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
The laws of dynamic competition apply just as forcefully to networks as
to computers. Just as the time arrived when text editing and disk utilities
would be integrated into operating systems--or floating point computations
would be integrated into microprocessors--broadband cable services now must
be integrated into the public switched telephone network (PSTN), not segregated
from it. Despite the &quot;competitive&quot; access dreams of politicians
and regulators, true competition requires that the &quot;two-wire model&quot;
of home communications give way to a broadband, one-wire system.<BR>
<BR>
The best and most cost-effective network practicable today is a combination
of telco fiber and cable coax. Even the telephone industry agrees. U.S.
West, Pacific Telesis and Bellcore all have resolved on the same hybrid
system that TCI, Time Warner and Cablelabs have pioneered. Without mergers
with cable firms, the telcos in essence will try to rebuild cable networks.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to duplicate the connections to homes built by the cable industry
over the last 25 years, however, the telephone industry would have to spend
some $ 200 billion. It would have to sustain this level of new investment
while maintaining its existing plant and expanding into long-distance and
other services. It would have to summon large incremental capital in the
face of continued competition from the cable industry's taking of many of
the most profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos currently declare they are willing to make these investments.
They tell Washington regulators and politicians that all will be fine as
long as they are allowed to own programming and information services and
build equipment. But the message from the markets is clear and to the contrary.
At the very time that telco executives were intoning their bold plans, telephone
and cable share prices were plunging toward new lows. Now Raymond Smith
of Bell Atlantic is announcing a half-billion- dollar reduction in infrastructure
outlays. Southwestern Bell is giving up its plans to buy Cox Cable. Under
a similar &quot;competitive&quot; regime in cellular telephony, even AT&T and
McCaw have found their merger in jeopardy.<BR>
<BR>
Under rate-of-return regulations with prohibition of cross- subsidies from
current cash flow, a &quot;competitive&quot; information superhighway simply
cannot fly. An information superhighway cannot be built under a canopy of
federal tariffs, price controls, mandates and allocated markets. 
<PRE><B>

Highway Imperative:  Cable-PC</B></PRE>
Politicians must recognize that what is at stake is not merely games, entertainment
and a few educational frills but the very future of the U.S. economy. Cable
is central not only to the next generation of television technology but
also to the next generation of computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many companies offer bold words in business plans for interconnecting
homes with new networks. Indeed, the telcos can provide some intriguing
computer services through their accelerating rollout of Integrated Services
Digital Networks (ISDN), as was so eloquently urged by Mitch Kapor and others.
Internet will continue to expand rapidly its cornucopia of mostly narrowband
offerings. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw may even enlarge the bandwidth available
to homes to a level of 2.4 megabits per second through their elegant and
ambitious Teledesic. Direct broadcast satellite systems and public utilities
and wireless cable operators will all enrich the flow of video to the nation's
homes.<BR>
<BR>
Except in the short ran, though, these systems are not remotely competitive
with cable. Available ISDN, for example, offers less than one-100th the
bandwidth of one digital cable channel and less than one-1,000th the bandwidth
of a cable coax line. The other rivals to cable, from direct broadcast satellite
to Teledesic, are similarly far too little and too late. Even the advanced
28-gigahertz wireless cable projects, for all their promise as supplementary
systems, cannot ultimately compete with the potential two-way bandwidth
of fiber-coax systems in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
All the current plans of the telephone companies and the government leave
the huge U.S. endowment of home computers--the fastest-growing and most
promising segment of the computer industry--stranded in a narrowband world.
Only the cable industry's gigahertz links, passing into some 95 percent
of American homes, can launch the American personal computer industry into
a new level of two-way broadband digital connectivity.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason the future of the American computer industry largely depends
on the future of the cable industry. By linking America's computers to broadband
networks and then to telco fiber systems, cable can be the great enabler
of the next phase of development in America's digital economy.<BR>
<BR>
In laying broadband systems the cable industry has already been forced to
solve many of the key problems of an information superhighway. Although
often depicted as an intrinsically one- way service, cable technology has,
in fact, long provided two-way capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
Every cable coax line, for example, offers potential bandwidth equivalent
to six times the 160 megahertz of spectrum assigned by the FCC for personal
communications services. Cable can accommodate as much as one gigahertz--a
billion cycles per second--of communications power. This is some 250,000
times the capacity of a four-kilohertz telephone line to the home. Just
one six-megahertz cable channel commands 1,500 times the bandwidth of a
telephone line. In every coax connection the first four channels, between
five and 30 megahertz, are reserved not for broadcast but for reverse communications
to the headend. Widely used to transfer video programming among headends
and satellite dishes and other programming sources, these channels alone
already represent a potential information highway for home computers 2,500
times faster than a 9,600-baud modem to a phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Even these possibilities, however, underestimate the potential of cable.
The coax laid by the cable firms must carry analog video material without
interference or distortion. This means cable equipment must track perfectly
all the analog waveforms representing the shape and brightness of the image,
and must detect tiny differences in the frequencies of FM signals bearing
color and sound information. Because any deviation in an analog wave imparts
a defect to the picture, cable TV has had to develop extremely low loss
technologies. Although most current cable systems function at much lower
signal-to-noise ratios, measured logarithmically, a cable TV plant can potentially
function at nearly 50 decibels, or at a signal-to-noise power ratio of almost
100,000-to-one.<BR>
<BR>
Necessary to transmit high-quality analog video, between 10,000- and 100,000-to-1
signal-to-noise ratios are vast overkill for the relatively crude on-off
codes of digital communications, which can function at 17 decibels or less.
Therefore, the one- gigahertz coax lines can carry many more than one bit
per hertz. Craig Tanner, vice-president of advanced TV projects at Cablelabs,
the industry's research arm in Louisville, Colo., estimates that by wiggling
every wave in readable patterns using a modulation scheme called 256 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation), cable systems can transmit as many as
seven bits per hertz. This means that the one-gigahertz bandwidth of an
existing cable line might potentially carry between six and eight gigabits
per second, or more than three gigabits per second each way. These potential
links to homes are more capacious than the current telephone fiber lines
that accommodate tens of thousands of phone calls among telco central offices.<BR>
<BR>
This bandwidth represents the real potential of cable coax. For the next
decade much of the cable plant will still be devoted to analog TV broadcasts
or to digital renditions of pay-per-view movies. Time Warner's Orlando project,
however, envisions devoting the top 350 megahertz of its system to two-way
digital communications, including 100 megahertz for the personal communications
services of wireless telephony and 150 megahertz for digital two-way data
flows. At a very conservative estimate of two bits per hertz, Time Warner
projects a total of 300 megabits per second from these digital channels.
At these levels a computer could download a full movie of two-and-a-half
hours in about one minute. 
<PRE>
<B>
Cable's Real Potential is Not TV</B></PRE>
Abandonment of the Malone model by Malone and the rest of the cable industry
ultimately requires that cable TV magnates develop a new grasp of the dynamics
of the microcosm: the exponential growth of computer power and connections.
Accustomed to the role of propagating mass entertainment, cable leaders
have long downplayed the potential market in computer communications.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually growing throughout TCI, Time Warner, Continental Cablevision,
Jones Intercable and other cable firms, however, is a recognition that the
real future of cable is in computers rather than TVs. As David Fellows of
Continental declared in launching his pioneering new Internet access system
in Boston In late February, &quot;The market for computer communications
is huge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, during the next decade the cable companies are going to discover
that the computer market for their services is far more important than the
television market. The computer industry, hardware and software, is already
some 60 percent larger than the television and movie industries put together
and is growing six times as fast. On-line networked computer services, such
as Prodigy, CompuServe, Delphi and America Online, are collectively growing
at a pace of close to 100 percent per year. When on-line services can exchange
video and audio files as readily as they transfer text today, these computer
networks will be able to outperform any television system. Against all their
expectations and plans, cable executives are going to find themselves a
central part of the computer networking industry.<BR>
<BR>
As Fellows explains, &quot;Cable and computer network topologies go together
perfectly. Both provide shared bandwidth. Ethernet over cable is a natural.&quot;
In both networks all the data flow by every terminal. The receiver tunes
into the desired channel. For computers, cable offers the dumb bandwidth
that is increasingly needed as terminals gain near-supercomputer powers.
In the past networks had to be smart in order to provide needed services
to the dumb terminals on their periphery, whether phones, computers or TVs.
Dumb terminals could tolerate narrowband connections. In the future, however,
all terminals will command supercomputer powers.<BR>
<BR>
When terminals are smart, the intelligence in networks flows to the fringes.
When terminals are smart, networks must be broad and dumb. There is no way
that an intelligent switching fabric can anticipate the constantly evolving
technology emerging from a computer industry in a frenzied process of change.
There is no way that John Malone's satellite farm outside Denver will be
able to satisfy the demands for programming and communications of 100 million
networked teleputers. While the telephone business struggles with the increasing
problems of intelligent central switches with some 25 million lines of software
code, the cable industry is creating dumb networks in tune with the explosive
growth of supersmart machines in every home and office.<BR>
<BR>
The movement of computer networks onto cable need not await the development
of advanced broadband systems such as those planned by Time Warner in Orlando.
Already several companies are supplying moderns that allow computers to
link directly to cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith provided the first system, HomeWorks, operating at a rate of 500
kilobits per second. It is being used by Cox Cable to deliver Prodigy service
in San Diego at a rate 52 times faster than existing 9,600-baud phone modems.
Also using HomeWorks is Jones Intercable for Internet services in Alexandria,
Va., Continental Cablevision and CompuServe in Exeter, N.H., and TCI for
a distance learning test in Provo, Utah.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith is adding a system called ChannelMizer that can offer full Ethernet
capability of 10 megabits per second over a 15-mile radius. Intel, General
Instrument and Hybrid Technologies have announced an asymmetrical system
that runs upstream from the home at 256 kilobits per second and downstream
at 10 megabits per second, the Ethernet rate run in most office networks.<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering in the field for several years has been Digital Equipment Corp.
under the leadership of James Albrycht. Adapting equipment developed by
LANcity, DEC's ChannelWorks offers the functionality needed for true information
highway on-ramps. Extending a two-way Ethernet transparently from the office
to the home by a full 70 miles, the ChannelWorks frequency-agile modem allows
the use of all 83 cable frequency channels. Cable managers can send digital
information over any underused part of the coax bandwidth. Currently deployed
chiefly by telecommuting Digital employees, the system is under evaluation
by a variety of hospitals, libraries, schools and other institutions favored
by Vice-President Gore.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely crucial to the development of the broadband superhighway, however,
is not only the merger of the two networks but also access to the capital
of the telephone industry. Creation of high-bandwidth cable connections
to homes will be far cheaper than laying new coax. But they still will require
expensive upgrades to existing cable plant.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos already invest more money every year--some $ 24 billion--than
the total revenues of the cable industry. But even the telcos will not be
able to create information superhighways if they also have to duplicate
the broadband connections to homes already offered by the cable industry.
Similarly, the cable industry alone cannot attract sufficient funds to duplicate
the broadband fiber networks already commanded by the telcos, while the
telcos move in to skim off the best pay-per-view movie markets. Particularly
in an adverse regulatory climate neither industry is capable of building
broadband networks. With relatively narrowband networks, the Malone model
necessarily thrives. In the name of fighting monsters the administration
is in fact pursuing what amounts to a monster-protection policy.<BR>
<BR>
If this policy continues, innovation once more will follow its course toward
the least-regulated arenas. Cable and telco firms will install their best
technologies overseas. In the U.S. the computer networking industry will
build the information superhighways. To Gore's bitter regret, only business
and the wealthy will be able to afford access. Until the early decades of
the next century, much of the rest of the nation will be left to the mercies
of the Malone model for video entertainment and other cable programming.
Interactivity will tend to take the form of games and pay-per-view TV.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with the increasing movement of activity from big cities, corporate
headquarters, hospitals, schools and other centralized institutions to homes
and small cities, the demand for broadband computer connections is sure
to soar. Most current congressional legislation that imposes mandates on
businesses relating to everything from health care reform to parental leave
tends to drive work away from corporations to contractual outsources. The
market for &quot;interactive TV&quot; is likely to grow far more slowly
than the market for computer connections over cable.<BR>
<BR>
Both political parties are far behind the public in comprehending these
developments. But the reversal of the earlier forces of conurbation and
centralized industry responds to the most profound laws of new technology.
It is the most important movement in America today. If the administration
continues to strangle new technology with new regulation and red tape, a
new coalition of liberals and conservatives alike will rise up against it
and grasp the future. Al Gore may eventually wish he had never heard of
broadband networks.

Imagine it is 1971 and you are chair of the new Federal Computer Commission.
This commission has been established to regulate the natural monopoly of
computer technology as summed up in the famous Grosch's Law. In 1956 IBM
engineer Herbert Grosch proved that computer power rises by the square of
its cost and thus necessarily gravitates to the most costly machines. According
to a famous IBM projection, the entire world could use some 55 mainframes,
time-sharing from dumb terminals and keypunch machines. The owners of these
machines would rule the world of information in an ascendant information
age. By the Orwellian dawn of 1984, Big Bre'r IBM would establish a new
digital tyranny, with a new elite of the data-rich dominating the data-poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As head of the computer commission, you launch a bold program to forestall
this grim outcome. Under a congressional mandate to promote competition
for IBM and ensure the principle of universal computer service, you ordain
the creation of some 2,500 mainframe licenses to be auctioned to the highest
bidders (with special licenses reserved for minorities, women and farmers).
To ensure widespread competition across all of America, you establish seven
licenses in each metropolitan Major Trading Area and seven in every rural
Basic Trading Area as defined by Rand McNally. To guarantee universal service,
you mandate the free distribution of keypunch machines to all businesses
and households so that they can access the local computer centers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In establishing this auction in 1971, you had no reason at all to notice
that a tiny company in Mountain View, Calif., called Intel was about to
announce three new technologies together with some hype about &quot;a new
era of integrated electronics.&quot; After all, these technologies--the
microprocessor; erasable, programmable read-only memory (EPROM); and a one-kilobit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM)--were far too primitive to even compare
with IBM's massive machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The likely results of such a Federal Computer Commission policy are not
merely matters of conjecture. France pretty much did it when it distributed
free Minitel terminals to its citizens to provide them access to government
mainframes. While the United States made personal computers nearly ubiquitous
buying perhaps 100 million since the launch of the Minitel in the late 1970s
the French chatted through central databases and ended up with one-quarter
as many computers per capita as this country, and one-tenth the number of
computer networks. Today, PC networks are leading the US economy to world
dominance while Europe founders without a single major computer company,
software firm or semiconductor manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT IS NOW 1994, and Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, is indeed about to hold an auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than selling exclusive mainframe licenses, the current FCC is going
to sell exclusive ten-year licenses to about 2,500 shards of the radio spectrum.
Meanwhile, a tiny company called Steinbrecher Corp. of Burlington, Mass.,
is introducing the new microprocessor of the radio business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the world of radio waves ruled by the Federal Communications Commission,
the Steinbrecher MiniCell is even more revolutionary than the microprocessor
was in the world of computing. While Intel put an entire computer on a single
chip, Steinbrecher has put an entire cellular base station--now requiring
some 1,000 square feet and costing $ 1.5 million--in a box the size of a
briefcase that costs $ 100,000 today. Based on a unique invention by Donald
Steinbrecher and on the sweeping advance of computer technology, the MiniCell
represents a far bigger leap forward beyond the current state of the art
than the microprocessor did. What's more, this MiniCell is in fact much
superior to existing cellular base stations. Unlike the 416 hard-wired radio
transceivers (transmitter-receivers) in existing base stations, the MiniCell
contains a single digital broadband radio and is fully programmable. It
can accommodate scores of different kind of cellular handsets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important, the MiniCell benefits from the same technology as the microprocessor.
Making possible the creation of this broadband digital radio is the tidal
onrush of Moore's Law. In an antithesis of Grosch's Law, Gordon Moore of
Intel showed that the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology doubles
every 18 months. This insight suggested the Law of the Microcosm-- that
computing power gravitates not to the costliest but to the cheapest machines.
Costing $ 100,000 today, the MiniCell will predictably cost some $10,000
before the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In time, these digital MiniCells will have an impact similar to that of
the PC. They will drive the creation of a cornucopia of new mobile services--from
plain old telephony to wireless video conferencing--based on ubiquitous
client/server networks in the air. Endowing Americans with universal mobile
access to information superhighways, these MiniCells can spearhead another
generation of computer-led growth in the US economy. Eventually, the implications
of Steinbrecher's machines and other major innovations in wireless will
crash In on the legalistic scene of the FCC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning of the story.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on the block In May will be 160 megahertz (millions of cycles per
second) of the radio frequency spectrum, divided into seven sections of
between 10 and 30 megahertz In each of 543 areas of the country, and devoted
to enhanced Personal Communications Services (PCS).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Existing cellular systems operate in a total spectrum space of 50 megahertz
in two frequency bands near the 800 megahertz level. By contrast, PCS will
take four times that space in a frequency band near two gigahertz (billions
of cycles per second). Became higher frequencies allow use of lower-power
radios with smaller antennas and longer-lasting batteries, PCS offers the
possibility of a drastically improved wireless system. Unfortunately, the
major obstacle to the promise of PCS is the auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amid the spectrum fever aroused by the bidding, however, new radio technologies
are emerging that devastate its most basic assumptions. At a time when the
world is about to take to information superhighways In the sky--plied by
low-powered, pollution-free computer phones--the FCC is in danger of building
a legal infrastructure and protectionist program for information smokestacks
and gas guzzlers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used to describe the auction betrays its fallacies. With
real estate imagery, analysts depict spectrum as &quot;beachfront property&quot;
and the auction as a &quot;land rash.&quot; They assume that radio frequencies
are like analog telephone circuit: no two users can occupy the same spot
of spectrum at the same time. Whether large 50-kilowatt broadcast stations
booming Rush Limbaugh's voice across the nation or milliwatt cellular phones
beaming love murmurs to a nearby base station, radio transmitters are assumed
to be infectious, high-powered and blind. If one is on the highway, everyone
else has to clear out. Both the prevailing wisdom and the entrenched technology
dictate that every transmitter be quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, innovations from such companies as Steinbrecher and Qualcomm Inc.
of San Diego overthrow this paradigm. Not only can numerous radios operate
at non-interfering levels in the same frequency band, they can also see
other users' signals and move to avoid them. In baseball jargon, the new
radios can hit 'em where they ain't; in football idiom, they run for daylight.
If appropriately handled, these technologies can render spectrum not scarce
but abundant.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These developments make it retrograde to assign exclusive spectrum rights
to anyone or to foster technologies that require exclusivity. Spectrum no
longer shares any features of beachfront property. A wave would be a better
analogy. 
<PRE><B>
The New Rules Of Waves</B></PRE>
In the early decades of this century, radio was king. Electronics hackers
played in the waves with a variety of ham, citizens band and short-wave
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Experimenting with crystal sets, they innocently entered the domain of solid-state
devices and acquired some of the skills that fueled the electronic revolution
in the United States and the radar revolution that won World War II. The
first point-contact transistor, created by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
at Bell Labs in 1948, functioned like a crystal radio. The first major solid-state
product was a 1954 Texas Instruments pocket radio with six germanium transistors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the following decades, the radio became a mass commodity. There are
now some 230 million radios in the United States alone, not even including
more than 16 million cellular phones (which are in fact portable two-way
radios). Radios roll off Asian assembly lines at a rate that might be meaningfully
measured in hertz (cycles per second), and they come in sizes fit for pockets,
belts, watches and ears. But the romance of radio has died and given way
to the romance of computers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today it is PC technology that engages the youthful energies previously
invested in radio technology. The press trumpets a coming convergence between
computers and TVs and games and films. But no one talks much about radios.
For many years, we have been taking radios for granted.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the foundation of wireless communications, however, radio--no less than
TV or films--will burst into a new technoscape as a result of a convergence
with computers. The hackers of the '50s and '60s are joining forces with
the hackers of the '80s and '90s to create a new industry. Moore's Law is
about to overran the world of radio.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You double anything every 18 months and pretty soon you find yourself with
a monster. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moore's Law overturned the established
order in the computer industry and spawned some 100 million personal computers
that are as powerful as million-dollar mainframes were when the revolution
began. In the current decade, Moore's Law is upending the telephone and
television industries with interactive teleputers that will be able to send,
receive, shape and store interactive full-motion video. And during the next
five years, Moore's Law is going to transform exotic and costly radio equipment
once consigned to the military and outer space into the basic communications
access routes for the new world economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To understand this new world of radio, however, you must forget much of
what you learned about the old world of radio. For example, these new radios
differ radically from the radios of the past in the way they use spectrum,
the way they interfere with one another and the way they are built.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For some 15 years, a hacker of the 1950s named Don Steinbrecher and a small
group of students and associates have been making the world's most powerful
and aerobatic radios. Steinbrecher radio gear can soar to spectrum altitudes
as high as 94 gigahertz to provide radar &quot;eyes&quot; for smart bombs
and pies, plunge down to the cellular band at 800 megahertz to listen in
on phone calls or drop discretely to 30 megahertz--waves that bounce off
the ionosphere--for remote over-the-horizon radar work identifying cocaine
traffickers flying in low from Latin America. At the same time, some of
these radios may soon command enough dynamic ranges of accurate broadband
reception--rumored to be as high as 120 decibels (one trillion-to-one)--to
detect a pin drop at a heavy-metal rock concert without missing a high-fidelity
note or twang.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like every radio transceiver, a Steinbrecher radio must have four key components:
an antenna, a tuner, a modem and a mixer. The antenna part is easy; for
many purposes, your metal shirt hanger will do the trick (backyard wire
fences collect millions of frequencies). But without tuners, modems and
mixers, nothing reaches its final destination--the human ear.<BR>
<BR>
A tuner selects a desired carrier frequency, usually by exploiting the science
of resonant circuits. A modem is a modulator-demodulator. In transmitting
it applies information to the carrier frequency by wiggling the waves in
a pattern, called a modulation scheme, such as AM or FM. In receiving the
modem strips out (demodulates) the information tom the carrier wave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to Steinbrecher radios is the broadband mixer. It surmounts what
was long seen as an impossible challenge: moving a large array of the relatively
high career frequencies on the antenna down to a so-called baseband level
where they can be used without losing any of the information or adding spurious
information in the process. Compared to FM carrier frequencies of 100 megahertz
or even PCS frequencies of two gigahertz, baseband audio frequencies run
between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mixers were the basic Steinbrecher product, and in 1978 and 1980, Steinbrecher
acquired patents on a unique broadband mixer with high range and sensitivity
called the Paramixer. Even to its expected military customers, the Paramixer
was a hard sell because other radio components were unable to keep pace
with its performance. Today, however, the Paramixer is the foundation of
the Steinbrecher radio in the MiniCell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the old world of radio, transceivers integrated all of these components--antenna,
tuner, modem and mixer--into one analog hardware system. Because the radio
is analog and hard-wired, its functions must be standardized. Each radio
can receive or transmit only a very limited set of frequencies bearing information
coded in a specific modulation scheme and exclusively occupying a specific
spectrum space at a particular power range. If you are in the radio business--whether
as an equipment manufacturer such as Motorola or Ericsson, a provider of
services, such as McCaw or Comsat, or a broadcaster, such as NBC or Turner--you
care deeply about these hard-wired specifications, frequencies and modulation
schemes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprising the &quot;air standard,&quot; these issues embroil businesses,
politicians, standards bodies and regulators in constant warfare. For everything
from High Definition Television to digital cellular and cordless telephony,
standards bodies are wrangling over frequencies and modulation schemes.
<PRE><B>

How Digital Radios Can End The Spectrum Wars</B></PRE>
To the people at Steinbrecher Corp., all these wrangles seem utterly unnecessary.
With antennas, tuners, modems and mixers, wideband digital radios perform
all the same functions as ordinary radios. Only the antenna and mixer are
in hardware, and these are generic; they don't care any more about air standards
than your shirt hanger does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Steinbrecher radios, all of the frequency tuning, all of the modulating
and demodulating, all of the channelization, all of the coding and decoding
that so embroil the politicians are performed by programmable digital signal
processors and can be changed at a base station in real time. Strictly speaking,
the tuner and modem are not part of the base station radio at all. The broadband
radio in a Steinbrecher base station can send or receive signals to or from
any handset or mobile unit operating within its bandwidth (in current cellular
systems the full 12.5 megahertz of the band; in PCS, still larger bands
of as much as 30 megahertz).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the processing of codes, frequencies, channels and modulations, as well
as all special mobile services, can move onto computers attached to the
network. Steinbrecher technology thus can open up the spectrum for open
and programmable client/server systems like those that now dominate the
computer industry. Moore's Law, in fact, is changing radios into portable
digital computers. The most pervasive personal computer of the next decade
will be a digital cellular phone operating at least 40 MIPS (millions of
instructions per second).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the performance of analog-to-digital converters defines the limits
of Steinbrecher radios. Even if the mixers are perfect, the system's performance
can be no better than the accuracy of the A/D processors that transform
the output of the mixers into a digital bit stream for the DSPs. Steinbrecher
estimates that better broadband A/D converters--which can sample wave forms
more accurately at high frequencies--could increase the performance ofSteinbrecher
systems by an amazing factor of 10. Pushed by demands and designs from Steinbrecher,
Analog Devices and other suppliers are advancing converter technology nearly
at a pace with Moore's Law, and Steinbrecher's broadband digital radios
are rapidly approaching the ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Don Steinbrecher puts it, broadband A/D and DSP have changed wireless
&quot;turn a radio business to a computer business.&quot; At first, the
computer portion of a broadband radio was very expensive. Until the early
1980s, military customers performed advanced broadband analog-to-digital
conversion and digital signal processing on million-dollar custom supercomputers.
In 1986, an advanced DSP system for graphics at Bell Labs entailed the use
of 82 AT&T DSP32 chips and supporting devices in a custom computer that
cost some $ 130,000. Today, these same functions are performed on an Apple
Quadra 84o AV using an AT&T 3210 running at 33 megaflops (million floating-point
operations per second) and 17 MIPS for under $ 20 in volume. This rising
tide of advances in digital technology, propelled by Moore's Law, is about
to sweep Steinbrecher's recondite radio company into the midst of a mass
market in cellular telephony.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the entire cellular and PCS industries will be beating a path to Steinbrecher's
door. Just as millions of people today have learned the meaning of MIPS
and megabytes, millions of people around the world, believe it or not, are
going to come to understand the meaning of &quot;spurious-free dynamic range.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a very rough analogy, imagine cranking the volume of your radio as high
as possible without marring the desired signal with static and distortion.
The spurious-free dynamic range of your radio would measure the distance
between the lowest and the highest volumes with a clear signal. In more
technical terms, spurious-free dynamic range is defined as the range of
signal amplitudes that can simultaneously be processed without distortion
or be resolved by a receiver without the emergence of spurious signals above
the noise floor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In building broadband radios with high dynamic range, however, Steinbrecher
faced a fundamental technical problem. As a general rule, bandwidth is inversely
proportional to dynamic range. You can have one or the other, but you can't
have both. The broader the band, the more difficult it is to capture all
of its contents with full accuracy and sensitivity or with full spurious-free
dynamic range. An ordinary radio may command a high dynamic range of volumes
because it is narrowband.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Steinbrecher radio does not begin by tuning to one frequency alone;
it gasps every frequency in a particular swath of spectrum. In some extreme
Paramixer applications (94-gigahertz radar, for example), the bandwidth
could be 10 gigahertz--larger than the entire range of spectrum commonly
used in the air, from submarine communications at 60 hertz to C band satellite
at 6 gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most Steinbrecher applications that require high dynamic range, however,
the bandwidth runs between a few megahertz and hundreds of megahertz (compared
to 30 kilohertz in a cellular phone). Unless all of the frequencies captured
by the broadband radio are really present in the band rather than as artifacts
of the equipment--in technical jargon, unless the signals are spurious-free--the
radio user cannot tell what is going on, cannot distinguish between spurs
and signals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher has devoted much of his career to the graft of spurious-free
dynamic range. Soon after he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in September 1961 to pursue work on device physics, he moved into the school's
new Radio Astronomy Lab. The radio astronomers were using millimeter waves
at 75 gigahertz to probe remote galaxies and pour through evidence of a
big bang at the beginning of time. Because the return reflections from outer
space were infinitesimal, the radio telescopes had to command a bandwidth
of at least two gigahertz, a spurious-free dynamic range of more than 100
decibels (tens of billions-, or even trillions-to-one) and noise levels
of less than 10 decibels (millionths of a watt).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telescope signals turned out not to be spurious-free. More than 90 percent
of the receiver noise--the spurious signals--originated in the frequency
converter or mixer, which translated the 75-gigahertz millimeter waves in
cascading analog stages of diodes and transistors, fed by tunable local
oscillators, down to baseband levels that could be usefully analyzed. This
impelled Steinbrecher's obsession with spurious-free dynamic range in mixers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve high dynamic range in broadband mixers, Steinbrecher discovered,
was chiefly a problem of the basic physics of diodes. At the University
of Florida, at ECI Corp. and at MIT, Steinbrecher had pursued studies in
device physics focusing on the theory of PIN junctions--the positive-negative
interfaces that create the active regions in diodes and transistors. How
cleanly and abruptly they switch from on to off--how fully these switches
avoid transitional effects--determines how well they can translate one frequency
to another without spurs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From this experience, Steinbrecher concluded in 1968 that receivers could
be built with at least a thousand times more dynamic range than was currently
believed possible. He assigned his student Robert Snyder to investigate
the issue mathematically, integrating the possible performance of each component
into the performance of a mixer. Snyder's results stunningly continued Steinbrecher's
hypothesis. They predicted that in principle--with unlimited time and effort--the
linearity and dynamic range of a radio could be improved to any arbitrary
standard. In a key invention, Steinbrecher figured out how to create a diode
circuit that could produce a perfect square wave, creating a diode with
essentially zero switching time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher then proceeded to put his theory into practice by developing
the crucial diode and field-effect transistor arrays, mixers, amplifiers
and other components necessary to build a working system of unparalleled
dynamic range. Most of their advances required detailed knowledge of the
behavior of P/N junctions. To this day, the performance of Steinbrecher's
equipment depends on adjustment to unexpected nonlinearities and noise sources
that were discovered as part of Robert Snyder's work but are still not integrated
into the prevailing models of diode behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond radio astronomy, the people who were interested in analyzing signals
of unknown frequencies, rather than tuning into preset frequencies, were
in the field of military intelligence. Enemies did not normally announce
in advance the frequencies they planned to use or how they would modulate
them. Steinbrecher Corp.'s first major contract came in the early 1980s
for remote over-the-horizon radar (ROTHR) systems used to detect planes
carrying drugs from Latin America. Steinbrecher also won contracts to supply
MILSTAR satellite transceivers and 94-gigahertz &quot;eyes&quot; for smart
munitions and jet aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 these large potential businesses began to attract venture capitalists,
including EG&G venture partners, The Venture Capital Fund of New England
and Raytheon. As often happens, the venture capitalists sought professional
management. They pushed Steinbrecher upstairs to chairman and summoned a
Stanford EE graduate named Douglas Shute to manage the company's move from
a manufacturer of hard-sell mixers Into a producer of revolutionary digital
radios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still, Steinbrecher Corp. long remained a tiny firm occupying a dingy one-story
building in a Woburn, Mass., industrial park, where it rarely pulled in
more than $ 5 million in revenues. Not until the early 1990s, when its technology
converged with Moore's Law, did the company begin to escape its niche. 
<PRE><B>
Collision With Texas Instruments' DSP</B></PRE>
Indeed, strictly speaking even Moore's Law was not enough to make this Pentagon
turkey fly. Crucial was Texas Instruments' mid-1980s campaign to remake
the digital signal processor into a commodity device comparable to Intel's
microprocessor. Creating development systems and software tools, TI transformed
the DSP from an exotic and expensive printed circuit board full of integrated
circuits into a single programmable microchip manufactured in volume on
the same factory floor the company used to produce hundreds of millions
of dynamic random access memories. The results exceeded all expectations.
Outpacing Moore's Law by a factor of nearly four for some eight years so
far, DSP cost-effectiveness began soaring tenfold every two years. Pricing
the devices for digital radios, Douglas Shute saw that the wideband digital
radio had &quot;moved onto the map as a commercial product.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also in 1989, a secret contractor asked the company if its radios could
snoop on calls in the cellular band. After gigahertz explorations in radio
astronomy and military projects, the 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth
seemed a piece of cake. Although this national security application never
came through, the idea galvanized the company. If it should need a commercial
market, cellular telephony was a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pull of opportunity, however, is usually less potent than the push of
catastrophe--which is the key reason for socialism's failure. Insulating
the economy from failure, it also removes a key spur for success. For all
the bureaucratic rigmarole of military procurement, producers for the Pentagon
live in a relatively comfortable socialist world of cost plus contracts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Steinbrecher
began to get clear signals from Washington that the market for his products
was about to collapse. MILSTAR remained an experimental program; the ROTHR
system was halted after the creation of just four stations with 1,600 mixers;
and suddenly the cellular opportunity was not merely an attractive option--it
was crucial for survival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Shute and Steinbrecher viewed the cellular scene in the United States,
however, they became increasingly disdainful. These radio companies had
no more idea of what was possible in radio technology than had the MIT engineering
lab when he arrived in 1961. Indeed, Steinbrecher Corp.'s first potential
customer--a wireless colossus--refused even to meet with Shute: The chief
technologist said he had investigated digital radios several years before
and determined they were unable to achieve the requisite dynamic range.
Moreover, at scores of thousands of dollars apiece, digital signal processors
were far too expensive. Most cellular executives, along with their Washington
regulators, seemed stuck in a 1970s time warp when analog still ruled and
DSP was a supercomputer. 
<PRE><B>
Importing Obsolescence</B></PRE>
As a result, the entire industry was convulsed by what Shute and Steinbrecher
saw as a retrograde war over standards. Because Europe in general lagged
far behind the United States in adopting analog cellular technology, the
EEC had sponsored a multinational drive to leapfrog the United States by
adopting a digital standard, which could then be exported to America. The
standard they chose was called GSM (global services mobile), a time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) scheme that exceeded analog capacity by breaking
each channel into three digital time slots. Racing to catch up, the American
industry adopted a similar TDMA approach that also increased the current
system's capacity by a factor of three. With McCaw Cellular in the lead,
American firms quickly committed themselves to deploy TDMA as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in 1991, Qualcomm unleashed a bombshell Exploiting the increasing power
of DSPs to process digital codes, the company demonstrated a spread-spectrum,
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) modulation scheme that not only increased
capacity some twentyfold over analog but also allowed use of the entire
11.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth in every cell. To prevent interference
between adjoining cells, analog and TDMA systems could use a frequency in
only one cell out of seven.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of the industry seemed paralyzed by fear of choosing the wrong system.
To Shute and Steinbrecher, however, these fears seemed entirely reckless.
Using wideband digital radios, companies could accommodate any array of
frequencies and modulation schemes they desired TDMA, CDMA, voice, data
and eventually even video. Shute resolved to adapt Steinbrecher's advanced
radio technology to these new markets. In mid-1991, Shute rushed ahead with
a program to create a prototype cellular transceiver that could process
all 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth and convert it to a digital
bit stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first major customer for the radios turned out to be ADC-Kentrox, a
designer of analog cell extenders designed to overcome &quot;dead zones&quot;
caused by large buildings in urban areas. This system was limited in reach
to the few hundred meters the signals could be sent over analog wires without
deterioration. By converting the signals to digital at the remote site,
the Steinbrecher radio extended this distance from hundreds of meters to
scores of kilometers and allowed the price of the product to remain at $
100,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these gains concealed the potential impact and meaning of the Steinbrecher
technology. Once again, the Steinbrecher radios are being used to complement
the existing system rather than overthrow it. In a similar way, McCaw plans
to buy some $ 30 million worth of Steinbrecher machines to carry through
its cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network. To be provided to 95 percent
of McCaw's regions by the end of 1995, CDPD is a data overlay of the existing
cellular system, which allows users of the current analog system to send
digital data at a rate of 19.2 kilobits per second, compared to the 9.6-kilobit-per-second
rate offered by most modems over twisted-pair wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher radio can survey any existing swath of spectrum in real
time and determine almost instantly which channels are in use and which
are free. It is this capability that convinced McCaw to buy Steinbrecher
data cells despite the commitment of McCaw's putative owner, AT&amp;T, to
sell narrowband units made by Cirrus Logics' subsidiary Pacific Communications
Sciences Inc. (PCSI), which have to scan through channels one at a time.
McCaw is using the Steinbrecher radios as sniffers that constantly survey
the cellular band and direct data bursts to those channels that are not
being used at a particular time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the immediate needs of the marketplace alone justify the adoption
of Steinbrecher data cells. With modems and antennas increasingly available
and even moving sometime next year to PCMCIA slots the size of a credit
card, demand for wireless data is likely to soar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PCSI is now shipping a quintuple-threat communicator that fits into the
floppy bay of an advanced IBM ThinkPad notebook or an Apple PowerBook, enabling
them to send and receive faxes, make wireless or wire-line phone calls,
dispatch data files across the existing cellular network or send CDPD packets
at 19.2 kilobits per second. Speech recognition capabilities from IBM and
Dragon Systems will come next year to personal digital assistants, permitting
them to read or receive E-mail by voice. Although the first Newtons and
Zoomers have disappointed their sponsors, the market will ignite over the
next two years as vendors adopt the essential form factor of a digital cellular
phone with computer functions rather than providing a kluge computer with
a vaporware phone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, McCaw has more on its mind with Steinbrecher than merely gaining
a second source for CDPD sniffers. By simultaneously purchasing some 10
percent of the company and putting chief technical officer Nicholas Kauser
on the Steinbrecher board, McCaw is signaling not a tactical move but a
major strategic thrust. The Steinbrecher rollout in fact represents McCaw's
stealth deployment of broadband digital capability.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the rival CDPD equipment from PCSI, Hughes and AT&T all can be made
to perform CDPD communications as an overly to the existing cellular phone
system. However, only the Steinbrecher systems can be upgraded to perform
all of the functions of a base station and more, for voice, data and video.
Only Steinbrecher allows the replacement of 416 radio transceivers, one
for each channel, with one broadband radio and some digital signal processing
chips. Only Steinbrecher can replace a $ 1.5 million, 1,000 square foot
cellular base station with a box the size of a briefcase costing some $
100,000 but, thanks to Moore's Law, racing toward $ 10,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen only whether McCaw will have the guts to follow through
on this initiative by completely rebuilding its network to accommodate the
wideband radio being installed at its heart. Self-cannibalization is the
rule of success in information technology. Intel and Microsoft, for example,
lead the way in constantly attacking their own products. But this mode of
life is deeply alien to the telephone business--even an entrepreneurial
outfit like McCaw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With new software and a simple upgrade to a MiniCell, the Steinbrecher DataCell
will allow the McCaw system to handle all modulation schemes simultaneously--AMPS,
TDMA, CDMA and future methods such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access--obviating the need for hybrid phones. The multiprotocol and aerobatic
capabilities of broadband digital radios could enable McCaw to roll out
a cornucopia of PCS services--for everything from monitoring vending machines
or remote power stations to tracking tracks and packages, and linking laptops
and PDAs--while the rest of the industry is still paralyzed by wrangles
over incumbent users, regulatory procedures, frequency access and radio
standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Making channel sizes a variable rather than a fixed function of radios,
Steinbrecher systems offer the possibility of bandwidth on demand. They
could open up the entire spectrum as one gigantic broadband pipe into which
we would be able to insert packets in any empty space--dark fiber in the
air. 
<PRE>
<B>So Stop The Auction</B></PRE>
<BR>
So what does this have to do with the impending spectrum auction? Almost
everything. Strictly speaking, the FCC is leasing 10 year exclusive rights
to radiate electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies to deliver PCS.
This entire auction concept is tied to thousands of exclusive frequency
licenses. It has no place for broadband radios that treat all frequencies
alike and offer bandwidth on demand. It has no place for modulation schemes
that do not need exclusive spectrum space. Continuing to use interference
standards based on analog transmissions that are affected by every passing
spray of radiation, FCC rules fail to grasp the far more robust nature of
digital on-off codes with error correction. By the time the FCC gets around
to selling its 1,500 shards of air, the air will have been radically changed
by new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum. You buy or
lease spectrum as you would a spread of land. Once you have your license,
you can use it any way you want as long as you don't unduly disturb the
neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher system, by contrast, suggests a model not of a beach but
of an ocean. You can no more lease electromagnetic waves than you can lease
ocean waves. Enabled by new technology, this new model is suitable for an
information superhighway in the sky. You can use the spectrum as much as
you want as long as you don't collide with anyone else or pollute it with
high-powered noise or other nuisances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Steinbrecher model, you employ the spectrum as you use any public
right of way. You are responsible for keeping your eyes open and avoiding
others. You cannot just buy a 10 year lease and then barge blindly all over
the air in a high-powered vessel, depending on the government to keep everyone
else off your territory and out of your way. The spectrum is no longer dark.
The Steinbrecher broadband radio supplies you with lights as you travel
the information superhighway. You can see other travelers and avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if Steinbrecher radios did not exist, however, the assumptions of the
auction are collapsing in the face of innovations by Qualcomm and other
spread-spectrum companies. Like Steinbrecher radios, CDMA modulation schemes
allow you to use spectrum without interfering with others. To auditors without
the code, calls seem indistinguishable from noise. But radios with the code
can dig up signals from under the noise floor. Up to the point of traffic
congestion where the quality of the signal begins to degrade gracefully,
numerous users can employ the same frequencies at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This property of CDMA has been tested in Qualcomm's CDMA Omnitracs position
locator and two-way communications system. Mainly used by trucking companies,
it is now being extended to cars, boats, trains and other mobile equipment.
Based on geosynchronous satellites, it operates all across the country,
with some 60,000 units, under a secondary license that forbids Qualcomm
to interfere with the primary license-holders of the same frequencies. Qualcomm's
transceivers on the tops of trucks use a small antenna that issues a beam
six to 10 degrees in width. Because satellites are just two degrees apart,
the Qualcomm beam can blanket several satellites. Other users, however,
are entirely unconscious of the presence of the CDMA signal. Omnitracs has
operated for some six years and has not interfered with anyone yet. 
<PRE>
<B>No More Blind Drivers On The Information Superhighway</B></PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing array of low-interference technologies available, the
FCC should not give exclusive rights to anyone. Instead, it should impose
a heavy burden of proof on any service providers with blind or high-powered
systems that maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license,
that want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.
In particular, the FCC should make all the proponents of TDMA, whether in
the American or European GSM systems, explain why the government should
wall off spectrum. The wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth
on demand and send their packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm and Steinbrecher also radically attack
the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the auction is based. Steinbrecher's
radio makes it possible to manufacture new spectrum nearly at will. By putting
one of his MiniCells on every telephone pole and down every alley and in
every elevator shaft, the cellular industry can exponentially multiply the
total number of calls it can handle. At some $ 100,000 apiece and dropping
in price, these MiniCells can operate at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz
just as well as at the two-gigahertz range being auctioned by the government.
It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning off beachfront property, with a long
list of codicils and regulations and restrictive covenants, while the tide
pours in around him and creates new surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, the wideband capability
of the Steinbrecher radio joins CDMA in allowing the use of huge spans of
spectrum that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The Steinbrecher radio
can survey the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services,
UHF television and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions.
For example, the prime territory between 225 megahertz and 400 megahertz,
consisting of some 3,0130 25-kilohertz channels, is entirely occupied by
government and air force communications. But most of the channels are largely
unused. A Steinbrecher radio could sit on those frequencies and direct calls
to empty slots.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An ideal system would combine Steinbrecher broadband machines with Qualcomm's
modulation schemes. Steinbrecher supplies the lights and eyes to find space
in already licensed spectrum bands; CDMA allows the noninvasive entry Into
spans of spectrum that are in active use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Steinbrecher system changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot;
or rental. Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, Steinbrecher
radios can reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any
unoccupied territory. As Steinbrecher radios become the dominant technology,
the notion of spectrum assignments allotted in 2,500 specific shards becomes
a technological absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street is beginning to catch on. When Steinbrecher announced in January
a private placement through Alex. Brown, the company wanted to raise some
$ 20 million. The response was overwhelming, and hundreds of frustrated
Investors were left wringing their hands as the new radio left the station.
The sole proprietorship of the mid-1980s with revenues of $ 5 million or
less was moving into sleek new headquarters off Route 198 in Burlington.
Steinbrecher Corp. was becoming yet another of the Moore's Law monsters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the issue for Washington emerges starkly. Do we want a strategy
for MiniCells or for Minitels?

<PRE></PRE>
The perennial question of all suitors of fate and fortune now whispers and
resounds through conference resorts, executive retreats and consulting sessions
across the land as business leaders from Hollywood to Wall Street pose with
pundits and ponder the new world of converging technologies. Symbolized
in a famous mandala by MIT's Media Lab, this grand fondue of information
tools_to be served la carte on a flat-panel screen_is foreseen to be a $3.5
trillion feast for American business sometime early next century. Few would
guess that crucial to the emerging mediamorphosis_as king of the flat panel_will
be a slight, graying, bearded man with some 30 teddy bears, Roger Fidler.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler coined the term mediamorphosis as the title of his forthcoming book.
His office in Boulder, Colo., looks out on the panorama of a picturesque
downtown of red brick and neo-Gothic, surrounded by the Rocky Mountain foothills
and sepia sandstone buildings of a mile-high Silicon Valley. Down the hall
is an Apple Computer media center which is developing graphical forms of
AppleLink, the company's on-line network. Down the block is Cablelabs, John
Malone's research arm, which is designing the future of the cable industry.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Fidler, though, is a newspaperman, a veteran of some 32 years in a
business little known for technology. Beginning as an 11-year-old paperboy
in Eugene, Oreg., Fidler went on to serve as a reporter, science columnist
and art director before launching what is now Knight-Ridder Tribune Graphics.
A multimillion-dollar business and reliable profit center, this venture
provides digital graphics for newspapers and video animations for TV stations
across the country over a dedicated network called PressLink, also launched
by Fidler. Now Fidler and his allies working in Knight-Ridder's Information
Design Laboratory are concocting an audacious plan to make the lowly newspaper
the spearhead of the information economy.<BR>
<BR>
Most information companies and executives are betting on him to fail. Barry
Diller, the former ruler of 20th Century Fox, recently circled the planet
of technology on a celebrated pilgrimage from Hollywood to find where the
money would be made in the new information economy. Shunning Fidler's little
lab, he arrived at nearby Cablelabs and resolved on home shopping through
cable TV. He bought into QVC for some $20 million and went into business
with John Malone. After a more corporate investigation, featuring polls
and customer surveys, Robert Allen of AT&T settled to a remarkable degree
on the $14 billion market in electronic games. Since launching an alliance
with Sega, AT&T has been collecting game companies as compulsively as your
kid collects games. It has bought shares of Sierra Online, 3DO, Spectrum
HoloByte and PF Magic.<BR>
<BR>
Moving toward the news trade is IBM. But rather than collaborating with
one of the thousands of newspapers that use its equipment, the computer
giant is trysting with General Electric's NBC in a kind of elephants' waltz
into the sunset of old broadcast media.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these leaders in the new gold rush toward multimedia are getting
it wrong. Fixated by market surveys that map demand for existing video,
they are plunging down dead ends and cul-de-sacs with their eyes firmly
focused on the luminous visions in their rearview mirrors. Blockbuster,
Nintendo and other game and video vendors have good businesses, for the
moment, but they are ballast from the past.

News In The Microcosm

</B></PRE>
The leader who best comprehends the promise of the next phase in information
technology may be Fidler of Knight-Ridder. A student of electronic technology,
he has grasped an amazing and rather obscure fact: of all the information
providers, only newspapers are fully in tune with the law of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the constant rise in the computing power of individual microchips
relative to systems of chips, the law of the microcosm dictates that power
will continually devolve from centralized institutions, bureaucracies, computer
architectures and databases into distributed systems. On the most obvious
level, it caused the fall of the mainframe computer and the companies that
depended upon it, and assured the ascent of personal computers and workstations.
In the next decade, the law of the microcosm will assure the displacement
of analog television, with its centralized networks and broadcast stations,
by computer networks with no center at all. While offering a cornucopia
of interactivity, computer networks can perform all the functions of TV.<BR>
<BR>
With the cost-effectiveness of chips still doubling every 18 months, the
law of the microcosm is not going away. Now it dictates that of all the
many rivals to harvest the fruits of the information revolution, newspapers
and magazines will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
The secret of the success of the newspaper, grasped by Roger Fidler, is
that it is in practice a personal medium, used very differently by each
customer. Newspapers rely on the intelligence of the reader. Although the
editors select and shape the matter to be delivered, readers choose, peruse,
sort, queue and quaff the news and advertising copy at their own pace and
volition.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, newspapers differ from television stations in much the way
automobiles differ from trains. With the train (and the TV), you go to the
station at the scheduled time and travel to the destinations determined
from above. With the car (and the newspaper), you get in and go pretty much
where you want when you want. Putting the decisionmaking power into the
hands of the reader, the newspaper accords with the microcosmic model far
better than TV does. Newspaper readers are not couch potatoes; they interact
with the product, shaping it to their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
Computers will soon blow away the broadcast television industry, but they
pose no such threat to newspapers. Indeed, the computer is a perfect complement
to the newspaper. It enables the existing news industry to deliver its product
in real time. It hugely increases the quantity of information that can be
made available, including archives, maps, charts and other supporting material.
It opens the way to upgrading the news with full-screen photographs and
videos. While hugely enhancing the richness and timeliness of the news,
however, it empowers readers to use the &quot;paper&quot; in the same way
they do today_to browse and select stories and advertisements at their own
time and pace.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, the expense of computers restricted this complementarity
to newsrooms and pressrooms. The news today is collected, edited, laid out
and prepared for the press by advanced digital equipment. Reporters capture
and remit their data in digital form. But the actual printing and distribution
of the paper remain in the hands of printers and truckers.<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm has reduced the price of personal computers
below the tag on a high-end TV and made them nearly coextensive with newspapers.
Newspapers and computers are converging, while computers and televisions
still represent radically different modes. It is the newspaper, therefore,
not the TV, that is best fitted for the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
Newspapers can be built on foundations of sand_the silicon and silica of
microchips and telecom. Not only does the computer industry generate nearly
three times the annual revenues of television but computer hardware sales
are growing some eight times faster than the sales of television sets. By
riding the tides of personal computer sales and usage, newspapers can shape
the future of multimedia.<BR>
<BR>
High-definition PC displays will benefit text far more than images. The
resolution of current NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) analog
television_62 dots per inch_is actually ample for most images, particularly
the studio-quality forms that can be converted for digital delivery over
fiber-optic lines. Even the conventional interlaced TV screen_in which alternate
lines are filled in every second_easily fools the eye for video. But for
fully readable text you need the 200 to 300 dots per inch of a laser printer
or super-high-resolution screen. Such screens are now being developed. Overkill
for most images, they could supply the first display tablets with screens
as readable as paper.

Fat Panel's Digital Newspaper

</B></PRE>
After the &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; panorama, the first thing you
see in Roger Fidler's office is a more modest tableau. At a round table
in the corner is a huge teddy bear he calls Fat Panel. Fat Panel is poised
to read a tablet that looks very much like a newspaper, but in fact is a
flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high and a half-inch thick.
Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your
local newspaper, this device_call it a newspanel_might contain a trove of
news, graphics, audio and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday
papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links, it might connect to databases
of news and entertainment from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of this tablet is something that looks a lot like the page of
a newspaper. It contains headlines for featured stories followed by their
first few paragraphs and a jump to an inner page. The jump, unlike that
in your usual newspaper, is electronic and immediate. You click an arrow
with a pen or a mouse_or in the near future, say the word_and the rest of
the story almost instantly appears. If your eyes are otherwise engaged,
you can click on an audio icon and have the story read aloud to you.<BR>
<BR>
Discreetly placed on the bottom of the panel are three sample ads. Since
ads currently supply some 80 percent of the revenues of many newspapers
and magazines, the entire system will rise and fall on the effectiveness
of the ads. However, electronics promises a more total revolution in advertising
than in any other facet of the newspaper outside of printing. This change
comes none too soon. As shown by a general drop in margins from 30 percent
in the mid-1980s to close to 10 percent last year, newspapers are suffering
a sharp decline in conventional advertising revenues, only partly compensated
for by an influx of funds from blow-in coupons and inserts.<BR>
<BR>
In a 1988 prophecy at the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., Fidler
envisaged electronic newspanel ads in the year 2000: &quot;When you touch
most ads, they suddenly come alive. More importantly, advertisers can deliver
a variety of targeted messages that can be matched to each personal profile.
An airline ad offering discount fares to South America attracts me with
the haunting music of an Andean flute. I'm planning to take some vacation
time in Peru next month [Fidler's wife is a Peruvian recording artist],
so I touch the ad to get more information. Before I quit, I'll check the
ad indexes to see if any other airlines are offering discount fares. With
the built-in communicator, I can even make my reservations directly from
the tablet if I choose. The airline's reservation telephone number is embedded
in the ad, and my credit card numbers and other essential data are maintained
in the tablet, so all I would have to do is write in the dates and times
that I want to travel and touch a button on the screen. The information
is encrypted as well as voice-print protected, so there is no risk of someone
else placing orders with my tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the usual notion, the electronic newspaper will be a far more
effective advertising medium than current newspapers, television or home
shopping schemes. Rather than trying to trick the reader into watching the
ad, the newspaper will merely present the ad in a part of the paper frequented
by likely customers. Viewers who are seriously interested in the advertised
item can click on it and open up a more detailed presentation, or they can
advertise their own desire to buy a product of particular specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In deference to Fidler, who currently combs the world looking for the best
flat-panel screens, Fat Panel appears to be perusing a story on field emission
displays (FEDs). Even cathode ray tubes with VGA graphics command only 72
dots per inch of resolution. This has been shown to slow down reading by
some 25 percent compared with paper. Readers of Voyager Co.'s tomes on Mac
PowerBooks quickly discover that even Susan Faludi's breezy Backlash or
Michael Crichton's compulsive Jurassic Park or James Gleick's normally riveting
biography of Richard Feynman bog down in subtle but insidious typographical
fuzz. A newspaper with more than one item on the screen would be worse.
The age of electronic text entirely depends on the development of screens
with the definition of a laser printer. For this purpose, FEDs offer great
long-term promise.<BR>
<BR>
While the prevailing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) merely reflect or channel
light, FEDs emit light like a cathode ray tube. Indeed, as currently envisaged
by a Micron Display Technology process, FEDs will array millions of tiny
cathode light emitters that allow bright displays with high resolution and
full-motion video. Although today's FEDs require too much power for full
portability with current battery technology, they represent an inviting
option for newspaper tablets at the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Usable tablets, however, will arrive long before then. At the August Siggraph
show, Xerox demonstrated a 13-inch-diagonal liquid crystal display with
a record 6.3 million pixels, delivering 279 dots per inch of resolution.
The 279 dots per inch provide some three times more definition than the
screen of a Sun workstation_the current desktop graphics workhorse_and negligibly
short of the 300-dot resolution of a laser printer.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond resolution, the key to the newspaper tablet is portability. Portability
means low power. Active-matrix LCDs are inherently a high-power, low-transmissive
medium. The crystals absorb light; the polarizer wastes half the light;
the transistors at each pixel squander power. For high contrast, backlighting
is essential. That sinks another 20 to 30 watts. The higher the resolution,
the worse all these problems become.
<PRE>


<B>


Full-Motion Images Or Full-Motion Users?

</B></PRE>
According to the Fidler vision, the U.S. should stop emulating the Japanese,
who boldly invested some $12 billion in manufacturing capacity for power-hungry
liquid crystal displays used on notebook computers and flat-screen TVs.
Urged by the Clinton administration, this U.S. industrial policy is based
on a strategy of &quot;catch up and copy,&quot; and it will fail. Rather
than chase the Japanese by achieving high resolution at high power to compete
with cathode ray tubes, the U.S. should target high resolution at low power
to compete with paper.<BR>
<BR>
As in semiconductor electronics, the winners will follow a strategy of low
and slow. The law of the microcosm ordains exponential performance gains
from slower and lower-powered transistors packed ever closer together on
individual microchips. Throughout the history of semiconductors_from the
first transistor to the latest microprocessor_the industry has succeeded
by following this law: replacing faster and higher-powered components with
smaller, slower and lower-powered devices. When you pack enough of the slow
and low transistors close enough together, your system may end up operating
faster than a supercomputer based on the highest-powered and fastest discrete
transistors. And it will definitely be more efficient in MIPS per dollar.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm has not been suspended for displays. The Japanese
have been focusing on high-powered screens capable of reproducing the features
of low-end CRTs: full-motion color video. Rather than favoring full-motion
video, however, the U.S. should foster full-motion readers through low-
powered and slow components. It is the people rather than the pixels that
should be able to move. Speed will come in due course.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrating the first prototype of such a system is Zvi Yaniv of Advanced
Technology Incubator (ATI) of Farmington Hills, Mich. Long among the most
inventive figures in America's eternally embryonic flat-panel industry,
Yaniv was a founder of Optical Imaging Systems, currently the leading U.S.-based
producer, with well under one-percent global market share.<BR>
<BR>
For his tablet, Yaniv uses a material invented at Kent State University
in Ohio called Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Texture (PSCT). On it he inscribes
pixels in the form of helical liquid crystal devices. The helices are chemically
doped to give them a specific reflectivity: showing all wavelengths or colors
of light that do not match the resonant wavelengths in the helix.<BR>
<BR>
So far ATI has demonstrated images in black and white and in 16 levels of
gray scale. Color, according to Yaniv, poses no theoretical problems. Based
on current experimental successes, it will be achieved within the next two
years. For the first newspanels, however, color is less important than the
high-resolution text capability, which ATI delivers at a breakthrough price.<BR>
<BR>
This technology offers four key advantages over the active-matrix LCD: no
transistors, no polarizers, no color filters, no backlighting. Without these
power-and space-hungry features, Yaniv's screens can achieve higher density
of pixels at far lower energy use. This adds up to far higher resolution
at milliwatts of power (rather than 20 watts) and at far higher manufacturing
yields, and thus far lower cost. Yaniv predicts screens with laser-printer
resolution and with contrast higher than paper, costing between $1 and $2
per square inch (compared with around $10 for current active-matrix devices).
That means 8-1/2-by-11-inch tablets for $100 to $200 in manufacturing cost,
well under Fidler's target price.<BR>
<BR>
Still an R&D project in an intensely competitive industry, ATI may not have
all the answers, but it points the way to a solution. Within the next three
or four years, a portable tablet with laser-printer resolution and contrast
and with hundreds of megabytes of solid-state or hard disk memory will be
purchasable for an acceptable price. Fat Panel's tablet is not merely a
toy; it is the token of a technology that will sweep the world.

News On The Net

</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, precusor solutions are being rolled out on personal computers,
Newtons, Zoomers and other personal digital assistants. Already collecting
and transmitting copy in digital form, reporters and editors could just
as well provide digital content to all the other platforms that are emerging
in the 1990s, from tiny portable personal communications services to supercomputer
knowledge bases.<BR>
<BR>
Also empowering the newspaper industry will be the exploding new world of
boundless bandwidth or communications power in both the atmosphere and the
fibersphere (see Forbes ASAP, December 7, 1992, and March 29, 1993). One
of the most difficult concepts for many business planners to grasp is the
onset of bandwidth abundance: the idea that the electromagnetic spectrum
is not scarce but nearly limitless. The text of a daily newspaper takes
up about a megabyte; a hundred or so black-and-white photographs take up
about 100 megabytes; 25 color photos could run another 100 megabytes, or
even a gigabyte, depending on resolution. Video clips would take about 100
megabytes apiece. With just 500 megabytes, you could throw in the entire
&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summing it all up, the total bit-cost of a paper, including video-rich ads,
might be comparable to that of a two-hour movie_perhaps two gigabytes with
compression. Two gigabytes can be transmitted in a second down fiber-optic
lines, in perhaps 10 seconds down a gigahertz cable connection, and in perhaps
a matter of three or four minutes down a twisted-pair copper line equipped
with Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) technology, Amati Corp.'s
amazing new phone-company access system. From Digital Equipment Corp. and
Zenith to Hybrid Technologies and Continental Cablevision, several firms
are demonstrating impressive ways to use cable lines for two-way digital
data transmission at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more, which would
fill up a two-gigabyte newspanel in just over three minutes. Electrical
power companies also are laying fiber along with their power lines. All
these pipes are little used for long hours of the night and could be employed
to deliver newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Complementing this web of wires will be wireless methods of delivery. Cellular
technology is moving toward a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol
that allows use of the entire spectrum every mile or so, and toward millimeter
wave frequencies that offer gigahertz of capacity. Again, access to these
systems might be expensive on a demand basis, but a newspaper can be sent
whenever space or time is available. Delivery of the basic paper through
wires and fiber and delivery of short updates and extras via the air would
be optimal. Whatever electronic or photonic techniques are used, the laws
of the microcosm and telecosm ordain that distribution of newspapers will
become vastly cheaper, more efficient and more timely than their present
methods: trucks and bicycles.
<PRE>


<B>


The &quot;Domonetics&quot; Of The Word

</B></PRE>
The future of newspapers will not depend on technology alone, however. The
ultimate strength of the &quot;press&quot; comes not from its machinery
but from its &quot;domonetics&quot;_a word that describes an institution's
cultural sources and effects.<BR>
<BR>
Judeo-Christian scripture declares that in the beginning was the word. There
is no mention of the image. Today in information technology, the word still
widely prevails. In 1992, trade publications, newspapers and magazines alone
generated some $73 billion in sales, compared with television revenues of
$57 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In general, images are valuable as an enhancement to words. As Robert Lucky
of Bellcore has pointed out, images are not in themselves usually an efficient
mode of communication. In his definitive work &quot;Silicon Dreams,&quot;
just released in a new paperback edition, Lucky writes that after an evening
of television, &quot;we sink into bed, bloated with pictorial bits, starved
for information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
People who gush that a picture is worth a thousand words usually fail to
point out that it may well take a million computer &quot;words&quot; to
send or store it. Written words are a form of compression that has evolved
over thousands of years of civilization. In a multimedia encyclopedia, such
as Microsoft's Encarta, some 10,000 images take up 90 percent of the bits,
but supply perhaps one-100th of the information. With the pictures alone,
the encyclopedia is nearly worthless; with the words alone, you still have
a valuable encyclopedia. Most of the work and the worth are in the words.
Supremely the masters of words, newspapers can add cosmetic pictures, sounds
and video clips far more easily than TV or game machines can add reporting
depth, expertise, research and cogent opinion.<BR>
<BR>
More profoundly, the domonetics of the new technologies strongly favors
text-based communications. Video is most effective in conveying shocks and
sensations and appealing to prurient interests of large miscellaneous audiences.
Images easily excel in blasting through to the glandular substrates of the
human community; there's nothing like a body naked or bloody or both to
arrest the eye and forestall the TV zapper.<BR>
<BR>
TV news succeeds because of timeliness and vividness. Compared with TV imagery,
news photos tend to be late and lame. Nonetheless, for all its power and
influence, broadcast television news is a dead medium, awaiting early burial
by newspapers using new technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The TV news problem is summed up by the two-minute rule_the usual requirement
that, short of earthquake or war, no story take more than two minutes to
tell. This rule even applies to the epitome of broadcast news_CNN. It is
entirely a negative rule. The reason for it is not that the audience desires
no more than two minutes of coverage of stories of interest. On any matter
deeply interesting to the viewer, two minutes is much too little.<BR>
<BR>
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that the viewer will not tolerate
more than two minutes of an unwanted story. Its only function is to forestall
the zapper, but its effect is to frustrate any viewer with more than a superficial
interest in a story. Increasingly it reduces TV news to a kaleidoscope of
shocks and sensations, portents and propaganda, gossip and titillation.<BR>
<BR>
The new technologies, however, put individual customers in command. Making
their own first choices among scores of thousands of possibilities, individuals
eschew the hair-trigger poise of the channel surfer. Narrowcasting allows
appeal to the special interests and ambitions, the hobbies and curiosities,
the career pursuits and learning needs of particular individuals. Thus,
the new media open up domonetic vistas entirely missed by mass media.<BR>
<BR>
At the domonetic elevation of newspapers, images are supplementary, not
primary. The new technologies thus favor text over pure video because text_enhanced
by graphics where needed_is by far the best (and digitally most efficient)
way to convey most information and ideas. Where graphics are overwhelmingly
more efficient than alphanumerics_as in visualization of huge bodies of
data or statistics_the newspanel can supply true computer graphics and simulations.
Interactivity, after all, is the computer's forte.

The $700 Million Incentive

</B></PRE>
As early as 1981, Fidler saw and predicted that computer technology using
flat-panel screens would allow the newspaper business to eliminate much
of its centralized manufacturing and printing plant and much of its distribution
expenses, and deliver the product directly to the customer at half the cost.
He saw that this process would jeopardize neither the branded identity nor
the editing functions nor the essential character of the paper. The distribution
of intelligence would simply permit the customer rather than the newspaper
to supply the display and the printer. This microcosmic shift would drastically
simplify and improve the accessibility and worth of the information, enhancing
the value of newspaper archives and other resources. This step could theoretically
save Fidler's employer, Knight-Ridder, some $700 million, or between half
and two-thirds of its current costs.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler's vision is just as promising for magazines. In effect, his concept
allows newspapers to combine the best features of daily journalism with
the best qualities of specialty magazines. The front pages and shallower
levels of the system will still function like a streamlined newspaper, which
readers can browse, search and explore as they do a conventional paper without
thrashing about through the pages. The deeper levels will function like
magazines, focusing on business, technology, lifestyles, sports, religion
or art. Indeed, to exalt their offerings into an ever richer cornucopia,
news systems will want to collaborate with magazines, just as they often
distribute magazines today with their Sunday papers.

The Soul Of The New Medium

</B></PRE>
In addition, electronic magazines can excel newspapers in providing a sense
of community through interaction with other readers and authors in new kinds
of dynamic letters, bulletin boards and classified sections. In a sense,
the news panel never ends. Beyond its offering of news, articles and archives,
it opens into new dimensions of interactivity.<BR>
<BR>
As Stephen Case puts it: &quot;Everybody will become information providers
as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities
that marry information and communications_thereby creating an interactive,
participatory medium. This community aspect is crucial--it is the soul of
the new medium.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most practical current vessel for this expansion of the press is Case's
own company, America Online, a supplier of an icon-based interface and gateway
to scores of &quot;infobases&quot; and bulletin boards in Vienna, Va., outside
the District of Columbia. Ten percent owned by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
eight percent controlled by Apple, allied with Knight-Ridder and providing
access to such journals as the New Republic, National Geographic, Time and
Macworld, America Online has uniquely focused on the vital center of the
new market: the point of convergence of newspapers, magazines and computers
in new communities of interest and interaction.<BR>
<BR>
Following this strategy, America Online has invested just $20 million (one-100th
the capital of Prodigy) and devoted half the time, to achieve nearly one-third
the customer base and generate strong profits, in contrast to huge estimated
losses on the part of IBM and Sears. Prodigy is now paying AOL the high
tribute of imitation, making deals with Cox Enterprises Inc. and its 17
newspapers, and with Times-Mirror. Perhaps most audacious in pursuing this
vision, however, is Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., which recently purchased
Delphi Internet Services Corp., the only on-line service with full Internet
access to home PC users. Delphi already offers an array of news programs
and special-interest conferences, including a popular computer news show
led by moderator Jerry Pournelle that provides interactive dialogs on everything
from abstruse computer features to science fiction. Pournelle and some 300
other conference moderators can function like editors in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
Internet is the global agglomeration of data networks that has emerged from
the original Pentagon research network called ARPANET. Growing at some 15
percent a month for several years to a current level of 10 to 20 million
users, Internet has bifurcated into linked commercial and research nonprofit
divisions. As John Evans, president of News Corp.'s Electronic Data, puts
it, explaining the Delphi purchase: &quot;Internet is like a giant jellyfish.
You can't step on it. You can't go around it. You've got to go through it.&quot;
Delphi now plans to go through it using much quicker access systems, including
cable.<BR>
<BR>
Evans declares that these new collaborations between News Corp. and Internet
will &quot;put the 'me' back into media.&quot; His concept, also shared
by Nicholas Negroponte's Media Lab and Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator,
is an automated news database ultimately supplying the customer with a personal
paper filtered from floods of daily information by an agent programmed to
pursue your own interests. In Fidler's view, however, these digital papers
will succeed only to the extent that they transcend this vision of the Daily
Me.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler prefers the vision of a Daily Us, shaped by human editors rather
than by electronic agents or filters. According to Fidler, the law of the
microcosm will put so much intelligence and storage in the tablet that the
individual can personalize the &quot;paper&quot; every day in a different
way. If, as Case puts it, the soul of the new medium is community, the reader
will want to begin in a particular context, a specially favored &quot;place&quot;
in the world of information, a place with a brand name and identity: a newspaper.

The Computer Imperative

</B></PRE>
Above all, the key to the special advantage of newspapers in the new era
is their great good fortune in being forced to focus on computers. It should
be evident by now to everyone in the information business that the energy,
the creativity, the drive, the gusto, the pulse, the catalyst of this industry
is computers. The magic is in the microcosm of solid-state electronics (doubling
the density of components on a chip every 18 months) and in the concentric
circles of enterprise and invention that surge outward from this creative
core: the some 5,000 software firms, the thousands of manufacturers of chips,
peripherals, printed circuit boards and add-on cards; the double-digit annual
expansion in the armies of computer scientists and software engineers; the
ever growing millions of PC owners devoting their creative energies and
passions to this intoxicating machine.<BR>
<BR>
What the Model T was to the industrial era-the teenage training board, the
tinkerer's love and laboratory, the technological epitome-the PC is to the
Information Age. Just as people who rode the wave of automobile technology-from
tiremakers to fast-food franchisers-prevailed in the industrial era, so
the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer
community will predominate in the information era.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, are so many apparently ambitious and visionary executives shrinking
from the central arena to play around on the fringes with TVs and game machines?
Why are American computer executives standing silently aside while the so-called
U.S. Grand Alliance for the Future of Advanced Television, so-called digital
HDTV, adopts an interlaced screen technology that is fundamentally hostile
to computers?<BR>
<BR>
For images, the human eye cannot tell the difference between interlaced
and progressively scanned displays. But interlace poses endless problems
for text and multimedia. Apart from Zenith, the American leaders in the
Grand Alliance are AT&amp;T, General Instrument Corp., MIT, Sarnoff Laboratories
and GE-NBC. All but MIT capitulated to pressure from foreign TV interests
such as Sony, Thomson Corp. and Philips Electronics to betray the American
computer and newspaper industries by adopting a display scheme unsuited
for the multimedia and text programs central to the next computer revolution.<BR>
<BR>
Without text and multimedia capabilities, high-resolution images can open
virtually no markets not already served by current &quot;digitally enhanced&quot;
improved-definition television displays. Limiting the teleconferencing market,
for example, is not the resolution of the screens but the bandwidth of the
network. Without computer capabilities, digital TV is likely to be a large
disappointment.<BR>
<BR>
Claiming to set a standard that can survive deep into the next century,
the Grand Alliance is focusing on short-term economies for manufacturing
TVs tomorrow. These executives are all missing the point and the promise
of the era in which they live. The Information Age is not chiefly about
kicks and thrills, offering games for kids and so-called dildonics for &quot;adults.&quot;
Markets for educational programs and on-line information services are already
growing much faster than game markets. In 1992 in the computer business,
according to the Software Publishers Association, entertainment software
revenues rose some 29 percent to a level of $342 million. Educational software
for the home rose some 47 percent to $146 million. Meanwhile, sales of computers
with modems are rising at about 1,000 percent a year, hugely faster than
the sales of TVs. Online services like America Online and Prodigy have been
growing almost 500 percent per year since 1988. According to current projections
based on microprocessor CPU sales, some 50 million PCs may be sold over
the next 12 months, and perhaps three-quarters of them will contain either
on-board modems or networking systems.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate reason that the newspapers will prevail in the Information
Age is that they are better than anyone else at collecting, editing, filtering
and presenting real information, and they are allying with the computer
juggernaut to do it. The newspapers are pursuing the fastest expanding current
markets rather than rearview markets. They are targeting adults with real
interests and ambitions that generate buying power rather than distracting
children from more edifying pursuits. In the computer age, follow the microcosm
and you will find the money, too.

</H3>
The world of networks breaks into two polar paradigms. Most familiar is
the Public Switched Telephone Network. From the tiniest transistor flip-flop
on a modem chip through labyrinthine layers of rising complexity on up to
a 4ESS supercomputer switch linking 107,520 telephone trunk lines (itself
consisting of millions of interconnected transistors), the public network
is a vast, deterministic web of wires and switches. Once you are connected
in the public network, your message is guaranteed to get through.<BR>
<BR>
In the public network, bandwidth constantly expands as you rise in the hierarchy.
At the bottom are the twisted-pair copper wires of your telephone that function
at four kilohertz (thousands of cycles per second). At the top are fiber-optic
trunk lines that function at rates close to the 2.9-gigahertz speeds of
the electronic transistors that feed the glass wires. In The Geodesic Network,
writer Peter Huber has described the five tiers of the telephone switching
system as a structure with &quot;the solidity, permanence and inflexibility
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, which on paper it resembled.&quot; Although
the pyramid has suffered erosion and change in recent years, it remains
mostly in place today: the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
That is one network paradigm. The other paradigm is Robert Metcalfe's. It
germinated in his mind in 1970 as he read a paper by Norman Abramson of
the University of Hawaii given at a computer conference that year. Abramson
told of another paradigm. He called it Aloha. With Aloha, there were no
guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
AlohaNet was a packet radio system used for data communications among the
Hawaiian Islands. Packets are collections of bits led by a header, which
is a smaller collection of bits, bearing an address; they proceed through
a communications system rather like envelopes through a postal system. The
key feature of AlohaNet was that anyone could send packets to anyone else
at any time. You just began transmitting. If you didn't get an acknowledgment
back, you knew the message had failed to get through. Presumably your packets
had collided with others. In Metcalfe's words, &quot;They were lost in the
ether.&quot; At that point, you would simply wait a random period (to avoid
a repeat collision as both parties returned to the channel at once). Then
you would retransmit your message.<BR>
<BR>
To Metcalfe, AlohaNet seemed a beautifully simple network. But Abramson
showed that, because of collisions and other problems, it could exploit
only 17 percent of its potential capacity. A student of computer science
searching for thesis ideas, Metcalfe believed that by using a form of advanced
mathematics called queuing theory he could drastically improve the performance
of AlohaNet without damaging its essential elegance and simplicity. What
Metcalfe, then a graduate student at Harvard, eventually discovered would
bring such networks up toward 90 percent of capacity and make the Aloha
concept a serious threat to the entire structure of the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's discovery is known as Ethernet. Twenty years later, Ethernet
is the world's dominant local area network and, at 47, Metcalfe is known
and celebrated as its inventor. He was also founder in 1981 of 3Com Corp.
of Santa Clara, Calif., the leading producer of Ethernet adapter cards and
a major communications products company. In this era of networking, he is
the author of what I will call Metcalfe's law of the telecosm, showing the
magic of interconnections: connect any number, &quot;n,&quot; of machines
- whether computers, phones or even cars - and you get &quot;n&quot; squared
potential value. Think of phones without networks or cars without roads.
Conversely, imagine the benefits of linking up tens of millions of computers
and sense the exponential power of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the power of the telecosm reproduces on a larger scale - by interconnecting
computers - the exponential yield of the microcosm, a law describing the
near magical effect of interconnecting transistors on chips of silicon:
As increasing numbers of transistors are packed ever closer together, the
transistors run faster, cooler, cheaper and better. Metcalfe's law suggests
that a similar spiral of gains is available in the telecosm of computer
communications.<BR>
<BR>
Already the world economy is beginning to reap these gains. Ethernet now
links more than half of the world's 40 million networked computers, extending
Metcalfe's paradigm and his law. Indeed, the law would suggest that in addition
to his some $20 million of personal net worth from 3Com, Metcalfe's concept
has fostered scores of billions of dollars in global wealth. Led by Novell
Inc., with an equity capitalization of more than $8 billion, the top 15
publicly traded computer networking companies have a total market value
of some $22 billion. Add to that sum the productivity value derived from
the world's 100 million computers as they are increasingly linked in networks,
and you may sense the power of the Metcalfe paradigm.<BR>
<BR>
Today, 20 years after Metcalfe conceived it at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, Ethernet is still gathering momentum, gaining market share and generating
innovations. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of America's computers
on LANs rose from less than 10 to more than 60, and most of these gains
were in Ethernets.

Ether Moves to Cable
</B></PRE>
The telecosm's powers could end up saving the American economy from itself.
In an era when the new payroll taxes and regulations of Clintonomics could
end up driving millions of mind workers back into their homes, Digital Equipment
Corp. is now extending Ethernet's range from its current two-mile limit
to some 70 miles. Called Channelworks, the DEC system can run Ethernet on
the some 50 million miles of cable television coax. This will enable potential
scores of millions of telecommuters to access their familiar office LAN,
tap their company E-mail and their corporate databases, and generally make
themselves feel at work while at home. Deployed at a profit and extended
to customers at a flat monthly rate, Ethernet in the neighborhood could
become a massive growth business for the cable industry over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
As Ethernet spreads and faces the challenge of remote work teams using digital
images, simulations, maps, computer-assisted design schematics, visualizations,
high-fidelity sounds and other exotic forms of data, the system is constantly
adapting. From 3Com spin-offs Grand Junction Networks and LAN Media Corp.
to smart hubmaker David Systems, from Kalpana to Synernetics, from National
Semiconductor to Hewlett Packard, from Cabletron to SynOptics, from AT&T even
to Token Ring leader IBM, scores of companies are pushing Ethernet into
new functions and performance levels. It is emerging in full-duplex, multimedia,
fast, fiber- optic, shielded, unshielded, twisted, thin, thick, hubbed,
collapsed, vertebrate, invertebrate, baseband, broadband, pair, quartet,
coaxial and wireless versions. It now can run at 2.9, 10, 20 and 100 megabits
per second. It has moved from 2.9 megabits per second to 100 megabits per
second and from a few hundred to several million users in some 10 years.
At its present pace of progress, Ethernet will someday run isochronous (real-time)
gigabits per second on linguine.

Aloha ATM, Gushing Cash
</B></PRE>
So why is its boyish-looking inventor - over Metcalfe's anguished protests,
think of Ted Kennedy some 10 years ago - giving up on his baby just as it
enters its roaring 20s? Why is he ready to abandon his basic paradigm in
favor of a return to the public network vision of massive, intelligent switching
systems? Why is he now talking of Ethernet as a &quot;legacy LAN&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Discoursing this summer from a deck chair on his yacht (a converted lobster
boat) as he breezed down from his Maine retreat to a dock on the Charles
River for his 25th MIT reunion, Metcalfe has the air of an elder statesman.
Though humbly grateful for the benisons of Ethernet, he has seen the future
in a poll of experts prophesying the universal triumph of a powerful new
switching system called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). &quot;I have found,&quot;
Metcalfe solemnly intones, &quot;an amazing consensus among both telephone
industry and computer networking experts that ATM is the future of LANs.&quot;
Aloha, ATM.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe is not alone among Ethernet pioneers flocking back to Ma Bell's
pyramid of switches. Also leaving Ethernet behind is his onetime nemesis,
Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA, a leading guru of gigabit networks who helped
define the mathematical limits of Ethernet, and is given credit (or is it
blame?) for naming its Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
protocol (CSMA/CD). Preparing to defect to ATM is Ronald Schmidt, the brilliantly
ebullient technical director of SynOptics, who created the latest Ethernet
rage - sending the signals over telephone wire under the 10baseT standard
(10 megabits of baseband data over twisted pair).<BR>
<BR>
There has not been such a stampede to a new standard since the global rush
to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the early 1980s. Offering
digital phone lines at 144 kilobits per second, ISDN is just now coming
on-line in time to be aced by the megabits per second of Ethernet over cable.<BR>
<BR>
In a prophetic memo launching the concept in 1973, Metcalfe foreshadowed
the secret of Ethernet's success. He wrote: &quot;While we may end up using
coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise
to talk in terms of an ether, rather than `the cable'.... Who knows what
other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network: maybe
radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring, or frequency-multiplexed cable
TV or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof. The essential
feature of our medium - the ether - is that it carries transmissions, propagates
bits to all stations.&quot; In other words, it is the stations, rather than
the network, that have to sort out and &quot;switch&quot; the messages.<BR>
<BR>
The word Ethernet may be capitalized to signify the official standard of
CSMA/CD. Or it may be lowercased to suggest a medium without switches, routers
and other intelligence. In either case, the word &quot;ether&quot; conveys
the essence of the ethernet. An ether is a passive, omnipresent, homogeneous
medium. Long believed essential for the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
the literal existence of an ether was disproven in the late 19th century
by the famous experiments of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. But the
concept of a figurative ether - a dumb medium of propagation - survives
in modern communications.<BR>
<BR>
The enduring magic of ethernets stems from the law of the microcosm, favoring
distributed terminals over centralized hierarchies, peer networks of PCs
over mainframe pyramids. The microcosm's relentless price/performance gains
on chips have endowed Metcalfe's peer-to-peer scheme with ever more powerful
peers, at ever lower prices. Medium-independent from the outset, the Metcalfe
systems do not require central switching. In an ethernet system the intelligence
is entirely in the terminals, not in the network itself, and most of the
bandwidth is local (where some 80 percent of traffic resides).<BR>
<BR>
Although this ATM is expected to gush jackpots of cash for gaggles of network
companies and investors, it is unrelated to its acronymic twin, automatic
teller machines. Think of ATM rather as an automated postal center that
takes messages (of any size or addressing scheme), chops them up, puts them
into standardized little envelopes and figures the best routes to their
destinations in billionths of a second. The magic of ATM comes from restricting
its services to those uniform envelopes (called cells) of 53 bytes apiece
(including a five-byte address) and creating for each envelope what is called
a virtual circuit through the network. These features make it unnecessary
for intermediate switches in the network to check the address; the cell
flashes through the system on a precomputed course.<BR>
<BR>
A compromise defined by phone companies as the longest packet size that
can handle voice in real time, 53-byte cells are also short enough to be
entirely routed and switched in cheap hardware; i.e., microchips. This means
that the ATM postal center can function at speeds of up to 155 megabits
per second or even higher. Perhaps most attractive of all, ATM can handle
multimedia data, such as digital movies or teleconferences, with voice,
text and video that must arrive together at the same time in perfect sync.
As the world moves toward multimedia, the industry is flocking toward ATM,
the innovation that can make it possible. 
<PRE><B>


Ethernet: A Legacy LAN?
</B></PRE>
By contrast, Ethernet seems old and slow: the vacuum tube of computer communications.
Think of it, crudely, as a system where all the messages are cast into the
ocean and picked up by terminals on the beach which scan the tides for letters
addressed to them. Obviously, this system would work only if the beach terminals
could suck up and filter tremendous quantities of sea water. The magic of
ethernet comes from the ever growing power of computer terminals. The microcosm
supplies sufficiently powerful filtering chips - chiefly digital signal
processors improving their powers some tenfold every two years - to sort
mail and messages in the vasty deep. This is quite a trick. To the experts,
it seems unlikely to prevail for long against the fabulously swift switching
of ATM.<BR>
<BR>
True, there is some confusion about just how, where and when this miracle
cure will arrive. The industry's leading intellectual, Robert Lucky of Bellcore
- a paragon of long- distance networks - predicts that ATM will come first
in local area networks, while Metcalfe, of local area network fame, thinks
it will come first in wide area networks. James Chiddix of Time- Warner
Cable is probably right in predicting digital cable pay- per-view as the
first big ATM customer, using it for broadcasting films in his 500-channel
digital cable TV project in Orlando. But most experts agree that one way
or another ATM will blow away Ethernet during the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as usual, conventional wisdom is wrong. Ethernet is quietly
preparing for a new era of hegemony in the marketplace for computer connections.<BR>
<BR>
The reason Ethernet prevailed in the first place is that, in the words of
Ronald Schmidt, &quot;it was incredibly simple and elegant and robust.&quot;
In other words, it is cheap and simple for the user. Customers can preserve
their installed base of equipment while the network companies innovate with
new transmission media. When the network moves to new kinds of copper wires
or from one mode of fiber optics to another, Ethernet still looks essentially
the same to the computers attached to it. Most of the processing - connecting
the user to the network, sensing a carrier frequency on the wire and detecting
collisions - can be done on one Ethernet controller chip that costs a few
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe described the conception of this technology in 1981, &quot;I
explored the advantages of moving the transceiver down out of the ceiling
onto the adapter board in the host computer. I had seen many actual Ethernet
installations in which our brick transceivers were not up in the ceiling
tapping into the ether cable, as they were supposed to be...but instead
were on floors behind computers, dropped in the centers of neatly coiled
transceiver cables.... We were discovering that the people buying personal
computers and workstations in those days were not generally the same kind
of people who were allowed to remove ceiling tiles and string cables through
conduits.... The personal computer revolution was taking place in organizations
from the bottom up.... It was time for Ethernet to be re- invented for bottom-up
proliferation among the personal computer work group revolutionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using &quot;silicon compiler&quot; design tools to radically reduce the
time to market, Seeq Technology created an Ethernet chip for PCs in time
for a single-board version of the interface unit. Putting the transceiver
on the adapter board eliminated a special transceiver cable and drastically
simplified the system. There is no bulky connection between the coding device
preparing information for the network and the transceiver sending or receiving
the signals on the net. All this processing is done in the computer, on
one printed circuit board, now reduced to the size of a credit card. While
its rival from IBM - Token Ring - requires a mostly proprietary array of
token-passing managers, clocking assignments and other complexities, Ethernet
is an open system. Relative to the alternatives, it offers the possibility
of something near plug-and-play. So advantaged, Ethernet has overcome IBM's
Token Ring, 20 million nodes to 8 million in installed base.<BR>
<BR>
But this does not persuade Ethernet pioneers Bob Metcalfe, Leonard Kleinrock
and Ronald Schmidt. Because ATM can handle all kinds of data fast, Metcalfe
sees it as the &quot;grand unifier&quot; bringing together WANs and LANs
and effecting a convergence of television, telephony and computing in turbulent
multimedia bit streams bursting into our lives early next century. &quot;And
of all the variations of multimedia,&quot; he writes in Infoworld - Metcalfe
is now its publisher - &quot;the one that will drive ATM is personal computer
video conferencing - interactive, two-way, real-time, integrated digital
voice, video and data.&quot; Although Ethernet will persist as a &quot;legacy
LAN,&quot; he says, it cannot compete with ATM in these crucial new roles.
Schmidt makes the same essential case, stressing the need for switch-based
architectures in a world of exotic new media. 
<PRE>
<B>

Kleinrock's Formula
</B></PRE>
Why the pessimism on Ethernet? Bringing mathematics to bear on the argument,
Kleinrock declares that the collision-detecting functions of Ethernet bog
down with large bandwidths, short packets and long distances. Thus, the
system must fail with the onset of fiber highways across the land. The oceans
of Ethernet will simply grow too large to allow efficient detection of collisions
in its depths. With large bandwidths, more packets can be pumped into the
wire or glass before a collision is detected; by that time, most of the
transmission is finished. When the distances get too long, collisions can
occur far from the transmitting computer and take longer to be detected.
The shorter the packets, the worse these problems become.<BR>
<BR>
As Kleinrock computes these factors, the efficiency of Ethernet is roughly
a function (a), computed as five times the length of the line in kilometers
times the capacity of the system in megabits per second, divided by the
packet size in bits. When a exceeds a certain level (Kleinrock sets it at
0.05), Ethernet's efficiency plummets.<BR>
<BR>
With ATM packet sizes needed for voice traffic - or even at the minimum
Ethernet packet size of 72 bytes - any Ethernet with a capacity much higher
than 10 megabits per second exceeds this tipping point. Therefore, high-speed
Ethernets must either use packets too long for voice or shrink in extent
to far less than three kilometers. This is what Howard Charney's Grand Junction
and its rival LAN Media propose with Fast Ethernet. Noticing that 10baseT
hubs have reduced the length of Ethernet connections by a factor of 10,
Ron Crane, founder of LAN Media, suggests that this change allows acceleration
of the system by an equal amount: to 100 megabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
But this seems a one-time fix that fails to address the multigigabit world
of fiber optics. At some point, Kleinrock, Schmidt and Metcalfe agree, ad
hoc fixes will begin to fail and ATM (or possibly some other system) will
begin to prevail. Using Kleinrock's formula, that point is here today, with
100-megabit- per-second Ethernet lines.<BR>
<BR>
As an increasing share of network traffic takes the form of pictures, sounds,
simulations, three-dimensional visualizations, collaborative work sessions,
video teleconferences and high- resolution medical images, the Ethernet
model already seems to be foundering, according to many expert projections.
The triumph of ATM, so it would seem, is just a matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
Time, however, is precisely what is absent from all these projections. Ethernet
is a system based on the intelligence of terminals; ATM is a system based
on the intelligence of switches and networks. All the arguments for ATM
miss the law of the microcosm: the near annual doubling of chip densities,
the spiraling increase of computer power surging on the fringes of all networks
as transistor sizes plummet over the next decade. 
<PRE>
<B>

The Power of Exponents
</B></PRE>
Amazingly, most technology prophets fail to come to terms with the power
of exponents. You double anything annually for long - whether deforestation
in ecological nightmares or transistors on silicon in the awesome routine
of microchip progress - and you soon can ignite a sudden moment of metamorphosis:
a denuded world or a silicon brain.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the year 2000, semiconductor companies will begin manufacturing
microchips with more than a billion transistors on them - first as memories,
and soon after as processors. A billion transistors could accommodate the
central processing units of 1,000 Sun workstations or 16 Cray supercomputers.
This means roughly a millionfold rise in the cost-effectiveness of computing
hardware over the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Intelligence in terminals is a substitute for intelligence in networks;
switching and routing functions migrate from the center of the web to the
increasingly powerful computers on its fringe. Looming intelligence on the
edge of the network will relieve all the current problems attributed to
ethernets and will render the neatly calculated optimizations of ATM irrelevant.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the law of the telecosm is launching a similar spiral of performance
in transmission media, ultimately increasing their bandwidth, also by a
factor of millions. Bandwidth is a replacement for switches. If you can
put enough detailed addressing, routing, prioritization and other information
on the packets, you don't have to worry about channeling the data through
ATM switches. The emergence of dumb, passive all-optical networks with bandwidths
some ten- thousandfold larger than existing fiber optics will obviate much
of the pressure on switches. Combining microcosm and telecosm in explosive
convergence makes it nothing short of ridiculous to expect a system optimized
for 1995 chip densities and fiber capacities to remain optimal in 2013,
when Metcalfe foresees the final triumph of ATM, or even in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, ATM will be useful in various applications before then. Sun and
SynOptics envisage putting ATM ports in future workstations where ISDN ports
mostly languish today. AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Wiltel will incorporate
ATM switches in their long- distance networks. Time-Warner may indeed use
them for distributing movies. In general, however, companies that rely on
an apparent trend toward centralized switches will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Cable firms will do better by sticking to the ethernet paradigm of dumb
bandwidth that has made them the envy of all in the emerging era of digital
video. IBM and other computer firms with powerful ethernet and fiber technologies
should not rush to adopt the public network paradigm. Telephone companies
in particular should maintain an acute interest in their ongoing experiments
with all-optical networks and other passive optical technologies. Any near-term
successes of ATM, afflicted with the many glitches and growing pains of
any new technology, are likely to come too slowly to deflect the continuing
onrush of ethernets.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet prevails because it is dumb. In the old world of dumb terminals
- whether phones, IBM displays or boob tubes - a network had to be smart.
There was time even to put human operators into the loop, and a need to
concentrate programming at one central location. But in the emerging world
of supercomputers in your pocket or living room, networks will have to be
dumb bandwidth pipes. What the coming array of desktop supercomputers and
cheap massively parallel servers will need is passive dark fiber, mostly
unlit by switching intelligence. Dark fiber can allow for the huge variety
of data forms and functions, protocols and modulation schemes that is emerging
in the new era of convergence between phones and computers.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet is the protocol for a dumb pipe, a passive ether. That is why it
fits so well on a cable TV line and why it will fit even into the multigigabit
world of a multimedia future.

The Return of Aloha
</B></PRE>
The dumb networks of the fibersphere will be ethernets. These all-optical
links that have been made possible by the creation of erbium-doped amplifiers
and other passive devices give access to the full 25,000-gigahertz bandwidth
of fiber optics (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; December 7, 1992).
In these networks, fiber changes from a substitute for copper to a substitute
for air. Just as the microcosm put entire computer systems on single slivers
of silicon, the telecosm will put entire communications systems on seamless
webs of silica. Terminals will tune into the infrared colors of the fibersphere
like radios tuning into the frequencies of AM or FM.<BR>
<BR>
As chips and fiber are hugely expanding their performance and bandwidth,
information traffic is rapidly migrating from the wires to the air. Although
many experts contend that the radio frequencies in the air - the electromagnetic
spectrum - are running out, communications systems now use only a tiny sliver
of spectrum, well under one percent of the usable span. As shown by Cellular
Vision's success in sending cable TV signals over the air at 28 gigahertz,
it is now possible to move up the spectrum into the vast domains of microwaves;
other experiments show that network traffic in these portions of the spectrum
can be accommodated with error rates of less than one in a billion, enough
to avoid extensive error correcting.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the replacement of today's 30-mile cells with tomorrow's
closely packed microcells means an exponential rise in available spectrum
and an exponential reduction in power usage. The replacement of analog systems
with digital systems using code division multiple access (CDMA) will allow
the reuse of all frequencies in every cell, thus further expanding available
spectrum (see &quot;New Rules of Wireless,&quot; March 29, 1993). A company
called ArrayCom in Santa Clara, Calif., is developing a new system, called
spatial division multiple access (SDMA), based on smart antennas that can
follow an individual communicator as it moves through a cell. This technology
would allow the use of all the available spectrum by each &quot;phone.&quot;
<PRE>
<B>

Back to the Real &quot;Ether&quot; Net
</B></PRE>
Inspired by a radio network, ethernet is well adapted for this new world
of wireless. The increasing movement of data communications into the air
- the real ether - will give new life to Metcalfe's media-independent system.
Cellular systems already operate with protocols similar to CSMA/CD. As microcells
fill up with digital wireless traffic, all networks will increasingly resemble
the most popular computer networks. In the ether, links will resemble ethernets
far more than ATMs.<BR>
<BR>
The coming age of bandwidth abundance in glass and in air converges with
an era of supercomputer powers in the sand of microchips. We should build
our systems of the future - the cathedrals of the Information Age - on this
foundation of sand. It will not disappoint us.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in glass or in air, the basic protection of Ethernet is not smarts
but statistics. Ethernet is a probabilistic system. This fact has caused
endless confusion. Because a probabilistic system cannot guarantee delivery
of data on a specific schedule, or at all, many experts have concluded that
Ethernet is unsuited for critical functions, or for isochronous data inherent
in multimedia - with voice and video that must arrive in real time. When
and whether anything arrives is a stochastic matter.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, if there is enough bandwidth for the application, ethernets
work just as reliably and well as their deterministic rivals, even for advanced
video traffic. As Kleinrock observes, for many image applications, very
long packets can be as effective as very short ones. The long packets become
a virtual circuit connection, somewhat like a phone call. It is likely that
perhaps 80 percent of all multimedia will be sent in burst mode, with a
store-and-forward protocol, rather than isochronously in real time. Broadband
ethernets will be better for burst mode than ATM's short packets.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, the combination of intelligence at the terminals and statistics
in the network is more robust than the mechanistic reliability of Token
Rings or ATM switches. As Metcalfe points out in explaining the triumph
of his vision over Token Ring, Ethernet is a simple system that is stabilized
by its own failures. The CSMA/CD algorithm uses collision detection in a
negative feedback loop that delays retransmission in exponential proportion
to the number of collisions, which is a reliable index of the level of traffic.
Thus thriving on a worst- case assumption of frequent failure, Ethernet
has outpaced all rivals that guarantee perfect performance and depend on
it. 
<PRE><B>


Metcalfe's Law: Transcending His Own Doubts
</B></PRE>
Now, in ATM, Ethernet is faced with a new paragon of determinism offering
high speeds and rigorous guarantees, a new version of the public network
paradigm, a new pyramid of switching power. But Metcalfe's law and legacy
may well win again, in spite of his own defection.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe explains, &quot;Ethernet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;
The same could be said of all the devices of the microcosm and telecosm.
Both of the supreme sciences that sustain computer and communications technology
- quantum theory and information theory - are based on probabilistic rather
than deterministic models. They offer the underpinnings for an age of individual
freedom and entrepreneurial creativity.<BR>
<BR>
Humankind's constant search for deterministic assurance defies the ascendant
science of the era, which finds nature itself as probabilistic. To Einstein's
disappointment, God apparently does throw dice. But chance is the measure
of human ignorance and the mark of divine knowledge. Chance thus is the
paradoxical root of both fate and freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Nations and networks can win by shunning determinism and finding stability
in a constant shuffle of collisions and contentions in ever expanding arenas
of liberty.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an acceptance of setbacks, capitalist markets are more robust
than socialist systems that plan for perfection. In the same way, successful
people and companies have more failures than failures do. The successes
use their faults and collisions as sources of new knowledge. Companies that
try to banish chance by relying on market research and focus groups do less
well than companies that freely make mistakes and learn from them.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an ability to absorb shocks, stochastic systems in general are
more stable than deterministic ones. Listening to the technology, we find
that ethernets resonate to the deepest hymns and harmonies of our age.

The following article, ISSAQUAH MIRACLE, was first published in Forbes ASAP,
June 7, 1993.</H5>

</H3>
<HR>In the spring of 1989 when Michael Bookey first visited the Middle School
in Issaquah, Wash., to help the school system with its computers, he was
reminded of his early ventures into Communist China. After 20 years of working
with computer networks, to enter Issaquah seemed to me like encountering
an exotic tribe of primitives untouched by the modern world.<BR>
<BR>
The only sign of modern technology was a forlorn computer room full of Radio
Shack TRS-80 machines, most of which had broken down. Then he learned that
as a remedy for this problem, the district had recently voted a levy of
$2.7 million for outlays on high technology.<BR>
<BR>
Lacking any better ideas, the school system had decided to distribute the
money equally among the teachers, to spend as they wanted. What they wanted
turned out to be VCRs, incompatible CD- ROM drives and a random selection
of computers, printers and other gear to be scattered through the schools
under the influence of a flock of computer salespeople attracted to the
site by the pool of mandated money.<BR>
<BR>
To Bookey, this remedy seemed worse than the disease. It meant that the
bulk of the money would be wasted, further estranging both taxpayers and
students from the most powerful technologies of their era. Bookey wanted
school officials to know that the most powerful technology is not computers,
but computers joined in networks.<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the magic of networks, Bookey asks you to imagine a car plumped
down in the jungle. Checking it out, you might find it a very useful piece
of equipment indeed. A multipurpose wonder, it would supply lights, bedding,
radio communications, tape player, heat, air conditioning, a shield against
arrows and bullets, and a loud horn to frighten away fierce animals. In
awe of the features of this machine, you might never realize that the real
magic of a car comes in conjunction with asphalt.<BR>
<BR>
For the first 10 years of the personal computer era, according to Bookey,
we have used our computers like cars in the jungle. We have plumbed their
powers for processing words and numbers. All too often, home computers have
ended up in the closet unused. We have often failed to recognize that most
of the magic of computing stems from the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, the interconnections come on individual chips, as ever
smaller transistors crammed ever closer together work faster, cooler and
cheaper, enhancing both the capability and the speed of the processor. The
microcosm strewed some 100 million personal computers around the world and
endowed individuals at workstations with the creative power of factory owners
of the Industrial Age.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the microcosm generates exponential gains from increasing connections
on chips, the telecosm generates exponential gains by increasing connections
between chips, powerful microcomputers in themselves. These links between
increasingly potent microchips will soon dominate the world of communications.<BR>
<BR>
The networking industry therefore faces a drastic transition from a people-to-people
regime to computer-to-computer. This change is so radical that it resembles
a mutation that creates a new species. People communicate in domains of
time and space entirely alien to the world of computers. To a person, a
one- second delay on a voice line seems hardly noticeable; to a computer,
one second may mean a billion computations that would take hundreds of human
lifetimes to accomplish by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, people can transmit or receive only a small stream of information
at a time. They want relatively narrow bandwidth connections for a relatively
long period, a 64-kilobit- per-second voice link, for example, for a 10-minute
phone call.<BR>
<BR>
Computers, on the other hand, can handle hundreds of millions or even billions
of bits a second. They often need many millions of bits of bandwidth for
a short time fractions of seconds. As industry shifts from a human scale
of time and space to a computer scale, the systems and structures in existing
telephone and broadcast networks become almost irrelevant. Essentially,
all other forms of networks: voice, text, video and sound, are rapidly giving
way to various new forms of multimedia computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Driving this overwhelming force of change is the alchemy of interconnections,
working in the telecosm with the same logic and feedback loops as connections
in the microcosm. hile dumb terminals such as phones and TVs use up bandwidth
without giving anything back, computers are contributors to bandwidth, not
consumers of it.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the more computers, the more bandwidth. Not only is the network
a resource for each new computer attached to it, but each new computer is
also a resource for the network. Each new computer expands the potential
switching and processing capacity of the system by a large multiple of the
increasing demands it makes on other switches and processors.<BR>
<BR>
As ever more powerful computers are linked ever more closely, whether in
digital cellular microcells or in webs of fiber and coaxial cable, usable
bandwidth expands explosively. Governing the expansion of networks, the
law of the telecosm is just as potent as the law of the microcosm. Indeed,
in enhancing the productivity of organizations, the telecosm consummates
the microcosmic miracle.

Microsoft Windows for Jungle Cars</B></PRE>
The creator in the early 1970s of what may have been the world's first fully
functioning system of corporate electronic mail, Bookey was quick to foresee
this radical shift from person- to-person to computer-to-computer communications.
Pursuing his vision of networks, Bookey in 1982 spurned a possible job at
Microsoft on the grounds that the company was outfitting cars for the jungle,
a decision that probably cost him several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he joined Seafirst Bank in Seattle, where he made history (in the
form of a reference in John Sculley's autobiography, Odyssey) by pushing
the purchase of a thousand Macintosh computers for bank networks at a crucial
time for Apple.<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 Bookey left the bank to join Doelz Co., a startup in Irvine, Calif.,
that built advanced computer network equipment that he had used at Seafirst.
For Doelz, Bookey designed software and spearheaded marketing. A so-called
cell-based network, the Doelz system broke up a stream of data into short,
equal-sized packets, each with its own address, to be sent through the nodes
of the net in nanoseconds, like letters accelerated a trillionfold through
the branches of the post office.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey was not necessarily wrong in choosing this technology over Microsoft's.
In the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems, this essential
approach, based on short, uniform packets that can be switched at gigabit
speeds in hardware, is now the rage of planners in the computer networking
industry.<BR>
<BR>
ATM is seen as the crucial enabler for digital networks combining voice,
data and video in so-called multimedia applications. Bill Gates now calls
multimedia the future of his industry. Although many observers still see
ATM as a futuristic technology, Bookey believes its future is nearly now.
From the humblest personal digital phone to the most advanced supercomputer,
computer-to-computer links will dominate the entire universe of telecommunications,
and ATM will dominate network switching.<BR>
<BR>
Doelz, however, was ahead of its time and failed to survive a tangled legal
imbroglio with AT&T in 1988. So Bookey took a big profit on his California
residence and returned with his wife Robin and daughter Erin to Seattle,
where he had grown up and set records in the mile on the track at the University
of Washington. He bought his dream house on the top of Cougar Mountain in
Issaquah, with a view of the very Twin Peaks made famous in the television
series and put out his shingle as a network consultant under the name Digital
Network Architects (DNA). Almost as an afterthought, the Bookeys sent Erin
to Issaquah Middle School.<BR>
<BR>
Having designed networks around the world, Bookey had often seen their powerful
impact on business organizations, such as banks. Bookey believed that networks
could have a similar revitalizing impact on schools. Like banks, schools
are essentially information systems that have brought their Industrial Age
hierarchy into the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Creating networks in schools, however, posed many special problems. Most
school systems, like Issaquah, were largely unaccustomed to managing technology.
The system would need to create a large MIS (management information services)
organization just to keep the network functioning. Then, as the teachers
at Issaquah hastened to point out to Bookey, there was the problem of students.
Impulsive, mischievous and messy, they in no way resembled the disciplined
employees of a corporation. Speaking from grim experience, some of the teachers
told Bookey that his network plans would succeed only if the computers were
reserved exclusively for teachers and if students were barred entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey, however, thought there had to be a way to bring the magic of networks
to America's increasingly troubled school systems. The secret would be to
recognize that, just as computers are not consumers of but contributors
to bandwidth, students should be seen not as a problem, but as a precious
resource in launching the networks that inform the Information Age.

Networks as Productivity Engines</B></PRE>
Ever since Adam Smith first maintained that the division of labor, the spread
of specialization, is the catalyst of the wealth of nations, economists
have seen the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and specialties as
the driver of efficiency and growth. The key force expanding specialization
in the contemporary capitalist economy is networks. Indeed, networks, by
their nature and purpose, refine the division of labor.<BR>
<BR>
In the financial industry, for example, networks allowed the proliferation
of specialized institutions. In the ever-shifting kaleidoscopes of American
finance, some institutions went local, some global. Some managed car loans,
credit cards or other consumer services; some handled mortgages, mutual
funds or real estate trusts; still others stressed computer leases, junk
bonds, venture capital or large corporate accounts.<BR>
<BR>
The pell-mell fragmentation of American finance during the 1980s into an
ever more refined division of labor enabled the U.S. to lead the world in
levels of capital efficiency, with more economic growth per dollar of savings
than any other country. Each financial business did not have to repeat all
the work of all the rest, and each became more efficient at a particular
task.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey believes that networks can have a similar effect on that other great
information-processing industry: education. Why should every school have
an all-purpose library and a French teacher and a calculus scholar and a
health center and an administrative office? Why should every school have
an entire complement of buildings?<BR>
<BR>
With all the schools on networks, individual schools could specialize in
particular subjects, functions and resources, as financial companies do.
Education would not have to happen exclusively, or even mostly, in schools.
The explosive spread of networks is now the prime mover of the U.S. economy,
allowing all industries to break down into patterns of specialization unbound
by place and time. And now the government wants to get into the act.

Superhighways in the Sky</B></PRE>
Zoom through tax-hike tollgates and glide out onto data superhighways; this
is the new mantra of American industrial policy. Add the further fillip
of investment for educational infrastructure and you can sweep up the ramp
toward the federal treasury and drive out with a bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
In this new era of the big bands, there are now some 10 bills before Congress
to foster vast new networks with large bandwidth, or communications capacity.
Some $2 billion has already been authorized and $765 million appropriated
this year for various programs related to a National Research and Educational
Network (NREN).<BR>
<BR>
Candidate Bill Clinton presented the concept of NREN as Ra national information
network to link every home, business, lab, classroom and library by the
year 2015. President Bill Clinton, vice-president Albert Gore and a raft
of advisors all celebrate the highway as the metaphor for the future information
economy. Gore points out that his father was a leader in building the Interstate
Highway System in the early 1950s; Albert Jr., wants to play a key role
in building the information highways of the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, data superhighways would seem to be the fulfillment of the fibersphere;
the way to create the vast new infrastructure of fiber-optic lines that
will bring the full promise of digital video and multimedia communications
to all citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, is Mike Bookey so worried? He would seem to be the perfect NREN
champion. Bookey has pursued networks through most of his career and now
is focusing on networks for education. In explaining the importance of computer
connections, he has even long used Gore's favored highway metaphor. Bookey
thinks that the federal superhighwaymen do not grasp the nature of networks
and how they grow. In systems work we have a rule: You design top down,
but you build bottom up.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey sees the creation of networks as an organic process, driven by public
demand, shaped by human needs and rooted in a moral universe of growth through
sharing. It is the experience of building the network that creates the expertise
to maintain and use it. In all these processes, big government is nearly
irrelevant. 
<PRE>


<B>


None of the Above</B></PRE>
For the past 10 years, Washington, D.C. experts have been wringing their
hands over the supposedly unbearable costs of building broadband networks
and the urgent need for large federal funding. Analysts have been ruminating
over the question of who would spearhead the creation of broadband nets;
the phone companies, the cable television companies or the government.<BR>
<BR>
Before any of these forces could act, however, it became clear that the
answer would be none of the above. The hardest part of the job was accomplished,
with astonishing speed, by computer and networking companies. The rest of
the work is well under way, as cable and phone companies adopt the computer
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
As recently as 1989, only seven percent of America's personal computers
were connected to local area networks. By 1991 45 percent were connected,
and by 1993, close to two-thirds were linked to LANs. Growing even faster
than LANs is the internetworking business: the interconnection of existing
local area nets in wide area networks.<BR>
<BR>
Building internetworking gear or accessories, such companies as Cisco Systems,
Cabletron, Wellfleet, 3Com and SynOptics are among the highest flyers in
the technology stock market boom. Cisco, for example, is growing some 50
percent a year and commands a market value of almost $6 billion, comparable
to that of Digital Equipment Corp. Cabletron has hiked its revenues some
16-fold in the last five years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these connections run at some 10 megabits per second, enough for
high-resolution digital video, but inadequate for the more exotic traffic
in images predicted for use later in the decade. Increasingly, however,
the connections are fiber- optic lines or are broadband coax, which is nearly
as good as fiber for short-distance transport. The potential of fiber is
almost unlimited (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; Forbes ASAP, December
7, 1992).<BR>
<BR>
Although moving more slowly than the computer firms, telephone and cable
companies are rushing to lay fiber ever deeper into the nation's neighborhoods.
Spending some $2 billion (as much as NREN), Telecommunications Inc. (TCI)
vows, according to CEO John Malone, to have 90 percent of its subscriber
households served by fiber to the curb by 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing fiber into the local loop at a slower pace, the telephone companies,
led by Bell Atlantic, also are forging ahead with ingenious new ways to
make their twisted-pair copper connections carry as much as six megabits
per second of digital information. Wireless technology is also moving into
the local loop for video delivery (see &quot;The New Rule of Wireless,&quot;
Forbes ASAP, March 29, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. networking industry is not in need of fixing. The U.S. currently
commands some three-fourths of all the world's LANs and perhaps 85 percent
of its internetworks. Although Gore and others justify their industrial
policies by referring to the imperious plans of Japan, the U.S. currently
commands about three times the computer power per capita as Japan, some
10 times as many computers attached to networks, and an installed base of
broadband fiber and cable nearly 10 times as large. The remarkable thing
is that the U.S. government is so eager to fix a fabulously flourishing
system that is the envy of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The electronic and photonic networking industries actually resemble highways
in only the most superficial way. The highway construction trade has not
advanced substantially in 50 years. By contrast, the networking trade is
the fastest-moving part of the ever-accelerating computer industry and doubles
its cost- effectiveness every year. Although interconnecting government
laboratories, contractors and supercomputer centers with fiber is desirable,
a massive government network is not. Issaquah offers better guidance for
the future.... But first it will be necessary to deal with the abiding menace
of the student problem. 
<PRE>


<B>


Overcoming the Student Problem</B></PRE>
&quot;What do you think you are doing? Answer me,&quot; the voice insisted
with the I've-got-you-squirming-now confidence of a teacher who has caught
a pupil red-handed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just lookin' around,&quot; grumbled Lee Dumas, the red-headed 13-
year-old, trying to sound natural. Glimpsing a telltale red screen of network
management among the array of blue displays used in the keyboarding class,
the teacher had walked up silently behind Dumas as he broke into the student
lists, software programs and grades, and was on the verge of entering the
administrative server.<BR>
<BR>
Dumas was a bad kid. No one at Maywood Middle School (one of the 16 campuses
in Issaquah) doubted that. His teachers called him &quot;obnoxious&quot;
or even &quot;brain-dead.&quot; He set what he believes was an all-time
record at Maywood by being detained after class some 60 times for insubordination.
Using the approved psychobabble, he says, &quot;I had problems with authority.
I couldn't accept teachers ordering me around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After being caught breaking into the computer system, Dumas was dragged
up to the principal's office. Neither the teacher nor the principal could
figure out the nature of the crime or judge its seriousness. For help, they
summoned Don Robertson, the administrator assigned to Issaquah's Technology
Information Project (TIP). He considered the situation gravely and recommended
severe punishment. Toward the end of the meeting, however, he turned to
Dumas and said, &quot;With your talent, you should become the sheriff rather
than the outlaw. Why don't you come down and join TIP?&quot; Since no one
had previously detected any talent in Dumas, this comment made a sharp impression.<BR>
<BR>
About a week later, he showed up sheepishly at Robertson's door. To school
administrators, kids like Dumas might be a problem, but to Bookey, Issaquah's
9,000 students seemed a wonderfully cheap resource. By training the students
to build and maintain the networks, he could make the $2.7 million the foundation
of an enduring educational resource.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the Issaquah network was almost entirely built by students between
the ages of 12 and 17. Using students to solve the problems of network maintenance
and support and thus reduce the real costs by some 80 percent was Mike Bookey's
solution to the perplexing problem of computers in schools.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the Issaquah networking venture, in the spring of 1990,
cost no money and arose from pure necessity. Just as in businesses across
the country, the initial motive for networking was the arrival of laser
printers from Hewlett Packard. Bookey began by giving his 10-person TIP
team a pile of manuals and having them install a basic network connecting
two PCs, an Apple II and a Macintosh to a laser printer. This step enhanced
the value of all the computers at a small fraction of the cost of buying
new dot-matrix printers for each. Four of the ten students managed to cobble
together the network in about a month. They learned the intricacies of pulling
twisted-pair wiring for 10baseT Ethernet computer connections running at
the standard rate of 10 million bits (megabits) per second.<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to add a hard disk containing school files and software
programs. Using both Apples and IBM PCs, the Issaquah network from the beginning,
had to handle a variety of communications protocols. If the network was
to connect to anything outside itself to the school's administration building
or the school system's libraries, for example, Issaquah would have to install
equipment that could sort out messages from different computers. This meant
Issaquah joined the market for multiprotocol routers. A router is a device
that sits on a computer network and reads the addresses on all the message
packets that pass by. If the address is on another network with a different
protocol, the router creates a new envelope for the packet and sends it
to the other network.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with all their routers and Ethernet wiring, the Issaquah networks
slowed to a crawl as soon as they had to connect outside a building. There,
they had to depend on what is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network,
where everything turns to analog and drowses down to some 2,400 bits per
second.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey demonstrated that the school could save money on its voice communications
by buying a digital T-1 line that multiplexes 24 phone circuits onto a 1.544-megabit-per-second
system. Since 12 of the 24 circuits would be enough to satisfy the school's
internal voice needs, the rest of the T-1 line, some 760 kilobits per second,
could be devoted to the data communications needs created by the school's
new Ethernets. Thus, while getting a cheaper solution for its voice traffic,
the school increased its data bandwidth by some sevenfold for free.<BR>
<BR>
Once these connections were in place, the students acquired a Microsoft
Mail program to incorporate E-mail in the system. Soon, this became the
heart of the network, with both students and teachers using it constantly
to handle papers, consult teachers in other schools in the system, make
reports to the state and interact with parents and students. E-mail became
so central to the functioning of Issaquah that when the computers were down
teachers would talk of canceling classes.<BR>
<BR>
To E-mail were added connections to Internet, the global research and education
network launched some 33 years ago as DARPA Net (the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency). Since Internet was civilianized in 1983,
adopting the TCP/IP networking standard, it has been expanding its traffic
at a pace of some 15 percent per month. Between 1981 and 1992 the number
of computers connected to Internet rose from 281 to 1.1 million. Through
Internet, the students could search through a variety of databases for material
for a paper or connect to Japan for help in learning Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Along with several other Issaquah students, Aaron Woodman, Jr., a burly
boy with his long blonde hair in a ponytail, became so adept at using Internet
that he now gives speeches to national conferences on the subject. The speechmaking
needs that grew out of the Issaquah project have imparted valuable lessons
in English communications for the students.<BR>
<BR>
All these developments did not occur without administrative resistance.
But the administration eventually became a prime beneficiary. Soon, the
computer networks in the Issaquah system were connected by a T-1 line to
the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative (WSIPC) 20 miles
north in Redmond, where attendance and other student records were kept for
the entire state.<BR>
<BR>
To make these WSIPC services more readily available to schools across the
state, Bookey proposed the creation of a statewide educational network running
on T-3 lines (45 megabits per second), now known as WEDNET. This provides
links all over Washington, from Shaw Island and Stehekin to Seattle and
Issaquah, with a rogue line down to Portland, Oreg.<BR>
<BR>
As for Lee Dumas, according to his mother, his situation has changed completely,
&quot;both in his attitude toward school and in the school's attitude toward
him.&quot; After joining TIP, Dumas became one of its most active and enthusiastic
members. Last summer, he got a job at the Computer Store in Seattle teaching
the Macintosh HyperCard program to a student body consisting, yes, of public
school teachers. According to Dumas, they had no problem accepting his authority
as a fledgling computer guru.<BR>
<BR>
No longer one of the outlaws, Dumas became an official beta tester for the
new Microsoft DOS 6.0 and Windows NT operating systems, specializing in
their security procedures. Following the path of another student who found
the &quot;Issaquah bug&quot; in Microsoft's LAN Manager program, Dumas believes
he found three or four bugs in NT.<BR>
<BR>
Having just finished his sophomore year, Dumas has gone to work this summer
at Microsoft for the company's network development chief, Brian Valentine,
who regards this once brain- dead punk as a valued employee with high promise
for the future. This student who floundered in the usual educational system
flourished when his individual specialization was discovered. The Issaquah
economy released his energies, just as the national economy releases its
own energies through the specialization and division of labor in computer
networks.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are millions of Lee Dumases in the schools of America, many
of them being given up for lost by analysts such as Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, because they are not adept at the usual curriculum for &quot;symbolic
analysts,&quot; Dumas' redemption by technology bears crucial lessons. The
lessons are Bookey's: Students are a resource, not a rabble; specialized
practical experience is more edifying than most textbook learning; networks
are the critical technology both for economic growth and for educational
renewal.<BR>
<BR>
To these insights should be added Lewis Perelman's view, in his book &quot;School's
Out&quot; (1992, Morrow), that teachers should increasingly abandon their
role as a &quot;sage on the stage&quot; in favor of service as a &quot;guide
on the side,&quot; steering their students through a global cornucopia of
educational resources. 
<PRE>


<B>


Education as a Network Driver</B></PRE>
It may seem peculiar that Bookey, a network guru for large corporations
like U.S. West, should focus his attentions on such problems as interconnecting
school children in Issaquah with libraries in Bellevue, parents on Squaw
Mountain, teachers across town and administrators at the Washington State
Information Processing Cooperative. Yet Bookey believes that the educational
application may well drive the creation of a true national infrastructure
of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The networking problems of schools closely resemble the networking problems
of a nation full of diverse systems. To achieve their full promise, school
networks must link computers of many varieties owned by parents, students
and teachers, to administrative servers owned by state and local governments,
to printers, libraries and databases. School networks must connect LANs
to IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture) links, to a variety of telephone
technologies, from T-1 lines of 1.5 megabits per second to T-3 lines at
45 megabits per second and, soon, to ATM switches and other potential gigabit
systems. In all its dimensions, including an acute financial constraint,
this challenge is altogether as difficult as interconnecting supercomputers
over fiber in an NREN.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey relished this challenge at Issaquah. Advocates of NREN might disparage
Issaquah as a relatively low-grade network. After all, it currently has
no fiber outside of the fiber links in the telephone network that it uses.
Without fiber, the network will not be able to accommodate collaborative
learning in multimedia forms across the country. Bookey demurs. Buying a
fiber-optic network before personal computer technology can manage broadband
flows of data is premature. In five years, fiber-optic links will probably
cost about one-fifth of what they cost today. When the network is needed,
Issaquah will be able to purchase it and, more important, also use it. Moreover,
TCI recently offered to install fiber throughout the Issaquah school system
for nothing as part of its general program of fiber to the curb.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that big-band technology will come to Issaquah in due course,
with or without NREN money. Critics, of course, will carp that Issaquah
is a special case &quot;a relatively rich community&quot; that could afford
to levy $2.7 million for technology. Yet the Issaquah example is galvanizing
schools across the state of Washington and even in California and Arkansas,
where Bookey and his colleague Mason Conner have been consulting with education
officials. Emulating Issaquah, other districts in Washington have since
raised some $140 million for network ventures. 
<PRE>


<B>


Glass Ceiling for Networks?</B></PRE>
The lesson of Issaquah is that data highways and superhighways, driven by
the convergence of microcosm and telecosm, are indeed emerging in America,
and at an astonishing pace. They already are revitalizing the economy and
society, and are helping to reform the system of education. The only federal
initiatives that will significantly assist the process are lower taxes,
accommodation of Internet growth and use, and further deregulation of telecommunications.
Communication must begin locally, with access to the community. From these
local roots can emerge the great branching systems that can interconnect
an information economy.<BR>
<BR>
By starting from the top, the government risks paving over the pullulating
fabric of networking enterprise with a glass ceiling of expensive and misplaced
fiber. In 1993 an estimated 37 million personal computers will be sold worldwide.
The same forces that impelled the networks of Issaquah will drive the owners
of these new PCs to interconnect them to other networks and will induce
the owners of the networks to link them together.<BR>
<BR>
As the centrifugal force of the microcosm, multiplying and distributing
intelligence through the world, converges with the integrating power of
the telecosm, the exponential miracles of specialization and growth will
gain new momentum. How far can this spiral reach? Internet will soon approach
some interesting limits. According to International Data Group, the number
of users has risen from 9,800 in 1986, all in the United States, to 4.7
million around the world today.<BR>
<BR>
At this pace, Internet will embrace the entire world population by the year
2001. That's one limit. As the system's trunking backbone rises to 45 megabits
per second on T-3 lines and above, the sky is the limit for the amount of
message traffic. In the first month after the enlargement to T-3 lines in
October 1992, usage rose from 3.5 trillion bytes to 4 trillion bytes. All
these networks are dominated by text and still pictures. But the miracles
of Internet and Issaquah are about to be joined with a new miracle of growth
in digital video connections in the local loop. 
<PRE>


<B>


Bombshell from Time-Warner</B></PRE>
How soon can this happen? Advocates of NREN speak of this technology being
consummated in 2015. But to most politicians and businessmen, a projected
date more than five years ahead is essentially a synonym for never-never
land; a way of saying, &quot;Forget about it. I'll be retired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that a widespread system of two-way broadband networks reaching
most American homes, schools and offices is less than five years away. All
U.S. business planners must come to terms with this transforming reality.
Announcements this spring from leading cable, telephone and computer companies;
from TCI and U.S. West to IBM and Silicon Graphics; bring the shape of this
network into clear focus.<BR>
<BR>
Exemplary among plans announced by a variety of firms is Time-Warner's projected
system in Orlando. As described by Jim Chiddix, the company's college-dropout
technical guru, the Time- Warner showcase venture will be a giant client/server
computer network, suggestive of the arrangements now ubiquitous in corporate
computing. The wires will be a combination of fiber to the curb and coax
to the home. Much of the system's hardware and software will be supplied
by computer companies (allegedly including IBM and Silicon Graphics). The
&quot;client&quot; computers will be digitized TVs or teleputers linked
to powerful database computers that use a parallel-processing architecture
to access hierarchical memory systems, from DRAM caches to optical disk
archives. These memories will contain terabytes (trillions of bytes) of
digital video movies, games, educational software and other programming.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most dramatic breakthrough, though, will come in the switches.
While much of the computer and telephone world continues to dither about
the future of ATM (many consigning it to the pits of 2015), Time-Warner
is committed to installing ATM switches, built by AT&amp;T, beginning next
year in Orlando. The ATM system will allow Time-Warner to offer telephone,
teleputer and multimedia services together, as soon as the regulators allow
it. Chiddix predicts that ATM will soon gravitate to local area networks
and ultimately become ubiquitous.<BR>
<BR>
But the most portentous announcements of all have come from the telephone
companies, who have the most to lose from this cable-oriented network design.
Both U.S. West and Pacific Bell have disclosed that they are adopting a
combination architecture of fiber and coaxial cable closely resembling the
Time-Warner and TCI projects. This unexpected action by two leading Baby
Bells, of turning their backs on their millions of miles of twisted-pair
copper wires shows both the boldness of the new telephone company leadership
and the imperious power of this digital technology.<BR>
<BR>
From all sides the telecommunications and computer industries are converging
on one essential configuration of advanced parallel-processing hardware,
client/server database software and ATM switching. As microcosm and telecosm
converge in the living room, with interactive digital video and supercomputer
image processing, the leading edge of the digital revolution moves from
millions of offices toward billions of homes. Just as Michael Milken, then
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the late William McGowan of MCI in 1983 rescued
long-distance fiber optics from the never-never lands of the year 2015 to
which AT&amp;T had consigned it, John Malone of TCI, Gerald M. Levin of
Time-Warner and Richard D. McCormick of U.S. West in 1993 have burst open
the floodgates for fiber and ATM in the local loop.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the force behind this revolutionary development was fierce business
and technical rivalry in the marketplace. In the real world the ruling principle
of network development is not imposed standardization by government but
spontaneous order. It springs from the interplay of human creativity and
entrepreneurship with the inexorable laws of physics and technology.<BR>
<BR>
These dynamics of interconnection in the Information Age will continue well
into the next century. The microcosm will yield chips containing billions
of transistors, equivalent to scores of supercomputers on single slivers
of silicon. The telecosm will yield bandwidth exploding into the terahertz
of all- optical networks and the gigahertz of millimeter waves in the air.<BR>
<BR>
Provided that rulers and regulators do not stifle this spiral of opportunity,
the human spirit &quot;emancipated and thus allowed to reach its rarest
talents and aspirations&quot; will continue to amaze the world with heroic
surprises. The Issaquah miracle of Mike Bookey and Lee Dumas and all the
others, and the continuing miracle of American networks, which was entirely
unexpected by the world, will repeat themselves again and again in new forms
of entrepreneurship and technology.

<HR>At first glance, Vahak Hovnanian, a homebuilding tycoon in New Jersey,
would<B> </B>seem an unlikely sort to be chasing rainbows. Yet in the converging
realms of computers and communications that we call the telecosm, rainbows
are less a matter of hue and weather than they are a metaphor for electromagnetism:
the spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies used to build businesses in
the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
An Armenian Christian from Iraq, Hovnanian ran a business building high-quality
&quot;affordable&quot; housing. His first coup came on Labor Day in 1958
when, together with his three older brothers, he bought an apparently undesirable
property near the waterfront in Tom's River for $20,000. From this modest
beginning has arisen not only one of the nation's largest homebuilding enterprises
(divided among the four immigrant brothers), but also a shattering breakthrough
on some seemingly bleak frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum. Together
with maverick inventor Bernard Bossard, Hovnanian has launched a wireless
cellular TV business in frequencies once thought usable only in outer space.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the reason Hovnanian feels comfortable today pioneering on the shores
of the telecosm is that some 35 years ago he was an engineer at Philco Semiconductor
following in the theoretical steps of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories titan William
Shockley. Shockley led the team that plunged into the microcosm of solid-state
physics and invented the transistor. At the heart of all-digital electronics,
this invention still reverberates through the world economy and imposes
its centrifugal rules of enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
This law of the microcosm dictates exponential rises in computer efficiency
as transistors become smaller. It is this law that drives the bulk of the
world's computations to ever- cheaper machines and pushes intelligence from
the center to the fringes of all networks. Today the microcosm is converging
with the telecosm and igniting a new series of industrial shocks and surprises.<BR>
<BR>
The convergence of microcosm and telecosm in an array of multimedia industries
- from personal intelligent communicators to video teleputers to digital
films and publishing - is now the driving force of world economic growth.
John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple Computer, has projected that by
2002 there will be a global business in multimedia totaling some $3.5 trillion
- close to the size of the entire U.S. economy in the early 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
This new world of computer communications will break down into two domains
- the fibersphere and the atmosphere. The fibersphere is the domain of all-optical
networks, with both communications power - bandwidth - and error rate improving
by factors in the millions. In &quot;Into the Fibersphere&quot; (Forbes
ASAP, December 7, 1992), we saw that the potential capacity for communications
in the fibersphere is 1,000 times greater than all the currently used frequencies
in the air - and so radically error-free that it mandates an entirely new
model of wired telecommunications. Now we will discover that the atmosphere
will offer links as mobile and ubiquitous as human beings are. It thus will
force the creation of an entirely new model of wireless networks.<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Sculley's $3 5 trillion dream can be seen as the pot of gold
at the end of Maxwell's rainbow. In 1865, in a visionary coup that the late
Richard Feynman said would leave the American Civil War of the same decade
as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by comparison, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. Encompassing
nearly all the technologies imagined by Sculley, Maxwell's rainbow reaches
from the extremely low frequencies (and gigantic wavelengths) used to communicate
with submarines all the way through the frequencies used in radio, television
and cellular phones, on up to the frequencies of infrared used in TV remotes
and fiber optics, and beyond that to visible and ultraviolet light and X-
rays. In a fabulous feat of unification, Maxwell reduced the entire spectrum
to just four equations in vector calculus. He showed that all such radiations
move at the speed of light - in other words, the wavelength times the frequency
equals the speed of light. These equations pulse at the heart of the information
economy today.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all electromagnetic radiation can bear information, and the higher
the frequencies, the more room they provide for bearing information. As
a practical matter, however, communications engineers have aimed low, thronging
the frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum, comprising far less than
one percent of the total span.<BR>
<BR>
The vast expansion of wireless communications forecast by Sculley, however,
will require the use of higher frequencies far up Maxwell's rainbow. This
means a return to the insights of another great man who walked the halls
of Bell Labs in the late 1940s at the same time as future Nobel laureate
William Shockley, and who left the world transformed in his wake.<BR>
<BR>
In 1948, the same year that Shockley invented the transistor, Claude Shannon
invented the information theory that underlies all modern communications.
At first encounter, information theory is difficult for nonmathematicians,
but computer and telecom executives need focus on only a few key themes.
In defining how much information can be sent down a noisy channel, Shannon
showed that engineers can choose between narrowband high-powered solutions
and broadband low-powered solutions. 
<PRE>


<B>


From Long & Strong to Wide & Weak
</B></PRE>
Assuming that usable bandwidth is scarce and expensive, most wireless engineers
have strived to economize on it. Just as you can get your message through
in a crowded room by talking louder, you can overcome a noisy channel with
more powerful signals. Engineers therefore have pursued a strategy of long
and strong: long wavelengths and powerful transmissions with the scarce
radio frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
Economizing on spectrum, scientists created mostly analog systems such as
AM radios and televisions. Using every point on the wave to convey information
and using high power to overcome noise and extend the range of signals,
the long and strong approach seemed hugely more efficient than digital systems
requiring complex manipulation of long strings of on-off bits.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, however, the long and strong policy of economizing on spectrum
led to using it all up. When everyone talks louder, no one can hear very
well. Today, the favored regions at the bottom of the spectrum are so full
of spectrum- hogging radios, pagers, phones, television, long-distance,
point- to-point, aerospace and other uses that heavy-breathing experts speak
of running out of &quot;air.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's theories reveal the way out of this problem. In a counterintuitive
and initially baffling redefinition of the nature of noise in a communications
channel, Shannon showed that a flow of signals conveys information only
to the extent that it provides unexpected data - only to the extent that
it adds to what you already know. Another name for a stream of unexpected
bits is noise. Termed Gaussian, or white, noise, such a transmission resembles
random &quot;white&quot; light, which cloaks the entire rainbow of colors
in a bright blur. Shannon showed that the more a transmission resembles
this form of noise, the more information it can hold.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's alternative to long and strong is wide and weak: not fighting
noise with electrical power but joining it with noiselike information, not
talking louder but talking softer in more elaborate codes using more bandwidth.
For example, in transmitting 40 megabits per second - the requirement for
truly high-resolution images and sounds - Shannon showed some 45 years ago
that using more bandwidth can lower the needed signal-to- noise ratio from
a level of one million to one to a ratio of 30.6 to one. This huge gain
comes merely from increasing the bandwidth of the signal from two megahertz
(millions of cycles per second) to eight megahertz. That means a 33,000-fold
increase in communications efficiency in exchange for just a fourfold increase
in bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Such an explosion of efficiency radically limits the need to waste watts
in order to overcome noise. More communications power comes from less electrical
power. Thus, Shannon shows the way to fulfill Sculley's vision of universal
low-powered wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
This vision of wide and weak is at the heart of the most promising technologies
of today, from the advanced digital teleputer sets of American HDTV to ubiquitous
mobile phones and computers in so-called personal communications networks
(PCNs). Shannon's theories of the telecosm provide the basic science behind
both Sculley's dream and Hovnanian's video spectrum breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's world, however, is not nirvana, and there is no free lunch. Compensating
for the exponential rise in communications power is an exponential rise
in complexity. Larger bandwidths mean larger, more complex codes and exponentially
rising burdens of computation for the decoding and error-correcting of messages.
In previous decades, handling 40 megabits per second was simply out of the
question with existing computer technology. For the last 30 years, this
electronic bottleneck has blocked the vistas of efficient communication
opened by Shannon's research.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1990s, however, the problem of soaring complexity has met its match
- and then some - in exponential gains of computer efficiency. Not only
has the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology been doubling every 18
months but the pace of advance has been accelerating into the 1990s. Moreover,
the chips central to digital communications - error correction, compression,
coding and decoding - are digital signal processors. As we have seen, the
cost-effectiveness of DSPs has been increasing - in millions of computer
instructions per second (MIPS) per dollar - some tenfold every two years.<BR>
<BR>
This wild rush in DSPs will eventually converge with the precipitous plunge
in price-performance ratios of general-purpose microprocessors. Led by Silicon
Graphics' impending new TFP Cray supercomputer on a chip, Digital Equipment's
Alpha AXP device and Hewlett Packard's Precision Architecture 7100, micros
are moving beyond 100-megahertz clock rates. They are shifting from a regime
of processing 32-bit words at a time to a regime of processing 64-bit words.
This expands the total addressable memory by a factor of four billion. Together
with increasing use of massively parallel DSP architectures, these gains
will keep computers well ahead of the complexity problem in broadband communications.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that while complexity rises exponentially with bandwidth,
computer efficiencies are rising even faster. The result is to open new
vistas of spectrum in the atmosphere as dramatic as the gains of spectrum
so far achieved in the fibersphere. 
<PRE>


<B>


Attacking Through the Air
</B></PRE>
Hovnanian's campaign into the spectrum began when a cable company announced
one day in 1985 that under the Cable Act of 1984 and franchise rights granted
by local governments, it had the right to wire one of his housing developments
then under construction. Until that day, Hovnanian's own company could package
cable with his homes through what are called satellite master antenna TV
systems. In essence, each Hovnanian development had its own cable head end
where programs are collected and sent out to subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
When the cable company, now Monmouth Cable Vision, went to court and its
claim was upheld by a judge, Hovnanian sought alternatives. First he flirted
with the idea of having the phone company deliver compressed video to his
homes. In 1986, in the era before FCC Commissioner Alfred Sikes, that was
both illegal and impractical. Then he met Bernard Bossard and decided to
attack through the air. An early pioneer in microchips who had launched
a semiconductor firm and eventually sold it to M/A COM, Bossard was familiar
with both the soaring power of computers and the murky problems of broadband
noise that have long restricted the air to a small number of broadcast AM
TV stations.<BR>
<BR>
Air delivery of cable television programming had long seemed unpromising.
Not only was there too little spectrum available to compete with cable,
but what spectrum there was, was guarded by the FCC and state public utilities
commissions. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s &quot;wireless cable&quot;
did become a niche market, led by Microband Wireless Cable and rivals and
imitators across the land. Using fragments of a frequency band between 2.5
and 2.7 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), Microband, after some
financial turmoil, now profitably broadcasts some 16 channels to 35,000
New York City homes in line of sight from the top of the Empire State Building.
As long as they are restricted to a possible maximum of 200 megahertz and
use AM, however, wireless firms will not long be able to compete with the
cable industry. Cable companies offer an installed base of potential gigahertz
connections and near universal coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Having spent much of his life working with microwaves for satellites and
the military, Bossard had a better idea. He claimed he could move up the
spectrum and pioneer on frontiers of frequency between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz,
previously used chiefly in outer space. That would mean he could command
in the air some half a million times the communications power, or bandwidth,
of typical copper telephone links, some ten times the bandwidth of existing
wireless cable, some four times the bandwidth of the average cable industry
coaxial connection, and twice the bandwidth of the most advanced cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional wisdom was that these microwaves (above about 12 gigahertz)
are useless for anything but point-to-point transmissions and are doubtful
even for these. For radio communication, the prevailing folklore preferred
frequencies that are cheap to transmit long distances and that can penetrate
buildings and tunnels, bounce off the ionosphere or scuttle across continents
along the surface of the earth. The higher the frequency, the less it can
perform these feats essential to all broadcasting - and the less it can
be sent long distances at all.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it was believed, these millimeter-sized microwaves not only would
fail to penetrate structures and other obstacles but would reflect off them
and off particles in the air in a way that would cause hopeless mazes of
multipath. Multipath would be translated into several images, i.e., ghosts,
on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there was the real show-stopper. Everyone knew that these frequencies
are microwaves. The key property of microwaves, as demonstrated in the now
ubiquitous ovens, is absorption by water. Microwaves cook by exciting water
molecules to a boil. Microwave towers are said to kill birds by irradiating
their fluids. Microwave radar systems won't work in the rain. Mention microwaves
as a possible solution to the spectrum shortage, and everyone - from editors
at Forbes to gurus at Microsoft, from cable executives to Bell Labs researchers
- laughs and tells you about the moisture problem.<BR>
<BR>
So it was no surprise that when in 1986 Bossard went to M/A COM and other
companies and financiers with his idea of TV broadcasting at 28 gigahertz,
he was turned down flat. Amid much talk of potential &quot;violations of
the laws of physics,&quot; jokes about broiling pigeons and warnings of
likely resistance from the FCC, he was spurned by all. In fairness to his
detractors, Bossard had no license, patent or prototype at the time. But
these holes in his plan did not deter Vahak Hovnanian and his son Shant
from investing many millions of dollars in the project. It could be the
best investment the Hovnanian tycoons ever made.

New Rule of Radio
</B></PRE>
For 35 years, the wireless communications industry has been inching up the
spectrum, shifting slowly from long and strong wavelengths toward wide and
weak bands of shorter wavelengths. Mobile phone services have moved from
the 1950s radio systems using low FM frequencies near 100 megahertz, to
the 1960s spectrum band of 450 megahertz, to the current cellular band of
900 megahertz accommodating more than 10 million cellular subscribers in
the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1990s, this trend will accelerate sharply. Accommodating hundreds
of millions of users around the world, cellular communications will turn
digital, leap up the spectrum and even move into video. Shannon's laws show
that this will impel vast increases in the cost-effectiveness of communications.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the new rule of radio is the shorter the transmission path,
the better the system. Like transistors on semiconductor chips, transmitters
are more efficient the more closely they are packed together. As Peter Huber
writes in his masterly new book, The Geodesic Network 2, the new regime
favors &quot;geodesic networks,&quot; with radios intimately linked in tiny
microcells. As in the law of the microcosm, the less the space, the more
the room.<BR>
<BR>
This rule turns the conventional wisdom of microwaves upside down. For example,
it is true that microwaves don't travel far in the atmosphere. You don't
want to use them to transmit 50,000 watts of Rush Limbaugh over 10 midwestern
states, but to accommodate 200 million two-way communicators will require
small cells; you don't want the waves to travel far. It is true that microwaves
will not penetrate most buildings and other obstacles, but with lots of
small cells, you don't want the waves to penetrate walls to adjacent offices.<BR>
<BR>
Microwaves require high-power systems to transmit, but only if you want
to send them long distances. Wattage at the receiver drops off in proportion
to the fourth power of the distance from the transmitter. Reducing cell
sizes as you move up the spectrum lowers power needs far more than higher
frequencies increase them. Just as important, mobile systems must be small
and light. The higher the frequency, the smaller the antenna and the lighter
the system can be.<BR>
<BR>
All this high-frequency gear once was prohibitively expensive. Any functions
over two gigahertz require gallium arsenide chips, which are complex and
costly. Yet the cost of gallium arsenide devices is dropping every day as
their market expands. Meanwhile, laboratory teams are now tweaking microwaves
out of silicon. In the world of electronics - where prices drop by a third
with every doubling of accumulated sales - any ubiquitous product will soon
be cheap.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm dictates that the higher the frequency, the shorter
the wavelength, the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the antenna, the slimmer
the cell and ultimately, the cheaper and better the communication. The working
of this law will render obsolete the entire idea of scarce spectrum and
launch an era of advances in telecommunications comparable to the recent
gains in computing. Transforming the computer and phone industries, the
converging spirits of Maxwell, Shannon and Shockley even pose a serious
challenge to the current revolutionaries in cellular telephony.

The New PC Revolution: PCN
</B></PRE>
Many observers herald the huge coming impact of wireless on the computer
industry, and they are right. But this impact will be dwarfed by the impact
of computers on wireless.<BR>
<BR>
In personal communications networks (PCN), the cellular industry today is
about to experience its own personal computer revolution. Just as the personal
computer led to systems thousands of times more efficient in MIPS per dollar
than the mainframes and minicomputers that preceded it, PCNs will bring
an exponential plunge of costs. These networks will be based on microcells
often measured in hundreds of meters rather than in tens of miles and will
interlink smart digital appliances, draining power in milliwatts rather
than dumb phones using watts. When the convulsion ends later this decade,
this new digital cellular phone will stand as the world's most pervasive
PC. As mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet, these PICOs will recognize
speech, navigate streets, take notes, keep schedules, collect mail, manage
money, open the door and start the car, among other computer functions we
cannot imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
Like the computer establishment before it, current cellular providers often
seem unprepared for this next computer revolution. They still live in a
world of long and strong - high- powered systems at relatively low frequencies
and with short- lived batteries - rather than in a PCN world of low-power
systems at microwave frequencies and with batteries that last for days.<BR>
<BR>
Ready or not, though, the revolution will happen anyway, and it will transform
the landscape over the next five years. We can guess the pattern by considering
the precedents. In computers, the revolution took 10 years. It began in
1977 when large centralized systems with attached dumb terminals commanded
nearly 100 percent of the world's computer power and ended in 1987 with
such large systems commanding less than one percent of the world's computer
power. The pace of progress in digital electronics has accelerated sharply
since the early 1980s. Remember yesterday, when digital signal processing
(DSP) - the use of specialized computers to convert, compress, shape and
shuffle digital signals in real time - constituted an exorbitant million-dollar
obstacle to all-digital communications? Many current attitudes toward wireless
stem from that time, which was some five years ago. Today, digital signal
processors are the fastest-moving technology in all computing. Made on single
chips or multichip modules, DSPs are increasing their cost- effectiveness
tenfold every two years. As radio pioneer Donald Steinbrecher says, &quot;That
changes wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thus, we can expect the cellular telephone establishment to reach a crisis
more quickly than the mainframe establishment did. The existing cellular
infrastructure will persist for vehicular use.<BR>
<BR>
As the intelligence in networks migrates to microcells, the networks themselves
must become dumb. A complex network, loaded up with millions of lines of
software code, cannot keep up with the efflorescent diversity and creativity
among ever more intelligent digital devices on its periphery. This rule
is true for the broadband wire links of fiber optics, as intelligent switching
systems give way to passive all-optical networks. It is also true of cellular
systems.<BR>
<BR>
Nick Kauser, McCaw Cellular Communications' executive vice- president and
chief of technology, faced this problem early in 1991 when the company decided
to create a North American Cellular Network for transparent roaming throughout
the regions of Cellular One. &quot;The manufacturers always want to sell
switches that do more and more. But complex switches take so long to program
that you end up doing less and less,&quot; says Wayne Perry, McCaw vice-chairman.
Each time Kauser tried to change software code in one of McCaw's Ericsson
switches, it might have taken six months. Each time he wanted to add customer
names above a 64,000 limit, Ericsson tried to persuade him to buy a new
switch. The Ericsson switches, commented one McCaw engineer, offer a huge
engine but a tiny gas tank. The problem is not peculiar to Ericsson, however;
it is basic to the very idea of complex switch- based services on any supplier's
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
When McCaw voiced frustration, one of the regional Bell operating companies
offered to take over the entire problem at a cost of some $200 million.
Instead, Kauser created a Signaling System 7 (SS-7) network plus an intelligent
database on four Tandem fault-tolerant computers, for some $15 million.
Kauser maintains that the current services offered by North American Cellular
could not be duplicated for 10 times that amount, if at all, in a switch-based
system. Creating a dumb network and off- loading the intelligence on computer
servers saved McCaw hundreds of millions of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm is a centrifuge, inexorably pushing intelligence
to the edges of networks. Telecom equipment suppliers can no more trap it
in the central switch than IBM could monopolize it in mainframes.<BR>
<BR>
Kauser should recognize that this rule applies to McCaw no less than to
Ericsson. His large standardized systems with 30- mile cells and relatively
dumb, high-powered phones resemble big proprietary mainframe networks. In
the computer industry, these standardized architectures gave way to a mad
proliferation of diverse personal computer nets restricted to small areas
and interlinked by hubs and routers. The same pattern will develop in cellular.
<PRE>


<B>


Could &quot;Charles&quot; Upend McCaw?
</B></PRE>
Together with GTE and the regional Bell operating company cellular divisions,
McCaw is now in the position of DEC in 1977. With its new ally, AT&amp;T,
McCaw is brilliantly attacking the mainframe establishment of the wire-line
phone companies. But the mainframe establishment of wires is not McCaw's
real competition. Not stopping at central switches, the law of the microcosm
is about to subvert the foundations of conventional cellular technology
as well. Unless McCaw and the other cellular providers come to terms with
the new PC networks that go by the name of PCNs, they will soon suffer the
fate of the minicomputer firms of the last decade. McCaw could well be upended
by its founder's original vision of his company - a PICO he called &quot;Charles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just as in the computer industry in the late 1970s, the fight for the future
is already under way. Complicating the conflict is the influence of European
and Japanese forces protecting the past in the name of progress. Under pressure
from EEC industrial politicians working with the guidance of engineers from
Ericsson, the Europeans have adopted a new digital cellular system called
Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) after the commission that conceived it.<BR>
<BR>
GSM is a very conservative digital system that multiplies the number of
users in each cellular channel by a factor of three. GSM uses an access
method called time-division multiple access (TDMA). Suggestive of the time-sharing
methods used by minicomputers and mainframes to accommodate large numbers
of users on centralized computers, TDMA stems from the time-division multiplexing
employed by phone companies around the world to put more than one phone
call on each digital line. Thus, both the telephone and the computer establishments
are comfortable with time division.<BR>
<BR>
Under pressure from European firms eager to sell equipment in America, the
U.S. Telephone Industry Association two years ago adopted a TDMA standard
similar to the European GSM. Rather than creating a wholly new system exploiting
the distributed powers of the computer revolution, the TIA favored a TDMA
overlay on the existing analog infrastructure. Under the influence of Ericsson,
McCaw and some of the RBOCs took the TDMA bait.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it was in the name of competitiveness and technological progress,
and of keeping up with the Europeans and Japanese, that the U.S. moved to
embrace an obsolescent cellular system. It made no difference that the Europeans
and Japanese were technologically well in our wake. Just as in the earlier
case of analog HDTV, however, the entrepreneurial creativity of the U.S.
digital electronics industry is launching an array of compelling alternatives
just in time.<BR>
<BR>
Infusing cellular telephony with the full powers of wide and weak - combining
Shannon's vision with computer advances - are two groups of engineers from
MIT who spun out to launch new companies. Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, is
led by former professor Irwin Jacobs and telecom pioneer Andrew Viterbi.
A Shannon disciple whose eponymous algorithm is widely used in digital wire-line
telephony, Viterbi now is leading an effort to transform digital wireless
telephony. The other firm, Steinbrecher Corp. of Woburn, Mass., is led by
an inventor from the MIT Radio Astronomy Lab named Donald Steinbrecher.<BR>
<BR>
Like Bernie Bossard and Vahak Hovnanian, the leaders of Qualcomm and Steinbrecher
received the ultimate accolade for an innovator: They were all told their
breakthroughs were impossible. Indeed, the leaders at Qualcomm were still
contending that Steinbrecher's system would not work just weeks ago when
PacTel pushed the two firms together. Now they provide the foundations for
a radical new regime in distributed wireless computer telephony. 
<PRE>


<B>


Signals in Pseudonoise
</B></PRE>
Ten years ago at Linkabit, the current leaders of Qualcomm conceived and
patented the TDMA technology adopted as the U.S. standard by the Telephone
Industry Association. Like analog HDTV, it was a powerful advance for its
time. But even then, Viterbi and Jacobs were experimenting with a Shannonesque
technology.<BR>
<BR>
A classic example of the efficacy of wide and weak, CDMA exploits the resemblance
between noise and information. The system began in the military as an effort
to avoid jamming or air- tapping of combat messages. Qualcomm brings CDMA
to the challenge of communications on the battlefronts of big-city cellular.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than compressing each call into between three and 10 tiny TDMA time
slots in a 30-kilohertz cellular channel, Qualcomm's CDMA spreads a signal
across a comparatively huge 1. 25-megahertz swath of the cellular spectrum.
This allows many users to share the same spectrum space at one time. Each
phone is programmed with a specific pseudonoise code, which is used to stretch
a low-powered signal over a wide frequency band. The base station uses the
same code in inverted form to &quot;despread&quot; and reconstitute the
original signal. All other codes remain spread out, indistinguishable from
background noise.<BR>
<BR>
Jacobs compares TDMA and CDMA to different strategies of communication at
a cocktail party. In the TDMA analogy, each person would restrict his or
her talk to a specific time slot while everyone else remains silent. This
system would work well as long as the party was managed by a dictator who
controlled all conversations by complex rules and a rigid clock. In CDMA,
on the other hand, everyone can talk at once but in different languages.
Each person listens for messages in his or her own language or code and
ignores all other sounds as background noise. Although this system allows
each person to speak freely, it requires constant control of the volume
of the speakers. A speaker who begins yelling can drown out surrounding
messages and drastically reduce the total number of conversations that can
be sustained.<BR>
<BR>
For years, this problem of the stentorian guest crippled CDMA as a method
of increasing the capacity of cellular systems. Spread spectrum had many
military uses because its unlocalized signal and cryptic codes made it very
difficult to jam or overhear. In a cellular environment, however, where
cars continually move in and out from behind trucks, buildings and other
obstacles, causing huge variations in power, CDMA systems would be regularly
swamped by stentorian guests. Similarly, nearby cars would tend to dominate
faraway vehicles. This was termed the near-far problem. When you compound
this challenge with a static of multipath signals causing hundreds of 10,000-to-
1 gyrations in power for every foot traveled by the mobile unit - so-called
Rayleigh interference pits and spikes - you can comprehend the general incredulity
toward CDMA among cellular cognoscenti. Indeed, as recently as 1991, leading
experts at Bell Labs, Stanford University and Bellcore confidently told
me the problem was a show-stopper; it could not be overcome.<BR>
<BR>
Radio experts, however, underestimate the power of the microcosm. Using
digital signal processing, error correction and other microcosmic tools,
wattage spikes and pits 100 times a second can be regulated by electronic
circuitry that adjusts the power at a rate of more than 800 times a second.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this result, Qualcomm uses two layers of controls. First is a
relatively crude top layer that employs the automatic gain control device
on handsets to constantly adjust the power sent by the handset to the level
of power received by it from the base station. This rough adjustment does
not come near to solving the problem, but it brings a solution into reach
by using more complex and refined techniques.<BR>
<BR>
In the second power-control step, the base station measures the handset's
signal-to-noise and bit-error ratios once every 1.25 milliseconds (800 times
a second). Depending on whether these ratios are above or below a constantly
recomputed threshold, the base station sends a positive or negative pulse,
either raising or lowering the power some 25 percent. 
<PRE>


<B>


Dynamic Cells
</B></PRE>
Passing elaborate field tests with flying colors, this power- control mechanism
has the further effect of dynamically changing the size of cells. In a congested
cell, the power of all phones rises to overcome mutual interference. On
the margin, these high- powered transmissions overflow into neighboring
cells where they may be picked up by adjacent base station equipment. In
a quiet cell, power is so low that the cell effectively shrinks, transmitting
no interference at all to neighboring cells and improving their performance.
This kind of dynamic adjustment of cell sizes is impossible in a TDMA system,
where adjacent cells use completely different frequencies and fringe handsets
may begin to chirp like Elmer Fudd.<BR>
<BR>
Once the stentorian voice could be instantly abated, power control changed
from a crippling weakness of CDMA into a commanding asset. Power usage is
a major obstacle to the PCN future. All market tests show that either heavy
or short-lived batteries greatly reduce the attractiveness of the system.
Because the Qualcomm feedback system keeps power always at the lowest feasible
level, batteries in CDMA phones actually are lasting far longer than in
TDMA phones. CDMA phones transmit at an average of two milliwatts, compared
with 600 milliwatts and higher for most other cellular systems.<BR>
<BR>
A further advantage of wide and weak comes in handling multipath signals,
which bounce off obstacles and arrive at different times at the receiver.
Multipath just adds to the accuracy of CDMA. The Qualcomm system combines
the three strongest signals into one. Called a rake receiver and co- invented
by Paul Green, currently at IBM and author of Fiber Optic Networks (Prentice
Hall, 1992), this combining function works even on signals from different
cells and thus facilitates hand-offs. In TDMA, signals arriving at the wrong
time are pure interference in someone else's time slot; in CDMA, they strengthen
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, CDMA allows simple and soft hand-offs. Because all the phones are
using the same spectrum space, moving from one cell to another is easy.
CDMA avoids all the frequency juggling of TDMA systems as they shuffle calls
among cells and time slots. As the era of PCN microcells approaches, this
advantage will become increasingly crucial. Cellular systems that spurn
Qualcomm today may find themselves in a quagmire of TDMA microcells tomorrow.
Together, all the gains from CDMA bring about a tenfold increase over current
analog capacity. In wireless telephony above all, wide and weak will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Like any obsolescent scheme challenged by a real innovation - and like minicomputers
and mainframes challenged by the PC - TDMA is being sharply improved by
its proponents. The inheritors of the Linkabit TDMA patents at Hughes and
International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMMC) have introduced extended TDMA,
claiming a 19-fold advance over current analog capacity. Showing a conventional
cellular outlook, however, E-TDMA fatally adopts the idea of increasing
capacity by lowering speech quality. This moves in exactly the wrong direction.
PCN will not triumph through compromises based on a scarce-spectrum mentality.
PCN will multiply bandwidth to make the acoustics of digital cellular even
better than the acoustics of wire-line phones, just as the acoustics of
digital CDs far excel the acoustics of analog records.<BR>
<BR>
Riding the microcosmic gains of digital signal processing, CDMA inherently
offers greater room for improvement than TDMA does. Bringing the computer
revolution to cellular telephony, CDMA at its essence replaces frequency
shuffling with digital intelligence. Supplanting the multiple radios of
TDMA - each with a fixed frequency - are digital-signal-processing chips
that find a particular message across a wide spectrum swath captured by
one broadband radio.<BR>
<BR>
With the advance in digital electronics, the advantage of CDMA continually
increases. As the most compute-intensive system, CDMA gains most from the
onrushing increases in the cost- effectiveness of semiconductor electronics.
Qualcomm recently announced that it has reduced all the digital signal processing
for CDMA into one application-specific chip.<BR>
<BR>
For all the indispensable advances of CDMA, however, Qualcomm cannot prevail
alone. It brilliantly executes the move to digital codes, but proprietary
mainframe computer networks are digital, too. As presently conceived, CDMA
still aspires to be a cellular standard using the same mainframe architecture
of mobile telephone switching offices that now serve the analog cellular
system. In itself the Qualcomm solution does little to move cellular toward
the ever cheaper, smaller and more open architectures that now dominate
network computing and will shape PCN.

Hearing Feathers Crash Amid Heavy Metal
</B></PRE>
Consummating the PCN revolution - with its millions of microcells around
the globe and its myriad digital devices and frequencies - will require
a fundamental breakthrough in cellular radio technology. In the new Steinbrecher
minicell introduced early this month at the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association show, that breakthrough is at hand. The first true PC server
for PCN, this small box ultimately costing a few thousand dollars will both
replace and far outperform a 1,000-square-foot base station costing more
than a million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, in an entrepreneurial economy, crucial innovations come as an
utter surprise to all the experts in the field. Donald Steinbrecher began
in the Radio Astronomy Lab at MIT in the 1960s and early 1970s, creating
receivers that could resolve a random cosmic ray among a mass of electromagnetic
noise. This required radios with huge dynamic range - radios that could
hear a feather drop at a heavy metal rock concert. He and his students solved
this intractable problem by creating unique high-performance receivers and
frequency &quot;Mixers.&quot; These could process huge spans of spectrum
with immense variations of power and translate them without loss into intermediate
frequencies. Then, computer systems convert the signals from analog to digital
and analyze them with digital signal processors.<BR>
<BR>
Moving out to begin his own company in 1973, Steinbrecher and his colleagues
made several inventions in the fields of radar and digital signal analysis.
At first, most of their customers were national security contractors in
the intelligence field. For example, Steinbrecher supplied the radios for
the ROTHR (remote over the horizon radar) systems that became famous for
their role in the war against airborne drug traffic. Then in 1986, the company
was asked if its equipment could work in the cellular band.<BR>
<BR>
After cosmic rays and battlefield radar, the cellular band was easy. When
he saw that the digital signal processors at the heart of his systems were
dropping in price tenfold every two years, Steinbrecher knew that his esoteric
radios could become a consumer product.<BR>
<BR>
Translated to cellular, this technology opens entire new frontiers for wireless
telephony. Rather than tuning into one fixed frequency as current cellular
radios do, Steinbrecher's cells can use a high-dynamic-range digital radio
to down-convert and digitize the entire cellular band. TDMA, CDMA, near
or far, analog cellular, video, voice or data, in any combination, it makes
no difference to the Steinbrecher system. His minicell converts them all
at once to a digital bit stream. The DSPs take over from there, sorting
out the TDMA and CDMA signals from the analog signals and reducing each
to digital voice. To the extent the Steinbrecher system prevails, it would
end the need for hybrid phones and make possible a phased shift to PCN or
a variety of other digital services.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping to use Qualcomm chipsets and other technology, Steinbrecher could
facilitate the acceptance of CDMA. For CDMA, the minicell provides a new,
far cheaper radio front end that offers further relief to the near-far problem
and is open to the diverse codes and fast-moving technologies of PCN. For
the current cellular architecture, however, Steinbrecher offers only creative
destruction, doing for large base stations what the integrated circuit did
for racks of vacuum tubes in old telephone switches.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the new minicell replaces a rigid structure of giant analog
mainframes with a system of wireless local area networks. Reconciling a
variety of codes and technologies, the Steinbrecher devices resemble the
smart hubs and routers from SynOptics Communications and Cisco Systems that
are transforming the world of wired computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Best of all, at a time when the computer industry is preparing a massive
invasion of the air, these wide and weak radios can handle voice, data and
even video at the same time. Further, by cheaply accommodating a move from
scores of large base stations to scores of thousands of minicells per city
- on poles, down alleys or in elevator shafts - the system fulfills the
promise of the computer revolution as a spectrum multiplier. Since each
new minicell can use all the frequencies currently used by a large cell
site, the multiplication of cells achieves a similar multiplication of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Steinbrecher receivers can accommodate the coming move into
higher frequencies. Banishing once and for all the concept of spectrum scarcity,
these high-dynamic-range receivers can already handle frequencies up to
the &quot;W band&quot; of 90 gigahertz and more. 
<PRE>


<B>


Boundless Bandwidth
</B></PRE>
The future of wireless communications is boundless bandwidth, accomplished
through the Shannon strategy of wide and weak signals, moving to ever smaller
cells with lower power at higher frequencies. The PCN systems made possible
by Qualcomm and Steinbrecher apply this approach chiefly to voice and data.
Recent announcements by Bossard and Hovnanian extend the concept to television
video as well. Last December, they disclosed that their company, Cellular
Vision, was already wirelessly delivering 49 cable television channels to
350 homes near Brighton Beach, Long Island, in the 28-gigahertz band. They
declared a plan to soon sign up some 5,000 new customers a month all over
New York.<BR>
<BR>
Among engineers in cellular and cable firms, Cellular Vision evokes the
same responses of incredulity and denial familiar at Qualcomm and Steinbrecher.
Like them, Bossard is resolutely on the right side of the Shannon and Shockley
divide. In answer to the multitude of qualms and objections and demurrals,
all three companies cite the huge benefits of more bandwidth. Qualcomm can
assign some 416 times as much bandwidth to each call as a current cellular
or TDMA system. Steinbrecher's minicell receivers can process 4,160 times
as much bandwidth as an analog cell site or TDMA radio.<BR>
<BR>
Hovnanian achieves some 300 times the bandwidth of a broadcast TV station
and some three times the bandwidth of even a typical cable head end. For
Hovnanian's so-called multipoint local distribution system, the FCC has
allocated a total of two gigahertz between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz - one
gigahertz for TV and one gigahertz for experimental data and phone service.
This large swath of spectrum allows Cellular Vision to substitute bandwidth
for power. Using FM rather than the AM system of cable, Cellular Vision
gains the same kind of increased fidelity familiar in FM radio. Assigning
20 megahertz to each channel - three times the six megahertz of an analog
system - Cellular Vision proves the potency of wide and weak by getting
20 decibels - some 10 times - more signal quality. These extra decibels
come in handy in the rain.<BR>
<BR>
With a radius of three miles, Cellular Vision cells are about 100 times
smaller than telephone cells. Transmitting only 10 milliwatts per channel
over a three-mile radius, the system gets far better signal-to-noise ratios
than the three-watt radios of cellular phones or the multikilowatt systems
of AM radio or television broadcasts. The millimeter wavelengths at 28 gigahertz
allow narrowband high-gain antennas that lock onto the right signal and
isolate it from neighboring cells. At 28 gigahertz, small antennas command
the performance of much larger ones (for example, a six-inch antenna at
28 gigahertz is equivalent to a three-foot antenna at 4 gigahertz or a 300-foot
antenna at broadcast television frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
In Brighton Beach the receiving antennas, using a fixed- phased-array technology,
are just four inches square, and the transmitting antennas deliver 49 channels
from a one-inch omnidirectional device on a box the size of a suitcase.
Between cells, these transmitters can send programming and other information
through a conventional point-to-point microwave link. 
<PRE>


<B>


Singing in the Rain
</B></PRE>
So what happens in the rain? Well, it seems that Cellular Vision does better
than conventional cable. When you have small cells in geodesic low-power
wireless networks using the full computational resources of modern microchips,
you have plenty of extra decibels in your signal-to-noise budget to endure
the most violent storms. Indeed, the 350 Brighton Beach customers of Cellular
Vision received continuous service during the November 1992 near hurricane
in New York, which brought floods that interrupted many cable networks for
hours. One competitive advantage of Cellular Vision over cable seems to
be less vulnerability to water.<BR>
<BR>
Moving television radically toward the regime of wide and weak, Bossard
and the Hovnanians have changed the dimensions of the air. However, they
cannot escape the usual burdens of the innovator. Any drastic innovation
must be some 10 times as good as what it replaces. Otherwise, the installed
base, engineering momentum and customer loyalty of the incumbents will prevail
against it.<BR>
<BR>
Cellular Vision faces a wired cable system with some $18 billion in installed
base. Already deploying fiber at a fast pace, cable companies plan to move
within the next year toward digital compression schemes that increase capacity
or resolution by a factor of between six and 10 (depending on the character
of the programming). That means some 500 digital channels or more. TCI,
the leading cable company, has ordered some one million cable converter
and decompression boxes from General Instruments' Jerrold subsidiary for
delivery late in 1993. In the U.S. cable industry, Hovnanian faces an aggressively
moving target. Most cable experts doubt he can make much of a dent.<BR>
<BR>
This view may be shortsighted. Clearly, Cellular Vision - and its likely
imitators - can compete in the many areas with incompetent cable systems,
in areas yet unreached by cable or in new projects launched by developers
such as the Hovnanians. In the rest of the world, cable systems are rare.
Cellular Vision is finding rich opportunities abroad, from Latvia to New
Zealand. Most of all, as time passes, Cellular Vision might find itself
increasingly well positioned for a world of untethered digital devices.<BR>
<BR>
Such a cellular system could be adapted to mobile telephone or computer
services. With a bit-error rate of one in 10 billion, it could theoretically
transmit computer data without error correction. With one gigahertz of bandwidth,
the system could function easily as a backbone for PCN applications, collecting
calls from handsets operating at lower frequencies and passing them on to
telephone or cellular central offices or to intelligent network facilities
of the local phone companies.<BR>
<BR>
The future local loop will combine telephone, teleputer and digital video
services, together with speech recognition and other complex features, in
patterns that will differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Easily customizable
from cell to cell, a system like Bossard's might well offer powerful advantages.<BR>
<BR>
In an era of bandwidth abundance, the Negroponte switch - with voice pushed
to the air and video onto wires - may well give way to this division between
fibersphere and atmosphere. With the fibersphere offering virtually unlimited
bandwidth for fixed communications over long distances, the local loop will
be the bottleneck, thronged with millions of wireless devices. Under these
conditions, a move to high-frequency cellular systems is imperative to carry
the increasing floods of digital video overflowing from the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, led by Qualcomm, Steinbrecher and Cellular Vision, a new generation
of companies is emerging to challenge the assumptions and structures of
the existing information economy. All these companies are recent startups,
with innovations entirely unexpected by international standards bodies,
university experts and government officials. They are the fruit of an entrepreneurial
America, guided by the marketplace into the microcosm and telecosm.

Why Imitate European Failures?
</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, the European and Japanese experiences with government-guided
strategies should give pause to proponents of similar policies here. Thirty
years of expensive industrial policy targeting computers has left the Europeans
with no significant computer firms at all. The Japanese have done better,
but even they have been losing market share across the board to the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
In the converging crescendos of advance in digital wireless telephony and
computing, progress is surging far beyond all the regulatory maps and guidebooks
of previous years. If the entire capacity of the 28-gigahertz band, renewed
every three miles, is open to telephony and video, bandwidth will be scarcely
more limiting in wireless than it is in glass.<BR>
<BR>
In this emerging world of boundless bandwidth, companies will prevail only
by transcending the folklore of scarcity and embracing the full promise
of the digital dawn. In an era of accelerating transition, the rule of success
will be self- cannibalization. Wire-line phone companies are not truly profitable
today; their reported earnings all spring from slow depreciation of installed
plant and equipment that are fast becoming worthless. As George Calhoun
of IMMC demonstrates in his superb new book, Wireless Access and the Local
Telephone Network (Artech, 1992), new digital wireless connections are already
less than one-third the cost of installing wire-line phones. For the RBOCs,
aggressively attacking their own obsolescent enterprises is their only hope
of prosperity.<BR>
<BR>
As Joseph Schlosser of Coopers & Lybrand observes, self- cannibalization
will not appear to be in the financial interests of the established firms;
it will not prove out in net-present- value terms. There will be no studies
to guarantee its success. Executives will have to earn their pay by going
with their gut. As semiconductor and computer companies have already learned,
phone and cable companies will discover that self-cannibalization is the
only way to succeed in this era - the only way to stop others from capturing
the heart of your business.<BR>
<BR>
This is the lesson of the last decade. When Craig McCaw sold his cable properties
and plunged into cellular telephony and $2 billion of Michael Milken's junk
bond debt, there was no way to prove him right. Today AT&T is preparing
to launch him as a rival to Bill Gates as the nation's richest man. Yet
McCaw cannot rest on his laurels; the hour of the cannibal is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
In theory, the transition should not be difficult for this resourceful and
ingenious entrepreneur, who has long been a leading prophet of ubiquitous
wireless phones and computers - his predicted personal digital assistant,
&quot;Charles.&quot; But a company that has paid billions for its 25-megahertz
national swath of long and strong frequencies faces especially acute dilemmas
in moving toward a regime of wide and weak. As a man - and company - that
has made such transitions before, McCaw is favored by history and by AT&amp;T.
As a giant pillar of the new establishment, though, McCaw may find it as
difficult to shift gears as did the computer establishment before him. The
stakes are even higher. The next decade will see the emergence of fortunes
in ever- changing transmutations of PCN, digital video, multimedia and wireless
computers that dwarf the yields of cable and cellular. The window of opportunity
opens wide and weak.

Philip Hope, divisional vice president for engineering systems of EDS,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has an IQ problem. His chief client and owner, General Motors, wants to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
interconnect thousands of 3-D graphics and computer aided engineering (CAE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
workstations with mainframes and supercomputers at Headquarters, with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
automated assembly equipment at factories in Lordstown, Indiana, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Detroit, with other powerful processors at their technical center in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren, Michigan, with their Opel plant in Ruesselheim, Germany, and with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their design center outside San Diego. On behalf of another client, Hope<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wants to link multimedia stations for remote diagnostics, X-ray analysis,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and pharmaceutical modeling in hospitals and universities across the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any function involving 3-D graphics, CAE, supercomputer visualization,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lossless diagnostic imaging, and advanced medical simulations demands large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth or communications power. Graphics workstations often operate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
screens with a million picture elements (pixels), and use progressive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
scanning at 60 frames or images a second. Each pixel may entail 24 bits
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
color. That adds up fast to billions of bits (gigabits) a second. And<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that's for last year's technology in a computer industry that is doubling<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
its powers and cost effectiveness every year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope needs is bandwidth and connections. The leading bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and connections people have always been the telephone companies. But when<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope goes to the telephone companies, they want to tell him about<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligence: their Advanced Intelligent Network which will be coming on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
line over the next decade or so and will solve all his problems. For now,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they have what they call DS-3 services available in many areas, operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T-3 lines at 45 megabits (million bits) a second. These facilities are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ample for most computer uses and working together with several different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Hope should be able to acquire<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
these services in time for a General Motors takeover by Toyota.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope has been through this before. In the early 1980s, he actually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wanted D-3 services. Then he was interconnecting facilities in Southeast,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michigan, with plants in Indiana and Ohio. But Michigan Bell could not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply the lines in time. EDS had to build a network of microwave towers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to bear the 45 megabit traffic. Later in the decade, the phone companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have even offered him higher capacity fiber optic lines, with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
requirement that the optical bits be slowed down and run periodically<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through an electronic interface so the telco could count the number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;equivalent channels&quot; being used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope and others in the systems integration business need is not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligent networks tomorrow but dumb bandwidth that they can deliver to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their customers flexibly, cheaply, and now. To prepare for future demand,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they want the network to use fiber optics. It so happens that America's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies have some two million miles of mostly unused fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines in the ground today, kept as redundant capacity for future needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope would like to be able to tap into this &quot;dark fiber&quot; for his
own<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the rapidly expanding field of computer services, EDS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
epitomizes the needs of an information economy. With a backlog of 22<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollars in already contracted business, EDS is currently a seven<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollar company growing revenues at an annual rate of 15 percent,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some three times as fast as the phone companies. EDS will add a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollars or so in new sales in 1992 alone. If the company is to continue
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply leading edge services to its customers, it must command leading edge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications. To EDS, that means dumb and dark networks.<BR>

The &quot;Dark Fiber&quot; Case<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That need has driven EDS into an active role as an ex parte pleader in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Case 911416, currently bogging down in the District of Columbia<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Court of Appeals as the so-called &quot;dark fiber&quot; case. On
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
surface, the case, known as Southwestern Bell et al versus the Federal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department, pits four<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell telephone companies against the FCC. But the legal maneuvers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
actually reflect a rising conflict between the Bells and several large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
corporate clients over the future of communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond all the legal posturing, the question at issue is whether fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks should be dumb and dark, and cheap, the way EDS and other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers like them. Or whether they should be bright and smart, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;strategically&quot; priced, the way the telephone companies want them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the side of intelligence and light are the phone companies;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southwestern Bell, U.S. West, Bell South, and Bell Atlantic. The forces
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
darkness include key officials at the FCC and such companies as Shell Oil,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the information services arm of McDonald Douglas, long distance network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider Wiltel, as well as EDS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For most of the four year course of the struggle, it has passed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unnoticed by the media. In summary, the issue may not seem portentous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The large corporate customers want dark fiber; the FCC mandates that it
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplied; the Bells want out of the business. But for all their obscurity,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the proceedings raise what for the next twenty years will be the central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
issue in communications law and technology. The issue, if not the possible<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trial itself, will shape the future of both the computer and telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries during a period when they are merging to form the spearhead of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dark fiber&quot; is simply a glass fiber optic thread with nothing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
attached to it, (ie. no light being sent through it). In this &quot;unlit&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
condition, it is available for use without the intermediation of phone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company electronics or intelligent services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, the Bells leased some of their dark fiber lines to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
several large corporations on an individual case basis. These companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
learned to love dark fiber. But when they tried to renew their leases with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the Bells, the Bells clanged no! Why don't you leave the interconnections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and protocols to us? Why don't you use our marvellous smart network with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the acronyms and intelligent services? Why don't you let us meter your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
use of the fiber and send you a convenient monthly bill for each packet
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bits you send?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EDS and the other firms rejected the offer; they preferred that dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber to the intelligent network. When the Bells persisted in an effort
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
deny new leases, the companies went to the FCC to require the Bells, as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
regulated &quot;common carrier&quot; telephone companies, to continue supplying
dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the fall of 1990, the FCC ruled that the phone companies would have<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to offer dark fiber to all comers under the rules of common carriage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than accept this new burden, the phone companies petitioned to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
withdraw from the business entirely under what is called a rule 214<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
application. Since the FCC has not acted on this petition, the Bells are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
preparing to go to court to force the issue. Their corporate customers are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ready to litigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is safe to say that none of the participants fully comprehend the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
significance of their courthouse confrontation. To the Bells, after all
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
said and done, the key problem is probably the price. Under the existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
tariff, they are required to offer this service to anyone who wants it for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an average price of approximately $150 per strand of fiber per month. As<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an offering that competes with their T-3 45 megabit (millions of bits) a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second lines and other forthcoming marvels, dark fiber threatens to gobble<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up their future as vendors of broadband communications to offices, even
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cable TV preempts them as broadband providers to homes. Since the Bells'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
profits on data are growing some 10 times as fast as their profits on voice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephony, they see dark fiber as a menace to their most promising markets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The technological portents, however, are far more significant even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than the legal and business issues. The coming triumph of dark fiber will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mean not only the end of the telephone industry as we know it but also the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
end of the telephone industry as they plan it: a vast intelligent fabric<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of sophisticated information services. It also could mean a thoroughgoing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restructuring of a computer industry increasingly dedicated to supplying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;smart networks.&quot; Indeed, for most of the world's communications
companies,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
professors of communications theory, and designers of new computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, the triumph of dark and dumb means &quot;back to the drawing board,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
if not back to the dark ages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the new dark ages cannot be held back.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Springing out the depths of IBM's huge Watson Laboratories is a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powerful new invention: the all optical network, that will soon relegate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all bright and smart executives to the Troglodyte file and make dumb and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dark the winning rule in communications.<BR>

The Wringer Effect<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the structure of nations and economies goes through<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a technological wringer. A new invention radically reduces the price of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
key factor of production and precipitates an industrial revolution. Before<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
long, every competitive business in the economy must wring out the residue<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the old costs and customs from all its products and practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The steam engine, for example, drastically reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
physical force. Power once wreaked at great expense from human and animal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
muscle pulsed cheaply and tirelessly from machines burning coal and oil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the world, dominance inexorably shifted to businesses and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nations that reorganized themselves to exploit the suddenly cheap resource.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually every human industry and activity, from agriculture and sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transport to printing and war, had to centralize and capitalize itself to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
take advantage of the new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Putting the world through the technological wringer over the last<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
three decades has been the integrated circuit, the IC. Invented by Robert<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Noyce of Intel and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1959, the IC put<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire systems of tiny transistor switches, capacitors, resistors, diodes,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and other once costly electronic devices on one tiny microchip. Made<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chiefly of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, three of the most common<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
substances on earth, the microchip eventually reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic circuitry by a factor of a million.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As industry guru Andrew Rappaport has pointed out, electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
designers now treat transistors as virtually free. Indeed, on memory<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chips, they cost some 400 millionths of a cent. To waste time or battery<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power or radio frequencies may be culpable acts, but to waste transistors<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is the essence of thrift. Today you use millions of them slightly to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enhance your TV picture or to play a game of solitaire or to fax Doonsbury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to Grandma. If you do not use transistors in your cars, your offices, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone systems, your design centers, your factories, your farm gear,
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your missiles, you go out of business. If you don't waste transistors,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your cost structure will cripple you. Your product will be either too<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive, too slow, too late, or too low in quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Endowing every information age engineer or PC hacker with the creative<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
potential of a factory owner of the industrial age, the microchip reversed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the centralizing thrust of the previous era. All nations and businesses<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had to adapt to the centrifugal law of the microcosm, flattening<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hierarchies, outsourcing services, liberating engineers, shedding middle<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
management. If you did not adapt your business systems to the new regime,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you would no longer be a factor in the world balance of economic and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
military power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the next decade or so, industry will go through a new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology wringer and submit to a new law: the law of the telecosm. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new wringer, the new integrated circuit, is called the all optical network.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a communications system that runs entirely in glass. Unlike existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optic networks, which convert light signals to electronic form in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
order to amplify or switch them, the all optical network is entirely<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
photonic. From the first conversion of the signal from your phone or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer to the final conversion to voice or data at the destination, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
message flies through glass on wings of light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the old integrated circuit put entire electronic systems on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single slivers of silicon, the new IC will put entire communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems on seamless webs of silica. Wrought in threads as thin as a human<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hair, this silica is so pure that you could see through a window of it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seventy miles thick. But what makes the new wringer roll with all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
force of the microchip revolution before it is not the purity but the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
price. Just as the old IC made transistor power virtually free, the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, the all optical network, will make communications power virtually free.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another word for communications power is bandwidth. Just as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire world had to learn to waste transistors, the entire world will now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to learn how to waste bandwidth. In the 1990s and beyond, every<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry and economy will go through the wringer again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The impact on the organization of companies and economies, however,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has yet to become clear. What is the law of the telecosm? Will the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology reverse the centrifugal force of the microchip revolution...or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
consummate it? To understand the message of the new regime, we must follow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the rule of microcosmic prophet Carver Mead of Caltech: &quot;Listen to
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology...and find out what it is telling us.&quot;<BR>

The father of the all-optical-network, the man who coined the phrase,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
built the first fully functional system, and wrote the definitive book on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the subject, is Paul E. Green, Jr. of Watson Laboratory at IBM. Now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
standing directly in the path of Green's wringer is Robert Lucky, who some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seven years ago at a conference at Cornell first gave Green the idea that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an all optical network might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The leading intellectual in telephony, Lucky recently shocked the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry by shifting from AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, where he was executive director<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of research, to Bellcore, the laboratory of the Regional Bell Operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies (RBOCs). There he will soon have to confront the implications
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's innovation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplating the new technology, Lucky recalls a course on data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks that he used to teach many years ago with Green. As a computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
man, Green relished the contrast between the onrushing efficiencies in his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology and the relative dormancy in communications. Indeed, for some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twenty five years, while computer powers rose a millionfold, network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacities increased about a thousandfold. It was not until the late 1980s<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that most long distance data networks much surpassed the Pentagon's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ARPANET&quot; running at 50 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second
since the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mid sixties.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was the era dominated by the powerful mathematic visions and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
theories of Claude Shannon of MIT and Bell Labs. Shannon was the reclusive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
genius who invented Information Theory to ascertain the absolute carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity of any communications channel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether wire or air, channels were assumed to be narrow and noisy, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way God made them (sometimes with help from AT&amp;T). Typical were the
copper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone lines that still link every household to the telephone network and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the air waves that still bear radio and television signals and static.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all-purpose remedy for these narrow, noisy channels was powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Invented at Bell Laboratories by a team headed by William<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shockley and then developed by Robert Noyce and other Shockley proteges
in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley, silicon transistors and integrated circuits engendered a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
constant exponential upsurge of computing power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throwing ever more millions of ever faster and cheaper transistors at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every problem, engineers created fast computers, multiplexors, and switches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that seemed to surmount and outsmart every limit of bandwidth or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restriction of wire. This process continues today with heroic new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression tools that allow the creation of full video conferences over
64<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilobit telephone connections. Scientists at Bellcore are now even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
proposing new ways of using the Motion Picture Engineering Group (MPEG)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression standard to send full motion movies at 1.5 megabits a second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
over the 4 kilohertz twisted pair copper wires to the home. Using ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
faster computers, the telephone company is saying it can give you pay-per-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
view movies without installing fiber, or even coaxial cable, to the home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Shannon-Shockley era, the communications might be noisy and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
error prone, but smart electronics could encode and decode messages in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
complex ways that allowed efficient identification and correction of all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
errors. The Shannon channel might be narrow, but fast multiplexors allowed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it to be divided into time slots accommodating a large number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simultaneous users in a system called time division multiplexing. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
channel might clog up when large numbers of users attempted to communicate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with each other at once, but collision detectors or token passers could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sort it all out in nanoseconds. Graphics and video might impose immense<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods of bits on the system, but compression technology could reduce the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods to a manageable trickle with little or no loss of picture quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If all else failed, powerful electronic switches could compensate for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
almost any bandwidth limitations. Switching could make up for the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inadequate bandwidth at the terminals by relieving the network of the need<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to broadcast all signals to every destination. Instead, the central switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could receive all signals and then route them to their appropriate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, this is the essential strategy of the telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies: compensate for narrow noisy bandwidth with ever more powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and intelligent digital electronics. Their &quot;core competence,&quot;
the Bells<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hasten to tell you, is switching. They make up for the shortcomings of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
copper wires by providing smart, powerful digital switches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Their vision for the future is to join the computer business all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way, making these switches the entering wedge for ever more elaborate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information services. Switches will grow smarter and more sophisticated<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
until they provide an ever growing cornucopia of intelligent voice and fax<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
features, from caller ID and voice mail to personal communications systems<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that follow you and your number around the world from your car commute to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your vacation beach hideaway. In the end, these intelligent networks could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply virtually all the world's information needs, from movies, games and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
traffic updates to data libraries, financial services, news programs, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
weather reports, all climaxing with yellow pages that exfoliate into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigantic global mall of full motion video where your fingers walk (or your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
voice commands echo) from Harrods, to Jardines, to Akihabara, to Century
21<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
without you leaving the couch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the time when Green and Lucky taught their course, this strategy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for the future was only a glimmer in the minds of telephone visionaries.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the essence of it was already in place. As Green pointed out,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies' response to sluggishness in communications was to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enter the computer industry, where progress was faster. The creativity of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
digital electronics would save the telephone industry from technical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stagnation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky, however, protested to Green that it was unjust to compare the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two fields. Computers and telecom, as Lucky explained it, operate on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entirely different scales. Computers work in the microscale world of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, putting ever more thousands of wires and switches on single slivers
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
silicon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, telecommunications functions in the macroworld, laying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
out wires and switches across mostly silicon landscapes and seabeds. It<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
necessarily entails a continental, or even intercontinental stretch of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cables, microwave towers, switches, and poles. &quot;How was it possible,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky asked, &quot;to make such a large scale system inexpensive?&quot;
Inherent in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the structure and even the physics of computers and telecommunications,
so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it seemed to Lucky two decades ago, was a communications bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Lucky remembers it, Green was never satisfied with Lucky's point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green believed that someday communications could achieve miracles<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to the integrated circuit in computing....<BR>

<BR>
The Bandwidth Scandal<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, as Lucky was the first to announce, fiber optics has utterly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
overthrown the previous relationship between fast computers and slow wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it is computer technology that imposes the bottleneck on the vast<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vistas of dark fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A silicon transistor can change its state some 2.5 billion times a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second in response to light pulses (bundles of photons) hitting a photo-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
detector. Since it would take a human being a thousand years or so of 10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hour workdays even to count to two billion, two billion cycles in a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second (two gigahertz) might seem a sprightly pace. But in the world of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optics running at the speed and frequencies of light, even a rate
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two billion cycles a second is a humbling bow to the slothful pace of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Since optical signals still have to be routed to their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
destinations through computer switches, communications now suffers from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what is known as the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is this electronic bottleneck, the entire Bell edifice of Shannon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and Shockley, that Paul Green plans to blow away with his all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks. Green is targeting what is a secret scandal of modern<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecommunications: the huge gap between the real capacity of fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and the actual speed of telephone communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In communications systems, the number of waves per second (or hertz)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
represents a rough measure of its potential bandwidth or ultimate carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity. The bandwidth of a radio system, for example, is determined by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the frequency of each station or channel and by the number of stations that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
can fit within the band. Your AM dial, for example, runs from around 535<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand hertz (kilohertz) to 1705 kilohertz and each station uses some
10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilohertz. With an ideal receiver, the AM passband might carry 117<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some 25 thousand gigahertz in each of three groups of frequencies (three<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands) through which fiber can transmit light over long distances. At<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a gigahertz per terminal, this bandwidth might accommodate some 25,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supercomputer &quot;stations&quot; (or 2.5 billion AM stations). Using what
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
called dispersion shifted fiber, it may be possible to use two of these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands at once: a total of some 40 or 50 thousand gigahertz. For<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparison, consider all the radio frequencies currently used in the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for radio, television, microwave, and satellite communications and multiply<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by two thousand. The bandwidth of one fiber thread could carry more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two thousand times as much information as all these radio and microwave<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies that currently comprise the &quot;air.&quot; One fiber thread
could bear<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twice the traffic on the phone network during the peak hour of Mothers'
Day<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in the U.S. (the heaviest load currently managed by the phone system).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet even for point-to-point long distance links, let alone connections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to homes, telephone and computer network engineers now turn their backs
on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
this immense capacity and use perhaps one or two fifty thousandths it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deferring to the electronic bottleneck, the telephone industry uses fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
merely as a superior replacement for the copper wires, coaxial cables,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
satellite links, and microwave towers that connected the local central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
office switches to one another for long distance calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last 15 years, the Bell Laboratory record for fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication has run from 10 megabits per second over a one kilometer span<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to some 10 gigabits per second over nearly one thousand kilometers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the heroic advances in point-to-point links between central offices<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
continued to use essentially one frequency on a fiber thread, while<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoring its intrinsic power to accommodate thousands of useful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In a world of all optical networks, this strategy is bankrupt. No<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
longer will it be possible to throw more transistors, however cheap and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fast, at the switching problem. Electronic speeds have become an<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
insuperable bottleneck obstructing the vast vistas of dark fiber beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So called gigabit networks planned by the telephone and computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies will not do. What is needed is not a gigabit spread among many<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals, but a large network functioning at a gigabit per second per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demands of EDS offer a hint of the most urgent business needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Added to them will be consumer demands. True high definition television,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to movies in resolution, requires close to gigabit-a-second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, particularly if the program is dispatched to the viewer in burst<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mode all at once in a few seconds down the fiber, or if the user is given
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chance to shape the picture, choose a vantage point, window several images<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at once, or experience three dimensions. When true broadband channels<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
become available, there will be a flood of new applications comparable to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the thousands of new uses of the IC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No foreseeable progress in electronics can overcome the electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bottleneck. To do that, we need an entirely new communications regime. In<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the form of the all optical network, this regime is now at hand.<BR>

Law Of The Telecosm: Networks Dumb As A Stone<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime will use fiber not as a replacement for copper wires<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but as a new form of far more capacious and error-free air. Through a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
system called wavelength division multiplexing and access, computers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephones will tune into desired messages in the fibersphere the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios now tune into desired signals in the atmosphere. The fibersphere<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be intrinsically as dumb and dark as the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime overcomes the electronic bottleneck by altogether<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
banishing electronics from the network. But, ask the telcos in unison,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what about the switches? As long as the network is switched, it must be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
partly electronic. Unless the network is switched, it is not a true any-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to-any network. It is a broadcast system. It may offer a cornucopia of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services. But it cannot serve as a common carrier like the phone network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
allowing any party to reach any other. Without intelligent switching it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cannot provide personal communications nets that can follow you wherever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you go. Without intelligent switching, the all optical network, so they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
say, is just a glorified cable system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These critics fail to grasp a central rule of the telecosm: bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is a nearly perfect substitute for switching. With sufficient physical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it is possible to simulate any kind of logical switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
whatsoever. Bandwidth allows creation of virtual switches that to the user<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seem to function exactly the way physical switches do. You can send all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
messages everywhere in the network, include all needed codes and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
instructions for correcting, decrypting, and reading them, and allow each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength, just like
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two-way radio. When the terminals are smart enough and the bandwidth great<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enough, your all optical network can be as dumb as a stone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last several years, all optical network experiments have been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conducted around the world, from Bellcore in New Jersey to NTT at Yokosuka,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Japan. British Telecom has used wavelength division multiplexing to link<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
four telephone central offices in London. Columbia's Telecom Center has<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launched a &quot;Teranet&quot; that lacks tunable lasers or receivers but
can<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
logically simulate them. Bell Laboratories has generated most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology but as a long distance specialist has focussed on the project
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sending gigabits of information thousands of miles without amplifiers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only fully functional system is the Rainbow created by Paul Green at IBM.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As happens so often in this a world of technical disciplines sliced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
into arbitrary fortes and fields, the large advances come from the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrators. Paul Green is neither a laser physicist, nor an optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
engineer, nor a telecommunications theorist. At IBM, his work has ranged<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
from overseeing speech recognition projects at Watson Labs to shaping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company strategy at corporate headquarters in Armonk. His most recent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
success was supervising development of the new APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Network) protocol. According to an IBM announcement in March, APPN will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
replace the venerable SNA (systems network architecture) that has been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
synonymous with IBM networking for more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green took some pride in this announcement, but by that time, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
project was long in his past. He was finishing the copy editing on his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
magisterial tome on Fiber Optic Networks (published this summer by Prentice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hall). And he was moving on to more advanced versions of the Rainbow which<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
he and his team had introduced in December 1991 at the Telecom 91<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Conference in Geneva and which has been installed between the various<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
branches of Watson Laboratories in Westchester County, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker points out, a new technology cannot displace an old<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
one unless it is proven at least 10 times better. Otherwise the billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of installed base and thousands of engineers committed
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
improving the old technology will suffice to block the new one. The job
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Green's 15 man team at IBM is to meet that tenfold test.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's all optical network creates a fibersphere as neutral and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passive as the atmosphere. It can be addressed by computers the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios and television sets connect to the air. Consisting entirely of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unpowered glass and passive spitters and couplers, the fibersphere is dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dumb. Any variety of terminals can interconnect across it at the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time using any protocols they choose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as radios in the atmosphere, computer receivers connected to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere do not find a series of bits in a message; they tune into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wavelength or frequency. Because available Fabry Perot tunable filters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
today have larger bandwidth than tunable lasers, Green chose to locate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rainbow's tuning at the receiver and have transmitters each operate at a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fixed wavelength. But future networks can use any combination of tunable<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
equipment at either end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Green began the project in 1987, the industry stood in the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
general position as the pioneers of radio in the early years of that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry. They had seemingly unlimited bandwidth before them, but lacked<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters and receivers powerful enough to use it effectively. Radio<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters suffered &quot;splitting losses&quot; as they broadcast their
signals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
across the countryside. Green's optical messages lose power everytime they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are split off to be sent to another terminal or are tapped by a receiver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The radio industry solved this problem by the development of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
audion triode amplifier. Green needed an all optical amplifier to replace<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the optoelectronic repeaters that now constitute the most widespread<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic bottleneck in fiber. Amplifiers in current fiber networks first<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert the optical signal to an electronic signal, enhance it, and then<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert it back to photons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the pioneers of radio, Green soon had his amplifier in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following concepts pioneered by David Payne at the University of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southhampton in England, a Bell Laboratories group led by Emmanuel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Desurvire and Randy Giles developed a workable all optical device. They<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
showed that a short stretch of fiber doped with erbium, a rare earth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mineral, and excited by a cheap laser diode, can function as a powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier over the entire wavelength range of a 25,000 gigahertz system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today such photonic amplifiers enhance signals in a working system of links<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between Naples and Pomezia on the west coast of Italy. Manufactured in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
packages between two and three cubic inches in size, these amplifiers fit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
anywhere in an optical network for enhancing signals without electronics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This invention overcame the most fundamental disadvantage of optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks compared to electronic networks. You can tap into an electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
network as often as desired without weakening the voltage signal. Although<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
resistance and capacitance will weaken the current, there are no splitting<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
losses in a voltage divider. Photonic signals, by contrast, suffer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
splitting losses every time they are tapped; they lose photons until<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
eventually there are none left. The cheap and compact all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier solves this problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Not only did Green and his IBM colleagues create working all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, they also reduced the interface optoelectronics to a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microchannel plug-in card that can fit in any IBM PS/2 level personal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer or R6000 workstation. Using off-the-shelf components costing a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
total of $16,000 per station, Rainbow achieved a capacity more than 90<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
times greater than FDDI at an initial cost merely four times as much.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Jack Kilby's first ICs were not better than previous adders<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and oscillators, the Rainbow I is not better in some respects than rival<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks based on electronics. At present it connects only 32 computers
at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a speed of some 300 megabits per second, for a total bandwidth of 9.5<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigabits. This rate is huge compared to most other networks, but it is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
still well below the target of a system that provides gigabit rates for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A more serious limitation is the lack of packet switching. Rather<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than communicating down a dedicated connection between two parties, like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phones do, computer networks send data in small batches, called packets,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
each bearing its own address. This requires switching back and forth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between packets millions of times a second. Neither the current Rainbow's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lasers nor its filters can tune from one message to another more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of times a second. This limitation is a serious problem for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
links to mainframes and supercomputers that may do many tasks at once in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
different windows on the screen and with connections to several other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Green shows, however, all these problems are well on the way to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
solution. A tide of new interest in all optical systems is sweeping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the world's optical laboratories. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a program for all optical networking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Green installed as the new President of the IEEE Communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Society, the technical journals are full of articles on new wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division technology. Every few months brings new reports of a faster laser<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with a broader bandwidth, or filter with faster tuning, or an ingenious
new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way to use bandwidth to simulate packet switching. Today lasers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
receivers can switch fast enough but they still lack the ability to cover<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the entire bandwidth needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key point, however, is that as demonstrated both in Geneva and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armonk, the Green system showed the potential efficiency of all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Even in their initial forms they are more cost effective in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth per dollar than any other network technology. Scheduled for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
introduction within the next two years, Rainbow III will comprise a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand stations operating at a gigabit a second, with the increasingly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
likely hope of fast packet switching capability. At that point, the system<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be a compelling commercial product at least hundreds of times more<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost effective than the competition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Without access to dark fiber, however, these networks will be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
worthless. If the telephone companies fail to supply it, they risk losing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
most of the fastest growing parts of their business: the data traffic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
which already contributes some 50 percent of their profits. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
also a possibility that they will lose much of their potential consumer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
business as well: the planned profits in pay-per-view films and electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yellow pages. This is the message of a second great prophet of dark fiber,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will Hicks of Southbridge, Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A venerable inventor of scores of optical products, Hicks believes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that Green's view of the future of fiber is too limited. Using wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division, Hicks can see the way to deliver some 500 megahertz two-way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
connections to all the homes in America for some $400 per home. That is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fifty times the 10 megahertz total capacity of an Ethernet (with no one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
else using it) for some 20 percent of the cost. That is capacity in each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
home for twenty digital two-way HDTV channels at once at perhaps half the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost of new telephone connections. Then, after a large consumer market<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
emerges for fiber optics, Hicks believes, Green's sophisticated computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services will follow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The consumer market, Hicks maintains, is the key to lowering the cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the components to a level where they can be widely used in office<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks as well. He cites the example of the compact disk laser diode.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once lasers were large and complex devices, chilled with liquid nitrogen,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and costing thousands of dollars; now they are as small as a grain of salt,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cheap as a box of cereal, and more numerous than phonograph needles. An<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
executive at Hitachi told Hicks that Hitachi could work a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation on laser diodes and amplifiers for all optical networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just tell me what price you want to pay and I'll tell you how many
you<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to buy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The divergence of views between the IBM executive and the wildcat<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inventor, however, is far less significant than their common vision of dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber as the future of communications. By the power of ever cheaper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it will transform all industries of the coming information age<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
just as radically as the power of cheaper transistors transformed the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries of the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the telephone companies, the age of ever smarter terminals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mandates the emergence of ever dumber networks. This is a major strategic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge; it takes a smart man to build a dumb network. But the telcos<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have the best laboratories and have already developed nearly all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
components of the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Telephone companies may complain of the large costs of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation of their system, but they command capital budgets as large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as the total revenues of the cable industry. Telcos may recoil in horror<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at the idea of dark fiber, but they command webs of the stuff ten times<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
larger than any other industry. Dumb and dark networks may not fit the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company self-image or advertising posture. But they promise larger<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
markets than the current phone company plan to choke off their future in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the labyrinthine nets of an &quot;intelligent switching fabric&quot; always
behind<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
schedule and full of software bugs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telephone companies cannot expect to impose a uniform network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
governed by universal protocols. The proliferation of digital protocols<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and interfaces is an inevitable effect of the promethean creativity of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer industry. Green explains, &quot;You cannot fix the protocol zoo.
You<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
must use bandwidth to accommodate the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Robert Pokress, a former switch designer at Bell Labs now head of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unifi Corporation, points out, telephone switches (now 80 percent software)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are already too complex to keep pace with the efflorescence of relatively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simple computer technology on their periphery. While computers become ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more lean and mean, turning to reduced instruction set processors, networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
need to adopt reduced instruction set architectures. The ultimate in dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dark is the fibersphere now incubating in their magnificent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The entrepreneurial folk in the computer industry may view this<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wrenching phone company adjustment with some satisfaction. But the fact
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that computer companies face a strategic reorientation as radical as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telcos do. In a world where ever smarter terminals require ever dumber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications, computer networks are as gorged and glutted with smarts
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company networks and even less capacious. The nation's most<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
brilliant nerds, commanding the 200 MIPS Silicon Graphics superstations
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mac Quadra multimedia power plants, humbly kneel before the 50 kilobit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines of the Internet and beseech the telcos to upgrade to 64 kilobit basic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ISDN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now addicted to the use of transistors to solve the problems of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limited bandwidth, the computer industry must use transistors to exploit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the opportunities of nearly unlimited bandwidth. When home-based machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are optimized for manipulating high resolution digital video at high<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speeds, they will necessarily command what are now called supercomputer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powers. This will mean that the dominant computer technology will emerge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
first not in the office market but in the consumer market. The major<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge for the computer industry is to change its focus from a few<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hundred million offices already full of computer technology to a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
living rooms now nearly devoid of it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies possess the advantage of already owning dumb networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
based on the essentials of the all optical model of broadcast and select--<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of customers seeking wavelengths or frequencies rather than switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
circuits. Cable companies already provide all the programs to all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals and allow them to tune in to the desired messages. Uniquely in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the world, U.S. cable firms already offer a broadband pipe to ninety<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
percent of American homes. These coaxial cables, operating at one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigahertz for several hundred feet, provide the basis for two way broadband<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services today. But the cable industry cannot become a full service<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplier of telecommunications until it changes its self-image from a cheap<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider of one way entertainment services into a common carrier of two
way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Above all, the cable industry cannot succeed in the digital<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
age if it continues to regard the personal computer as an alien and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
irrelevant machine.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Analogous to the integrated circuit in its economic power, the all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optical network is analogous to the massively parallel computer in its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technical paradigm. In the late 1980s in computers, the effort to make one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor function ever faster on a serial stream of data reached a point<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of diminishing returns. Superpipelining and superscalar gains hit their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limits. Despite experiments with Josephson Junctions, high electron<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mobility, and cryogenics, usable transistors simply could not made to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
switch much faster than a few gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Computer architects responded by creating machines with multiple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processors operating in parallel on multiple streams of data. While each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor worked more slowly than the fastest serial processors, thousands<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of slow processors in parallel could far outperform the fastest serial<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Measured by cost effectiveness, the massively parallel machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dwarfed the performance of conventional supercomputers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same pattern arose in communications and for many of the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
reasons. In the early 1990s the effort to increase the number of bits that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could be time division multiplexed down a fiber on a single frequency band<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had reached a point of diminishing returns. Again the switching speed of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transistors was the show stopper. The architects of all optical networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
responded by creating systems which can use not one wavelength or frequency<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but potentially thousands in parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the new systems could not outperform time division multiplexing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
on one frequency. But all optical networks opened up a vast vista of some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
75 thousand gigahertz of frequencies potentially usable for communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That immense potential of massively parallel frequencies left all methods<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of putting more bits on a single set of frequencies look as promising as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launching computers into the chill of outer space in order to accelerate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their switching speeds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the law of the microcosm made all terminals smart,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
distributing intelligence from the center to the edges of the network, so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the law of the telecosm creates a network dumb enough to accommodate the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
incredible onrush of intelligence on its periphery. Indeed, with the one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chip supercomputer on the way, manufacturable for under a hundred dollars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
toward the end of the decade, the law of the microcosm is still gaining<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
momentum. The fibersphere complements the promise of ubiquitous computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power with equally ubiquitous communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What happens, however, when not only transistors but also wires are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nearly free? As Robert Lucky observes in his forward to Paul Green's book,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of us have been conditioned to think that transmission is inherently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive; that we should use switching and processing wherever possible
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
minimize transmission.&quot; This is the law of the microcosm. But as Lucky<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speculates, &quot;The limitless bandwidth of fiber optics changes these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assumptions. Perhaps we should transmit signals thousands of miles to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
avoid even the simplest processing function.&quot; This is the law of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecosm: use bandwidth to simplify everything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Hillis of Thinking Machines Corporation offers a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vision, adding to Lucky's insight the further assertion that massively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
parallel computer architectures are so efficient that they can overthrow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the personal computer revolution. Hillis envisages a powerplant computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
model, with huge Thinking Machines at the center tapped by millions of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively dumb terminals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these speculations assume that the Law of the Telecosm usurps the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Law of the Microcosm. But in fact the two concepts function in different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ways in different domains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transistors use electrons to control, amplify, or switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons. But photonics differ radically from electronics. Because<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moving photons do not affect one another on contact, they cannot readily
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
used to control, amplify, or switch each other. Compared to electrons,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moreover, photons are huge: infrared photons at 1550 or 1300 nanometers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are larger than a micron across. They resist the miniaturization of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microcosm. For computing, photons are far inferior to electrons. With<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single electron electronics now in view, electrons will keep their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
advantage. For the foreseeable future, computers will be made with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are crippling flaws for photonic computing, however, are huge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assets for communicating. Because moving photons do not collide with each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
other or respond to electronic charges, they are inherently a two way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
medium. They are immune to lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrical power surges that destroy electronic equipment. Virtually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
noiseless and massless pulses of radiation, they move as fast and silently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Listening to the technology, as Caltech prophet Carver Mead<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
recommends, one sees a natural division of labor between photonics and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Photonics will dominate communications and electronics will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dominate computing. The two technologies do not compete; they are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
beautiful complements of each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm makes distributed computers (smart terminals)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more efficient regardless of the cost of linking them together. The law
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the telecosm makes dumb and dark networks more efficient regardless of how<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
numerous and smart are the terminals. Working together, however, these two<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laws of wires and switches impel ever more widely distributed information<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
It is the narrow bandwidth of current phone company connections that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
explains the persistence of centralized computing in a world of distributed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Narrowband connections require smart interfaces and complex<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
protocols and expensive data. Thus you get your online information from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only a few databases set up to accommodate queries over the phone lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You limit television broadcasting to a few local stations. Using the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively narrowband phone network or television system, it pays to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
concentrate memory and processing at one point and tap into the hub from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of remote locations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Using a broadband fiber system, by contrast, it will pay to distribute<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
memory and services to all points on the network. Broadband links will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
foster specialization. If the costs of communications are low, databases,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
libraries, and information services can specialize and be readily reached<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by customers from anywhere. On line services lose the economies of scale<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that lead a firm such as Dialog to attempt to concentrate most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
world's information in one set of giant archives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By making bandwidth nearly free, the new integrated circuit of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere will radically change the environment of all information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries and technologies. In all eras, companies tend to prevail by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maximizing the use of the cheapest resources. In the age of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere, they will use the huge intrinsic bandwidth of fiber, all 25<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand gigahertz or more, to replace nearly all the hundreds of billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of switches, bridges, routers, converters, codecs,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compressors, error correctors, and other devices, together with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trillions of lines of software code, that pervade the intelligent switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fabric of both telephone and computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The makers of all this equipment will resist mightily. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
no chance that the old regime can prevail by fighting cheap and simple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optics with costly and complex electronics and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical network will triumph for the same reason that the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrated circuit triumphed: it is incomparably cheaper than the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competition. Today, measured by the admittedly rough metric of MIPS per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollar, a personal computer is more than one thousand times more cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
effective than a mainframe. Within 10 years, the all optical network will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
be millions of times more cost effective than electronic networks. Just
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the electron rules in computers, the photon will rule the waves of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical ideal will not immediately usurp other technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Vacuum tubes reached their highest sales in the late 1970s. But just as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the IC inexorably exerted its influence on all industries, the all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology will impart constant pressure on all other communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Every competing system will have to adapt to its cost structure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, almost all electronic communications will go through the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wringer and emerge in glass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is the real portent of the dark fiber case wending its way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the courts. The future of the information age depends on the rise<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dumb and dark networks to accommodate the onrush of ever smarter<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Ultimately at stake is nothing less than the future of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer and communications infrastructure of the U.S. economy, its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competitiveness in world markets, and the consummation of the age of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Although the phone companies do not want to believe it, their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
future will be dark.

<HR><BR>
The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one huge fact: Without
immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a world power. Without immigration,
the U.S. could not have produced the computerized weapons that induced the
Soviet Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the U.S.
could not have built the atomic bomb during World War II, or the hydrogen
bomb in the early 1950s, or the MIRVs in the 1970s or the cruise missiles
for the Gulf War in the 1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military projects but
also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures in an information age economy.
No less than military superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance
and high standards of living today depend on outsiders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every high-technology company, big or small is like a Manhattan Project.
All must mobilize the personnel best trained and most able to perform a
specific function, and deliver a product within a window of opportunity
as fateful and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to the
small elite of human beings in the world capable of pioneering these new
scientific and engineering frontiers. For many specialized high-technology
tasks, the pool of potential talent around the world numbers about 10 people,
or even fewer. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
The Right People </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are running such a technology company, you will quickly discover
that the majority of this cognitive elite are not citizens of your country.
Unless you can find the right people wherever they may be, you will not
be able to launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless you
can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any other jobs at
all, and your country will forgo the cycle of new products, skills, and
businesses that sustain a world-leading standard of living. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their followers are
beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the movement of cabbage pickers and au
pair girls and the possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like
hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex crouching behind
them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as George Borjas of the University
of California, San Diego, and artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude
that the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or negligible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the evidence in overwhelming and undeniable; it is all around us,
in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from microwaves and air
bags to digital cable and satellite television, from home computers and
air conditioners to cellular phones and life saving pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. Without immigration over the last 50 years, I would estimate
that the U.S. real living standards would be at least 40% lower. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems from a basic
flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail to account for the indispensable
qualitative effects of genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability
to generate unique products and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses
are literally thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We
all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify or predict, except
in retrospect. But judging from the very rough metric of awards of mathematical
doctorates and other rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes,
patents, and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. are
foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of immigrants. A third of
all American Nobel Prize winners, for example were born overseas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A stellar example of these elates in action is Silicon Valley in California.
Silicon Valley companies have reduced the price of computer MIPs and memory
bits by a factor of some 10,000 in 2 1/2 decades. Although mainstream economists
neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these innovations, most of
the new value in the world economy over the last decade has stemmed, directly
or indirectly, from the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware
and software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel
developed the basic processes of microchip manufacture and created dynamic
and static random access memory. In other words, Intel laid the foundations
for the personal computer revolution and scores of other chip-bases industries
that employ the vast bulk of U.S. engineers today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two American born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were key founders
of Fairchild and Intel. But their achievements would have been impossible
without the help of Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-Benchkowski,
inventor of electrically erasable programmable ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor
of silicon gate technology and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi
Shima, layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course Andrew
Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved several intractable problems
of the metal oxide silicon technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All
these Intel engineers - and hundreds of other key contributors - were immigrants.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon Valley, from National
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic,
Actel, Atmel, Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the outset heavily depended on immigrants
in the laboratories and on engineering work benches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel,
Xicor, and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully one-third
of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. economy, with
Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even Alleys being hopefully launched
from Manhattan to Oregon, immigration becomes ever more vital to the future
of the U.S. economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the foundation
of silicon have arisen world-leading software and medical equipment industries
almost equally dependent on immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing
U.S. industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted jobs
in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still must turn to immigrants
for 5% of its domestic work force, despite the difficult and expensive legal
procedures required to import an alien. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
Freedom of Enterprise </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a Microsoft attorney,
declared that immigration bars could jeopardize the 58% of its revenue generated
overseas, threaten American dominance of advance &quot;client-server&quot;
business applications, and render &quot;stillborn&quot; the information
superhighway. In particular, Corning and other producers of fiber-optic
technology have faced a severe shortage of native engineers equipped to
pursue this specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning mathematics and the
hard sciences, America is the global technology and economic leader in spite
of, not because of , any properties of the American gene pool or dominant
culture. America prevails only because it offers the freedom of enterprise
and innovation to people from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress is contemplating,
is a decision to wreck the key element of the American technological miracle.
After botching the issues of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction,
and wasting a year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget,
the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body blow to the
intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must not cripple the new Manhattan
Projects of the U.S. economy in order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic
dream of ethnic purity and autarky.

<H1><CENTER>The Roots of Black Poverty </CENTER>

</H3>
<H5><A HREF="dispfthr.html">Read a response to this article by <BR>
Washington Post columnist William Raspberry</A></H5>
<BR>
<HR>Dinesh D'Souza is currently the perplexed benificiary and victim of
an uproar over his book <I>&quot;The End of Racism,&quot;</I> which emerged
in the midst of a momentous furor over the centrality of race in America.
Except for the always bravely Olympian sage Thomas Sowell, even conservative
blacks have fiercely renounced much of his argument along with his intemperate
language. How can anyone deny the power of racism in the face of the taped
ruminations of Mark Fuhrman, the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan the indignant
voices at the Million Man March, the radical split between the races reacting
to the acquittal of O.J. Simpson? <BR>
<BR>
I know how Mr. D'Souza feels. In 1979, I published a book called <I>&quot;Visible
Man: A True Story of Post Racist American.&quot;</I> Now this book is being
republished by the ICS Press in San Francisco. <I><A HREF="visible.html">&quot;Visible
Man&quot;</A></I> showed that white racism was not a significant problem
for American blacks in the late 1970's. If white racism was not much of
a problem in 1978, it is manifestly not a problem in 1995. <BR>
<H4>Black Achievement </H4>
<BR>
Neither I nor Mr. D'Souza denies the existence of racial feelings in America
and throughout the world. But far from being hostile to black achievement,
American whites celebrate blacks at every opportunity. In the truest test,
governed by messive voluntary choices in the marketplace, Americans have
made the National Basketball Association, 80% black, the most popular sports
league, Whitney Houston the most popular and richest American singer, Bill
Cosby the most popular and richest comedian, and Oprah Winfrey the most
prosperous entertainer. Far from showing racism, American employers, mostly
white, have given black women higher earnings, on average, than comparable
white women. Between 1973 and 1994, the current-dollar revenues of the top
100 black owned industrial companies, as listed by <I>Black Enterprise</I>
magazine, rose from $473 million to $6.7 billion, plus $4.9 billion in revenues
from auto dealerships. Blacks in America have far outperformed blacks in
any other society with a substantial black population. <BR>
<BR>
In my view, the most important finding in <I>&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;</I>
by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray was that after controlling for
age, IQ and gender, the average full-time worker actually out-earns the
average white by 1%. Let the IQ number stand for real educational attainment
(as opposed to degrees in easier subjects and from less rigorous institutions),
and it is clear that racial discrimination no longer limits black earnings.
A more appropriate standard, though, would include a correction for marital
status, since married men of all races earn some 30% more than single men
of the same age and credentials. Correcting the Murray figures for marital
status gives black men a dramatic edge in earnings over white men. Although
such comparisons are full of pitfalls, it is safe to say that black men
in the U.S. today earn more, not less, than truly comparable whites. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than admit this reality, the intelligentsia, black and white, would
rather pusue fantasies of racial hatred. As I discovered during appearances
related to the original publication of <I>&quot;Visible Man,&quot;</I> and
as Mr. D'Souza is now learning, denial of racism today is widely seen as
evidence of it. In the face of the fury of the charges of bigotry, whites
find it easier to go along than to tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Public opinion polls, for example, show that the beating of Rodney King
galvanized a newly intense feeling of alienation among blacks in America.
Yet anyone, regardless of race, who took the police on an eight- mile, high-speed
chase, and then charged at them at the end, should be grateful if he is
not shot (rather than beaten). Sensible people learn not to defy or insult
police officers who are performing an inevitably messy and treacherous job
under tremendous strain. Yet the white media almost unanimously confirmed
the black outrage. Today whites indulge the idea of reasonable doubt in
the Simpson trial, as if it were possible that a team of policemen would
or could contrive an instant frame-up of a supremely popular black athelete.
<BR>
<BR>
In effect, all America treats blacks as children who cannot be told the
truth. From Harvard Law School deans to ghetto social workers; from the
chairman of the New York Times to the editors of Time magazine, to the steady
drumbeat of three broadcast networks, eminent whites are constantly confirming
blacks in the crippling comfort of their belief in white racism. <BR>
<BR>
If racism explains next to nothing about black poverty and crime, what does
explain it? What is the real cause, so unspeakably unwelcome that it drives
opinion toward almost any other explanation, however false or unsavory?
The chief cause of black poverty is welfare state feminism. Thirty years
of affirmative action programs have artificially elevated black women into
economic power over black men. <BR>
<BR>
This regime prevailed from the highest levels of the economy, where black
female college graduates with five years on the job significantly outearned
black men in 1991, to the underclass, where a typical package of welfare
benefits produced disposable income 28% above a typical job in 1994. It
prevailed on college campuses, where more than 60% of the blacks are women.
It dominated government job training programs, where girls are found to
benefit far more than boys. It even invaded such male bastions as the cockpits
of fighter planes, police squad cars, fire stations, construction sites
and university athletic teams. In a grotesque abuse of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, judges have interpreted Title IX of the 1972 amendments as
requiring academic institutions, in effect, to retrench scholarships and
opportunities for superior black male athletes to advance the careers of
measurably inferior female athletes, white and black, soley on the basis
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
It is an unpopular fact of life that in all societies and in all races monogamous
marriage is based on patriarchal sex roles, with men the dominant provider.
Welfare state feminism destroyed black families by ravaging the male role
of provider. <BR>
<BR>
Some observers claim that black communities benefit from matriarchal institutions.
Looking more closely, however, you will find inner cities implacably ruled
by gangs of young men, with the &quot;matriarchs&quot; cowering in their
triple bolted apartments in fear of them. <BR>
<BR>
Men either dominate as providers or predators. There is hardly any other
option. The key problem of the underclass - the crucible of crime, the source
of violence, the root of poverty - is the utter failure of socialization
of young men through marriage. The problem resides in the nexus of men and
marriage. Yet nearly all the attention, subsidies, training opportunities
and therapies of the welfare state focus on helping women function without
marriage. The welfare state attacks the problem of the absence of husbands
by rendering husbands as entirely superfluous. &quot;Welfare reform&quot;
continues the policy giving welfare mothers new training and child care
benefits and further obviating marriage by pursuing unmarried fathers with
deadbeat dad campaigns. <BR>
<BR>
Today, in large American cities, fully 40% of young black men between the
ages of 17 and 35 are in prison, on probation, or on the lam; and some 40%
of young black women say they have been forced into unwanted sexual activity.
To fear young black males has become a mandate for survival on the streets
of many American cities. This unspeakable social tragedy - with all its
infuriating reverberations on law-abiding balck citizens - is the inevitavble
harvest of government policy. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>The Great Fiasco </H4>
<BR>
Even Margaret Mead recognized that in all cultures family values depend
on religious supports and male providers. The effort to unculcate ethical
behavior and sustain marriage without religious faith is the great fiasco
of the modern age. In order to relieve the pain of the poor, our soicety
must come to recognize that their problem is not lack of jobs or lack of
money but moral anarchy originating with the establishment and most sorely
victimizing blacks. <BR>
<BR>
With both the black and white establishments and even the leading Christian
churches succumbing to the siren appeal of unisex policy, what could be
more predictable than the emergence of patriarchal religion - however offensive
in some ways - as a galvanizing force among black men. If Mr. Farrakhan
is deeply culpable for his ethnic fanaticism, surely the entire U.S. establishment
is equally culpable for its fanatical assault on family roles. For all races,
patriarchal religion has played a central role in human civilization. Patriarchal
black churches, from Father Divines' mid-century movement to Christian fundamentalists
and Black muslims today - have served more as part of the solution than
as part of the problem of black poverty. <BR>
<BR>
These lessons have become increasingly relevant to whites who imagine that
they can sustain a civilization based on secular liberation from monogamous
sex roles. As the white illegitimacy rate moves toward the level reached
by blacks at the time of the Moynihan Report - and decisively surpasses
it in Britain - the events of recent weeks should ring a tocsin for all
Americans. <BR>

What's wrong with welfare? Here's an answer you haven't heard: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key problem of the welfare culture is not unemployed women with
illegitimate children. It is the women's skewed and traumatic relationships
with men and boys. In a reversal of the usual pattern in civilized socieitie,
the women have the income and the ties to government authority and support.
The men are economically and socially subordinate.... This balance of power
virtually prohibits marriage which is everywhere based on the provider role
of men counterbalancing the sexual and domestic superiority of women.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I almost don't want to mention the source of this arresting notion - conservative
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> writing in the conservative American
Spectator (June 1995) - for fear that the name and affiliation might lead
some readers to suspend thought. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You see, of course, where Gilder is headed: Men, he believes, are the key
to strong families. And they are, the more successful welfare is - even
if it leads women to jobs, child care and improved earnings - the worse
it will be for families, because it will &quot;render the men still more
optional, desperate, feral, and single.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does any of this make sense? How would I feel, hearing this indispensable-man
argument, if I were female - especially if I were a single mother? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Already there has been a stream of books and articles (several of the latter
by me) arguing the negative effects of absent fathers on children and on
communities, or contending that the breakdown of marriage is the leading
indicator of social pathology, or otherwise calling for reclamation of men
and boys as the means of rescuing society. The Million Man March only underscored
the notion. Women must be wondering what makes us think men are God's primary
gift? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Gilder isn't quite saying we are. What he is saying is that children
need their fathers, too - and so do their mothers - and that welfare almost
calculatedly drives the men away, perpetuating both the worst effects of
welfare and the need for it. Listen: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire welfare state - from Donna Shalala to Bob Dole's Senate
offices - is relentlessly feminist, mandating preferences for women on construction
sites, in police cruisers, in Air Force jets and in athletic scholarships.
These programs necessarily concentrate their job incentives, training benefits,
and subsidies on women rather than on men because, in general, it is only
the mothers who are on welfare. The fathers use the apartments and take
the money of a series of welfare mothers, usually without joining the dole.
Thus the recipients of welfare-related work will mainly be women. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we know from reams of studies and centuries of experience that
only fathers can satisfactorily sustain families, reliably discipline teen-age
boys, and lift a community from poverty. The idea that welfare mothers can
do it while the government raises their children is incredibly naive....
The very idea that women with small children should work outside the home
is perverse. The welfare state has already deprived these children of fathers.
The workfare state proposes to take away the mothers as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Implicit in Gilder's analysis is his thesis of woman as civilizer of naturally
predatory man. How does she do it? By demanding commitment (which she needs)
in exchange for sex (his priority). Welfare eliminates the economic basis
for the commitment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unless they are tamed by marriage and the provider role,&quot; he
says, &quot;men become enemies of civilization and revert to their primordial
role as predators.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this blame-shifting drivel, as some surely will contend? Or has Gilder
found the virus that is killing our families and our communities? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He says it too harshly and too categorically, perhaps, but I think he is
on to something. The natural promiscuity of men combined with the increasing
unnecessity of men (except for sex) produces a breed frighteningly close
to Gilder's description of &quot;optional, desperate, feral and single.&quot;
We have to make men necessary again. <BR>

From NORTEL<I> The Next Century: Perspectives on the Information Age<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Network as Computer</CENTER>

<P>In the oceanic sweep of the information age, the once separate streams
of computers and telecom are converging into new digital floods of innovation
that shift as inexorably as the tides of the sea. As we rush toward a millennial
crest of invention, a new tidal shift is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of this shift is not the computer industry, which has long
ruled supreme, but the telecom equipment industry. Because average citizens
have always preferred communicating to computing, the shift from computers
to networks will transform the fruits of progress - once chiefly accessible
from the lofty reaches of the elite - to an everyday harvest as popular
and ubiquitous as the phone.<BR>
<BR>
The latest cycles began in the years following the Second World War, when
the telecommunications industry spearheaded research that brought such key
advances as the transistor and the laser. Over the last forty years, the
computer industry has ridden the transistor to dominance in the information
economy. New laser-based breakthroughs in fiber optics, however, now promise
to turn the tide again toward telephony. While the computer will still be
king, the network will become the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The siege of computer progress has been sustained over the last twenty years
by Moore's Law, based on the famous prophecy by Intel founder Gordon Moore
in 1978 that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every
eighteen months. Implicit in Moore's Law is a similar doubling every eighteen
months in computer power: the number of millions of instructions per second
(MIPS) that a single microprocessor or personal computer could perform.<BR>
<BR>
But the epoch of Moore's Law dominance is now ending. The silicon microcosm
- the physical source of innovation in microchips and computers - is giving
way to the optical telecosm and its even more rapid pace of advance in communications
power.<BR>
<BR>
Signaling the transition from microcosm to telecosm is one key metric: the
performance of publicly available networks compared to the performance of
the internal computer buses that connect microprocessor central processing
units (CPUs) to memories, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors. Today, new
fiber optics and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems being launched
by leading telco suppliers are overthrowing the key foundations of computer
industry supremacy on the leading edges of innovation. Now in view, as early
as next year, is a bandwidth crossover point where the communications power
of widely available telephone networks will surpass for the first time the
communications power of the internal buses of personal computers.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, while telecom bandwidth apparently stagnated, North American
phone companies installed some ten million miles of optical fiber - in effect,
a new bandwidth infrastructure in North America. So far, less than one-millionth
of the potential communications power of this fiber has been delivered to
customers.<BR>
<BR>
Now this potential bandwidth is about to erupt as a kinetic force of change
in the information economy. Telephone companies plan to increase the maximum
bandwidth of corporate services from the current 2.4 gigabits per second
to 40 gigabits per second in 1997. They will quadruple capacity, and quadruple
it again within the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
The explosion of bandwidth, however, will not transform the information
economy until it is delivered to people's homes. Delivery of the new tides
of bandwidth requires that telcos commanding advanced fiber and switch capabilities
collaborate with cable companies possessing broadband lines to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term bandwidth expander is ATM. It radically simplifies
the switching problem by putting all information in uniform 53-byte cells
that can be processed entirely in silicon chips without time-consuming access
to memory and software. With guaranteed delivery of cells on a fixed schedule
soon to reach a pace of 2.4 gigabits a second, ATM can manage multimedia
voice, data, and video all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
These new technologies can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and a remote archive or digital library. PCs will be able to
tap databases and libraries across the world as readily as they can reach
their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of telecom equipment, this new architecture provides huge
opportunities to launch new ATM systems on every scale, new network hardware
and software, and new optical communications equipment. The companies that
truly grasp that the network is the computer, and invest in the infrastructure
of the new networked economy, will dominate the decade.<BR>
<BR>
However, amid these torrents of bandwidth abundance, the greatest rewards
will accrue to people around the globe, joining the ever-expanding circles
of prosperity in an age of information.<BR>
<BR>
Many skeptics suggest that the new technologies will chiefly favor the already
prosperous and powerful in the industrialized countries. But the first beneficiaries
of the new age are Asian nations, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia and
China. Trapped in Third World poverty as recently as two decades ago, they
are now supplying crucial components to major telecom and computer companies
and leading the world in rates of economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade, digital networks will provide a new central nervous
system for the world economy. Transformed by convergence and computerization,
TV will burst forth in a new flowering of choice and empowerment. An abundance
of multimedia choices can remedy and reverse the cultural debacle of mass
market television. Transcending the current programming of the lowest common
denominator, video culture will effloresce into a plethora of products as
rich and various as books and magazines.<BR>
<BR>
Great cities will give up their current role as hives of industry and emerge
as havens of social activity and entertainment. On the network, an inner-city
child in public housing can pursue a curriculum far richer in learning resources
and far better adapted to personal needs and aptitudes than the program
of an elite suburban school today. Equipped with ATM and fiber-optic links,
small towns will become creative centers in the information economy. Productive
citizens will retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets
and communities. Hollywood and Wall Street will become historic curiosities
as their businesses diffuse to all points of the continent and the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Perfectly targeted to the most acute problems of the era, the new technologies
can reverse the spirals of decay afflicting many institutions and communities.
Traffic and pollution, ignorance and waste, can all give way to worldwide
webs of glass and light. <BR>
<BR>
The home will re-emerge as an industrial center, with marriages gaining
new roles and meanings around the evolving silicon hearths of a new cottage
economy, thus strengthening family values.<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the costs and raising the effectiveness of medical care will be
the on-line house call, sharing scarce diagnostic tools, tapping remote
specialists, and bringing busy doctors back to the patients' bedsides in
targeted teleconferences.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all these changes, one theme will triumph: the empowerment of
individual families and customers against remote and irresponsible organizations.
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or at the mall or in the local corporate center. Instead, they
will seek out and command their first choices in jobs, culture, entertainment,
and religion.<BR>
<BR>
Ranging across continents to find the best colleagues for every major project,
workers will scale new pinnacles of productivity and wealth. A culture of
first choices will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward
the mediocre, the vulgar, or the vicious.<BR>
<BR>
The age of mass manufacturing, mass marketing, and mass media brought capital
and labor together in vast pyramidal corporations, tying workers to the
machine and the tube. The explosive centrifuge of the telecosm will burst
these chains of industrial concentration. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and machine-age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth abundance not only fuels the advance of electronics; it also galvanizes
the growth of economies. The new media extend the webs of news and interconnection
that nourish markets and expand opportunity. <BR>
<BR>
Lavishing the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly
productive tools, and unleasing creativity with increasingly fertile and
targeted capital, the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope
to the masses of people who the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than giving millions of viewers access to five hundred channels of
one-way TV, the new technology will give all users two-way teleconferencing
with colleagues regardless of where they are - reading documents and books,
sharing multimedia experiences, consulting with specialists on your rare
disease at the Mayo Clinic or Columbia, touring Venice and Vancouver the
same day, dallying simultaneously at the Louvre and the London Museum, designing
a new building with an architect in Israel or a new dress with a couturier
in Paris or a new chip with a guru in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Through these channels, the poorest citizens will gain access to new worlds
of education, employment, entertainment, medical care, and communication
now commanded only by elites - a true transfer of power to the people everywhere.<BR>

<PRE>
What will happen over the next several years is that the external 
bandwidth of most computers--that is, the bandwidth of the 
asynchronous transfer mode networks that are being developed by 
some 600 companies and that are being deployed at an increasing 
pace--will be bigger than the internal bandwidth. And that will mean 
that computers will be able to tap remote databases and educational 
possibilities as readily as they tap their internal disk drives and CD-
ROMs. This means that, in a sense, the computer will hollow out, and 
the network will become the computer in a way that has never been 
true before. 


And the effect of this is that the Law of the Microcosm will join the 
Law of the Telecosm. The Law of the Microcosm says that if you take 
any number n transistors and put them on a single sliver of silicon, 
you get n-squared performance and value (thats one of the key 
exponentials that drive this era). The Law of the Telecosm says that 
if you take any number n computers and put them on a network you 
get n-squared performance and value, because each computer uses 
the network as a resource and is also a potential resource for the 
network.
	

And so the value of the network exponentially increases as the 
number of computers connected to it increases. And I think its the 
convergence of these two laws, both of which are central to the 
evolution of the computer industry, that will really shape the future. 
Its not going to be Hollywood executives who are going to be the 
chief drivers of the new age; they in fact will be victims of the new 
age. The chief drivers and the real winners are the computer and 
computer networking industries, as they interconnect Americas 
schools and colleges and homes into a truly new World Wide Web of 
glass and light. That is the real promise of the next era, and its going 
to happen faster than people expect, not more slowly. 


Theres still an optical illusion at the communications cliff at LANs 
end, but that can be quickly overcome by the use of cable 
technology--the coaxial that is already in the ground and connecting 
American homes, and particularly connecting to all the homes with 
computers. Last year there were some 26 million PCs in American 
homes, and 24 million of those homes had cable connections, and 
these cable connections are fully adequate to open the way for this 
transformation of the computer--the hollowing out of the computer, 
the moving of the computer onto the network, and the 
transformation of computer network architecture over the next 
decade.
	

So I think its a sure thing that education will be a much bigger 
market than entertainment. This is almost a certainty. Because 
education fits with computer technology, which is the driving force of 
this industry. But its not just the computer technology thats 
important, its the culture of the computer industry. Its the power of 
the commitment of increasing millions of citizens to this technology 
as a key channel for their creation of wealth and their advancement 
of learning.
	

And so its not just a technological issue, its a cultural issue, and 
the computer as a learning tool is a generator of wealth that will 
absorb an increasing share of our energies and creativity in the 
information age and will continue to expand its domain; whereas 
television will always be a disappointment because its essentially a 
diversion. It doesnt edify, it doesnt add to the national endowment, it 
tends to subtract from it. Its not the idiot box that will lead the U.S. 
into a new information age.


I think that the past years well-publicized efforts at convergence 
were really misconceived. US West and Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
turning to Hollywood talent agent Mike Ovitz is really rather 
pathetic, because when you think about it, if youre Mike Ovitz and 
you make a movie you really want it to go on everybodys conduit, 
whereas if youre Bell Atlantic and you run a network you want 
everybodys movies on that network. In other words, theres no 
benefit anymore from combining content and conduit in an era of 
truly broadband network. The exponential thrust comes from 
combining conduit with conduit, and allowing the people on the 
network to supply their own content to a great extent, in an 
entrepreneurial process thats almost entirely unpredictable.
	

But I think you can tell the general shape of the multimedia 
market that will emerge. It wont resemble Hollywood and it wont 
resemble broadcast television: It will resemble the book industry. 
There are about 80,000 books published every year in the United 
States, and the stores that are gaining share are the stores that offer 
the most choice. The key to the book industry is when a customer 
goes into a book store the customer gets his or her first choice. You 
get the book you want rather than a book thats been scheduled for 
you.
  

I think that same idea also gives us the key to finding the real 
opportunity in education in the information age. Students will get 
their first choice rather than some choice thats defined for them by 
some remote hierarchy. The power is migrating to the customer and 
that will be the driving force of the economy in the next decade, and 
it will be an exciting time.</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>An information technology visionary who writes compellingly about the 
relationship between technology and economics, George Gilder is the 
author of Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology 
(1989), Wealth and Poverty (1981), and numerous other works. His 1990 
book Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and 
American Life is now being issued by W.W. Norton Co. in a revised 
paperback edition with five new chapters.

	Gilder has been a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard and is currently a senior fellow of the Discovery 
Institute in Seattle. He lectures widely across the Country and around 
the world and will be a featured speaker at the Educom'94 conference 
this fall in San Antonio. Educom Review caught up with him just as he 
was about to leave for Europe to present a speech at Cambridge 
University.

Educom Review: You've used &quot;A Convergence of Corpses&quot; as the title for 
the prologue to Life after Television, and you've said that mergers such 
as the one recently attempted by Bell Atlantic and TCI &quot;mostly miss the 
point of the digital age.&quot; Who are all these corpses, and how are all 
these mergers missing the point?

<B>GILDER</B>: The real driving force of all this information technology is the 
triumph of the computer. Just as the personal computer essentially 
displaced the mainframe over the past ten years, over the next ten years 
the personal computer will displace the television set, the telephone, 
and an array of other appliances. So companies that attempt to exploit 
the opportunities of convergence by converging with TV sets, for 
example, tend to fail, as 3DO seems already to have failed, precisely 
because of that mistake. Meanwhile, Creative Labs was based on a less 
exciting technology--a soundboard for the PC--but has become an enormous 
company riding the tremendous ascendancy of 
personal computing.

<B>ER</B>: So your advice to 3DO would have been . . . ?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, my advice at the time was that they had better get 
connected to computers and regard computers as the interactive 
appliance. If they focused on the TV set, they would lose. And that's 
what seems to have been happening.
Other errors are being made by companies that target the set-top box and 
devote an enormous amount of design effort to squeezing computing power 
into the price point and form factor of a consumer electronics set-top 
box. 

<B>ER</B>: Why did 3DO ignore your advice?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I guess they were just infatuated with television. They'd 
come from founding MTV, and they imagined TV as an instrument with a 
future that somehow commands larger markets than the personal computer. 

But personal computers in homes are increasing ten times faster than 
television sets, and PC owners spend fifteen hundred bucks for the 
device itself and then another fifteen hundred bucks on software and 
peripherals, and within that price point you can accomplish anything 
that a set-top box or game machine can accomplish. And if you have 
broadband connections, for example, over cable lines through a cable 
modem, the PC can do anything the TV can do and do it just as well. 

That's the key limitation today: bandwidth. As Andy Grove says, infinite 
processing power will get you only so far with limited bandwidth. The 
key to the next generation of computer development is coupling the 
personal computer with broadband networks. 

Today, the personal computer is crippled by its need to devote most of 
its MIPs [million instructions per second], or a large portion of them, 
to compressing and decompressing any images that it uses. Thus 
teleconferencing, for example, and video telephones are so drastically 
unsatisfactory because all the computer MIPs are devoted to compressing 
and decompressing rather than to real computer functions. 

Once the PC is connected to broadband networks, it will really ascend to 
its dominant level in homes as well as offices. And that will be the 
crucial opportunity for educational materials as well.

<B>ER</B>: You say in Life after Television that &quot;TV ignores the reality that 
people are not inherently couch potatoes; given a chance they talk back 
and interact.&quot; Then how do you explain some of the disappointments of 
interactivity, such as GTE's Cerritos project, or the US West/TCI 
project in Denver, neither of which seemed to gain much loyalty from its 
subscribers?

<B>GILDER</B>: The explanation is that they all use the TV, and the TV is 
inherently a couch potato device, which is particularly lame at 
presenting text. Yet text is a crucial part of multimedia communications 
and interactivity. Those projects made the same error that 3DO made: 
they converged with a corpse. Unless you're a necrophiliac, that's not 
particularly gratifying.

<B>ER</B>: Alan Kay used the phrase &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; to express the concern 
that the new media would be mass communications oriented and that 
literacy would fall apart.

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, any instrument that creates &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; is going to 
fail, because it's going to make people poorer. Markets expand in the 
long run only if they are absolutely central industries in the economy--
if they're creating capital rather than depleting it. TV in general 
dissipates and deflates human capital, and game machines are 
distractions that fail to edify their users. 

The people who use PCs generate wealth with them rather than merely 
distract themselves, so they're willing to invest a lot more effort into 
their PCs. They're willing to master the intricacies of use, and they're 
also willing to contribute to the development of further applications. 
In contrast, all these consumer electronics devices are mostly self-
limiting, because they don't contribute to wealth creation, but instead 
actually distract people from their career and their higher pursuits.

<B>ER</B>: By emphasizing the extent to which people are different, don't you 
run the risk of ignoring how much they are actually the same, that is, 
of ignoring what we might uncharitably call the herd instinct that 
dictates a lot of fashion, a lot of politics, and a lot of life?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think that people are the same in relatively lower-level 
ways, so if you have a medium that appeals chiefly to the way people are 
the same, they're going to gravitate increasingly to prurient interests, 
morbid fears and anxieties, and shocks and sensations. If you do that, 
the whole culture will become depraved--and I think that's what happened 
with the TV--whereas I think that if you appeal to people's special 
curiosities and hobbies and career interests and other ambitions--if you 
appeal to people's first choices rather than their lowest-common-
denominator choices--then the culture gravitates toward excellence 
rather than toward mediocrity, toward distinction rather than prurient 
interest and titillation.

<B>ER</B>: So what becomes of the herd instinct? Does it go away?
GILDER: There will always be certain things that people still want to do 
in large numbers, but in general it's people as individuals or as 
members of homes and families that can cement to more edifying 
disciplines. A mob can just say yes or no, whereas an individual can 
articulate, can express subtle and complex ideas, can respond to art, 
can aspire toward God. 

Rather than encouraging the mass tendencies of the population, we should 
be trying to counteract them and to educate the population. Education is 
a fulfillment of individual distinction and excellence; it shouldn't be 
a pandering to mass taste and appetites. And to the extent that schools 
do try to cater to their students rather than to teach them, the schools 
will fail and will contribute to the general deterioration of learning.

<B>ER</B>: If we think of life before television as the age of the amateur 
(with social life focused on the family piano, on amateur theater 
groups, on sandlot baseball games), and life during television as the 
age of the professional (with social life organized around boob tube 
performances by millionaire actors, comedians, athletes, and 
politicians), how should we think about the quality of life after 
television? Will it help us back to the idyllic past of the amateur? Or 
will it be better than our past as well our present?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think it will be better. I think the culture will take a form 
more resembling the book culture than the TV culture. There are 55,000 
books published in the United States every year. There's a religious 
book market as big as the trade book market, and each of those markets 
amount to about $2.5 billion. There are a huge number of successful 
technical books and career books, and there's a wide diversity of 
literature. I think the book market is a much better reflection of 
American culture than the TV market, which I think is a perversion of 
American culture. 

In general, the interactive media culture will resemble book culture and 
literary culture more than it will the current mass culture. You know, 
the people who produce mass culture are the ultimate elitists. I've 
often debated with them, and they'll say to me, &quot;You don't understand, 
George, the reason that the boob tube is an idiot box is that people 
really are boobs. We've done market research. We know they're boobs.&quot;

 Well, I think they just don't understand the business. Of course, 
confronted with the boob tube, we're all boobs; when I get into a hotel 
room at night and start clicking through channels, I get distracted by 
the shocks and sensations just as anyone else would. The critical fact 
is that a mass medium is no good whatsoever at conveying educated ideas; 
if it happens to convey a sophisticated idea, that's just an accident. 

I think the French were perfectly right in trying to exclude U.S. 
television programs, because for the most part such programs are the 
ultimate realization of mass taste, and they are depraved and 
destructive. They are deeply destructive to American society, 
particularly to any effort to educate anyone in it. And yet the schools 
increasingly try to simulate the TV culture, which is their worst 
betrayal!

<B>ER</B>: Simulate TV culture in what way?

<B>GILDER</B>: By having students read dumb books that seem to be simulations 
of TV sensibility. By avoiding anything difficult. By trying to pander 
to the kids, to entertain them rather than teach them.

<B>ER</B>: Compare two serious approaches to television: PBS and C-SPAN. Some 
people have said that C-SPAN is what public television ought to be. What 
do you think?

<B>GILDER</B>: C-SPAN now exists without the aid of public TV, and PBS works at 
all only because of the garbage that's on all the other channels. Just 
by being explicitly elitist, PBS can shine luminously in the darkness. 
But beyond that, I just don't really believe any of these channels or 
networks have a future. And, particularly, I don't think TV news has any 
future at all. So I believe that although within the existing regime of 
thirty channels or whatever, C-SPAN and PBS are better than the others, 
it's all still a vast wasteland. A channel like C-SPAN will still have a 
place in a world where you have one channel and it's yours, but 
enterprises like PBS and CNN are resources only for a world in which 
there are few channels and no control over them.

<B>ER</B>: Why is there no future for TV news?

<B>GILDER</B>: Because TV news is all governed by the two-minute rule, which 
says that you can't devote more than two minutes to a story unless it's 
a war or something. But the reason for that is not that people have any 
particular desire for two-minute stories; to the contrary, people want 
much more than two minutes on any story that actually interests them.
TV's two-minute rule exists because people will zap any story longer 
than two minutes that doesn't interest them. And so network news is 
guided entirely by that negative constraint, and within the two-minute 
limit, it necessarily has to go for sensational images and crashes and 
fires and murders and whatever. 

News is getting worse and worse that way, and the only reason TV news 
now succeeds is its timeliness and its ability to present video, but 
newspapers will shortly be able to present video and pictures and 
everything else in just as timely a way as television does; moreover, 
the newspaper of the future will be able to give you access to archives 
and to advertisements that actually step you through to the transaction 
itself, a process that requires text.

<B>ER</B>: You've pointed out in Life after Television that some 70 percent of 
the costs of a film go for distribution and advertising, saying, &quot;In 
every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key impact of the 
computer-networking revolution is to collapse the costs of distribution 
and remove the middlemen.&quot; What's the future of the middlemen in 
educational systems? Do you agree with Lew Perelman's thesis in School's 
Out that hyperlearning will replace, rather than merely reform, 
conventional education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Yeah, I agree mostly with Lew. I don't think that things change 
so abruptly as he implies they will, but it's clear that because schools 
are centralized and dominated by these educationist elites, they're 
ineffective in teaching children. And so I think in the same way as the 
computer has tended to break down all existing hierarchies, monopolies, 
pyramids, and power grids of established industrial society, it will 
break down centralized educational institutions as well. There is no 
correlation--period--between spending per student and performance per 
student, adjusted for education and income of parents. But there is a 
very statistically significant negative correlation between the amount 
of bureaucracy per student and the performance of the student. 

So it's clear that the middlemen in education are not merely dead wood, 
they are also a  destructive force, and they actually prevent education. 
It's teachers that are needed, and teachers don't need much supervision. 

The computer essentially replaces vertically organized institutions with 
horizontally organized institutions. It distributes intelligence and 
power rather than concentrates them; it endows teachers with authority 
and responsibility rather than reducing teachers to being instruments of 
some educational bureaucracy. And the reason teachers don't care about 
anything but money as far as their organizations are concerned is that 
the bureaucrats have destroyed the experience of teaching and the 
gratification of teaching. This is why the schools are such perverse 
institutions. As Lew Perelman says, academia is a socialist bureaucracy 
as big as the Soviet government at its height, and it is going to fail 
just about as cataclysmically.

<B>ER</B>: Do your observations apply from top to bottom? Do they also apply to 
higher education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there's greater diversity in higher education--
quite a lot of diversity--and that the schools people think are good are 
mostly bad, and some of the schools people think are bad are in fact 
quite good. For example, I think about 70 percent of the courses at 
Harvard are useless. You know less when you finish than when you 
started. All those endless sociology courses and social science courses 
and social psychology and political science courses, and the endless 
efforts to retrieve some inkling of truth from Marxism!  
You know, it's as though they were still teaching some pre-Copernican 
astronomy--they're really obscurantists in those institutions. It 
reflects the collapse of the elite culture in the United States, but I 
think there are a lot of other cultures out there, and a lot of schools 
that people don't pay attention to are in fact a lot better. Schools 
like Hillsdale, schools like Thomas Aquinas.

There are also schools like CalTech and Harvey Mudd--schools that are 
excellent in science and technology. These are the best schools in the 
country, because the one thing this culture does well is science and 
technology. One of the real jokes is when you find MIT increasingly 
trying to teach students the humanities. I think the humanities as 
taught in existing universities are mostly perverse: Nihilist, 
relativist, feminist, and Marxist. Marxism is just a completely 
worthless mode of study, and yet it's pursued intently at a great many 
elite universities as though there's something still in it.

<B>ER</B>: What would you recommend to a 17-year-old?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there are two possibilities. One is, if such 17-
year-old boys or girls really have their act together, have strong 
convictions, and know what they want to study, then it would be 
interesting to attend one of the elite universities and be kind of a 
counterforce there and create an adversarial culture. Publications like 
the Dartmouth Review, the Salient at Harvard, and the Prospect at 
Princeton are part of a whole series of conservative publications across 
the country that are kinds of centers of resistance and rebellion on 
these corrupt campuses, and that's probably a pretty good education, to 
pursue that course. In general, however, I'd recommend getting a 
technical or scientific education, because I don't think the schools are 
teaching anything else.

<B>ER</B>: Granting that technological advances will have a great impact on the 
general culture, don't you fear that money will have an even greater 
impact? Are cities with thirty trashy radio stations better served than 
towns with only two, and are they not the victims of investors who are 
chasing maximum ad revenues? Have the 55,000 trade books published last 
year in the United States produced a better general culture? Or has the 
culture been affected mainly by the small number of books--and movies 
and television shows--that were hyped into best-seller-dom?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think that America is still the world's leading economy and it 
produces a tremendous amount of art and literature that elude the elite 
media and elite institutions and elite critical vessels. If American 
culture were really summed up by TV culture, there would be no leading 
software company, no world-leading 
scientific/educational enterprise, no globally ascendant computing 
industry. Bioengineering wouldn't be centered in the United States, and 
so forth.

So I really don't think this elite mass culture--and I believe it is 
elitist, contrived by elites to pander to mass prurience and anxiety--
can generate anything worthwhile, and I don't think it does. The actual 
success of the United States does not stem from what the media generally 
treat--in other words, phenomena like the personal computer that are 
incomparably more important than phenomena like Madonna.

<B>ER</B>:  What is the hardest part of your ideas for people to comprehend? 
I'm sure that many of the people in charge of the converging corpses of 
Hollywood, TV, cable, and publishing have read your books or heard you 
speak. Why do you think they can't get the message?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think a lot of them do get the message, and the ones who 
do are actually doing well. The ones who are pursuing the PC incurred 
nothing but upside surprises last year. At the beginning of the year it 
was predicted by Bill Gates and Andy Grove--the world's leading experts 
on the subject--that between 34 and 37 million personal computers would 
be sold in 1993; the actual number turned out to be almost 50 million 
computers--about 30 or 40 percent more than expected. 

And all the people who produce software and peripherals for personal 
computers and personal computer networks prospered. The computer 
industry grew 20 percent or so last year, while consumer electronics was 
stagnant. A lot of people developed CD-ROMs, which were a $5-billion 
business last year, up from virtually nothing a few years ago. 

The cable industry, which I consulted with a lot and which I think I 
influenced a lot, recently launched a wide array of products to connect 
computers over the cable network, and those products are going to be 
very important and valuable. I predict that during the next five years 
or so the computer industry will yield more products for cable companies 
than the TV industry does.

<B>ER</B>: What advice would you give to the president of a college or 
university?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think a kind of organizing principle, such as St. John's Great 
Books Program or St. Thomas Aquinas's orientation toward the Catholic 
worldview, can animate an educational experience, whereas trying to be a 
smorgasbord of secular social theory is going to result in both a bad 
experience for students and failure as an educational institution. 
You've got to be willing to teach some specific thing. You can't adopt 
some relativist posture, because that will mean that fanatics will 
dominate the institution, and most of these institutions are dominated 
by propagandists rather than by teachers.

<B>ER</B>: And what would you advise college and university presidents to do 
with regard to information technology?

<B>GILDER</B>: They should digitize their libraries and make them available 
from student rooms over computer networks. They should in general not 
restrict the resources of the college to the classrooms in it, but reach 
out from their own classrooms to students around the world who want to 
take courses with the excellent teachers available, while at the same 
time allowing the students on campus to reach out around the world. In 
other words, make your educational institution one that summons the best 
from universities everywhere, rather than focusing on the faculty and 
students that happen to be assembled at your particular location.</PRE>

<H1><CENTER>The Dark Fiber Interview with George Gilder </CENTER>
</H1>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Gilder mixes high technology and social politics.
His best-selling book, <I>Wealth and Poverty</I>, practically outlined our
loving embrace of high- tech entrepreneurs in the 1980s. Research for that
book led him deeper into the physics of silicon microchips. He emerged with
<I>Microcosm</I>, a book about how silicon-chip technology causes matter
to &quot;collapse&quot; into a microcosm where the usual economies of scale
are reversed: Small is better. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of decentralized telecommunications prompted his monograph <I>Life
After Television</I>, which is in some ways a warm-up for the book he is
working on now - <I>Telecosm</I> - a study of how the telecomputer will
enhance individual liberty. In this interview with Wired's Executive Editor
Kevin Kelley, Gilder expounds on society's current great work: wiring the
planet. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>KK</B>: Your book, Microcosm, begins with a quote from physicist Carver
Mead, who said, &quot;Listen to technology; find out what it's telling you.&quot;
I was wondering, what is the current technology of modems, packet-switching,
and fiber optics telling you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
GG</B>: It's telling me that today we're at the same general point that
we were with integrated circuits in about 1970. In 1970, people didn't anticipate
that transistors would be virtually free by today. Today you can buy a transistor
for 4,000-millionths of a cent. I think the same thing is on its way in
fiber optics. We're going to gain access to the 25,000 gigahertz of capacity
that's in each of the three windows in infrared spectrum that work with
fiber optics. With 25,000 gigahertz, you get the equivalent to the number
of phone calls in America during the peak moment on Mother's Day. Or take
all the radio spectrum currently used for communications, from AM radio
to KU-band satellite. It's 1,000 times that, on one thread of glass the
width of a human hair. I don't think people have come to terms with what
fiber really means. You can simulate any kind of switching configuration
you want. All of a sudden this huge apparatus of electronic switching that
dominates our current communications becomes unnecessary. Suddenly, you're
going to find that just as the integrated circuit rendered transistors -
and hence mips and bits - virtually free, fiber optics is going to render
bandwidth and hertz virtually free. This world is quite different from the
world that assumes bandwidth scarcity. A dearth of spectrum has to be regulated
and parceled out carefully by sensitive federal bureaucrats beset by tens
of thousands of lawyers. That whole apparatus, both the technology of it
- the huge switching fabric of the phone companies - and the legislative
apparatus and all its bureaucracies and legal accessories, are going to
be rendered almost worthless over the next ten years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Every time I hear the phrase &quot;virtually free&quot; I think
of the claim about nuclear power: &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot; It's almost
utopian. I find myself not believing it, as much as I want to go along with
the idea. Am I too skeptical? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yep. It's just that when things become free you ignore them.
Transistors that used to be seven bucks apiece now cost about a millionth
of a cent. That means that you can regard them as insignificant, just as
they're becoming ubiquitous and thus determining the whole atmosphere of
enterprise. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, you could say that aluminum - by the atom - has become
virtually free, but that doesn't mean aluminum in any useful amount is free.
As long as we have storage devices, we'll find things to fill them up with,
so there will always be a demand for more. That means no matter how cheap
storage becomes, it won't be free. It seems to me that the appetite for
bandwidth is equally insatiable, so people will always want more than they
have. It has to cost something. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Of course it will. The point is that in every industrial revolution,
some key factor of production is drastically reduced in cost. Relative to
the pervious cost to achieve that function, the new factor is virtually
free compared to its expense when it derived from animal muscle power and
human muscle power. Suddenly you could do things you could not afford to
do before. You could make a factory work 24 hours a day churning out products
in a way that was just incomprehensible before the industrial era. It really
did mean that physical force became virtually free in a sense. The whole
economy had to reorganize itself to exploit this physical force. You had
to &quot;waste&quot; the power of the steam engine and its derivatives in
order to prevail, whether in war or in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last 30 years, we've seen transistors (or switching power) move
from being expensive, crafted vacuum tubes to being virtually free. So today,
the prime rule of thrift in business is &quot;waste transistors.&quot; We
&quot;waste&quot; them to correct our spelling to play solitaire, to do
anything. As a matter of fact, you've got to waste transistors in order
to succeed in business these days. My thesis is that bandwidth is going
to be virtually free in the next era in the same way that transistors are
in this era. It doesn't mean there won't be expensive technologies associated
with the exploitation of bandwidth - just as there are expensive computers
employing transistors; but it does mean that people will have to use this
bandwidth, they'll have to waste bandwidth rather than economize on bandwidth.
The wasters of bandwidth will win rather than the people who are developing
exquisite new compression tools and all these other devices designed to
exploit some limited bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
One of the key ways you economize on bandwidth is switching. Switching has
been the whole foundation of our communications systems. You run narrow-band
wires to some switch and then switch the data to its destination in order
to avoid using lots of bandwidth to broadcast signals to every terminal.
It seems to me that we're going to start using fiber the way we currently
address air. Instead of switching, we'll broadcast on fiber optic. We'll
be tuning in rather than processing all the bits. And instead of using a
lot of switching intelligence in order to economize on bandwidth, we're
going to use bandwidth in order to economize on intelligence. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Okay. In a world where physical force, switching, and computation
are almost free, we now add almost-free bandwidth. What becomes expensive?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The scarce resource is the human mind. People will be more valuable.
People will get paid better. We need people to provide the software, the
interfaces, the standards, and the protocols to all these systems that make
it possible to exploit these increasingly cheap resources. So it's the human
mind that you ultimately have to economize on. That's the reason I think
it's utter garbage to say that our grandchildren won't live as well as we
do. People who say this just don't see the technology. They live in this
bizarre world of thermodynamics, where entropy rules, and we're dominated
by our waste products. it is very short-sighted. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: It take it then that as a believer in the human mind as sort
of the ultimate repository of wealth and power, that you're not a believer
in artificial intelligence as an attainable thing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Artificial intelligence is obviously attainable, it just won't
be human intelligence. It's a different function. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Do you think there's a downside to having everything connected
to everything else? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I don't see any. There must be a downside to the telephone, but
I can't remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, when you're in the middle of supper and some solicitor
is calling you, you'll probably remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, that's the downside. But that's the downside all this stuff
overcomes. When you can have intelligence in you telephone it can defer
the calls you don't want to voice mail and still take emergency calls. It
can be adapted to your needs. So, the chief effect of these technologies
is to put you in command again. The trouble with top-down centralized technologies,
which the telephone and television represent, is that they're dumb equipment
attached to complex switching systems and broadcasting technologies. On
the other hand, the chief virtue of distributed intelligence is that the
network can be dumb and the control of it can be distributed to smart users.
That means that technologies are much more servants than rulers of your
life. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: When I look at networks I see counter-intuitive behavior. Distributed
networks have a remarkable ability to be slightly out of anyone's control.
They possess an organic out-of-control quality. Does that concern you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I think it's good. The Internet, for instance, is an exciting
kind of metaphor for spontaneous order. It shows that in order to have a
very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control.
When there's a lot of intelligence at the fringes everywhere, the actual
network itself can be fairly simple. The future is dumb networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Dumb networks? Why not smart networks? We put smartness into
everything else. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There's smartness all around the network, but the actual network
should be essentially dumb glass. The fiberspace, as I call it. I think
the mistake that the phone companies sometimes make is to think that they
can keep up with the computer. What they call &quot;network intelligence&quot;
will usually appear as a bottleneck to a computer industry that's rapidly
rushing forward into new possibilities. So what you really want is dumb
networks where all intelligence is on the fringes. You'll have intelligent
devices of various sorts that are easily reachable from the network but
aren't part of the actual fabric of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What is the fabric of the network? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Photons. Electronics are not good for communications. Photons
- optical computing - are. What makes photons so great for communication
is they don't interfere with each other. They collide and pass on unaffected.
You can send them two-way, and they are not subject to electromagnetic disruption.
Many signals can flow through one fiber. But the fact that photons don't
affect each other means they are cumbersome for computing, since you want
interactions in computing. You need to have the charges affect one another
- that's the heart of computing. The heart of the transistor function is
that you can control a bigger force with a smaller force. But photons don't
control each other. So for computing functions I still think that electronics
will prevail; but for communications, photonics will prevail. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: One would think that there is wealth to be made in the interface
then between photons and electrons. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, there is. Opto-electronics is very important. However,
opto- electronics should not be in the middle of the network, it should
be one the edges of the network where it links the computing functions to
the communications functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There are some advocates who claim that we can get a lot of what
we want in fiber optic by using the existing copper wires beefed up with
the ISDN communication protocol. Do you go along with the idea of implementing
(and paying for ) ISDN right now? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yes. The phone companies should do ISDN. We might as well get
as much out of the existing copper switch system as we can. ISDN is already
installed in all the new switches; it's more a matter of getting the tariffs
right so they can charge some reasonable amount for it is use. There's no
excuse not to do ISDN today. It won't detract from the fibersphere. But
while they do ISDN, all-optical networks are going to be launched all over
the place by different companies. Some people have this vision that either
we devote our resources to ISDN, or we devote them to creating this fabulously
expensive fiber network. My belief is that fiber network is going to get
rapidly cheaper, so that we're going to be able to do both it and ISDN perfectly
well. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What role do you think the US government should play in laying
data highways? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The role for the US government is to make government as efficient
as possible. Government operates leviathan laboratories, hospitals, universities,
bureaucracies, and post offices, and they all should be interconnected with
fiber. The government always discovers technology after its moment is passing.
If you're a winner, you don't go to the government. You're too busy. You've
got too many customers. It's the people with no customers who end up besieging
the government. There are all these wise-asses in Washington who really
think that they can choose technologies. They think they know better. They
get bowled over by every earnest representative of IBM who comes up to talk
to them. <BR>
<BR>
Just now the US government thinks that HDTV is absolutely the future of
the world because all the old farts at Zenith, and the broadcasting moguls
who aren't really making it with the new computer technologies, are converging
on Washington. it's always going to be that way. It's not going to change
with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out
like poodles. The politician is always the dogs best friend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There is a myth, a utopian hope, that all these electronic connections
(what I call the &quot;advent of the net&quot;) are going to eliminate hierarchy.
The belief is that we will come into a peer world, where everything is on
a peer-to- peer level. All the experimental work that I have seen shows
that that's probably not very likely. On the contrary, anything complex
self-organizes into nested hierarchies, just in order to manage itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Right. The complexity of digital systems requires a hierarchical
organization. It's the only way to deal with the kind of combinatorial explosions
that attend interlinking of billions of nodes, all functioning in parallel.
You need nested hierarchies, but the real miracle of micro- electronics
is that these extraordinarily complex hierarchies can be incorporated into
individual silicon chips, with virtual supercomputer power capabilities.
This fabulous supercomputer power can be ubiquitously distributed, which
renders them an egalitarian force. <BR>
<BR>
When everybody commands a supercomputer, you give the average owner of a
work station the power that an industrial tycoon commanded in the industrial
era, or that a TV station owner commands in the age of broadcasting. In
other words, the hierarchy is in the silicon rather than in the human organization.
So you have this incredible distribution of power. This is a period of transition
that resembles the transition between railroads and automobiles. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: How's that? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: When you ride a train you go to the railway station at a scheduled
time, you travel with the people that happen to be on the train, you go
to preset destinations. This is what the current television world is like.
You tune into the stations that have been prescribed through some collaboration
between advertisers and TV executives in New York and Hollywood. Moving
from broadcast model to the teleputer is like moving from a railroad model
to automobiles. Automobiles are essentially egalitarian transportation systems.
They aren't organized - like the Internet. A Ferrari, say, and a Toyota
Tercel look like radically different machines, but the fact is that any
car endows the average person with more freedom than any railroad. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: You are a tireless champion of small business. For the last 20
years or so, really big projects have been considered arrogant, incapable
of working because they are big. Now there is talk of Motorola's global
satellite project Iridium. Do you think that the fibersphere gives us permission
to think big again. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There are going to be a lot of big fiber projects in the next
decade. They're already coming right now. I'm sort of worried that they're
going to think too small. I hope that the government, with its National
Research and Education Network (NREN) doesn't end up buying a lot of obsolescent
telephone company fiber systems that make networks with a total power of
a gigabit rather than a gigabit per terminal. The fibersphere is a big project,
and it will take scores of thousands of small companies to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What about big companies? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Sure. Laboratories where lots of people work on their own special
visions, with the luxury of very long-term goals, are very valuable. Such
places are usually supported by relatively big companies and consortia of
companies. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Bell Labs developed most of the component
for all optical networks. When you're producing millions of something it
becomes a commodity, and almost by definition you have a big company. MS-DOS
and Windows are commodity products, so Microsoft is a big company. <BR>
<BR>
There are cycles in which companies get big exploiting commodity products
with wide distribution, which then mature and then are displaced by new
products. It's relatively rare that the company that's triumphant in the
commodity phase. Insurrections are ordinarily led by entrepreneurs. I don't
see any likelihood that will change anytime soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What else is the technology telling you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: What the technology tells me is that, among other things, Clinton's
going to get a bonanza. He doesn't know what's coming, but technology's
just going to be breaking out all over. Bush did virtually everything that
Clinton promises to do, and because Bush has done it already it doesn't
leave Clinton much room except to play cock-a-doodle-do. He'll get up on
the post and crow as the marvelous sunrise technologies come blindingly
to the fore during his administration. They're going to have 50,000 technology
programs and behold, a million technologies will bloom and they will take
credit for it all. <BR>

</H2>
Once upon a time in a distant mountainous land there was a young and beautiful
princess who loved to wander in the woods. The forest was deep below the
snowcapped peaks and the valleys were quiet and safe. She could go freely
without care or fear. She could saunter along the trails that took local
merchants and messengers toward the passes to neighboring lands and brought
them back laden with news and commerce. She could watch for birds radiant
among the leaves and sometimes glimpse a deer dancing through the brush.
In summer she could swim in the brooks that hurtled down the mountains and
gathered in pools in the crevices. She was carefree and gay, at ease with
nature and the world.<BR>
<BR>
Then one year trouble struck this halcyon land. A barbarian moved into a
cave somewhere in the woods and began to prey on the merchants and messengers
making their way through the mountain passes. Although groups of young men
formed posses to pursue him, he was so strong and swift and so resourceful
in the ways of the woods and canyons that no one could catch him. Commerce
slowed and the kingdom grew steadily poorer. Merchants could travel only
in large groups protected by warriors. The king and queen bade the princess
to halt her wanderings and stay in the castle night and day. Someday, they
said, she would be queen, but until then she would have to learn the ways
of the palace. She pined for her dark and secret places among the trees,
but she did not disobey.<BR>
<BR>
One night, however, her sleep was beset with dreams of serpents. She woke
in fear as shadowy shapes lurched on her walls and sinister sounds whirred
outside her window. She went to the sill, parted the curtains, and gasped
at the wild beauty beyond. Through the trees, waving their arms in the night
winds and glistening in the moonlight, she could see deep into the forest
that she longed to explore. She yearned to run along the sylvan paths and
feel the pine needles under her bare feet and the breezes against her face
and in her hair. She longed to spy on the creatures of the night. Surely,
no one would notice or care if she should steal down the stone stairs and
step out on the moonlit path.<BR>
<BR>
As it happened, that same evening the barbarian, also restless in the night
season, set forth into the lunar darkness down the path that led toward
the castle. He walked quietly, like a cat slinking through the woods, until,
startled by the sound of steps, he slid behind a huge oak. At first he thought
he had heard some animal and raised his club. Then he sensed a human rhythm
in the paces and steeled himself for a robbery. When the princess finally
came into view, he gasped at the sight of her- -a beautiful girl garbed
only in a silken gown--gliding barefoot along the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Never before had a vision moved him so powerfully. The luminous night and
the woman alone, the shape and the shadows, reached in beyond his bearded
face and bristling chest and touched his sinuous heart. He stepped forward
and asked her if he might walk with her a while. She screamed and fled.
He pursued her, caught her, and pulled her to the ground, ripping her gown.
Then he seized her flailing arms and shook her to silence.<BR>
<BR>
Soon, however, he sensed that he wanted less to overpower than to please
her. Entranced by the wonders of her strong young body, he pleaded with
her to stop struggling--he meant her no harm. She told him to go ahead and
kill her if he wanted her, but to do it quickly and mercifully. He insisted
he had no desire to have her dead. He wanted her alive; he wished to hold
her body against his in the night. She said she would die first.<BR>
<BR>
He then changed his approach and asked her again if she would walk with
him for a while in the woods. She consented; it was a way to gain release
from his grasp. But as they strolled along, his gruff voice softened. With
quiet authority he described his life in the woods among the fierce animals
that threatened his survival and that he sometimes had to kill to escape.
She listened and marveled as he told her fantastic tales of the barbarian
life. She had never before heard of the struggle for life in the wilds beyond
the castle walls. They walked together until the glow of dawn shocked her
to her senses and she said she had to run back to the castle. The great
barbarian slumped in helpless anguish. She assured him she would be back
the next week to learn more. But to the barbarian, a week seemed an eternity.<BR>
<BR>
The next week she once more sneaked away from her bed after midnight and
walked in the woods with the barbarian. When the sun rose he lunged for
her, and she delicately slipped aside, saying she would be back again in
another seven days. The next week they once again walked and talked for
hours in the night. Finally he asked her to come back to see the etchings
on the walls of his cave.<BR>
<BR>
She said no, she would never go back to his lair until he halted his attacks
upon the merchants and messengers of the realm. He said robbery was his
way of life; all men robbed in one way or another; the king's entire territory
had been stolen from the barbarian's forebears, the natives of the land.
She told him severely that he had better find another way of living if he
expected her ever to visit him in his cave. He should make a clearing, build
a cabin, and grow a garden in the woods. He could collect nuts and berries
and hunt small game. With all his knowledge of the wilderness he could live
well, and she would come weekly to hear his tales of the night wood.<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian was heartbroken. The idea of a different life frightened and
repelled him. He was a nomadic predator, born to run in the forest and prey
on the weak. But finally he saw that he had no choice. To avoid losing the
princess, he recognized at last that he would have to give up the barbarian
life and get to work. And so he did. By the time he met her seven days hence,
he had cleared a large space among the trees. Within six months he had planted
a garden and built a cabin.<BR>
<BR>
During that time no robberies were reported on the road. Commerce with neighboring
kingdoms expanded rapidly as travel grew safer and merchants could go through
the mountain passes without an expensive guard of young warriors. With the
country growing richer, the barbarian did well selling wood and nuts to
the people. At last one day, after showing her his trove of produce, his
cabin enlarged with an octagonal wing, and his large gardens and herds of
goats, he asked the princess to marry him. Joyfully she said yes and brought
him back to the castle to meet her father and mother, the king and queen.<BR>
<BR>
At first the king declared that the barbarian's background made him entirely
unsuitable to be the mate of his precious daughter. But the queen replied
with a smile that he too had been something of a barbarian in his day and
he had to confess that this was true. The barbarian was certainly a refreshing
change from the unctuous courtiers who had previously pursued the princess.
The king and queen soon welcomed the youth as a strong and resourceful husband
for their daughter and an asset to the realm.<BR>
<BR>
The wedding brought a huge celebration throughout the kingdom. After a nostalgic
honeymoon in the cabin in the woods, the couple moved into the castle. Freed
from the ravages of the barbarian, the land continued to prosper. After
the princess's parents died, the barbarian himself became king and expanded
his domains deep into the mountains and the forest. In the course of time
the new queen bore a daughter and the daughter too grew into a beautiful
young princess, who, like her mother, hearkened to the call of the wild.<BR>
<BR>
As the realm grew ever richer, the king and queen invited famous wise men
from a neighboring kingdom to entertain at court. These men told of seductive
new ideas. They chilled the king and queen with tales of the death of God
and the eclipse of law, and excited them with accounts of the joys of libertine
sex. They brought books and art celebrating the new freedoms that followed
the breakdown of traditional morality and religion. They told of a city
called New York where everything indeed was new and free.<BR>
<BR>
The young princess listened avidly. Poring over the books, she learned of
the powers that princesses held in other nations. She learned to disdain
the stodgy, hardworking life of her parents' kingdom and to long for a land
where happiness was the only goal. As time passed these ideas gnawed at
her nocturnal thoughts. Like her mother she found her sleep disturbed by
serpentine dreams, and she would walk in the woods to quell the disquieting
desires that flooded her young body.<BR>
<BR>
Then a crisis struck the country. Another barbarian--as young and strong,
ruthless and resourceful as his predecessor--moved into the forest and began
preying on the commerce between the kingdom and the neighboring realm. Once
again the land became poor, and this princess too was forbidden to walk
in the woods. The princess, however, rebelled against her parents and continued
her excursions.<BR>
<BR>
One night she found herself suddenly confronted by the young barbarian.
She was even more beautiful than her mother, and the barbarian surged with
admiration and desire. He asked her if she minded if he walked with her
for a while. Deeply bored by her life in the castle, she agreed. They sauntered
along the path discussing the flaws of the king and the oppressive rules
within the walls. Shortly he put his arm around her shoulders and she pulled
away and said please, not yet. He asked her if she would return with him
to see the etchings in his cave. She suggested they first walk longer and
get to know one another better. But eventually they visited his cave together.
When she left at dawn, she promised to return the next week. &quot;Wow,&quot;
she exclaimed, &quot;you're good!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the next several months she visited with the barbarian every week and
they reveled in the cave. Then one day, a king arrived from the progressive
country of the wise men to visit with the father of the princess. This foreign
king was the most charming and cosmopolitan man the princess had ever seen.
He told her of the great riches and romantic forests of his land, of the
advanced universities and museums, of the flourishing commerce and art.
And after everyone went to bed, there was a knock on the door of the princess's
chamber.<BR>
<BR>
The princess opened the door and saw the foreign king outside, garbed in
a robe of purple velour. He asked to come in. He stayed until dawn, and
as the morning light suffused the room, along with the royal aroma of his
Paco Rabanne, he asked her to return with him to his kingdom. He would divorce
his queen and marry her. They had &quot;drifted apart,&quot; he said, and
his marriage &quot;was no longer a growthful experience.&quot; His wife
needed &quot;more space,&quot; and in his progressive views and liberated
lifestyle, he discovered he had far more in common with youth than with
his own generation. The princess agreed joyfully. Banishing the barbarian
in the woods from her thoughts, she returned the next day with the king
to her new land.<BR>
<BR>
Each week the barbarian waited in the forest for his princess. But she never
came. After a while he gave up waiting and angrily escalated his attacks
on the commerce between the two nations. As time passed, the mood of license
fostered by the wise men induced many young men to join the barbarian in
the woods. The nation fell into ruin and the forest became a jungle, ruled
by barbarians, where no princess ever dared to tread.

But beginning in parochial school I was taught that He could use  natural processes to produce life. Contrary to conventional wisdom, religion  has made room for science for a long time. But as biology uncovers startling  complexity in life, the question becomes, can science make room for religion?  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In his statement, the Pope was careful to point out that  it is better to talk about &quot;theories of evolution&quot; rather than  a single theory. The distinction is crucial. Indeed, until I completed  my doctoral studies in biochemistry, I believed that Darwin's mechanism  -- random mutation paired with natural selection -- was the correct explanation  for the diversity of life. Yet I now find that theory incomplete. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, the complex design of the cell has provoked me  to stake out a distinctly minority view among scientists on the question  of what caused evolution. I believe that Darwin's mechanism for evolution  doesn't explain much of what is seen under a microscope. Cells are simply  too complex to have evolved randomly; intelligence was required to produce  them. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I want to be explicit about what I am, and am not, questioning.  The word &quot;evolution&quot; carries many associations. Usually it means  common descent -- the idea that all organisms living and dead are related  by common ancestry. I have no quarrel with the idea of common descent,  and continue to think it explains similarities among species. By itself,  however, common descent doesn't explain the vast differences among species.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's where Darwin's mechanism comes in. &quot;Evolution&quot;  also sometimes implies that random mutation and natural selection powered  the changes in life. The idea is that just by chance an animal was born  that was slightly faster or stronger than its siblings. Its descendants  inherited the change and eventually won the contest of survival over the  descendants of other members of the species. Over time, repetition of the  process resulted in great changes -- and, indeed, wholly different animals.    That's the theory. A practical difficulty, however, is that one can't  test the theory from fossils. To really test the theory, one has to observe  contemporary change in the wild, in the laboratory or at least reconstruct  a detailed pathway that might have led to a certain adaptation. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwinian theory successfully accounts for a variety of  modern changes. Scientists have shown that the average beak size of Galapagos  finches changed in response to altered weather patterns. Likewise, the  ratio of dark- to light-colored moths in England shifted when pollution  made light-colored moths more visible to predators. Mutant bacteria survive  when they become resistant to antibiotics. These are all clear examples  of natural selection in action. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>But these examples involve only one or a few mutations,  and the mutant organism is not much different from its ancestor. Yet to  account for all of life, a series of mutations would have to produce very  different types of creatures. That has not yet been demonstrated. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwin's theory encounters its greatest difficulties when  it comes to explaining the development of the cell. Many cellular systems  are what I term &quot;irreducibly complex.&quot; That means the system  needs several components before it can work properly. An everyday example  of irreducible complexity is a mousetrap, built of several pieces (platform,  hammer, spring and so on). Such a system probably cannot be put together  in a Darwinian manner, gradually improving its function. You can't catch  a mouse with just the platform and then catch a few more by adding the  spring. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>All the pieces have to be in place before you catch any  mice. An example of an irreducibly complex cellular system is the bacterial  flagellum: a rotary propeller, powered by a flow of acid, that bacteria  use to swim. The flagellum requires a number of parts before it works --  a rotor, stator and motor. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that about 40  different kinds of proteins are needed to produce a working flagellum.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The intracellular transport system is also quite complex.  Plant and animal cells are divided into many discrete compartments; supplies,  including enzymes and proteins, have to be shipped between these compartments.  Some supplies are packaged into molecular trucks, and each truck has a  key that will fit only the lock of its particular cellular destination.  Other proteins act as loading docks, opening the truck and letting the  contents into the destination compartment. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many other examples could be cited. The bottom line is  that the cell -- the very basis of life -- is staggeringly complex. But  doesn't science already have answers, or partial answers, for how these  systems originated? No. As James Shapiro, a biochemist at the University  of Chicago, wrote, &quot;There are no detailed Darwinian accounts for the  evolution of any fundamental biochemical or cellular system, only a variety  of wishful speculations.&quot;   A few scientists have suggested non-Darwinian  theories to account for the cell, but I don't find them persuasive. Instead,  I think that the complex systems were designed - purposely arranged by  an intelligent agent. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whenever we see interactive systems (such as a mousetrap)  in the everyday world, we assume that they are the products of intelligent  activity. We should extend the reasoning to cellular systems. We know of  no other mechanism, including Darwin's, which produces such complexity.  Only intelligence does. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, I could be proved wrong. If someone demonstrated  that, say, a type of bacteria without a flagellum could gradually produce  such a system, or produce any new, comparably complex structure, my idea  would be neatly disproved. But I don't expect that to happen. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Intelligent design may mean that the ultimate explanation  for life is beyond scientific explanation. That assessment is premature.  But even if it is true, I would not be troubled. I don't want the best  scientific explanation for the origins of life; I want the correct explanation.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pope John Paul II spoke of &quot;theories of evolution.&quot;  Right now it looks as if one of those theories involves intelligent design.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Michael Behe is a Professor  at Lehigh University and the author of the critically acclaimed <I>Darwin's  Black Box</I>.</FONT></B></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

<H3>A Review of Michael Behe's <I>Darwin's Black Box</I><BR>
(The Free Press, 1996, 307 pages, $25)<BR>
<I>By Nancy Pearcy</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM">&quot;When light strikes the retina, a photon is absorbed by a
molecule<BR>
called cis-retinal, which causes it to change to trans-retinal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Such scientific jargon was unfamiliar terrain for a Washington, D.C., think<BR>
tank, and the audience grew hushed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The change in retinal forces a corresponding change in the protein<BR>
rhodopsin, which allows it to interact with another protein called<BR>
transducin.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Glances shot around the room, as members of the audience furtively sought
out<BR>
others who were equally mystified.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transducin dissociates from a small molecule called GDP and binds<BR>
to a different molecule called GTP, and this complex binds to a<BR>
protein called phosphodiesterase. . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For several minutes the polysyllabic mysteries piled up, until finally<BR>
embarrassed laughter broke out. But <A HREF="behe.html">Michael Behe</A>
had made his point: Speaking<BR>
to a group of educated non scientists, he had walked them through the complex<BR>
molecular interactions required for vision in way they will never forget.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's book <I>Darwin's Black Box</I> does the same thing for readers, painting
a<BR>
vivid picture of the cell's complexity. But his purpose is not simply to
give a<BR>
charming exposition of popular science, it is to challenge the Darwinist<BR>
hegemony in biology. Behe's thesis is that life depends on a host of molecular<BR>
systems that are irreducibly complex, a phrase he coins to mean that such<BR>
systems consist of several interlocking parts that must be in place before
they<BR>
can function. And since Darwinian processes kick in only _after_ there is<BR>
minimal function, the origin of an irreducibly complex system is out of
reach of<BR>
standard Darwinian explanations.<BR>
<BR>
As an analogy, Behe invokes the humble mousetrap: You can not start with
a<BR>
wooden platform and catch a few mice, add a spring and catch a few more
mice,<BR>
add a hammer, and so on, with gradual improvement of function. To function
at<BR>
all, a mousetrap requires a minimum number of interacting parts assembled
from<BR>
the outset. By the same token, an irreducibly complex organic system like<BR>
vision must come together all at once. It cannot appear gradually, piece
by<BR>
piece.<BR>
<BR>
But the heart of Darwinism is precisely such a gradualist scenario. Darwin<BR>
obligingly offered a way to falsify his own theory, writing: &quot;If it
could be<BR>
demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have
been<BR>
formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely<BR>
break down.&quot; Behe's point is that the cell is chock full of molecular
systems<BR>
that could not possibly have formed by successive, slight modifications.
Ergo,<BR>
Darwinism has broken down.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair to Darwin, he proposed his theory when scientists knew next to<BR>
nothing about biochemistry. Living things were &quot;black boxes,&quot;
their inside<BR>
workings a mystery. The cell itself was thought to be nothing more than
a blob<BR>
of jelly like protoplasm. It was easy to draw large scale scenarios about
fins<BR>
gradually turning into legs, or legs into wings, since no one had a clue
how<BR>
limbs and organs work from the inside. As Behe writes, it's as though someone<BR>
asked how a stereo system is made and we answered, &quot;by plugging a set
of<BR>
speakers into an amplifier and adding a CD player, radio receiver, and tape<BR>
deck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Today that kind of answer won't cut it, Behe insists. The &quot;black box&quot;
of the<BR>
cell has been opened and biologists are intimately familiar with its inside<BR>
workings--its nuts and bolts. Any successful explanation of the origin of<BR>
living things must deal with molecular systems.<BR>
<BR>
Consider the origin of vision, a problem Darwin said made him shudder. Richard<BR>
Dawkins, a contemporary Darwinist, brushes it off as no problem whatsoever:
We<BR>
merely begin with a light sensitive spot, Dawkins writes, move to a group
of<BR>
cells cupped to focus light better, and continue through a graded series
of<BR>
infinitesimal improvements to a true lens.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence is quite persuasive on the surface. But what about _under_
the<BR>
surface? To function, Behe argues, even Dawkins's initial light sensitive
spot<BR>
requires a cascade of factors, starting with cis-retinal and rhodopsin.
About<BR>
these complex molecular systems Dawkins is silent. As for those cupped cells,<BR>
dozens of proteins are involved in controlling shape and structure. About
these<BR>
complex proteins Dawkins says nary a word. It's the old strategy of telling
us<BR>
that stereos are made by plugging in speakers and a CD player.<BR>
<BR>
What we really want to know is whether Darwinism can explain how the speakers<BR>
and CD players themselves were assembled. Behe argues that it cannot, and<BR>
offers two types of arguments. On one hand, Behe has combed the scientific<BR>
literature and announces that there are virtually no professional papers<BR>
proposing detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of complex molecular<BR>
structures. Explanations simply do not exist.<BR>
<BR>
And the reason they are non-existent, Behe says, delivering his second punch,
is<BR>
that a Darwinian explanation of an irreducibly complex system is logically<BR>
impossible. At the heart of the book are five chapters that drive the point<BR>
home by describing different types of irreducible complexity. Some systems<BR>
consist of interdependent parts that must be assembled all at once, like
a<BR>
mousetrap. An example is the hair-like cilium, which functions like an oar
and<BR>
requires the interplay of more than 200 different proteins. Other systems
are<BR>
sequential, like a Rube Goldberg machine. An example is the blood-clotting<BR>
mechanism, in which numerous steps are exquisitely timed by a series of<BR>
catalysts to ensure that blood clots at the site of a wound and at no other<BR>
place or time. Still other systems depend on delicate recognition signals.<BR>
Certain molecules in the cell act as transport vessels that must recognize
the<BR>
right &quot;pick-up&quot; and &quot;drop-off&quot; zones, as well as the
right materials to carry.<BR>
<BR>
These examples are described in lively prose, sprinkled with vivid<BR>
illustrations. Any reader who follows Behe's descriptions will find it<BR>
difficult not to agree that the complexity of these molecular systems is
indeed<BR>
irreducible--that they could not arise by any step-by-step, Darwinian process.<BR>
<BR>
What alternative does Behe offer? Intelligent design theory. Structures
that<BR>
consist of interacting, co-adapted parts, he argues, are evidence of a<BR>
purposeful, intelligent agent. At this point, many readers may balk, objecting<BR>
that science is not equipped to deal with anything outside nature. To which<BR>
Behe replies: Catch up with the late-twentieth century. It was sixty years
ago<BR>
that the Big Bang theory was proposed, and cosmologists had to confront
the idea<BR>
of an ultimate origin of the universe--no matter how philosophically &quot;repugnant&quot;<BR>
(Eddington's word) they found that idea because of its implication of a
personal<BR>
creator. Now it is biology's turn to recognize that its data may likewise
have<BR>
discomfiting implications.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe is careful to limit his own discussion to the data itself. Thus
he<BR>
denies that from design we can infer the existence of the Christian God.
All we<BR>
can say is that a natural object exhibits the characteristics of intelligent<BR>
manufacture. In Behe's words, &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have<BR>
a candidate for the role of designer.&quot; We might select a candidate
based on<BR>
philosophical or theological grounds but not on scientific grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's tight focus on scientific data means he treats historical and<BR>
philosophical issues only gingerly. Except for brief (though illuminating)<BR>
discussions of Paley and Socrates, we hear little about the history of the<BR>
concept of design. Apart from a quotation from St. George Mivart, we learn
next<BR>
to nothing about the history of the Darwinian controversy. No mention is
made<BR>
of Georges Cuvier, who in the nineteenth century developed a similar notion
of<BR>
irreducible complexity (calling it &quot;the correlation of parts&quot;).
Nor is any<BR>
acknowledgement made of contemporary proponents of design theory, such as<BR>
Michael Denton (_Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_) or Thaxton, Bradley, and
Olsen<BR>
(_The Mystery of Life's Origin_).<BR>
<BR>
This narrow lens may be frustrating to some readers, but adopting it was<BR>
probably good strategy. Behe is an associate professor of biochemistry at<BR>
Lehigh University, and he stays squarely within his own field of expertise.
He<BR>
crafts one basic argument, and crafts it well.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, a few points may leave readers puzzled. Is Behe acreationist?
He<BR>
explicitly eschews the term. Though a Roman Catholic, he accepted Darwinism
for<BR>
many years without sensing any contradiction with his faith, and still accepts<BR>
common descent. The conclusion of design is drawn from the data itself,
he<BR>
insists, and &quot;not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs.&quot; It
is significant<BR>
that his book came out from a major New York publisher, not a religious<BR>
publishing house.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe may protest a bit too much. He rejects the label creationist only
by<BR>
narrowly restricting the term to those who accept a young earth and flood<BR>
geology--disqualifying a host of people who describe themselves as creationists<BR>
but do not hold to those geological theories. Similarly, Behe accepts common<BR>
descent only by giving _that_ term a highly atypical definition. His idea
is<BR>
that an original one-celled organism contained the information for all<BR>
subsequent biological development, which advanced through multiple, coordinated<BR>
changes in sudden, large leaps (akin to Goldschmidt's &quot;hopeful monster&quot;
theory<BR>
except that the monsters appear not by luck but through the unfolding of
an<BR>
implicit design).<BR>
<BR>
It might have been better if Behe had simply said, Sure, I accept creation,
and<BR>
it's time to stretch that category to acknowledge that creationists come
in many<BR>
stripes. Be that as it may, Behe's book is a powerful contribution to the<BR>
literature on the Darwin controversy. The black box has been opened.<BR>
Biologists had better get ready to face the implications of what they find<BR>
there.

<FONT SIZE=2>Biological origins can be one of the most captivating subjects
in the curriculum. As a biology teacher, you have probably already seen
how the topic excites your students. The allure of dinosaurs, trilobites,
fossilized plants, and ancient human remains is virtually irresistable to
many students. Indeed, many prominent scientists owe their interest in science
to an early exposure to this topic.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The subject of origins, however, is not only captivating. It's
also controversial. Because it touches on questions of enduring significance,
this topic has long been a focal point for vigorous debate &shyp;&shyp;legal
and political, as well as intellectual. Teachers often find themselves walking
a tightrope, trying to teach good science, while avoiding the censure of
parents or administrators.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To complicate things, the cultural conflict has been compounded
by controversies within the scientific community itself. Since the 1970s,
for example, scientific criticisms of the long&shyp;dominant neo&shyp;Darwinian
theory of evolution (which combines classical Darwinism with Mendelian genetics),
have surfaced with increasing regularity.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
fact, the situation is such that paleontologist Niles Eldredge was driven
to remark:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually
marks periods of healthy growth in science, then evolutionary biology is
flourishing today as it seldom has in the past. For biologists are collectively
less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a
scant decade ago.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, many scientists have advocated fundamental revisions
of orthodox evolutionary theory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, the standard models explaining chemical evolution&shyp;&shyp;the
origin of the first living cell&shyp;&shyp;have taken severe scientific
criticism. These criticisms have sparked calls for a radically different
approach to explaining the origin of life on earth.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Though many defenders of the orthodox theories remain, some
observers now describe these theories as having entered paradigm breakdown&shyp;&shyp;a
state where a once&shyp;dominant theory can no longer explain many important
data. Science historians Earthy and Collingwood, for example, have described
neo&shyp;Darwinism as a paradigm that's lost its capacity to solve important
scientific problems. They note that both defenders and critics find it hard
to agree even about what data are relevant to deciding scientific disagreements.
Putting it more bluntly, in 1980 Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould
pronounced the &quot;neo&shyp;Darwinian synthesis&quot; to be &quot;effectively
dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach
biological origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists
disagree about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for
not knowing which ones to teach. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>An Opportunity<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Controversy is not all bad, however. For it gives teachers
the opportunity to engage their students at a deeper level. Instead of filling
young minds with discrete facts and vocabulary lists, teachers can show
their students the rough&shyp;and&shyp;tumble of genuine scientific debate.
In this way, students begin to understand how science really works. When
they see scientists of equal stature disagreeing over the interpretation
of the same data, the students learn something about the human dimension
of science. They also learn about the distinction between fact and inference&shyp;&shyp;and
how background assumptions influence scientific judgement.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity that
the publisher offers this supplementary text, <I>Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins</I>. The purpose of this text is
to expose your students to the captivating and the controversial in the
origins debate &shyp;&shyp; to take them beyond the pat scenarios offered
in most basal texts and encourage them to grapple with ideas in a scientific
manner.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>does this in two ways. First,
if offers a clear, cogent discussion of the latest data relevant to biological
origins. In the process, it rectifies many serious errors found in several
basal biology texts.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, <I>Pandas</I> offers a different interpretation of
current biological evidence. As opposed to most textbooks, which present
the more&shyp;or&shyp;less orthodox neo-Darwinian accounts of how life originated
and diversified, <I>Pandas</I> also presents a clear alternative, which
the authors call &quot;intelligent design.&quot; Throughout, the text evaluates
how well these different views can accommodate anomalous data within their
respective interpretive frameworks. <I>Pandas</I> also makes the task of
organizing your lessons and researching the scientific issues much easier.
Pandas provides the scientific information you need, and provides it in
a way that coordinates well with your basal text.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the spirit of good, honest science, <I>Pandas</I> makes
no bones about being a text with a point of view. Because it was intended
to be a supplemental text, the authors saw no value in simply rehashing
the orthodox accounts covered by basal textbooks. Rather, its presentation
of a non&shyp;Darwinian perspective, in addition to the standard view, is
intended to stimulate discussion and encourage students to evaluate the
explanatory power of different theories &shyp;&shyp; which, after all, is
what science is all about.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By using this text in conjunction with your standard basal
text, you will help your students learn to grapple with multiple competing
hypotheses &shyp;&shyp; and to maintain an open but critical posture toward
scientific knowledge. As students learn to grapple with competing views,

<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Status of Evolution as a Fact</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the great value of presenting opposing viewpoints,
the popular debate over origins has fostered several misconceptions about
evolution, design, and science itself. To get the most benefit from this
supplement, teachers should understand these misconceptions and be prepared
to face them in an open and fair&shyp;minded manner when they arise.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>One misconception concerns the status of evolution as a fact.
In the origins debate, it is common to hear the assertion that evolution
is not merely a theory, but an indisputable fact. Educators who take this
view argue that it is futile and misleading to present non&shyp;Darwinian
views as serious alternatives to Darwinian evolution.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The factual status of evolution, however, depends critically
on what the word &quot;evolution&quot; means. Yale biologist Keith Stewart
Thomson points out that scientists have used the term in at least three
different ways.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first meaning he identifies is &quot;change over time.&quot;
In this sense, to say that evolution has taken place is to say that change
has occurred and that things are different now than they were in the past.
The fossil evidence, for example, reveals different organisms from one geological
period to the next.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the word is used in this sense, it is hard to disagree
that &quot;evolution&quot; is a fact. The authors of this volume certainly
have no dispute with that notion. <I>Pandas </I>clearly teaches that life
has a history and that the kinds of organisms present on earth have changed
over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second meaning that Thomson identifies is descent with
modification &shyp;&shyp; the idea that all organisms are &quot;related
by common ancestry.&quot; Evolution in this sense is a theory about the
history of life. In Darwin's view, that history can best be depicted as
a single branching tree &shyp;&shyp; a geneaological tree &shyp;&shyp; in
which life diversifies over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Many people assert that evolution in this second sense is a
fact, just as gravity is a fact. But the two situations are hardly analogous.
The fact of gravity can be verified simply by dropping a pencil &shyp;&shyp;
an experiment anyone can perform. The &quot;fact&quot; of common anscestry,
however, is on an entirely different level. We can no more &quot;see&quot;
evolution in the fossil record than paleontologists of Darwin's day could
&quot;see&quot; creation events. The best we can do is infer what might
have happened by piecing together circumstantial evidence from many different
fields.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin, for example, sought to establish common descent by
examining evidence from several different areas: paleontology, biogeography,
comparative anatomy, and embryology. Others have relied, in addition, on
evidence from genetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The problem with this kind of historical detective work, however,
is that it seldom produces a conclusion that forecloses other alternatives.
As philosopher of biology Elliot Sober points out, there may be any number
of plausible explanations&shyp;&shyp;or &quot;past histories&quot;&shyp;&shyp;that
can account for the same evidence. Sober's observation recalls the insightful
warning of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Circumstantial evidence
is a very tricky thing,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may seem to point very
straight to one thing, but if you shift your point of view a little, you
may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something different.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To use another analogy, consider the picture in Figure X. What
do you see? A tired old woman or an attractive young lady? Depending on
what you're looking for, you can probably see either one. The drawing hasn't
changed. The only thing that's different is the way you look at it.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The point is, unless we can eliminate plausible competing explanations,
it's presumptuous to call descent with modification a fact. As most people
understand the term, a fact &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">is supposed
to be distinguished from transient theories as something definite, permanent,
and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
By this definition, descent with modification simply doesn't warrant the
status of a fact. Far from compelling a single conclusion, the evidence
may legitimately be interpreted different ways, leading to several possible
conclusions. None of those conclusions warrant the status of a &quot;fact.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>As zoologist Thomas Kemp warns:<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[A]ll attempts to understand the diversity of organisms rely
upon empirically untestable assumptions either about evolution or about
natural patterns. There is nothing wrong with making assumptions or seeking
to justify them of course. It is the very stuff of science. What is unforgivable
is to forget that they are assumptions and behave as if they were known
certainties when they are no such things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, calling descent with modification a fact only closes
off debate and blurs the distinction between fact and inference. That, in
turn, makes us particularly vulnerable to the illusion that we know more
than we really do. In the preface to his best selling volume, <I>The Discoverers</I>,
historian Daniel Boorstin tells the reader:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The obstacles to discovery&shyp;&shyp;the illusions of knowledge&shyp;&shyp;are
also part of our story. Only against the forgotten backdrop of the received
common sense and myths of their time can we begin to sense the courage,
the rashness, the heroic and imaginative thrusts of the great discoverers.
They had to battle against the current &quot;facts&quot; and dogmas of the
learned.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is precisely why a book that questions the Darwinian notion
of common descent is so necessary. By presenting a reasonable alternative
to evolution in this second sense, <I>Pandas</I> helps students learn to
work with multiple perspectives, to distinguish those perspectives from
facts, and to guard themselves against the illusion of knowledge.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The final meaning of evolution that Thomson identifies concerns
the mechanism of biological change &shyp;&shyp; the particular explanation
of how evolution in the first two senses occurred. Here the term &quot;evolution&quot;
refers to random variation and natural selection. In Thomson's words:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although many biologists act as though [the mechanism] were
the whole meaning of evolution, it obviously is not. The first and second
meanings could be explained by several different theories, and both had
a serious intellectual history before 1859, while the third meaning is currently
confined to a particular explanatory hypothesis, Darwinism.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Evolution in this third sense asserts that the cause or mechanism
of biological change is purposeless, non&shyp;intelligent, and completely
naturalistic. Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins defended this view in his
best selling book, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I>. Like Darwin himself, Dawkins
acknowledges that biological organisms appear to exhibit remarkable design.
Yet both men claim that this appearance is an illusion, produced entirely
by random variation and natural selection. Blind nature mimics intelligent
design.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; thesis is often touted as
a fact, but it is not. For one thing, Darwinists have never demonstrated
empirically that natural processes can create the complex structures that
characterize living organisms. Like common descent, the blind watchmaker
thesis is based on indirect evidence. It accounts for hypothetical transformations
by extrapolating small observed changes over immense periods of time. Thus,
the blind watchmaker thesis is not a fact, but an inference. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, the blind watchmaker thesis &shyp;&shyp; at least
in its neo&shyp;Darwinian form &shyp;&shyp; may not even be a warranted
inference. As we mentioned at the beginning of this essay, neo&shyp;Darwinism
has come under increasing attack from scientists and philosophers alike.
Scientists have increasingly questioned the ability of mutation and natural
selection to generate new organs, limbs, or body plans. A host of other
problems have led biologists Mae-Wan Ho and Peter Saunders to say:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until only a few years ago, the 'synthetic' or 'neo&shyp;Darwinist'
theory of evolution stood virtually unchallenged as the basis of our understanding
of the organic world....</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the picture is entirely different. More and
more workers are showing signs of dissatisfaction with the synthetic theory.
Some are attacking its philosophical foundations....Others have deliberately
set out to work in just those areas in which neo&shyp;Darwinism is least
comfortable, like the problem of gaps in the fossil record or the mechanisms
of non&shyp;Mendelian inheritance....Perhaps most significantly of all,
there is now appearing a stream of articles and books defending the synthetic
theory. It is not so long ago that hardly anyone thought this was necessary.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> gives students a much&shyp;needed
opportunity to explore the evidence and arguments that have caused some
scientists to doubt contemporary Darwinism. It examines evidence from such
fields as biochemistry, genetics and paleontology--evidence that casts doubt
on the sufficiency of purposeless processes to explain the appearance of
new biological forms.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going a step further, <I>Pandas</I> helps students understand
the positive case for intelligent design. Following a growing number of
scientists and philosophers, the authors argue that life not only <I>appears</I>
to have been intelligently designed, but that it actually was. Drawing on
recent developments in molecular biology, the authors show that even simple
organisms bear all the earmarks of designed systems.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The authors will also discuss what theorists have learned by
applying mathematics and information science to biology. Those insights
suggest that there are ways to distinguish natural systems from intelligently
designed ones--and have led some scientists to conclude that the &quot;coded
genetic information&quot; (or sequence specificity) of DNA, proteins, and
the like, reflects the activity of a pre-existent intelligence. While that
conclusion is still controversial, a growing minority of scientists see
it as a plausible alternative to the blind watchmaker thesis. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By presenting the case for intelligent design the authors demonstrate
that there are alternatives to the blind watchmaker thesis--and that evolution
as a purposeless process is neither an indisputable fact, nor the only inference
supported by biological data.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, then, only in the most trivial sense&shyp;&shyp;change
over time&shyp;&shyp;can evolution be considered a fact. Far from being
a legitimate reason for avoiding alternative views, the alleged &quot;fact
of evolution&quot; underscores precisely why a book like <I>Pandas </I>is
so necessary. If students are to achieve true scientific literacy, they
must learn to distinguish fact from supposition. A curriculum that blurs
this distinction serves neither the students nor society.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Science and the Laws of Nature</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second misconception revolves around the question of what
makes a concept or explanation &quot;scientific.&quot; In particular, some
scientists and philosophers assert that the concept of intelligent design
is inherently non-scientific. According to this view, science must explain
things by using natural laws&shyp;&shyp;not by invoking an the special action
of an intelligent agent. Thus, we no longer explain the orbit of a planet
by saying that an angel pushes it through the heavens. We explain it with
Newton's law of universal gravitation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the same way, design is ruled out&shyp;of&shyp;court because
it invokes an intelligent agent, rather than natural laws. Philosopher of
science Michael Ruse, for example, has said:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Science attempts to understand this empirical world. What is
the basis for this understanding? Surveying science and the history of science
today, one thing stands out: Science involves the search for order. More
specifically, science looks for unbroken, blind, natural regularities (<I>laws</I>).
Things in the world do not happen in just any old way. They follow set paths,
and science tries to capture this fact. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are serious problems with this view, however. One problem
is that it ignores areas of scientific investigation where intelligent design
is a necessary explanatory concept. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) is one example. At the time of this writing, radio telescopes are
scanning the heavens, looking for artificial radio signals that differ from
the random signals generated by natural objects in space. If we were to
limit science to the search for &quot;unbroken, blind, natural regularities
(laws)&quot; we would have to say that SETI is unscientific&shyp;&shyp;by
definition.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Archaeology would meet the same fate. Archaeologists routinely
distinguish manufactured objects (e.g. arrowheads, potsherds) from natural
ones (e.g. stones), even when the differences between them are very subtle.
These manufactured objects then become important clues in reconstructing
past ways of life. But if we arbitrarily assert that science explains solely
by reference to natural laws, if archaeologists are prohibited from invoking
an intelligent manufacturer, the whole archaeological enterprise comes to
a grinding halt.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second problem with limiting science to blind, natural regularities
is that it confuses <I>laws </I>with <I>explanations</I>&shyp;&shyp;an error
that philosopher of science William Alston calls &quot;a 'category mistake'
of the most flagrant sort.&quot; Laws and explanations are often two different
things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Scientific explanations often invoke not only laws, but causal
events and actions. For example, consider the field of modern cosmology.
Most cosmologists explain the features of our universe not only by reference
to the laws of physics, but by reference to a single event: the Big Bang.
The Big Bang, for example, helps explain why galaxies throughout the universe
seem to be receding from each other. It also explains the presence of low
level radiation that seems to permeate space. These phenomena cannot be
explained solely by reference to physical laws, or natural regularities.
Rather, the critical explanatory feature is a one-time event that established
the conditions responsible for the phenomena that we now witness.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Taking this idea a bit farther, sometimes it seems that scientific
laws are hardly relevant to our explanations at all &shyp;&shyp; such as
when we try to explain why things turned out one way rather than another.
For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation may tell us why the
earth has a Newtonian orbit rather than a non&shyp;Newtonian one. But it
doesn't explain why the earth follows it's present orbit, instead of some
other orbit that's equally compatible with Newton's law. That kind of explanation
requires something else &shyp;&shyp; namely, information about how the earth
attained its present position and velocity.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar example can be drawn from the field of historical
geology. If a historical geologist wanted to explain the unusual height
of the Himalayas, invoking natural laws would be of little use. Natural
laws alone cannot tell us why the Himalayas are higher than, say, the Rocky
Mountains. That would require discovering antecedent factors that were present
in building the Himilayas, but not in other mountain&shyp;building episodes.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, scientific explanation not only involves laws, but may
also involve past causal events. If scientists could never invoke past events
and causes, they could not explain many important phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why is this important? Because ignoring the role of causal
events in scientific explanation has created a false dichotomy between agency
&shyp;&shyp; or intelligent design &shyp;&shyp; and the laws of nature.
The fact that scientific explanations may invoke laws doesn't mean that
agency is somehow ruled out. Rather, intelligent agents can alter causal
events and other contributing factors. Although intervention may alter the
course of subsequent events &shyp;&shyp; sometimes in novel and unexpected
ways &shyp;&shyp; it does not violate natural laws.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, the actions of intelligent agents are themselves causal
events. Therefore, citing the action of agents may be necessary to explain
many present phenomena. Imagine trying to explain Mt. Rushmore without reference
to sculptors. Law-like explanations involving only natural processes would
completely miss this critical explanatory factor. That is why archaeologists,
forensic scientists and historians often find it impossible to avoid postulating
intelligent agency.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The notion that science explains solely by reference to natural
law suffers from yet a third problem. In addition to confusing laws with
explanations, it assumes a cookie&shyp;cutter view of science, in which
all disciplines ask similar questions and use the same &quot;scientific
method.&quot; This belies the rich diversity of methods that scientists
use to understand the natural world.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Several philosophers, for instance, have argued that a clear
distinction exists between the &quot;inductive sciences&quot; and the &quot;historical
sciences.&quot; These two broad categories ask different kinds of questions,
and use different kinds of methods. The inductive (or nomological) sciences,
on the one hand, ask questions about how the natural world operates. Hence,
a virologist may try to discover how a particular enzyme helps a virus infect
its host. Or a crystalographer may try to determine the effects of weightlessness
on crystal growth. In each case, scientists seek to uncover the regularities
that characterize natural phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The historical sciences, on the other hand, ask different kinds
of questions. Rather than trying to understand how the natural world operates,
the historical sciences seek to understand how things came to be. One example,
of course, would be the historical geologist who was seeking to explain
the unusual elevation of the Himalayas. Another would be an evolutionary
biologist seeking to explain the origin of giraffes. Still another would
be the archaeologist seeking to reconstruct an ancient culture. Note that
in each case, the goal is not to find new laws or regularities, but to reconstruct
past conditions and events.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of this distinction to our present discussion
is that although postulating intelligent intervention is completely inappropriate
in the inductive sciences, the same is not true in the historical sciences.
In the inductive sciences, the whole point is to discover how the natural
world normally operates on it's own, i.e., <I>in the absence of intelligent
intervention</I>. Postulating an intelligent agent would thus be contrary
to the stated goal of research.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the historical sciences, however, the goal is to reconstruct
past events and conditions. Thus, there is no need to impose such restrictions.
Quite the reverse. As we have seen, the explanation of certain artifacts
or features may require reference to intelligence. Intelligent agents may
have left traces of their activity in the natural world. The historical
scientist need not turn a blind eye to them.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hence, when investigating the origin of the living world, it
is perfectly acceptable to hypothesize an intelligent designer if the evidence
warrants.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Observability</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third misunderstanding concerns the scientific status of
unobservable objects and events. Some philosophers and scientists claim
that intelligent design is not scientific because it invokes an unobservable
intelligent designer. To be scientific, they claim, a concept or idea must
be testable. Because an intelligent designer is unobservable it is not testable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence not scientific.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is by no means clear, however, that something is untestable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence unscientific&shyp;&shyp;simply because it is unobservable. If this
were the case, many accepted theories and concepts would have to be declared
unscientific as well. Chemist J.C. Walton observes:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The postulation of...external intervention [into nature by
a designer] indoubtedly restores order, harmony and simplification to the
data of physics and biology. [Yet] at present there is no unambiguous evidence...for
the existence of the external entity, but this should not be regarded as
a drawback. Many key scientific postulates such as atomic theory, kinetic
theory of the applicability of wave functions to describing molecular properties
were, and still are, equally conjectural. Their acceptance depended, and
still depends, on the comparison of their predictions with observables.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also falling in this category are almost all theories in the
historical sciences&shyp;&shyp;theories that postulate conditions and events
that occured in the unobservable past. The Big Bang is one such theory.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another, ironically, is Neo&shyp;Darwinism. Although Neo&shyp;Darwinism
explains many observable features of the living world, it postulates unobservable
objects and events. For example, the mutational events that allegedly produced
reptiles, birds, mammals, and even humans, have never been observed &shyp;&shyp;
nor will they ever be observed. Similarly, the transitional life forms that
occupy the branching&shyp;points on Darwin's tree of life are also unobservable.
Transitional forms exist now only as theoretical entities that make possible
a coherent Darwinian account of how present&shyp;day species originated.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unobservable character of Darwinism becomes especially
plain when proponents try to reconcile the fossil evidence with their theory.
As paleontologists now admit, the fossil evidence looks a good deal less
&quot;Darwinian&quot; than they had previously acknowledged. Indeed, as
Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould points out, the two outstanding features
of the fossil record are &quot;sudden appearance&quot; and &quot;stasis.&quot;
At any given location, species tend to appear &quot;suddenly,&quot; fully
formed, and exhibit no directional change during their stay on earth.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The standard neo&shyp;Darwinian explanation for these features
is the imperfection of the fossil record: Because fossilization occurs only
under special circumstances, fossils give us only a rough sketch of evolutionary
history. More recently, some have proposed that evolutionary change occurs
rapidly, and in small, isolated populations of organisms. Both explanations,
however, invoke unobserved circumstances (how can one observe a non&shyp;fossilization
event that happened 100 million years ago?) to explain unobserved fossil
organisms.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin himself realized that much of the evidence for his theory
was indirect. Indeed, he spent long hours defending his practice of inferring
the unobservable from the observable.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend
to adduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that
I believe that this view in the main is correct because so many phenomena
can be thus grouped and explained.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If we accepted the principle that unobservable entities are
inadmissable in science, we would have to reject not only Darwin's theory,
but his entire approach to scientific investigation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To be fair, some opponents of intelligent design would argue
that the real problem is not unobervability, but flexibility. The concept
of an intelligent designer is simply too much of a &quot;wild card&quot;:
it can explain anything. Put another way, the concept of an intelligent
designer cannot be falsified.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the contrary, however, intelligent design is not so flexible
that it cannot be falsified. The concept of intelligent design entails a
strong prediction that is readily falsifiable. In particular, the concept
of intelligent design predicts that complex information, like that encoded
in a functioning genome, never arises from purely chemical or physical antecedents.
Experience will show that only intelligent agency gives rise to functional
information. All that is necessary to falsify the hypothesis of intelligent
design is to show confirmed instances of purely physical or chemical antecedents
producing such information.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, intelligent design is not unique in its flexibility.
We have already seen how Darwinists handle the problem of the fossil record
(i.e. in the way they account for unobserved fossil forms by invoking unobserved
geological processes). Indeed, the history of science shows that scientists
have often offered <I>ad hoc</I> explanations to save a cherished theory.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the historical sciences, where
investigators must draw conclusions from incomplete or sketchy evidence.
If flexibility is an issue, therefore, it should be an issue for every scientific
theory, not just intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religion and Intelligent Design</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A final misconception you may confront is that intelligent
design is simply sectarian religion. According to this view, intelligent
design is merely fundamentalism with a new twist &shyp;&shyp; and teaching
it in public schools violates the separation of church and state.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This view is wide of the mark. The idea that life had an intelligent
source is hardly unique to Christian fundamentalism. Advocates of design
have included not only Christians and other religious theists, but pantheists,
Greek and Enlightenment philosophers, and now include many modern scientists
who describe themselves as religiously agnostic. Moreover, the concept of
design implies absolutely nothing about beliefs normally associated with
Christian fundamentalism: such as a young earth, a global flood, or even
the existence of the Christian God. All it implies is that life had an intelligent
source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, sectarianism is more a matter of form than content.
It is marked by a certain narrowness and exclusivity that entertains no
debate and tolerates no opposing viewpoints. Given the broad appeal of intelligent
design (even Richard Dawkins, a staunch Darwinist and author of <I>The Blind
Watchmaker</I>, acknowledges &quot;the appearance of design&quot; in the
living world), it is perhaps more accurate to conclude that the real sectarians
are those who villify design as &quot;fundamentalist religion.&quot; Such
name&shyp;calling is merely another way to avoid debate and keep the real
issues off the intellectual field of play.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even if the design hypothesis were religious, however, criticizing
it on that basis begs the question of whether it's scientifically warranted.
In science, the origin of an idea is supposed to be irrelevant to its validity.
What matters is not the source, but the whether the idea is logically consistent
and empirically supportable. If it is, what justification is there for excluding
it from the classroom?</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its landmark ruling on the Louisiana Balanced Treatment
Act, the United States Supreme Court did not try to shield the classroom
from dissenting viewpoints. Indeed, it affirmed that teachers already had
the flexibility to teach non&shyp;evolutionary views and present scientific
evidence bearing on the question of origins:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Act does not grant teachers a flexibility that they did
not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the
presentation of theories besides evolution, about the origin of life. Indeed,
the Court of Appeals found that no law prohibited Louisiana public schoolteachers
from teaching any scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Neither did the Supreme Court choose to limit that flexibility:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[T]eaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins
of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular
intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is not only consistent with good science, it's consistent
with the highest ideals of a democratic society. As John Scopes, who was
tried 1920s for teaching evolution, said at his own trial, &quot;Education,
you know, means broadening, advancing, and if you limit a teacher to only
one side of anything the whole country will eventually have only one thought,
be one individual. I believe in teaching every aspect of every problem or
theory.&quot;<BR>

If this is so, it strengthens the case against the &quot;fact&quot; of evolution

When we finally find some evolutionary change, however slight it may seem,
the &quot;typostrophic&quot; sort of affair the <I>Phacops rana</I> lineage
seems to show in the Midwest poses a choice between two unappetizing alternatives:
either you stick to conventional theory despite the rather poor fit of the
fossils, or you focus on the empirics and say that saltation looks like
a reasonable model of the evolutionary process--in which case you must embrace
a set of rather dubious biological propositions. Paleontologists are rather
well known for taking that latter course--adopting <I>ad hoc</I>, <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>For these purposes, it has little to do with greed. Or wanting to buy
too much at the mall to boost your self-esteem. <BR>
<BR>
Materialism is the modern day philosophy that holds that matter is all there
is. It's the philosophy that says &quot;If you can't touch it, smell it,
taste it or explain it through the hard sciences, it doesn't exist.&quot;
Men are merely complex machines and not spiritual beings. <BR>
<BR>
And it's approved by most intellectuals around the world. <BR>
<BR>
One other thing: we're out to topple it. <BR>

<H2><CENTER><I>#3. OK, then what is Darwinism?</I> </CENTER>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Darwinism is the belief that we evolved not only from the apes, but
that we started from nothing other than purposeless mass. As late Harvard
evolutionary biologist George Gaylord Simpson said, &quot;<I>Man is the
result of a</I> <I>purposeless and natural process that did not have him
in mind. He was not planned</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin is to Materialism like Karl Marx is to Communism. Like Adam
Smith is to Capitalism. This is not to say that Darwin himself is responsible
for the full course of Darwinism since his death. But he opened the door.

<H4>Materialism is a powerful philosophy of life today because it sets the
boundaries for what is right and wrong in society. It explains the &quot;rules&quot;
that govern our civilization. It goes to the very intellectual roots of
society, the very foundation that our social and cultural institutions are
built upon. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if materialism is right &shyp; as most intellectuals propose &shyp;
then &quot;God&quot; is merely a figment of our imagination. Therefore,
God didn't create man; man created God. Doestoyevsky once said that &quot;
<I>if God is dead</I> <I>then all things are lawful</I>.&quot; Might makes
right. The State is the ultimate enforcer of rules. <BR>
<BR>
Let's look at how materialism has infected the legal system, welfare and
popular culture.<BR>

<H4><BR>
Materialism teaches us that God is dead. It follows that divine revelation
cannot be the basis of human law. <BR>
<BR>
Human law can only be based on upon the current opinion of the people who
have the power to make and interpret laws. In our society, that power rests
in the hands of an elite class of judges, lawmakers and other experts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot; We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&quot;
quickly loses much validity if our &quot;Creator&quot; does not exist. Result:
a culture of irresponsibility and victimhood. <BR>
<BR>
The present culture took decades to develop. Look at a 1930s text in criminal
law that upholds the materialist foundation: <BR>
<BR>
<I>&quot;Man is no more responsible for becoming willful and committing
a crime than a flower for becoming red and fragrant. In both instances,
the end products are predetermined by nature.&quot; <BR>

<H4>Dating back to the 1960s, those who conceived the war on poverty believed
that poverty could be eradicated because they believed its root causes were
material: poverty, educational deprivation, crime, etc Thirty five years
later, we realize that throwing material resources at the problem has made
it worse, not better. <BR>

By ignoring the moral and spiritual dimensions of poverty, we have ignored
the real problems of poverty: family breakdown, illegitimacy and government-fostered

<H4>If morals are relative and nothing is absolute, anything goes. It requires
no deep intellectual digging to see how materialism has assaulted popular
culture. <BR>
<BR>
Popular culture seldom portrays religion favorably yet often with disdain.
Those characters who seem to hold traditional or conservative values will
surely be mocked, seen as &quot;square&quot; and even &quot;oppressors&quot;
of some sort of unalienable right bestowed upon humankind from Hollywood.

<H4>Much depends on how you define &quot;evolution.&quot; Some people think
evolution describes how things change over a period of time ( i.e. a finch's
beak length, a moth's color etc). Others think that slow and <BR>
gradual change to one organism can be translated directly into how life
itself was created. <BR>
<BR>
At a very basic level, we think evolution might explain the survival of

<BLOCKQUOTE>C. S. Lewis is perhaps the most widely known and read Christian
intellectual of the 20th century. His various works continue to sell more
than a millioin copies each year. He is best known for his theological and
fictional writings, but Lewis also was an articulate defender of representative
democracy, limited government, property rights, and the moral principles
upon which free societies are based. As Americans today seek to apply their
religion beliefs in the public arena in a constructive manner, there is
much they might be able to learn from Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, the purpose of Discovery Institute's project about Lewis and
politics is to use Lewis's writings to help American's better understand
the connections between faith and public life. The project includes public
conferences, books, scholarly colloquium, and published writings by Discovery
Fellows.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1><CENTER>Proprietary Rights: Privilege and Confidentiality In Cyberspace</CENTER>

<IMG SRC="goldline.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="8" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>At the recent Internet Law Symposium 95, sponsored by the Seattle-based
Discovery Institute, noted technology author and pundit George Gilder stated
that &quot;[i]n the twenty-first century, all law will be Internet law.&quot;
The proof of this statement is the debate already taking place among lawyers,
scholars, technologists, and Netizens about security, privilege, and confidentiality
in cyberspace. It is common currency in the popular press that nothing is
secure or private on the Internet. Whether true or not, whether an exagger-
ation or understatement, these sentiments breed doubt that any attomey-client
privilege can be maintained in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the law is not as muddled as conventional punditry suggests.
That is not to say that there are not real business risks associated with
use of digital communications today, just as there are risks associated
with use of fax machines, voice mail, and ordinary &quot;snail&quot; mail
(physical mail), but privilege waiver probably is not one of them. To understand
the issue, we do not start with the rules of professional conduct on maintaining
the confidences and secrets of clientsl or with the technology or medium
of exchange. Rather, we look to criminal law. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Title 18 prohibits the interception of any aural, wire, or electronic communications
by any person. It also prohibits the use or disclosure of unlawfully intercepted
communications. Electronic communications mean any transfer of signs, signals,
writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted
in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo-electronic,
or photo-optical system. Wire communications mean any aural transfer (i.e.,
transfer containing a human voice) made in whole or in part through wire,
cable, or other like connection between the point of origin or point of
receptions Thus, for example, cellular phone communications, though wireless
in origin, are wire communications because they connect to land lines to
complete the call. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short, no one can lawfully intercept communications made over phone lines
or wireless communications. The same is true for information or communications
made over the Internet, including e-mail. For the uninitiated, it may seem
surprising that the Wiretap Act is the source of prohibition for interceptions
on the Internet. But the fact is that the Net is a series of interconnected
networks of computers connected by and accessed through the telecommunications
infrastructure--that is, the phone lines and exchanges throughout the world
connect the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To intercept an Internet communication (limited voice communications are
now available in addition to e-mail) requires a wiretap. Thus, there is
no greater insecurity when the Internet communication is in transit over
the phone lines than there is with an ordinary phone call.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The greater concern arises once the communication is passed through computers
on the network or when it is stored electronically. Internet communications
may pass through dozens of computers on the way to the fmal receiver. Each
computer is a potential source of exposure. Communications stored electronically
in a computer share the same vulnerability as voice-mail and other data
fides.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hacking or &quot;cracking&quot; networks has become easier today, in part
due to the Internet. Hackers routinely exchange information over the Net
about systems' vulnerabilities. Any network connected to the Internet has
the potential to be cracked absent security measures.<BR>
Congress recognized the vulnerability of networks and amended the Wiretap
Act in 1986 to address the problem, enacting the Electronic Communication
Privacy Act (ECPA). ECPA makes it unlawful to access without authorization
a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided.
It is also unlawful to exceed an authorization to access a facility and
thereby alter, obtain, or prevent authorized access to a wire or electronic
communication while it is an electronic storage. In other words, hacking
is illegal, just as altering or obtaining stored data without proper authority
is. In short, it is unlawful to intercept an e-mail at point from transmission,
while in transit, when stored or after receipt.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If new technologies are to succeed, users must have confidence in the security
of the system. Making hacking and eavesdropping felonies goes a long way
to achieving that goal, but mere prohibitions on interception of communications
do not preserve privilege. Congress did, however, provide the answer. Section
2517(4) of Title 18 provides that &quot;[n]o otherwise privileged wire,
oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in
violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, interception of communications over the Internet or over the phone
should not result in waiver of the attomey-client privilege. There is no
similar provision (and none is needed) for electronically stored data, however,
because there is no waiver of privilege when a thief steals a document out
of a file cabinet, and likewise no waiver when the file is in digital form
and the breakin occurs through the phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Some have argued that any communication &quot;readily capable of interception&quot;
should not be protected if, indeed, it is intercepted. The Association of
the Bar of the City of New York has admonished its members to , exercise
caution when engaging in conversations containing client confidences by
cellular or cordless phones readily capable of interception and [to] consider
taking steps such as encryption or scrambling of signals sufficient to ensure
the security of such conversations &quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rulings as to cordless phones are correct. Inadvertent interceptions
have occurred frequently with cordI ss phones, which transmit on a normal
FM frequency within radio range. Using a cordless phone is like operating
a radio station and broadcasting your message. Anyone within range could
receive the communication. Thus, it would not be uncommon to hear a conversation
on an FM car radio or even a baby monitor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same is not true for cellular phones, however. While they use part of
the spectrum for transmission, they do not transmit within a range or frequency
capable of inadvertent interception by commercial users of the airwaves
or listeners. Rather, scanners are required to intercept cellular communications
and that is an illegal act. From a privilege standpoint, this is the difference
between using the PA system to deliver your message in a crowded shopping
mall and whispering a secret in a private room. California has amended its
evidence code to make clear that attomey-client communications do not lose
their privilege character when conducted by cellular phone. This is the
right approach and is timely because wireless data exchange is becoming
more costeffective every day, so wireless e-mail and other packetswitched
data services by wireless means are not far off.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We can look at the problem another way-from the user's expectations. The
same people who argue that the Internet or cellular phones are too insecure
to use without encryption would be aghast at the suggestion that the government
should be free to eavesdrop on those same calls or communications. Yet the
rule is that if a citizen has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the
communication, then there is no &quot;search&quot; under the Fourth Amendment.
Congress, here again, has answered the question (and the Association of
the Bar of the City of New York as well) by making clear that essentially
any communication carried over a communication system provided by a telecommunications
carrier is deemed to be not &quot;readily accessible to the general public.&quot;
In other words, the person making the communication has a reasonable expectation
of privacy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed ' there is no question but that the government needs a court order
or warrant based on probable cause that a felony is being conunitted to
conduct electronic surveillances To obtain the contents of communications
in electronic storage for less than 180 days, the government also must obtain
a warrant based on probable cause. If the communications have been stored
for over 180 days, a warrant is still necessary unless the government gives
advance notice to the user. With notice, the government can use other legal
process such as a subpoena to obtain the contents, but then the user can
always challenge the process and move to quash. The same procedures apply
to communications stored in remote computing services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Wiretap Act and ECPA are the statutory floor; states may enact more,
but not less, strict laws. These laws reflect society's view that citizens
have every right to expect their private connnunications to be free from
unwarranted intrusion, whether such communications be by wire, electronic
means, or by old-fashioned voiceto-voice over a desk in a lawyer's office.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But shouldn't the attorney and client use encryption out of prudence? (Encryption
is an electronic lockand-key technology based on algorithms that makes messages
and stored data unreadable to anyone except the sender and intended recipient.)
Encryption presents a host of policy challenges that have yet to be resolved.
Strong encryption is banned from export as a &quot;munition.&quot; There
are questions about who should have access to the keys. Some nations, such
as France, ban encryption entirely. Yet some form of encryption may become
the foundation of electronic commerce, not because of privilege or the need
to maintain it, but because of the need for a secure payment systems. (Criminals
also enjoy the idea of ubiquitous and strong encryption as a means of thwarting
legitimate law enforcement surveillance.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the degree of privacy necessary for communications should be
a business decision, not one based on fear of losing the privilege umbrella
for the entire transaction. Nor should the decision to use encryption be
based on fear that someone could otherwise use readily available and easily
modified technology to unlawfully intercept the communication. If that were
the criteria, all business would have to be conducted under the &quot;cone
of silence&quot; and cellular phones would be as rare as Maxwell Smart's
shoe phone. <BR>

<P>Much hype and misinformation has been churned out about cyberspace and
the information highway. While the mass media's coverage of this new medium
does not rival that of the O.J. trial, attention being paid to users and
providers of computer networks and online services has grown intense during
the past two years. Culminating this misinformation glut is legislation
in Washington, D.C.: Senator Exon's Decency Act of 1995. <BR>
<BR>
The Exon Bill represents leadership that is uninformed of the citizenry
it is attempting to rule over, reminiscent of the British style of &quot;taxation
without representation&quot; legislation during America's frontier days.
Despite the stories of security problems and the wilderness of data, the
electronic communities that comprise the Net are in most cases stable and
self-regulating as their citizens hold each other and their system administrator
accountable for their online content and conduct. <BR>
<BR>
In an era when government is trying to downsize so that it may live within
its means, an attempt at regulating a medium residing within and beyond
the jurisdiction of the terrestrial courts and agencies of the U.S. is shortsighted
and embarrassing. Specifically, many electronic communities whose computer
and databases reside physically in the U.S. have users (i.e., online citizens)
who reside in the U.S. and in other countries. Despite differences in culture
and legal standards, individuals meet and share information on a regular
basis. <BR>
<BR>
Such users can meet peaceably because they adhere to what is generally known
as an acceptable use policy (AUP), or netiquette, or terms of service. Ranging
from an informal understanding of what is proper to a structured code and
signed contracts, users agree with an electronic community's system administrator
to abide by rules in order to participate in that particular community.
By letting their contracts be their conscience, users have much liberty
and responsibility as they act and speak in cyberspace. While there are
rogue and raucous electronic communities out there, there are thousands
of communities that have gotten along fine over the years because their
users care about what goes on while online. Users turn misusers in to system
administrators (a.k.a., &quot;sysops&quot;) and in cases where the violative
conduct touches upon a terrestrial law, the sysop turns the offender over
to the appropriate authorities (e.g., the recent incident of child pornographers
being turned in by America Online's chief sysop and CEO Steve Case). <BR>
<BR>
While Senator Exon's Bill is well intentioned -- laws that argue to protect
children will always be deemed to be a &quot;good thing&quot; -- it is unnecessary
for the most part. If, however, there needs to be regulation of the Internet,
then such rule making should come from an authority other than an elected
representative who is not even a user of e-mail. Instead, a more appropriate
body for the consideration and recommendation of laws for the online world
is one that does not yet exist formally but one whose time has come: an
&quot;Internet Law Task Force&quot; or ILTF. Analogous to the Internet Engineering
Task Force or IETF, a volunteer body that meets regularly to discuss and
determine what technical standards should be agreed upon in furtherance
of the interoperability of the various networks that make up the Internet,
an ILTF could be a body of lawyers and technical experts from the U.S. and
other countries whose mission would be to support the positive use of the
Net. Already, many individual professionals here and abroad work together
on issues of mutual interest because they enjoy it and because they deem
it as a necessity. <BR>
<BR>
An ILTF could be called upon by elected representatives in Washington, D.C.,
and elsewhere for expert testimony and for fact finding missions. However,
an ILTF would be in the best position to hear and understand the interests
of online citizens and sysops. Also, an autonomous and volunteer ILTF would
appreciate the fact that users and sysops of individual electronic communities
do not wish to have their rules subverted by an outsider. <BR>
<BR>
In the absence of an ILTF, legislation like Senator Exon's will most likely
result in the Balkanization of cyberspace, chilling participation and openness,
increasing costs through heightened liability (thus decreasing access for
the poor), and dividing the medium on jurisdictional boundaries -- dividing
lines wholly inconsistent and incompatible with the meaning and working
mechanism of the fluid and global medium that is the Net. Data will be driven
offshore to computer networks in other countries, connectivity will be cut
short, and electronic commerce will blossom elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
Even if content providers on the Net were to voluntarily submit to a government
requirement for a rating system similar to the motion picture industry (re:
How About X Ratings On the Internet? by G. Griggs, 29 March 1995, The New
York Times, A14), implementation of adequate software in support of such
online notification symbols and protocols would take years. Also, and perhaps
more importantly, such a measure ignores the same fact that the Exon Bill
does: the Net is a global phenomenon. Attempts to control information here
will simply mean that such information will be stored elsewhere and accessible
remotely from the U.S.. The interconnected nature of the Net permits users
to route around barriers and get to the information they want. <BR>
<BR>
Recently in these Op-Ed pages it was written that :&quot;The successful
marketspace will be one that makes shopping a transaction not just involving
goods and services but also experience. It will not forsake community for
commerce.&quot; (Steven Alburty, It's a Buyer's Marketspace, The New York
Times, A15, 20 March 1995.) Similarly, successful governance should not
forsake communities and their rules falsely in the name of children. <BR>

<PRE>

<B>NETIZENS</B> - the community of Internet users - bear a strong resemblance to Americans of the 
Wild West.  They are fiercely independent, value their privacy and have a strong distrust of laws 
made in Washington, D.C. Nonetheless, even the Wild West was tamed as the rule of law replaced 
frontier Justice.


The Internet already is home to some 40 million users and growing exponentially as networks 
join networks.  With a &quot;point and click,&quot; data and opinions move over the world.  In such a wired 
world, bringing law to the Internet will not be easy.  In fact, it will not be possible at all if nations 
act unilaterally, piecemealing the Internet into jurisdictions with conflicting laws and liabilities.  We 
need what some have called a <B><I>Magna Carta for the Information Age</I></B>.


First, it must be understood that anything as massive as the Internet cannot be &quot;regulated&quot; in any 
meaningful manner.  It was designed to be a self-healing network of diverse platforms capable of 
operating under the most adverse of conditions - nuclear holocaust.  The Internet evolved from 
military use to link the world's leading universities and research facilities together; and ultimately, 
it passed into private hands where its commercial growth has been astonishing.


Today, anyone can set up a &quot;home page&quot; on the World Wide Web and bring ideas to the 
marketplace free of media filters or goverrunent censorship in this or other countries.  In the 
greatest of American traditions, the Internet has unleashed an army of pamphleteers&quot; who are 
'udged, no doubt harshly sometimes, on the merit of their ideas in the marketplace.  Increasingly, 
people also will get news from the Internet, a revolutionary change that will affect politics, culture 
and commerce forever.  In short, the Internet has come too far to be constrained by any one 
government.  For the putative regulator, the message is simple: Law will never keep up with the 
Internet.


For example, China could massacre students in Tiananmen Square but could not &quot;ban&quot; the 
Internet from carrying the news of its infamy.  Now the Chinese government itself is getting into 
the Internet through deals with multinational telecommunications giants.  But if China believes that 
it can control the Internet this way, it may find that the genie is already out of the bottle.  The 
Internet is bigger than China and it crosses all borders free of customs.
Then what is all of the talk about bringing law to Internet? As the Net has become more popular, 
the public - or perhaps more correctly, the politicians - have discovered that there are some dark 
back alleys on the Internet where pornographers and fraudsters lie in wait for the next Internet 
tourist.  But to listen to the politicians and the media outlets, one would think that the Internet was 
dominated by virtual voyeurs, techno-pedophiles and purveyors of electronic smut.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth, as anyone who has visited the popular Louvre or the Smithsonian Web 
sites can attest.


Yet, as the Telecommunications Act of 1995 heads into a conference between the U.S. Senate 
and House, one would think that the only important issue regarding the Internet is regulation of 
pornography.  There is a glaring absence of debate or discussion about the Internet overall, and 
what exists is uninformed.


Some may prefer it that way, but there are a host of important legal issues raised by the Internet 
that should occupy the minds of Congress.  If commerce is to succeed on the Internet, certainty 
and security are prerequisites.  Here there is a need for bringing law to the Internet, and for care in 
doing so.  Too much law may stifle the use of the Net for business purposes; too little law and the 
uncertainty associated with risks and liability of using these new technologies may dissuade some 
that would otherwise embrace such an open network for trade.
If security is to be achieved, we need to come to grips with the use and export of strong 
encryption. (Encryption is a software lock and key that prevents others from viewing or altering 
the content of communications without authorization key.) Recent stories about Netscape 
Communications' encryption standard being cracked in Europe carried the wrong headline.  The 
story should have decried the ban on export of software with stronger encryption, which Netscape 
makes and markets in the United States and which has not been compromised.  Although the fact 
that some U.S. companies are put at a competitive disadvantage in the growing Internet 
applications market is important, there are strong privacy concerns associated with encryption and 
cryptography.


It was only a year ago that the government sought to hold the keys to every encrypted message 
through a required &quot;Clipper Chip.&quot; The firestorm of opposition was great and the idea was 
dropped.  Now the Clinton administration proposes a system of public key encryption where a 
trusted third party would hold the keys to the communication and the government would have 
access only on the same basis as it would for a wiretap.  It remains to be seen whether this 
proposal will meet with the same opposition from Netizens concerned about their privacy in 
cyberspace and the intrusion of government into the Net.


One thing is for sure, however, as the encryption debate progresses: There must be a careful 
balance between legitimate privacy expectations and legitimate law-enforcement requirements.  
Marry strong encryption to a secure network and the first subscriber will be the Cali drug cartel and 
an army of money launderers.  How will the government fight them without the capability to surf 
the Net in pursuit of any criminal? Allow the government too much latitude on the Net and the 
amount of information about our personal lives that can be gathered from monitoring our use of the 
Internet is enormous, raising Big Brotherlike concerns.  The public certainly deserves adequate 
safeguards in the law against government intrusion as well as third-party misuse.


The same balance is needed in coping with credit-card misuse on the Net and by the coming use 
of digital cash.  The rule of law must be to punish the fraudster in the same way, whether his 
medium of exchange is the Internet or a cold call over the telephone.


Indeed, this should be the standard for every aspect of law and regulation related to the Internet.  
Where there is a legitimate regulatory concern - health, safety or welfare - there is room for a law 
that proscribes the offending conduct.  But the resulting law should be medium-neutral; that is, 
fraud should be no more or less illegal because it occurs over the Internet.


We cannot leave it to distant or uninfon-ned politicians to devise the rules of the road, nor can we 
rely exclusively on Internet frontier justice and custom and usage to achieve the certainty business 
demands in today's world of electronic commerce.</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What Laws Should Govern the Internet? </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><CENTER>Individuals, not governments, should shape Internet's future</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bruce Chapman </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The two traits that have always distinguished the American character are
a fierce insistence on personal liberty and &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;
Both live on brightly in the Internet, the winning future of communications
and commerce. Forget Al Gore's industrial era image of &quot;the information
superhighway,&quot; conjuring up visions of interactive televisions and
a big regulatory job for government. The concept isn't big enough or open
enough for what the Internet already is becoming. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet began as an obscure Defense Department communications project
a quarter of a century ago, but for the past twenty years it has been changing
in form and content. It is no longer a government network tying computer
users together, but a worldwide network of many networks, free and open
to all, and increasingly easy to access. There is no monopoly potential
to it, so government's excuse to regulate it is almost nil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More than 40 million people presently use the &quot;Net&quot;, some just
for electronic mail. However, 22 million of them also use it for research,
education, buying and selling, video-conferencing, publishing, or simply
seeking information in text and motion pictures from around the world. With
the number of &quot;domains&quot;--Net locations you can contact--growing
about seven thousand a month, and with numbers of users doubling annually,
the Internet is a whole new communications revolution. Further, its low
cost general offerings are greatly enriched by various for-profit services
and software products that, in turn, help America's economy to expand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But (good news for lawyers, alas) there are legal problems on the Net. If
the Internet it to continue to flourish, these problems must be met head
on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When businessmen, attorneys, techies, academics and government officials
meet in Seattle for the first International Internet Law Symposium later
this month, they will be responding to a sense that Internet service providers
and users need to find answers to certain legal issues before the government
does. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A government-run Internet is no more in the public interest than a monopoly-run
Internet. But neither is a lawless Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, this column belongs to the Seattle Post-Intelligencernow and,
per agreement, to me later. In a few days I'll put it on the Internet &quot;home
page&quot; of my think tank and make it available to readers all over the
world (I can dream, can't I?). But what if someone plagiarizes it? Or simply
reprints it and sells it commercially? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, if it were not a column, but,
say, a book--say, your book--you might care a lot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, copyright law has to apply somehow to the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so do other property rights, including the right to protect one's reputation.
Who, for example, owns e-mail within a company? What are standards of libel
in cyberspace? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or take the issue of gambling, which is now illegal in most states, with
certain exceptions. A huge battle is building over a proposal to provide
Bingo and other gambling on the Internet, organized through a Native American
company, Multimedia Games, Inc., in Oklahoma, and operated through outlets
on reservations nation-wide. How can gambling be controlled when state and
eveninternational borders mean nothing? Among other things, how can it be
taxed? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like most legal disputes, these involve both important principles and practical
trade-offs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pornography is another example. When both models and customers may be children--including
children receiving unsolicited filth through the Internet--the principle
of offended &quot;community standards&quot; normally would be invoked. But
what is the &quot;community&quot; in this case: Seattle? The world? The
&quot;community&quot; of Internet users? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the related problem of persons inventing false identities
and deploying the Internet to attract gullible minors to real life sexual
encounters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any added legal sanctions, of course, must be understood as complimenting,
not contradicting, other important values, such as privacy and free speech.
Fortunately, law enforcement is getting into the field in both a vigorous
and reasonable way. Which raises the question, do we need new laws in this
area, or just common sense extensions of the ones we have? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trend towards digitized cash is yet another story. Banking is heavily
regulated now and while many of us are intrigued by the trend toward commercial
transactions conducted over the Internet, unless people have good assurances
of security, such innovations won't succeed. Unfortunately, federal law
presently prevents U.S. businesses from encrypting their transactions internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case, transfers of money electronically, as ATM's have shown in a
modest way, do not have to be fail-safe. They just need to be as safe as
transactions that use cash or checks. In a few years, cash in your wallet
may be almost as rare as a silver dollar. Money will move internationally
the way it moves around town now. Ah, but when all that happens, what becomes
of the IRS? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of these questions are fascinating to discuss and deliberate. But first,
one major medium for discussing them, the Internet iteself, needs to be
better understood. At the moment, while the telecommunications bills before
Congress move in the direction of a freedom model, they still ignore the
Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ordinary people should shape the exciting future of the Internet. Government's
job is simply to be sure that the laws that keep normal commerce reliable
and free also protect the Internet. But, even that job is going to require
careful foresight. <BR>

<p>
"For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was the conscience of the conservative movement. As a scholar, essayist, lecturer, and critic, he saw contemporary political events against the backdrop of history, philosophy, and literature -- subjects in which his background was astonishingly thorough. Following the publication of his masterful <I>The Conservative Mind</i>, Dr. Kirk watched the conservative intellectual revival develop around him until his solitary cause of the early 1950s became the dominant trend of the 1980s. As much as any other living American, Russell Kirk was responsible for the growth of that movement. His works have given the conservative movement sage guidance in its efforts to redeem the time and champion the permanent things."

<P><IMG SRC="/heritage/staff/pics/bennett.jpe" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10>
<P>
Dr. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education and National Drug Control Policy Director, examines how government policies and programs affect American culture, and in turn, how American culture affects government policies and programs.  Bennett is the author of the nationwide bestseller, The Book of Virtues (Simon & Schuster). A former Chairman of the National Endowment of the Humanities, Bennett serves as co-director of Empower America and a Senior Editor of National Review.  Bennett earned his Ph.D. from the University of Texas and his J.D. from Harvard University.

Between 1980 and 1992, casual drug use in America declined sharply.  Strong presidential leadership helped cut casual drug use in half between 1977-1992, and reduced the number of cocaine users from almost 3 million in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.
<P>
Since 1992, however, a sustained, intelligent and integrated anti-drug effort has been largely abandoned.  The results are not surprising:  the last four years have brought the greatest increase in teen drug use ever measured.  Consider the facts:
<P>
Illicit drug use is soaring among Americas young people.  Overall use of drugs among 12-17 year olds rose 105 percent between 1992 and 1995.  Fully 2.42 million youths ages 12-17 use drugs on a monthly basis.

Marijuana use functions as the "gateway" to hard drugs.  According to the Center on Addiction and substance Abuse (CASA), teens who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to "graduate" to cocaine than those who abstain.  As CASA director, Joseph Califano noted, "The jump in marijuana use among Americas children from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime . . . Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular users and cocaine a ddicts.</blockquote></td></tr>

<center><h3>
Statement by William J. Bennett<br>
on results of the<br>
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
</h3>
<p>
<I>August 20, 1996</I>
</center>
<p>
The huge increase in drug use reported today in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1995 is a national disgrace.  And the Clinton administration should be ashamed of its complete abdication in fighting illegal drug use.
<p>
Since 1992, we have watched the number of drug users go up -- way up -- year after year.  Today we learn that drug use among young people has surged again -- this time by 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Monthly use of marijuana use among the young is up by 37 percent between 1994 and 1995, and up 141 percent since 1992.  This has occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992 and a reduction of almost 80 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (peak for cocaine) and 1992. 
<p>
There has been a well-documented and complete failure of public policy.  But make no mistake: there is more involved here than merely a failure of public policy.  Public policy, after all, is a manifestation of attitude.  And the "root cause" of the Clinton administration's abdication in the battle against illegal drug use is moral confusion and moral weakness.   
<p>
The Clinton administration, for whatever reason, is cavalier, unengaged, and unconcerned about illegal drugs.  It is unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  Democratic congressman Charles Rangel expressed the opinion of many when he said, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."  The motto of the Clinton administration seems to be, "We Just Don't Care" -- and so they are unwilling to act in responsible and effective ways.  Unfortunately this nation is paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's diffidence, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.  
<p>
On the one issue that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many children of the poor -- Bill Clinton and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  The burning of black churches has caused justifiable outrage in the country.  President Clinton has taken it upon himself to speak out, time and again, against church burnings.  And he is right to do so.  But drugs have destroyed many, many, many more black families than church burnings.  Yet on the drug issue Bill Clinton is virtually silent -- in word and in deed.  Even before today's news, we knew that since Bill Clinton became president the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured.  The Clinton administration keeps adding to its infamy.  Fighting the drug epidemic requires courage, intelligence, determination, and above all, moral clarity.  Moral clarity is precisely what is missing at the top of this administration, as well as among the White House staff.

<title>ISSUE BRIEFING</title>

<p>
<H2>DRUGS IN AMERICA</h2>
</center>
<p>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<dd>	From 1980 to 1992, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the federal government mounted a strong offensive against drugs, with real results.  The combined effect of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough law enforcement and a morally firm attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in significant reductions in both the consumption and availability of drugs. <p>
<dd>	Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned the drug war.  Americans have witnessed a failure of public policy brought about by a moral torpor; policy follows attitude.  But, as recent polling suggests, the public's attitude is not one of indifference to the drug issue.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug control policy with the federal government rightfully leading the fight.
<p>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drug use is a major contributing factor to violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, and poverty.  Drugs -- particularly crack cocaine -- have made these and other social pathologies more acute and often unmanageable.
<li>Between 1970 (the peak) and 1992, overall drug use decreased by over 50 percent.   Between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992, overall cocaine use declined by almost 80 percent.  And between 1984 and 1992, annual illicit drug use trends among 12th graders declined by 41 percent.
<li>The latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug use beginning in 1993.  Annual use among 12th graders is up for 1994 by 33 percent.  Marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds nearly doubled from 1992 to 1994.  And high school use of cocaine and hallucinogens has risen precipitously from a low in 1988.
<li>Drug-related hospital emergency room cases have escalated to their highest numbers since 1978.   In 1994 a record high half-million Americans were treated for drug-related problems, with serious increases in those induced by cocaine. 
<li>In a  survey released in December, 1995 by the Gallup Organization, Americans ranked drugs as the second most important problem (behind crime) facing the nation.
<li>The public strongly supports anti-drug education, strict law enforcement and interdiction; and offers little support for increased treatment programs. 
<li>Legalization of drugs is overwhelmingly rejected by Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CURRENT POLICY</H3>
<ul>
<li>Shortly after taking office, President Clinton weakened the power and slashed the staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  He proposed cuts in other agencies that have been at the forefront in the war on drugs -- the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- cuts that were largely rejected by the  U.S. Congress.
<li>The Clinton policy abrogated interdiction, tough law enforcement and mandatory minimum sentences. 
<li>The strong moral message of "Just say no"  gave way to "I didn't inhale;" and to a surgeon general who advocated drug legalization. 
<li>The Clinton administration has concentrated its efforts on an unfocused treatment policy that is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  
</ul>
<p>
<H3> RENEWING THE WAR ON DRUGS</H3>
<ul>
<li>The government should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction process.
<li>America must establish trade and diplomatic sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail to reduce their production.
<li>The federal government must identify and dismantle all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating in the United States.
<li>Law enforcement, drug treatment and prevention education are state and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should be block granted without mandates.
<li>The President should send a clear and frequently-heard anti-drug message from his bully pulpit, making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>JUST SAY NO TO DRUG LEGALIZATION</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and threatening to American society because they are illegal.  They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to American society.
<li>Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
	
It is the first obligation of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Nothing poses a greater threat to both than the scourge of drugs and the violence associated with it.   It is time for the federal government to renew its war on drugs through moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<center><h3>Written Testimony by<br>
William J. Bennett<br>
Former Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
<p>
Delivered before the<br>
United States Senate<br>
Caucus on International Narcotics Control<br>
April 25, 1996</h3>
<p>
======================================================
<p>
</center>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Caucus: 
<p>
Little more than a year ago I came before both the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on the drug resurgence in America and the need for strong leadership and serious action.  The situation was serious then.  It is worse now.   Consider these events of the last fifteen months:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that in 1995, almost three million 12 to 17 year olds used marijuana.  Among high school seniors, the users number one in three, according to the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
<li>LSD was tried at least once by 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 -- the highest rate since record keeping began in 1975. [Monitoring the Future Study, December, 1995]
<li>The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that "on the Texas border, the popular practice of smoking cocaine-laced 'blunts' [cigar-like marijuana cigarettes] may also be leading to an increase among teens of smoking crack."  
<li>In Chicago, a marijuana cigarette laced with both PCP and crack, called "Ozone," was marketed over the summer for $15.
<li>The popular culture, emboldened by a softened attitude toward drugs, escalated its glorification of marijuana.  Adidas brought out the "Hemp" shoe; Capricorn Records produced the album, "Hempilation;" and  20,000 young people gathered in Seattle to attend Hempfest '95.
<li>During the past year there has been a startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest.  Last July we read the horrifying story of Eric Smith who, high on methamphetamine, murdered his son, cut off the boy's head, and threw it out the window of his van.
<li>It has been reported that having discovered how much money can be made, the citizens of Bolivia have gone into cocaine production rather than simply supply the raw material to other countries.  
<li>And, finally, the advocates of drug legalization have stepped into the breach and made their case vociferously during the past year.
</ul>
<p>
These are troubling trends.  But the good news is that the American people are not 
complacent.  The will to fight drugs is very much alive in the land.  Late last year, 
the Gallup Organization released the results of an extensive survey on American attitudes toward drugs.  The poll found that more than nine in ten Americans are intensely concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  When asked what they wanted to see a lot more of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law enforcement and education of the young, and two-thirds cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United States.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent, those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should be legalized in America.  By contrast, fewer than half -- 43 percent -- asked for more treatment programs.
<p>
Clearly, citizens are aware of the devastating effect that drugs are having on 
society.  We are watching the addicts at the end of the pipeline getting 
older and sicker while seeing record numbers of young people enter the pipeline 
that leads to addiction.  In the face of all this, failure of leadership and lack of 
moral seriousness simply cannot be tolerated.  The federal government has to do a 
better job in this area.
<p>
There is no mystery to fighting drugs effectively.  This job is doable.  The
combined effort of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough and intelligent law
enforcement, accountability within the drug treatment system, and a morally firm 
attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in the last decade.  From the late 
1970s to the early 1990s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty 
percent.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost eighty 
percent.
<p>
I commend you for holding these hearings and for the attempt to bring the drug 
issue to the top of the national political agenda.  That is certainly where it belongs.  
I urge the legislative branch to put all possible pressure on the executive branch
seriously to take up the fight.  We've done it before, and it was successful.  
Let's do it again.

<h2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> 
<P><i>December 12, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
Toward the close of my tenure as secretary of education, in a
speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America,
I called for a &quot;transformation of government policy to match,
and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;  I
was referring to the public's recognition that drug use was no
longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but a
personal, medical and economic catastrophe.  That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to '92 -- with
real results.  Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war.  But public sentiment, as this Gallup poll attests,
has not changed.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug
control policy with the federal government rightfully leading
the fight.
<P>
It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine in ten Americans
seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs
rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  Americans
should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use among adolescents
is once again on the rise after the steady and dramatic decline
of the 1980's and early 1990's.  According to the Center on Addiction
and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, &quot;the jump in
marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals that 820,000
more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of
that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and
addicts.&quot;  More bad news is that drug-related hospital emergency-room
cases -- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached
the highest levels since 1978.  Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.  
<P>
What Americans have witnessed -- and reacted to in the Gallup
Poll -- is the result of a failure of public policy brought about
by a moral torpor on the drug issue.  Policy follows attitude.
 But the public's attitude is not one of indifference toward the
scourge.  When asked what they wanted to see <I>a lot more</I>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <I>two-thirds</I>
cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United
States.  By contrast, <I>fewer than half</I> -- 43 percent --
asked for more treatment programs.
<P>
The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot; presents
a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support it received
in the Gallup poll.  Unlike the effective and modest treatment
programs sponsored by churches and using variants of the 12-step
method, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful
and ineffective.  From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment spending
almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment slots actually
declined.  And the discouraging result is that overall cocaine
treatment is not significantly reducing the polulation of hard
core addicts.  We must turn our support toward the proven models
of treatment, while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine
and crack addiction as yet one more compelling reason why preventing
casual drug use by the young -- the first step on the path to
addiction -- is so important.
<P>
Gallup poll respondents put drug interdiction high on their list
-- the percentage of those calling for increased efforts to reduce
the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was 88 percent.  Those
respondents are right  -- the government should put the U.S. military
in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our
borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction
process.  We know that strong interdiction works.  In 1989, the
U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down on the cocaine
cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking and interdiction
effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries
north.  These events produced substantial disruption in the cocaine
supply to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991.  Drugs were less available
on the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined;
reported cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy
users fell; and casual use dropped dramatically.  Today, U.S.foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once-strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated.   We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine-source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.  
<P>
More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict people for
the use and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America.  The response is wise on both counts.
 Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels.  The federal role requires the identification and dismantling
of all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating
in the U.S.   Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention
education are state and local responsibilities for which current
federal aid should be block granted without mandates.  
<P>
The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose legalization
of drugs send a strong message to those who would propose such
an option.  Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and
threatening to society because they are illegal.  They are illegal
because they are dangerous and  threatening to American society.
 Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.  On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization
-- and the overwhelming body of the American people who  reject
such a policy of despair. In the Gallup poll, the people have
again made that point.
<P>
Success in the drug war depends above all on what happens in America's
homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations, television
and movie screens, city streets and civic halls.  It depends on
the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy,  police chiefs, judges
and community leaders.  When I was President Bush's &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities.  I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better.  I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements.  The point is, we know what works.
 The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<h2>Colombia, America 's Favorite 'Narco-Democracy'</h2>
<h3>By WILLIAM J. BENNET AND JESSE HELMS</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has become one of the principal threats to our national security. More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Columbia -- which ships more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country -- completely off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.<p>

The administration's recent annual review of international cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a "national interest waiver" allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia despite its miserable record.<p>

This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has sent a troubling signal to all drug producing nations: The U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with the drug lords.<p>

Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably, become a "narco-democracy" -- a country with a facade of democratic government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine money. According to the administration's own background papers on Colombia:<p>

<ul>
<li>The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian government to exploit the banking system and launder vast sums of drug money with impunity.

<li>There is practically no effective investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current cases of corruption involving government officials (more than half of them senior level authorities).

<li>A "guilt-laundering" system exists, in which Cali drug lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining system that leaves their assets intact and allbws them to plead to minor charges.

<li>The government's eradication programs have been half-hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of opium and new cocaine cultivation.

<li>High-level government collusion enables the shipment of enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.

<li>There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential ties to the drug cartels.
</ul>

The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their blood money pervades almost all aspects of Colombia's political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in Colombia-from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.<p>

Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover and protection from international extradition, allowing these drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, where they destroy the lives of American children.<p>

We believe the Colombian government's collusion with the drug lords poses a direct threat to the national security of 'the U.S.  It is time to meet this threat head-on.  And since the Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume responsibility.  That is why a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue.  And why legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia by Feb. 6,1996, unless the president of the United States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. Congress he would enact.<p>

Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in Columbia; putting law enforcement resources behind investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major drug lords in Colombia; ending the "guilt-laundering" system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying 44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in Colombia by Jan. 1,1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. 1, 1997).<p>

The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.<p>

<title>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</title>

<h2>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[President Bush] hasn t fought a real war on crime and drugs, I will."</I><br>
	-Bill Clinton, Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992.<p>

During the first half of the Clinton presidency, the morally serious and tough-minded anti-drug policies of the Reagan and Bush years have been replaced with such Clinton-era messages as the president's infamous "I didn't inhale" comment and the former Surgeon General's repeated calls to study the legalization of drugs.<p>

Enforcement has been de-emphasized and Attorney General Janet Reno has decried the harshness of federal mandatory minimum prison terms for drug crimes, complaining that too many dealers are in prison.  Over the past two years, the administration and its Democratic congressional allies have slashed drug interdiction and domestic drug eradication activities.  Offering enforcement assistance to -- and if that did not work, sanctioning -- foreign countries where cocaine and other drugs are produced and shipped to the US. has ceased to be a foreign policy priority.  And the Clinton administration's announced priority?  Drug treatment.  Yet neither the president nor the Democratic leaders in the 103rd Congress provided the treatment resources they said were needed most.  In this area, as in so many others, the President al said one thing and did another.<p>

The results of the administration's indifference are now in.  And they are not good.<p>

Last July, the White House released a "Pulse Check" on "national trends in drug abuse" reporting that supplies of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs were plentiful.  And in mid-December, the Clinton administration announced that, in 1994, illegal drug use by teenagers -- specifically 8th, 10th, and 12th graders -- rose sharply in 1994.  (See chart.)<p>

In response, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University warned, "If historical trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of 3 these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts."<p>

The administration also revealed that drug-related emergency-room cases-- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached the highest levels ever, in reporting going back to 1978.  Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to record levels.<p>

Put another way: if these trends continue, by 1996, the Clinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern American history. And this will have occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992, and a reduction of almost 30 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992.<p>

President Clinton has shown little concern about the carnage drugs cause.  Where violent street crime once seemed to be fed largely by battles between cocaine and crack dealers, drug testing of urban arrestees reveals most of them are drug users and under the influence of drugs when they commit a wide array of violent crimes.<p>

Drug use is also a major contributing factor to child abuse. Last April, Newsweek magazine published a long article on child abuse. It reported what those working in the field have known for years: "Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common." In the same month, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story which profiled of a group of homeless, street people in New York City.  All the individuals featured in the article were drug addicts.  Whether it is violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs, -- and in particular crack cocaine -- have made those social pathologies far more acute and in some places, unmanageable.  While there are other factors contributing to these pathologies, it is crack that sustains the violence that is ripping apart large segments of American society.<p>

We believe two myths present serious obstacles to reducing such drug use.  First is the mantra that the root causes of drug use are poverty, racism and slow self-esteem."  And second is the more general view that therapy by a team of counselors, physicians and specialists is the only effective way to reduce drug use.  At their core these myths deny individual responsibility and, assume that drug use is not the product of an individual's decision, and that decisions are somehow made in a vacuum where things like f ear of getting caught, public disgrace and punishment are never considerations.  This attitude is precisely what got us in trouble in the first place.  Reversing the new drug epidemic and finishing the job of the Reagan and Bush years, requires restoring common sense about the drug problem and a recognition of the primary importance of the things contemporary liberalism has sought to discredit: enforcement, individual responsibility, and reducing the supply of drugs on our streets.<p>

Drug enforcement and individual responsibility are important because drug use can be intensely pleasurable.  The desire for drugs must be countered by certain moral precepts: drug use is wrong and those who use and traffic in illegal drugs deserve to be punished.  A responsible community teaches these things by what those in positions of authority -- parents religious leaders, teachers, friends, employers and political officials -- say about drugs and how they act toward drug use and sale.  If those in authority do not address the issue seriously, they teach that drug use is not a serious matter. And if they say
 drug use is intolerable but fail to act effectively to stop and punish those who sell and use drugs, their actions convey a much more powerful lesson than their words.<p>

Reducing the supply of drugs is important because drug use -- whether by non-addicts or
 addict -- is fueled by the desire to use and by the ease with which those who want drugs can obtain them. A nation that permits wide availability of dangerous drugs is sending its citizens particularly its youngest citizens an unwitting message: We are indifferent to drug use. The harsh reality is that drug use begins with experimentation, with a substantial portion escalating to addiction, which often ends in death. A free democratic society ought to display a special intolerance for those things that destroy people's
 virtue and eventually, destroy people's lives.<p>

There are some who believe the drug war is unwinnable.  They argue that the federal government has spent enormous sums of money to no effect and they assert that the drug trade is too rich and too powerful to be defeated. This is the "big lie" about the drug problem, and it is demonstrably false  The success of the 1980's gives witness to the lie.<p>

First the energy and resources devoted to the anti-drug effort during the last two administrations, combined with hardening public attitudes, produced dramatic declines in the drug problem. No other contemporary social pathology has declined by 50-80 percent.  The drug war was a huge domestic policy success that some have simply denied and are now dismantling.<p>

Second, while federal spending on the drug war was substantial, it only approached $12 billion at the end of the Bush years. At no time did such spending exceed federal spending for, say, NASA. The point here is that neither the space program nor the federal and-drug effort ever represented a serious burden in terms of the federal budget And busting the budget today is not required either. In fact, for the president to devote only a modicum of his valuable time seriously, to the drug issue can make a significant difference.<p>

Finally, there is no question that the drug trade has created some very wealthy and powerful criminals here and abroad. But they are not invincible. They corrupt and terrorize third-world countries and inner-city communities, largely because they are not seriously challenged. In 1989, Pablo Escobar was the well-known king of the Medellin Cartel, the seemingly unconquerable "King of Cocaine." A year later he was on the run. Eventually, even the corruption-plagued Colombian government was able to hunt him down and destroy the Medellin Cartel in the process.<p>

Our drug problem will continue to get worse until we once again pursue responsible, intelligent, and tough-minded policies. We have the means, it is simply a matter of whether we have the will. Consider this question: what would be the national response if a foreign-produced poison was contributing to the large-scale killing of white children in Chevy Chase, or Scarsdale, or Scottsdale? Would we have long debates about "root causes" -- or would we do whatever it took to close open-air drug markets, put an end to the killing, and stop the poison from reaching our children? We all know the answer to this question. It's time federal policy showed the same kind of concern for poor black inner city residents as it does for residents of upper middle class white neighborhoods.<p>

<h2>A record of failure in drug treatment</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[We] should deal with the drug problem in a far more heads-up manner than we are now with two things.  Number one, treatment on demand without delay . . . The second thing we ought to do is find an alternative for first-time drug offenders."</I><br>
	--Bill Clinton, address at Georgetown University, December 12, 1991.<p>

Today's addicts are the most visible casualties of both the permissive culture and the drug fad of the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's.  These addicts have moved up in the ranks from casual users.  They are largely aging, never married, and predominately male.  Most commit crimes - including selling drugs - as a means of income to purchase drugs. They are also largely concentrated among blacks and live in our inner cities.  While these addicts constitute the single largest demand for heroin and cocaine in the United States, they  also use a variety of other drugs (particularly marijuana) and alcohol.<p>

The overwhelming reaction to this problem has been a call for more drug treatment.  "Treatment on
 demand" is the preferred weapon of many in the drug fight. In fact, many liberals have argued the rational and humane response to drug addiction is to shift resources from drug enforcement and supply reduction to drug treatment.<p>

There are a number of very sophisticated and very effective drug treatment programs (many of which we visited), including very modest ones sponsored by churches and using
 variants of the 12-step method.  These are often every bit as effective as much more expensive and elaborate programs.  But the typical discussion of drug treatment in the press and by the government reflects a dangerous ignorance of the most basic facts.<p>

First, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  From fiscal 1988 to fiscal l994, federal drug treatment spending almost tripled.  At the same lime, however, the number of treatment slots remained virtually unchanged and the estimated number of people treated actually declined by 145,000.  Why?  As with much of government, it is because the bureaucracies have consumed more and more of the resources, leaving less and less for services.<p>

Bureaucratic waste and inefficiency aside, the number of addicts served per year, measured in terms of persons served per year, is equivalent to more than half the total estimated number of cocaine and heroin addicts.  Clearly, when given the chance, the bulk of these programs are not that successful.<p>

A substantial number of addicts have attended several treatment programs.  The real-world fact is that many treatment programs are simply not effective.  In addition, federal treatment funds continue to e distributed largely on the basis of population, even though we know that addicts are concentrated in our major cities.  And there has been no effort to ensure that addicts are placed in appropriate programs.  Today, out-patient treatment slots predominate when most experts argue that the only reasonable hope of successfully treating today's hard-core addicts is to place them in long-term, residential treatment.  Bush Administration efforts to make programs accountable - to cut off support to those that did not produce results, and match resources with the need-were not enacted by Democratic leadership in Congress.  And the Clinton Administration has abandoned all such efforts.<p>

In last year's crime bill large sums were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were highlighted by liberals who announced that they were being "smart and tough."  The model, and essentially the justification, for this funding was the Miami Drug Court and Attorney General Janet Reno's personal involvement with it as prosecutor.  But last August, as the crime bill fight was near its peak, the Miami Herald published a lengthy report raising serious questions about the effectiveness of the program.  In particular, the program established to divert first-and second-time drug offenders into treatment instead of prison was being used by robbers and burglars to serves as little as 45 days.  .And in December the Herald reported that the chief judge overseeing the Miami drug court order an audit of the entire program, expressing alarm that it "had no mechanism to measure whether it was succeeding" A central flaw in the rush to embrace drug courts as a major answer to addiction and crime is that a very large number of addicted offenders today are long-term, hard core addicts who are poorly suited for diversion program.  Drug courts, properly run, may hold promise for treating young addicts.  But young addicts are not the primary problem.<p>

Last year, two groups of studies were released that purport to demonstrate the effectiveness of drug treatment and its superior cost effectiveness to all other categories of drug-enforcement and supply control.  One, funded by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, received attention for its conclusion that treatment "averages [a] $7 return for every invested."  But it included both alcohol and drug addiction and was thus too broad to be enlightening in regard to the cost-effectiveness of treating cocaine, and particularly crack, addiction -- the most destructive addiction threat today.  None of the sympathetic news reports noted that such "benefits-to-society-for-every-dollar-invested" studies for expenditures on prisons and jails have produced estimates as high as 17-to-1.<p>

A second, widely-reported study, was funded in part by the White House drug office, and conducted by the RAND Corp.  It was entitled "Controlling Cocaine," and concluded that "treatment is seven times more cost effective in reducing cocaine consumption than the best supply control program." Most of the press reports on the release of this study failed to mention that even Clinton Administration drug office officials participating in the release distanced themselves from the reliability of the methods RAND used to measure the effectiveness of supply control programs. And to our knowledge none of the press reports explained what the study actually found in regard to the effectiveness of programs treating cocaine addicts.<p>

In reviewing all forms of cocaine treatment, RAND found that 20 percent of addicts continue using drugs while in treatment and only 13.2 percent of the cocaine addicts treated reduce their drug use below weekly or more frequent use (what RAND defined as "heavy use") during the year following their treatment Overall, RAND reported, only "6 percent of heavy users leave heavy use each year [i.e., to something less than heavy use, not to be equated with no use]. About two-thirds of that out flow is apparently due to existing treatment programs . . . [and] one third of the total annual outflow from heavy use is estimated to be due to unassisted desistance from heavy use."<p>

In other words, overall, cocaine treatment is only 4 percent effective in reducing heavy use and only two percent more effective in reducing heavy use than no treatment at all. Needless to say, if the effectiveness of cocaine treatment were measured in terms of the percentage of addicts who stopped using cocaine altogether and for good, these numbers would be much, much smaller.<p>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, we need to face the harsh reality of cocaine and crack addiction: most addicts are likely do die from the effects of their addiction, sometime in their 40's, if not earlier.  This is yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use by young people -- the first step on the path to addiction -- is so important.<p>

As long as the drug problem is discussed in terms of treatment vs. Enforcement or supply vs. demand, it will remain fundamentally misguided. These dogmatic positions are at odds with both reality and common sense. An effective drug policy should begin with this assumption: as long as young people and those who receive treatment reside in communities where the supply of dangerous, addictive drugs remains plentiful -- i.e., where there is de facto legalization -- prevention and particularly treatment efforts will be severely undercut and for purposes of national policy, ineffective.<p>

<h2>Why aren't we attacking the supply of drugs?</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
In August, 1989, the Medellin Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, assassinated Colombian presidential candidate, Carlos Galan and publicly declared war on the Colombian government In response, Colombian-President Virgilio Barco launched an intense attack on the cocaine cartels.  Shortly after that crackdown began, the US military deployed the most extensive detection, tracking, and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries north.  These events produced a substantial disruption in the cocaine supply to the US from 1989 to 1991, with striking consequences for cocaine and crack addicts.  For example, during the fall of l989, and well into1991,federal law enforcement agencies reported that cocaine trafficking groups were experiencing problems securing cocaine or securing it in a timely manner, even at a higher price.<p>

Reductions in the supply of cocaine to the US market are reflected at the retail level by an increase in street prices, a decline in purity, or both, or by scarcity if the disruption is large and sudden enough.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) compiles data on cocaine prices throughout the nation and issues quarterly and annual reports.  The data reveal that in gram amounts (the accepted retail measure), a downward trend in prices and upward trend in purity abruptly reversed in late 1989.<p>

The magnitude of the change in availability is best represented by using a standardized price; that is, a price that reflects both price and purity changes by calculating the cost of a 100 percent-pure gram of cocaine for each year.  Not surprisingly, the reduction in the availability of cocaine coincided with a 27 percent reduction in cocaine emergency room cases between 1989 and 1990.<p>

Medical examiner reports of deaths related to cocaine use during this period also declined. Analysis initiated by the White House drug office and released in the publication "Price and Purity of Cocaine: The Relationship to Emergency Room Visits and Deaths, and to Drug Use Among Arrestees, found declines in cocaine emergency room cases, deaths, and cocaine use among arrestees for the 17 US cities for which data are available. In addition, cocaine prices increased and purity decreased.<p>

Further, the cocaine supply reduction also coincides with a decline in the estimated number of heavy cocaine users (i.e., cocaine and crack addicts) throughout the country.<p>

Even though the data are limited, the forced reduction in cocaine availability between the latter part of 1989 and the first half of 1991 seems beyond question.  That it was a key causal factor in the decline of cocaine use, particularly heavy use, is the most obvious and reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.<p>

In addition, we know from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that immediately prior to and during this period casual or nonaddictive use of cocaine dropped dramatically. While non-addictive users consume a much smaller quantity of cocaine than heavy or addicted users, an almost 80 percent drop in nonaddictive users between 1985 and 1992 certainly reduced demand significantly (though it cannot be measured by existing surveys and analyses). In order to increase cocaine retail prices and reduce purity, supply reduction efforts would have to cut supply beyond the surplus supply resulting from reduced demand by casual users. So the actual supply reduction was probably even greater in magnitude than the sizable change reflected in the price and purity data.<p>

The cost of the entire international drug control effort for programs and assistance to foreign countries rose from $209 million in fiscal year 1988 - to $660 million in 1992 (its peak); it moved from 4.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the federal drug control budget. Interdiction costs increased between 1988 and 1992, but almost that entire increase involved the estimated cost of Department of Defense (DOD) activities in support of the anti-drug effort.  And even with this increase, interdiction costs as a percentage of the federal drug control budget declined between FY 89 and FY92.<p>

If measured strictly by results, prevention efforts -- assisted by Presidents Reagan and Bush but primarily those carried out by parents, teachers, young people and communities throughout the nation -- made unprecedented progress in combating drug use (in particular, casual cocaine use declined dramatically). But contrary to what is viewed as settled fact by many in Washington, interdiction and cocaine source country programs seem to have been the crucial cause of the only reductions in heavy or addictive cocaine use in the past decade. The most intelligent approach to drug policy, then, is to work both the prevention and interdiction fronts; to integrate efforts instead of posing an either/or scenario.<p>

The obvious question to ask is: why didn't the reduction in cocaine supply continue throughout 1991 and beyond? The movement in the summer of 1991 of US. military resources to the Persian Gulf for Desert Shield and, later, Desert Storm, reduced interdiction coverage, particularly in regard to some of the most powerful airborne and surface naval systems.<p>

Those resources were never returned.  Today, all of the source-country governments are reducing efforts against the cocaine trade. And unfortunately there is no visible effort by the Clinton administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S. and throughout the world: which is a prescription for uncontrollable supplies of illegal drugs.  Which in turn is a prescription for even greater social chaos.<p>

<center><h2>Losing the Drug War Without a Fight</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
During the past 15 years, American society experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.  But during this period, there was one area against which we made significant progress: drug use.  Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug-taking.<p>

The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural shift.  During the  late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun or as mere self-indulgence.  But beginning at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use was all but impossible to deny, it became Increasingly -- and far more accurately -- seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.<p>

Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.  Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies.  As a result, overall drug use went down.  From the late 1970s to the early lS90s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by almost one half.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost 80%. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.<p>

But earlier this year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.  Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise.  Survey results for 1993 indicate a sharp increase in marijuana use for eighth- 10th- and 12th-grade students, as well as an increase in the use of stimulants, ISD and Inhalants.  And hospitals reported a record number of drug-related emergency-room visits in 1992, suggesting that heavy drug use is also on the rise.<p>

These findings should have mobilized the federal government to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens.  Instead, the Clinton administration has said little to encourage those fighting the good fight and has proposed fundamentally misguided policies.  Consider the record:<p>
<ul>
<li>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80%. 

<li>Soon after assuming office, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related federal crimes.  Her focus? She is engaged in a never-ending search for the "root causes" of crime and drug use.

<li>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies.

<li>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100 drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment strategy that will do little to target hard-core users.
</ul>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral torpor on the  issue.  Policy follows attitude.<p>

In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but "I didn't like it.  I didn't Inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."<p>

And then there is Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, the administration's loudest voice on drugs.  While President Clinton dissociated himself once from Dr. Elders's favorable words about drug legalization, she has continued to make such statements --and the president has done nothing effective to stop her.<p>

These statements are significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals they send.  One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic to occur in the first place was the collapse of institutional authority.  Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who early on served as President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that "cocaine is probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."<p>

Government officials, through legislation and public discourse, can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts.  In a free society, few things matter more than speaking about- the right things in the right way -- and making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.<p>

During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale."<p>

Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first 14 months of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations.  But today, on one of the Issues that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many of the children of the poor -- he and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  One would think that a little more concern and serious thought would come from a president who claims to "feel the pain" of those who suffer.<p>

<h2>Renewing the war on drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett<br>
and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through its indifference to rising drug use and its erosion of the moral and governmental foundations of the successful anti-drug efforts of the past two administrations, the Clinton Administration has put the nation on a dangerous path. The President bears the principal political responsibility for this record. And only he can use his office to begin to correct it. Congressional leaders in both parties should give him every possible to that.  If the Clinton Administration does not see the light, it should feel the political heat.<p>

As the past two years demonstrate, the nation cannot sustain an effective anti-drug effort without leadership. Congress, governors, mayors, and community leaders, need to meet this challenge.  There are specific roles to fill for federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private institutions that support our families and communities.<p>

<I>Restoring effective federal action</I><br>
The cornerstone of national anti-drug efforts is to give force to the principle that drug use is wrong, harmful and will not be tolerated. This principle should be embodied in the institutions of society, which, in turn, should be organized to give force to that principle.  Without the federal government doing its part, this endeavor will be much more difficult<p>

1. While efforts by the federal government are not sufficient, they are a necessary element of an effective national anti-drug effort.  Executive leadership begins with the president and his appointees in relevant executive agencies. The White House drug policy office was created - at the insistence of a Democratic Congress - to organize and lead the war on drugs. Right now that office is not doing its job, and the Clinton Administration made it largely irrelevant. The President should give someone the responsibility and the authority to get the executive branch, and the federal government, back in the fight.<p>

2. The world headquarters for the cocaine industry is Colombia. The era of meaningful partnership with that government has ended. And there are reliable press reports that the current president of Columbia received campaign money from the cartels. But the heart of the matter today is that U.S. and Colombian enforcement agencies know who the leaders of the cartels are and where they are. The Colombians could arrest or force into hiding the management of the cocaine industry, and disrupt the cocaine trade as they have done in the past. But there is no evidence the Colombian government has any intention of doing so. Occasional showy enforcement operations continue, but no real efforts are mounted and therefore no real progress is made. The US. government has done virtually nothing to give the legitimate interests in Colombian society reason to undertake the risk and effort of making their government put the cocaine trade out of business. It is time to give them such a reason. During the recent embargoes on Iraq and Haiti, experts warned that these measures are most effective when applied rapidly and totally against a trading ally. The US. accounts for more than 35percent of Colombia's licit foreign exports. Such action against Colombia would change the priority of anti-drug efforts throughout the international community.<p>

3. Put the US. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from abroad. Require federal law enforcement agencies responsible for drug interdiction to operate under the overall command and control of the military. This mission will require continuous adaptation because traffickers will inevitably try new avenues as the old ones become too costly. Some in the military will object to this non-traditional mission and its cost. But no law enforcement organization will ever have the intelligence and operational capabilities for the interdiction task that the military already possesses. Over the last few years the US. has used its military resources to protect poor and endangered citizens of other countries.  It is time-it is past time- to stop overlooking the poor and endangered in our cities.<p>

4.  The drug trade inside the US. relies on sophisticated senior management.  Despite periodic law enforcement successes, federal domestic enforcement agencies have produced no serious disruption of major trafficking operations.  And for the last two years the Clinton Administration has allowed the DEA, FBI, and other drug enforcement agencies to curry political favor with local authorities by assigning federal personnel to augment manpower for cases with no federal significance.  This might be acceptable if important federal responsibilities were being met.  But they are not.  We therefore need to establish clear federal drug enforcement priorities and hold enforcement authorities accountable for meeting them.  For example, the Attorney General should be required to prepare a report every six months identifying all major drug trafficking organization know to be operation in the US and  a plan to deploy federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal drug enforcement agencies contingent on effectively implementing this policy.<p>

5.  The Congress should combine existing federal aid to the states and localities for drug enforcement, prevention, and treatment (now, roughly $3.5 billion per year) into a single block grant distributed on the basis of population.  Individual program mandates should be abolished so states and localities can establish and pursue their own priorities for fighting drug use and drug crime.  Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are local responsibilities.  Washington's bureaucratic regulation has utterly failed to engender programs that foster local accountability.  Therefor, the new block grand should be designed to restore local responsibility by phasing them out after three years.  In this way, communities will have an incentive to use these funds for those activities that demonstrate sufficient merit to deserve long term support entirely from local sources.<p>

<I>Creating effective local action</I> <br>
6.  Drug prevention is central to all effective anti-drug efforts.  Young people who do not use drugs in their teens are unlikely to ever become involved with illegal drugs.  But each generation bust be taught that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful.  This lesson must be taught by the community as a whole; indeed, by our culture.  Children learn about drugs by what the adults around them as a whole say and do.  Parents teach by precept and example.  The same is true of schools and the communities.  If drug use and sale is not aggressively opposed and prevented, children learn it is acceptable despite what some adults may occasionally tell them.  Teaching drug prevention must be apart of teaching children right from wrong.  It will always fall to parents to provide that education in home and act to ensure that schools and their communities are teaching this lesson effectively.  This task is easier if national leaders set the right example and speak in support of parents.  But since that national support has seriously eroded, parents, churches, schools, youth organization, and communities are more important than ever.  They have always been, and will always remain, the first line of defense for children.<p>

7.  Open-air drug markets feed addiction and are a visible sign of the toleration of the drug trade in our nation.  It is a national disgrace that such markets are tolerated in virtually every major American city. Drug pushers cannot operate effectively when law enforcement personnel are present.  Forcing drug deals from open spaced makes their lives more difficult and dangerous and hence their activities less frequent.  Many communities have demonstrated that creating a law enforcement presence and maintaining it in response to relocation efforts by drug dealers is doable - but only if closing drug markets is made a priority.  In the next year, mayors, city councils, and police chiefs should pledge and make clear that they will insist that these officials keep it.  We need to stop claiming that the crime and drug problem in our communities is someone else's responsibility.  Decisive action can be taken by local officials and community members now.<p>

8.  Drug testing is a proven tool to discourage drug use by individuals in treatment and those in the criminal justice system.  Good treatment programs require regular testing and apply sanctions against individuals who relapse.  Drug testing arrestees provides a basis for using bail, sentencing, release conditions and other aspects of the criminal justice system to compel individuals to stop using drugs.  Including an extended period of regular testing after offenders complete their sentences, discourages a return to drug use and crime.  Positive drug tests must involve steadily escalating penalties (starting with a one or tow-day return to jail or a half-way house and moving to reincarceration for an extended period).  Most heavy drug users pass through the criminal justice system and any short-term of a drug testing program will save larger costs to the community in repeated criminal justice expenditures on the same individual land the damage their crimes do to the innocents.<p>

These eight steps - involving federal, state, local, and individual action - will reverse the dangerous resurgence of drugs that has occurred during President Clinton's watch.  These actions will help turn the country away from its present course and go a long way toward making progress in the war on drugs.  And that, in turn, will help America to become a safer, more decent and more civilized society.<p>

<blockquote>
<u><h3>Impact of Drug Use</h3></u>
<P>
 <B>Illicit drug use is extremely costly to society</B>.  One
study conducted by Columbia University's Center for Addiction
and Substance Abuse found that drugs cost New  York City alone
$20 billion annually, or 21 cents of every taxpayer's dollar.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug abuse is surpassed only by violent crime as the issue
Americans consider the most serious facing the nation</B>.  According
to a recent Gallup poll, 94 percent of Americans surveyed consider
the use of illegal drugs a &quot;crisis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<h3><U>Drugs &amp; Crime</h3></U>
<P>
 <B>The vast majority of criminals use drugs</B>.  Data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics studies show that 79 percent of state prisoners
in 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1991, and 83 percent
of youths in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987 had
used drugs at some point in their lives. <BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug use contributes to and exacerbates other crimes</B>.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that 31 percent of
prison inmates in 1991 had reported being on drugs at the time
of their offense.  In addition, more than 80 percent of reported
cases of child abuse involve illicit drug use by the abusing adult.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>The percentage of prisoners convicted of drug charges has
increased</B>. The number of persons convicted of violating federal
drug laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981, an increase
of 190 percent.  The number of drug trafficking convictions in
State courts more than doubled between 1986 and 1990.  In 1960,
approximately one out of every 25 prisoners was incarcerated on
drug charges; today, around one in three is.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
higher rate of  conviction and punishment of drug offenders</B>.
 More than 170,000 people were convicted of drug trafficking charges
in 1992, more than four times as many people so convicted just
four years earlier (before mandatory sentencing requirements).
 About half of those convicted were sent to prison, compared to
around 37 percent in 1986.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
significant increase in the average length of sentences imposed
on convicted drug traffickers</B>.  Since the U. S. Sentencing
Commission set guidelines on November 1, 1987, the average drug
sentence has more than tripled from 23.1 months in 1987 to 84.2
months in 1991.<BR>

It's both a political statement by one who's been  there and a human testimony by a young woman with an unusual literary maturity,  certainly when measured by contemporary standards. And if Ms. Dahlby, a  Cornell grad (physics major) now working for a high-tech corporation, reaches  perhaps too harsh a conclusion if a woman really loves the service, she'll  leave her more nuanced moments bear witness to things that too often get  trampled in the blind quest for total equality . . . and in the equally  blind attempt to pretend that half the species isn't female. <BR>  <BR>  I became aware of Karen Dahlby a few weeks ago, via the standard unsolicited  query. So-and-so, she wrote, gave me your name and thought that you might  be interested in reading my. . . plus the standard, always faintly humiliating  SASE. (Self Addressed Stamped Envelope, so the object of your supplication  doesn't have to pay for the privilege of telling you to get lost.) <BR>  <BR>  I know from SASE's. A decade or two ago, I'd tried my hand at another kind  of non-regulation military fiction: a Beltway novella about the encounter  of a disgraced Marine colonel and his long-ago lover, now a Congresswoman  determined to become the first female secretary of defense. A novel about  a woman captain running an Air Force Aircraft Maintenance Unit couldn't  be much farther out. And anyway, reading unsolicited manuscripts seems  as good a form of community service as any.<BR>  <BR>  The title, &quot;Placeholder,&quot; refers to the literal meaning of the  word lieutenant: an officer who stands in for an absent superior. The plot  centers on the relationship between the unit's officer-in-charge, Capt.  Alexandra Ahlquist, and her new lieutenant, Stephanie Leclair. Alexandra,  a career type who values integrity yet knows how to play the Air Force  game, has a few weeks to prepare her new lieutenant to run the unit before  she leaves for a temporary assignment in Saudi Arabia. Stephanie's former  enlisted, street smart, college-educated (electrical engineering), and  equally intent upon excellence. Yet she begins to infect Alexandra with  her doubts as to whether women should really be in that hangar at all.<BR>  <BR>  The human element becomes fascinating. Two young women commanding a couple  hundred men of various ratings, sizes, and intensities. But the women focus  on each other. They're doing the same things men do, yet doing them utterly  differently. The way Captain Ahlquist preps, mentors, and disciplines Lt.  Leclair there's an emotional edge, a calculated game-playing that, in a  man, would be both offensive and ineffective. The men keep their distance,  a diffidence compounded of respect, distaste, and backbrain knowledge of  what would happen to their careers, were they to get out of line. <BR>  <BR>  Alexandra leaves Stephanie in charge. While in Saudi, a stray thought occurs:  Might Stephanie be interested in one of her unit's most attractive males,  Master Sergeant Lombard? The wonder becomes obsessive and Alexandra realizes  the depth of her own, hitherto unadmitted, interest in the man. When she  returns, nobody will tell her what happened, personally or professionally,  except that &quot;Everything's OK.&quot; Stephanie and Lombard seem particularly  reticent, and Alexandra endures a double torture: not knowing about her  unit or her fantasy, because the system requires that women's shortcomings  remain unacknowledged. <BR>  <BR>  Stephanie decides to resign. No clear reasons given. None demanded. A few  weeks later, Alexandra tries to write to Stephanie about her own doubts,  but realizes that the relationship is over. Stephanie's gone on to other  things in another world. For Alexandra to follow her would be throwing  away her career and - she shudders - the only family she expects to have.  So she crosses out &quot;Stephanie&quot; and writes &quot;To Cadet Alexandra  Ahlquist&quot;:<BR>  <BR>  &quot;I want to tell you some things. Things someone should have warned  you about. You don't want the military. You like the military, sure, but  mostly because of the kind of people who are in it. The kind of men who  are in it, I mean. You can't win. You'll always be competing with, fighting,  the ones you really wanted to be on a team with. If you win, then you won't  be interested in being on their team anymore. If you lose, you'll feel  inferior. . . .&quot; <BR>  <BR>  She muses that &quot;things happen, but I never expected it would be so  common I'd get used to it. Broken families are no more shocking than broken  aircraft now. Now that I've seen the cases of rape, the cases that weren't  rape, the colonels having affairs with sergeants, the maternity uniforms  on unmarried girls, the bets on who goes to bed with whom . . .&quot; <BR>  <BR>  A few weeks later, a plane crashes. The cause is traced to a female sergeant  who'd been improperly trained, advanced, and supervised because she was  female. Alexandra knows how it will be handled.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;That meant, I told myself after I had found a shredder and fed the  report to it page by page, that because I was female, I could not depend  on the Air Force to tell me if I was incompetent. That meant that I could  be a danger to my own unit and no one would tell me. It meant that the  scope of the problems might be so great no one was going to say anything  because it would bring up questions about everything. It meant that as  long as there was anything political about women in the military I could  not trust the Air Force to do its job of being prepared for war.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;I called in sick the day after I read the accident report, and that  was not dishonesty.&quot; <BR>  <BR>  Unfair to the Air Force? Perhaps. Arguably, the Air Force has done the  best job of integrating women and still seems capable of some pretty heavy  warfighting. But women in the military is no longer a purely military,  or even a political issue. It's starting to suffuse the cultural debate,  and may well become a key battlefield in the Culture War. Perhaps it should.  <BR>  <BR>  To those opposed to women in all or part of the military, these passages  will be ammunition. To those whose only priority is &quot;women&quot; and  their &quot;rights,&quot; it probably won't matter. But is there any possible  middle stance, based on recognition that equality (not sameness) is a fact  of life that never shouldn't have been a fact of life, and that getting  it right must be a long and often messy affair? <BR>  <BR>  &quot;Placeholder,&quot; by its civility and complexity, contributes to  that possibility. Would that another woman, another vet, might write another  &quot;Placeholder,&quot; with a different point of view.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospacestudies at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute.</FONT></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></FONT></A><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><AHREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Rather a good local Russian  restaurant. Somebody asked Vladimir whether this was the kind of food he  ate at home. He smiled politely. An adequate response.</P>  <P>Dr. Vladimir Raskin, according to the invitation, is Deputy Director  for International Relations of the Moscow Research Center for Human Rights.  The Center is &quot;an outgrowth of the human rights work of the late Andrei  Sakharov and his widow, Elena Bonner, is on the board of directors.&quot;  Raskin, an engineer by training, &quot;has been doing human rights work  in Russia since the beginning of the decade.&quot; Slender, late thirtysomething,  light hair, bright eyes, and insofar as such physical types exist, clearly  Russian.</P>  <P>My sense of him: You can trust this man.</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin's presentation deals with freedom of expression and the state  of Russia's media - an appropriate topic for &quot;the second event of  the Freedom of Expression Program of the Henry M. Jackson School of International  Relations, University of Washington, funded by a grant from the Henry M.  Jackson Foundation and co-sponsored by the Discovery Institute.&quot; So  states the invitation. This will be an evening of words about words.</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin's English is excellent. His words are plain, a simplicity  common to those who've known extreme experiences and uncertainty and danger  as a way of life. What does it mean to have done &quot;human rights work&quot;  since the beginning of the decade? Depends on where you do it, I suppose.  Those who've had extreme experiences of any kind do not need extreme words  to describe them. In this case, &quot;human rights work&quot; will do.  But it helps to look in their eyes when they talk, and to imagine what  they've seen besides you.</P>  <P>According to Dr. Raskin, there is now freedom of expression in Russia,  insofar as the central government no longer does what it once did. The  problems come from other sources: local officials, the new business class,  and crime. The media can't support themselves on subscribers and, apparently,  advertising's not that far advanced. So they get government support or  draw business money. In either case, it's the old story. Take care around  those who feed you, or who can make your life difficult, or take it from  you. &quot;The media practice self-censorship,&quot; he says.</P>  <P>Other problems: While the Moscow and Petersburg media have vastly improved,  their reach is still limited and most Russians care primarily for local  news, which is where the strictures are. &quot;People are poor,&quot; he  says. &quot;They can't afford to subscribe to more than one newspaper.  They want the local news.&quot; And also, he adds, they want their news  from media that confirm their own political beliefs and, in some cases,  personal prejudices. The best thing that could happen to the Russian media,  he believes, would be foreign investment. So far, that hasn't happened.</P>  <P>The trend in this country is toward the local. We believe it enhances  our freedom. When foreigners buy American media, people howl. Clearly,  when it comes to promoting democracy, one size does not fit all.</P>  <P>The talk turns to that peculiarly American cultural artifact, infotainment.  Yes, it's trivial and it trivializes, but it's also a very flexible format  and can be a dandy weapon, if used adroitly. Might a Russian infotainment  prove useful? Dr. Raskin laughs. Russian writers have a long history of  embedding their real messages. True enough, but there's still a difference  between Dostoevsky and &quot;Hard Copy.&quot; Not to worry: Russia's getting  that, too. There's a growing market for scandal. And, in any event, the  profits off trash can subsidize other work.</P>  <P>Does anybody in Russia care about NATO expansion? Not really. The south  is the problem, not the west. What about Lebed? There's always a chance  that he'll grow. How do you become a journalist in Russia? You go to the  university. You get the degree. And then you look for the job. What kinds  of people go into human rights work? All kinds. Why do you think that Americans  have been so indifferent to the miracles happening in Russia, and the agonies?</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin pauses. But it's not a pause of self-censorship - a don't-offend-the-check-writers  thing. There's a moment in his eyes, of his eyes, before he answers. &quot;I  think it's because they're busy with their own problems.&quot; All existence,  like all politics, is local. I remember a line from the film version of  Solzhenitsyn's <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan </I>Denisovich. You can't  expect somebody who's warm to understand somebody who's cold. Or to understand  the relationship between extreme experiences and simple words.</P>  <P>The man sitting next to me asks me why I think Americans haven't responded.  A fair question, since I asked Dr. Raskin and that gets him off the hook.  I answer that I don't think we're capable of responding. Left unsaid, self-censored:  You can't expect somebody who's warm to understand somebody who's cold.</P>  <P>And also, in a certain sense, nations are a lot like people. To those  who are faking it, the existence of those who aren't can be an awful reproach.  Better not to look in their eyes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a regular columnist for the Washington Times.</I></B></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>

No USSR, no new  Axis is likely to appear.</P>  <P>2)  It is possible, indeed probable, that sometime within the next few  years, thousands of Americans, perhaps many times that number, will be  killed or injured by a nuclear, biological, or chemical Weapon of Mass  Destruction (WMD) &shy; the greatest carnage on this continent since the  Civil War. The people I talk to in the military and in counter-terrorism  tell me that, given the proliferation of these weapons and a variety of  crude but functional delivery means, it's now a matter of when, not if.</P>  <P>3)  The United States has no real defense against such attacks and,  apparently, no serious intention of acquiring one. Continental ballistic  missile defense is nonexistent, air defense not much better. Counter-terrorism  is parceled out among literally hundreds of agencies, inter-agency groups,  and task forces.</P>  <P>4)  The United States will spend over $300 billion this year on defense  and an array of defense related activities. Most of this money will go  for expeditionary forces, i.e., forces intended and configured to fight  elsewhere. Nobody believes that this force can be maintained, let alone  modernized, on any conceivable peacetime budget.</P>  <P>5)  Humanitarian and other-than-war uses of the military may be expected  to increase. That inserts us into the problems and passions of others.</P>  <P>6)  A lot of these &quot;others,&quot; and a lot of their supporters,  wouldn't mind hurting us.</P>  <P>     From this admittedly unoriginal assessment, two equally unoriginal  conclusions emerge. The first is that there's no money, at least if present  spending patterns and priorities are maintained. The second is that, the  more we mess in other people's problems - or, if you prefer, the more we  exercise &quot;global leadership&quot; and keep our commitments - the more  likely we are to get hit at home.</P>  <P>     So what's a country to do?</P>  <P>     For starters, recognize two facts of life and begin to ponder the  implications of a third.</P>  <P>1)  When you aggregate a current miscellany  of activities - anti-missile  and anti-air defense, defense against WMD delivered by other means, counter-terrorism,  drug interdiction, border control - you find that they add up to homeland  defense, which is the first mission of any democracy's military.</P>  <P>2)  The United States only needs homeland defenses if we pursue an activist  foreign policy. Were America to embrace genuine isolationism, there would  be scant need for Fortress America. Many people would still hate us, but  few would care to attack us and risk retaliation. Leadership and activism,  not isolationism, require homeland defense. Not having it means that, someday,  a president may have to choose between disaster and submission to threat  or blackmail.</P>  <P>3)  In human conflict, as in all other aspects of contemporary existence,  previously clear boundaries are blurring. It may no longer be possible  to make neat distinctions between war and crime, i.e., between the military  and law enforcement spheres. When subnational groups and even individuals  may have the power to do us more harm than most nation-states, it's a new  world. The military may prefer only to do certain things under certain  conditions. It may no longer be possible to honor those preferences.</P>  <P>     But how to defend the homeland when threats are diffuse, cash running  low, and  dangers to civil liberties and constitutional rights only too  apparent? The answer may lie in two words: dual use - systems and organizations  that can function in both expeditionary and homeland defense roles.</P>  <P>     At the hardware level, for example, anti-missile systems designed  to protect troops in the field and theater-level operations might be adapted  for domestic use against shorter-range missiles. Ships can protect the  coast of New Jersey as well as the coast of Saudi Arabia. At the people  level, the National Guard - too often and too easily dismissed as archaic  - is a classic dual use system. Available to both governors and the president,  the Army Guard is on-site, knows the physical and human territory, and  already performs a variety of quasi-military/quasi-law enforcement missions  of relevance in homeland defense. It's a far more appropriate force for  working with local police and disaster relief agencies than federal troops.  The Air Guard has long held continental air defense responsiblities. Whatever  the Guard's value as the nation's expeditionary reserve (a value greater  than many care to admit), its potential as a homeland defense force is  enormous. </P>  <P>     But will anybody get serious about homeland defense before some  disaster gets everybody asking why nobody ever got serious about homeland  defense? One indicator may be the Quadrennial Defense Review now underway  at the Pentagon. The history of such efforts, most recently the Commission  on Roles and Missions, indicates that they generate little save uneasy  compromises, artful dodging, and <I>per diem</I> claims. This one may be  different, given that it may no longer be possible to &quot;ration the  poverty&quot; among the services. But cuts themselves mean less than restructuring,  the realignment of roles and missions, and - could it happen? - at least  a theoretical recognition of the growing need for homeland defense.</P>  <P>      Deputy Defense Secretary John White, who chaired the last commission,  claims that &quot;Everything is on the table.&quot; To translate from Beltwayese  into plain English, that  usually means that a rather intricate charade  is about to begin, an elaborate pretense resulting in little real change.  Perhaps this time will be different. And  one indicator of real change  could be whether homeland defense - <I>the common defense</I> - even gets  to the table at all.</P>  <P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based Discovery  Institute and director of &quot;ReVisioning Defense: Protecting the People,  Defending the Defenders,&quot; a Discovery Institute project in cooperation  with the Heritage Foundation.</I></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P> </P><P>      </P><P> </P><P>     <BR></BODY></HTML>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I learned about the Bucks County Coffee Company through the
younger sister of a former lover. She's a regional manager now. The sister,
not the lover (a Carter White House staffer now wed to a gentleman squire
farmer. We talk.) I did a magazine story on the company five years ago,
a favorable piece which duly impressed the boss of the sister of the lover,
and which garnered me a pass to their coffee nut &amp; chocolate warehouse
whenever I happen to visit Langhorne, Pa. I'll probably get another batch
of goodies out of this essay, but that's not why I'm writing it. I tell
myself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bucks got going in 1981, when Rodger Owen, a Navy veteran and bored executive,
bought a book on nuts, 25 pounds of cashews, and a little deep fat fryer
that he had a volunteer fireman rig up in his garage. After saturating his
primary market (the neighbors) he rented a 300 square foot carriage house
in downtown Yardley, Pa., conveniently near the town's only traffic light.
Rodger started advertising mail-order nuts in the <I>New Yorker</I> under
the name &quot;Squire's Choice&quot; (an unintended reference to the sister
of one of his future regional managers). He prospered, went into coffee,
named the new endeavor after its home, and today the Buck County coastal
empire boasts 42 stores, coffee houses, and kiosks from New Jersey to Washington,
DC. The coffee is good. The service is friendly. The Emperor presides. And,
until the arrival of the Conquistadors, there was peace.<BR>
<BR>
According to <I>Newsweek's</I> 18 September article, &quot;Not in My Backyard,&quot;
Starbucks has over 970 stores, with plans for 2,000 by 2000. But a popular
backlash may be developing, as non-northwest indigenous peoples struggle
to protect their local coffee cultures from the depredations and ravishments
of the newcomers. Indeed, if you believe a student columnist in <I>the Daily
Princetonian</I>, &quot;Starbucks is notorious for waiting for other coffee
shops to create a niche and then coming in with its sleazy old brand-name
recognition and usurping all the business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Bucks has a coffeehouse/Internet caf&eacute; in Princeton. Starbucks recently
opened down the street. Still, since Bucks' Princeton facility attracts
far more townspeople than students, and since the author (a certain Snow
Tempest, '97, English major) never mentions Bucks, but does allude to &quot;Small
World Coffee&quot; and &quot;Harry's Luncheonette,&quot; one may assume
that she neither flacks for Bucks nor has access to their warehouse.<BR>
<BR>
Rodger Owen lacks Ms. Tempest's, well, tempestuousness. Indeed, he exudes
benign serenity and multicultural tact. Owen says that in the areas where
Bucks and Starbucks go bean-to-bean, he's holding his own. &quot;In many
ways, they're a good competitor. It's not like going against Wal-Mart. You're
not forced to compete on price.&quot; He knows that in some places Starbucks
has conducted saturation operations. Still, says Owen, &quot;Starbucks is
good for the business because they help build awareness of coffee.&quot;
Then he warns: &quot;Starbucks needs competition. People are fickle. If
Starbucks were the only [specialty] coffee purveyor, people will find another
beverage.&quot; <BR>
Concludes Mr. Owen: &quot;I have nothing but admiration for Starbucks. They
put out a quality product. They don't cut corners. Our biggest virtue is
that they're great and we're not them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
How exquisitely multicultural. <I>They're great and we're not them</I>.
In fact, it's surprising how many ways Starbucks differs from its alternative-coastal
coffee competition. The eastern tribes generally prefer lighter roasts.
Starbucks roasts so darkly that some among the natives call it, &quot;Charbucks.&quot;
The eastern tribes like flavored coffees. Starbucks eschews such undeveloped
tastes. Starbucks sells mostly drop-in and carry-out beverages. Bucks earns
over half its money in bean sales, much of that bought in supermarket kiosks
that often double as real-reality chat rooms Starbucks has moved into milk-based
beverages. Bucks makes a mocha crush that can give a frappacino chills,
but still concentrates on the hot stuff, which it offers in a polystyrene
cup that, Rodger asserts, is both easier to handle and more environmentally
benign than Starbuck's finger-stinging paper.<BR>
<BR>
Yet none of this really captures the spiritual aspect of east coast coffee,
or suggests that Starbucks can operate for long in such hostile territory
without spiritual damage of its own. The eastern tribes live harried lives.
Rodger sells them moments of peace, quiet times in the morning and evening
when they withdraw into themselves with their mix of French Roast and Hazelnut
(two-thirds/one-third), or Costa Rica La Minita Estate, or Yemen Mocha Mattari,
or Amaretto, or Ethiopia Yirgacheffe. In fact, says Rodger, &quot;People
enjoy standing in line for their coffee. I've been criticized by some of
my landlords because my lines are too long. I tell them it's their morning
pause. And,&quot; he adds, &quot;maybe a chance to stand in line next to
some one interesting.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Bucks offers solace, communion, the call of the mini-retreat. Starbucks,
curiously, has taken on the frenetic quick-in/quick-out ambiance of the
eastern tribes. (Try DC's Dupont Circle and Georgetown locations if you
want to get jolted by more than caffeine.) It's as though the natives have
reserved their gentleness and grace for their own, meanwhile corrupting
the intruders with their coarser ways.<BR>
<BR>
If so, it wouldn't be the first time in history that Conquistadors found
themselves afflicted with the ills of the conquered. Nor would it be inappropriate
to suggest that some of the east coast's native remedies for incivility
and spiritual unease might have value here. If not as a civility therapy
(none needed, yet), then as an exercise in applied multiculturalism. Says
Rodger: &quot;Starbucks has come here. East coast coffee has never gone
west.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Celebrate diversity, Seattle. Try some east coast coffee. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

</H5>
<H5></H4><FONT FACE="Palatino"><FONT SIZE=3>We have crafted an era as abhorrent
to the future as to the past. Bill Clinton's as good a symbol of that era
as any.<BR>
<BR>
When John Kennedy wanted to author a book that would help him toward the
white House, he assembled (with <I>mucho</I> assistance from my old Georgetown
colleague, Jules Davids) <I>Profiles in Courage</I>. Jimmy Clinton borrowed
Admiral Rickover's imperious question, <I>Why not the Best?</I> for his
tome's title. Now Mr. Clinton has allowed his name to be associated with
<I>Between Hope and History</I> - an allusion to the site of his birth and
the locale where he will be remembered for at least eternity. A more accurate
title might have been,<I> Between Hype and Hubris. </I>A less pretentious
alternative: <I>The Gospel According to Bill</I>.<BR>
<BR>
This canonical (or is it apocryphorical?) document, written in a style perhaps
best described as trickle-down prose, begins by reminding the Republic that
&quot;[t]his book continues the conversation I have had with the American
people about our destiny as a nation . . . The Proverbs teach us that 'Where
there is no vision, the people perish.' I ran for President in 1992 because
I thought that our nation lacked a unifying vision for our future.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
So<I> that's</I> why he did it.<BR>
<BR>
The text next informs us that The Unifying Vision consists of Opportunity,
Responsibility and Community, all of which have been heftily advanced since
that magical moment when Bill took over. He offers hard examples - facts
and statistics spinning so wildly and weirdly that it's a wonder they stay
on the page - and buttresses them with Vivid Personal Examples. I remember
in 1992 how he responded so touchingly to the pain of a thirtysomething
male who moaned out at a rally, &quot;We're your children.&quot; My personal
favorite from this text: How an immigrant hotel worker, complaining that
his son wasn't safe on the streets, asked him, &quot;If I vote for you,
will you make my boy free?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The text does not record Mr. Clinton's response. Perhaps it ran along the
lines: &quot;Your faith has made him free. Go and sin no more.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In short, this book is pure political pap. Sensitivity aside, Phil Gramm
could have written it. But what makes this paean to vision so repellent
is the character (as buzzy a word of the 90s as relevance was to the 60s)
of the official author.<BR>
<BR>
In <I>Boy Clinton</I>, R. Emmett Tyrrell assesses that character. Mr. Tyrrell
might fairly be described as the John Wayne of conservative journalism.
You read him to read Tyrrell; the subject is the vehicle for the star. Tyrrell
has the virtue of consistency. A 60s campus conservative and founding editor
of &quot;The American Spectator,&quot; a fine and lively rag, what you see
is what you get. <I>Boy Clinton</I> is vintage Tyrrell: a stream of reportage
and scornfest, moving with the speed of, well, white water. He views Mr.
Clinton, his missus, and their breed as no more than 60s phonies, half student
council nerds, half countercultural radicals-of-convenience, who have learned
nothing and forgotten northing . . . and whose self-righteousness blinds
them even to their own criminality. <BR>
<BR>
Writes Mr. Tyrrell: &quot;They began their public lives in the petty charlatanry
of student government and ended in the 1990s as fit objects for grand jury
inquiries, government subpoenas, congressional investigations . . . chaos
is what he and Hillary are pleased to call public service.&quot; Mr. Tyrrell
also considers matters of sexual manners and mores, drugs, cash, and truth.
He concludes by predicting the Clintons' &quot;massive rejection by the
electorate.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And yet, massive rejection is precisely what is not happening. One reason
may be the sheer joy that Mr. Tyrrell and his legions take in trashing the
president. Mr. Tyrrell notes that, in 1992, Gennifer Flowers' charges got
lost amid the smarminess. Here they get lost amid the cleverness. And, in
a sense, Mr. Tyrrell has also learned nothing and forgotten nothing. He's
still fighting the 60s. Perhaps it's time to stop.<BR>
<BR>
And yet, the brilliant ineptitude of Mr. Tyrrell's assault - or the piteous
ineptitude of Mr. Dole's campaign - do not explain Mr. Clinton's resilience.
Jodie Allen, writing in &quot;Slate&quot; Magazine, argues that Clinton
may be the Nixon of the 90s - you hold your nose and give him his landslide.
Yet even this explanation seems inadequate. Time after time, in conversations
with liberals (especially women), people tell me that they like Mr. Clinton
because they see something of themselves in him. By conventional standards,
this would be impossible, or at least something you wouldn't want to brag
about. To what are these people relating? Certainly not his bimbos, his
draft record, his infatuation with cruise missiles, his ability to sell
you down the river (cabinet nominees, gays, welfare). Certainly not his
invocations of a morality that makes vanilla Dairy Queen positively piquant
by comparison. <BR>
<BR>
What's turning these people on?<BR>
<BR>
The answer may be as simple as it is ugly. We live in the Age of Getting
Away with It. Bill Clinton, more than any other American, Gets Away with
It. Part of this derives from the nature of politics. So many groups, so
many millions, believe they've nowhere else to go. They let him get away
with it. His personal morals may be repellent . . . but hey, who are we
to be judgmental? He gets away with it. Conservatives decry him as a pathological
liar. But hey, that's the way it is today. You know, image versus reality,
spin control. Everybody plays that game; Bill just plays it better. So he
gets away with it. And he gets away with it because he's more than the first
Baby Boomer president. He's also the first slacker president. Maureen Dowd,
writing in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; suggests that, while we may secretly
fear that we can't live up to Bob Dole's standards, we know we can meet
Bill Clinton's.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps. But he also gets away with it as a child would. He's a spoiled
prodigy who never got over it. He's a weird, postmodern Tom Sawyer. He's
&quot;Home Alone.&quot; He's Robin Williams in &quot;Jack.&quot; And we
treat him as such.<BR>
<BR>
We may or may not be Bill Clinton's children. He's certainly our child.
The Bible predicted that a child would lead. But history indicates that,
when children try, there's little reason for hope. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Great news from the Culture War. <BR>
<BR>
Political Correctness has entered its Brezhnev era. <BR>
<BR>
PC isn't dead, of course. Far from it. But the time has come to state, with
the serene certitude that only a vague metaphoric prophecy can generate,
that President Clinton (especially if re-elected) will go down in history
as the Leonid Brezhnev of PC . . . and that, five years from now, we may
be referring to the current Vice President as &quot;Goreby.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Here's what's coming down. <BR>
<BR>
The Brezhnev era (for those fortunate enough to know nothing about it) roughly
describes the Soviet Union during the twenty years between Nikita (&quot;Hare-Brained
Schemes&quot;) Khrushchev's enforced retirement and Mikhail (the original
&quot;Gorby&quot;) Gorbachev's ascent, i.e., mid-1960s to mid-1980s. The
Brezhnev clique and claque shipped Mr. K. back to his dacha for, among other
schemes, putting missiles in Cuba, wheat farms in Siberia, and venom in
the Sino-Soviet snuggle-fest. Gorby had only one hare-brained scheme: thinking
he could make communism work by giving people a taste of late 20<SUP>th</SUP>
century western alternatives (How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after
they've seen MTV?). But what concerns us here are the years between the
schemes, and what they tell us about the human soul. <BR>
<BR>
The Brezhnev era apparatus seemed omnipresent, invincible, expanding almost
at will. The Bolshies had also gone affluent. The future was secure. <BR>
<BR>
Yet within this structure of dominance, corruption took on a troika of forms.
The more cynical knew that the system was bankrupt, had nothing to offer,
and couldn't survive. They chose to enjoy it while it lasted. (Many have
since printed up new business cards.) The more vicious chose to exercise
power for the sake of power, in countless sterile oppressions at home, in
the construction of an utterly lunatic defense establishment, and in costly
foreign games. The more sincere and self-deluding, who still believed the
weary phrases, joined the vicious in pushing the system to what Polish dissident
Adam Michik once called the highest stage of communism: complete absurdity.
<BR>
<BR>
As for the rest, those who were neither vicious nor cynical nor self-deluding:
They went along. Later, many conceded that they had lived through a time
when theory collided with reality and lost - a time when ideological dementia
encountered sullen popular indifference, and lost to that, too. <BR>
<BR>
And so it is with PC today. The clique and claque are everywhere: the government
and courts, the universities and schools, the churches, the media, the family,
the street. But the sterility's starting to show. <BR>
<BR>
After all, once you've deconstructed everything, what's left to offer, create,
or preserve? After you've made it an article of faith that all human relationships
are based upon power, and all standards relative and oppressive, what's
to keep people from applying that notion to the explainers themselves? <BR>
<BR>
The life is gone. The PC promise of multi-cultural efflorescence and diversity
long ago segued into mere power politics. The PC promise of postmodern literature
and art and scholarship long ago sank, Marx-like, beneath its own pedantic
nihilism. And people know it, and are growing weary of it - not least of
all those young people who sit through the sensitivity training and the
screed-lectures and the rest with expressions that would not have been out
of place in Moscow, circa 1975. <BR>
<BR>
So the PC clique and claque begin to face their own Brezhnev era choices:
to take the money and power as long as it lasts; to become ever more bizarre
in their pursuits; or to just go along, evading the fact that PC suffers
from the same fatal deficiency as Marxism. It neither explains the world
adequately nor works well in it. Whether the claim be that there is only
one reality - the Marxist - or no reality at all, the net effect is the
same. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, the Soviet Union did not collapse from internal failure alone.
The United States hastened the demise in two ways. We kept the pressure
on, and we offered at least the image of alternatives. Inefficiency alone
was not enough to bring it down. There had to be a sense that something
better also existed, or could be made to exist. <BR>
<BR>
And that's how to bring down PC. Pressure and offer. Pressure the movement
toward the extremes of its own innate absurdity. It won't be hard; they're
already half-way there. Their weakness is their inability to abide any reality
(or unreality) other than their own, coupled with a lascivious desire to
exercise power for its own sake. It's an ugly combination, whether in the
courtroom or the classroom. Still, any movement that has reached the point
of claiming that the laws of physics are a sexist conspiracy can probably
be invited to prove it by jumping off the roof. <BR>
<BR>
And offer. The Republican Party and the conservative feminist movement now
terrify PC - not because they're movements of inclusion yet, but because
they could be. What might even a modest academic and literary renaissance
accomplish? PC rage nowadays has a curious quality: no longer the anger
of righteous indignation, just the shrill resentment of being challenged,
concealing - no longer completely - the beginnings of a fear that there's
nothing left inside, that perhaps there never was. <BR>
<BR>
And a fear that people might be noticing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Students of the military art</B> have long been familiar with the
Iron Law of the Inverse. This great truth holds, among other things, that
a service's leadership effectiveness is inversely proportional to the number
of generals available to lead; that combat ferocity is inversely proportional
to the quantity of medals awarded; and that a service's budgetary discipline
is inversely proportional to the amount of money thrown their way.<BR>
<BR>
Time, perhaps, to add a new codicil: The American military's long-term prospects
are inversely proportional to the slickness of their doctrinal brochures.<BR>
<BR>
Recent example: <I>Joint Vision 2010,</I> a 34-page, heavy-paper, glossy
 little pub, with several dozen  military action photos and busy full-color
schematics,  counterpointing modest quantities of large-type, double-spaced
prose. JV 2010 emanates from the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, but its style resonates of <I>New Townhome Community Prospectus
(80 percent Already Sold!),</I> or perhaps a mass mailout for a group of
recently incorporated Bill Gates wannabes, scavenging for start-up money.<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010, which recently hit the streets after months of  internal workup,
has a purple cover. This signifies jointness. (Those who labor at inter-service
tasks have long been known as &quot;purple suiters.&quot;) The pamphlet
begins with a statement from the Chairman, General John Shalikashvili, emphasizing
that modern warfare requires teamwork. The usually-obligatory quote from
the Commander-in-Chief appears conspicuous by its absence. But General Shalikashvili
writes that  that this little document provides &quot;an operationally based
template for the evolution of the Armed Forces for a challenging and uncertain
future.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010 goes on to explain that the future belongs to high technology: the
precision-guidance and information-age gizmos which will generate the capabilities
for: &quot;dominant maneuver; precision engagement; full dimensional protection;
and focused logistics.&quot; JV 2010 notes almost casually that, in some
cases, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; will still be necessary. But, clearly,
the future belongs to the machines.<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010 isn't wrong. The &quot;dazzle-'em-with-imagery&quot; format can't
quite conceal that this is a coherent, well-crafted approach to 21st century
warfare. But for two reasons, both beyond the military's control, this is
also a template for disaster.<BR>
<BR>
The first problem is perennial: Where's the money coming from? There is
simply no way the military can fund even a fraction of the necessary modernization
programs &shyp; necessary because the technologies to counter information-age
warfare are diffusing across the planet. Information-age forces are far
less vulnerable to destruction than disruption; a three-to-five year technological
lead is absolutely vital and easily lost.<BR>
<BR>
Money is also critical because of a condition peculiar to periods of rapid
technological change. Obviously, not everything can be modernized at once.
But insufficiently funded modernization can leave significant portions of
the force two and three generations behind, creating enormous interoperability
problems, especially in communications, supply, and maintenance. Incomplete
modernization could well result in a degraded active force and a marginal-to-useless
reserve . . . or a modernized but tiny active force and a semi-skilled,
cannon-fodder reserve.<BR>
<BR>
The second, and even more disturbing  failure involves the paper's attitude
toward weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The battlefield approach seems
sensible enough. Active measures (anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses,
among others) do what they can, while mobility and dispersion limit damage
on the ground. But JV 2010 nowhere mentions homeland protection, as though
the constitutional requirement to &quot;provide for the common defense&quot;
doesn't include the people and territory of the United States. Again, this
is primarily a political failure. But it would certainly have been an act
of military statesmanship, had JV 2010 contained a paragraph reading:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Today, the United States is involved in an unprecedented and potentially
catastrophic asymmetrical arms race. While we concentrate on precision-guidance
weaponry and information-age warfare, potential enemies (nation-states and
subnational groups) acquire WMD and a variety of crude but serviceable delivery
systems. New technologies permit development of active defenses that could
prove highly effective against small WMD attacks. Many of these defenses
could be adapted for homeland protection. Further, many defenses against
non-airborne WMD may have domestic uses. Finally, the National Guard should
be given WMD disaster relief as a high-priority mission, and trained and
equipped accordingly. Ironically, to the extent that we maintain invincible
conventional forces, potential enemies will be forced to consider terrorist
use of WMD, especially against this open society. We hope that deterrence
continues to work, even against the most fanatic rogue nations and their
terrorist clients. But it is always better to save lives than to avenge
them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Why hasn't this been said?<BR>
<BR>
The reasons are many, and often valid: unwillingness to defy the civilian
leadership; the possible effect on other military priorities; lack of funding;
reluctance to draw the military too deeply and openly into domestic counter-terrorism;
inertia; exhaustion. But it grows ever harder to avoid the conclusion that,
as a matter of professional as well as constitutional responsibility, the
military must begin to take homeland defense seriously.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1920s and 1930s, a diverse group of officers united around a common
goal: to get the United States some air power. Two decades of public advocacy,
professional struggle, and personal sacrifice paid off in World War II,
then laid the foundations for the aerospace dominance which the United States
has taken for granted ever since.  Perhaps it's time for a similar visionary
movement to emerge around homeland defense.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Purple prose&quot; alone can't defend us.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Less than a decade</B> after the great victories of the Cold War and
Desert Storm, the U.S. military faces a very different kind of crisis&oacute;indeed,
a crisis unique in all of military experience. Numerous factors have contributed:
a complex, volatile world situation; the spread of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD); the military technological revolution; deep budget cuts; and the
ill-advised use of the military to advance certain Politically Correct civilian
political and cultural agendas. Each of these problems can and must be addressed
individually, through normal policy channels. But, taken together, they
constitute a crisis so profound that the American people must also become
involved. Unfortunately, for reasons ranging from media bias to normal peacetime
inattentiveness, the American people have scant idea of either the depth
or the complexity of the crisis.<BR>
<BR>
It is time to make the people aware. It is also time for a new, historically
unprecedented covenant between the American people and the defense establishment
that exists to protect them, their territory, and their interests. In the
past, the American people have supported the military with their treasure,
and their sons and daughters. They shall continue to do so. But now &oacute;
and this is the essence of the new covenant &oacute; the American people
must defend their defenders against unwise and unwarranted civilian political
pressures and agendas. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives have argued for years against excessive budget cuts and imprudent
use of the military in other-than-war situations. But only in recent months
have conservatives and concerned centrists begun seriously to address the
problems of subjecting the military to social engineering and experimentation.
There has been outcry, and the marshaling of evidence. But, sadly and predictably,
the public debate has descended into a &igrave;rights versus readiness&icirc;
mode. Conservatives have argued the needs of the military while the PC left
has argued &igrave;rights&icirc; &oacute; unfortunately, a far more evocative
theme in this era. The conservative approach is necessary and correct, but
insufficient either to save the military or to place the military crisis
in a larger national context. Conservatives know that, ever since Vietnam,
the PC left has assailed the military as a strategic target in the Culture
War: the final bastion of traditional values. But conservatives naively
underestimated the tenacity and ferocity of the PC foe. The results are
now becoming clear: military resignations by the thousands, ruined careers
by the hundreds, suicides, and the gradual degradation of the ability to
fight. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives (and concerned centrists and non-PC liberals) understand this.
But conservatives, by and large, have yet to do what the PC left has done
so successfully: make the military a cultural issue, and do so in a manner
relevant and compelling to the largest possible audience. There are two
reasons for this, both valid. First, many of those most knowledgeable about
the military tend not to venture beyond their area of expertise (a notable
and happy exception: decorated marine veteran, novelist, and former navy
secretary James Webb). Second, many conservatives of non-military background
stress only the need for traditional values: again, a correct and necessary
approach, but insufficient to reach and influence the widest possible audience.
<BR>
<BR>
This Discovery Inquiry provides a strategy for a &igrave;Culture Wars&icirc;
approach to military issues that can help generate the popular support necessary
for policy changes. The Inquiry has two parts. The first proposes the contours
of a new covenant between people and military. The second suggests the structure
of a new debate, through which conservatives and concerned centrists can
carry the subject to the largest possible audience: the general public as
well as decision-makers, analysts and punditry. Accordingly, this Inquiry
contains no policy recommendations. These will be provided in forthcoming
papers. What matters here is to introduce a concept that is as relevant
to the American society as to the American military, as relevant to the
Culture Wars of the last few decades as to future military conflicts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, Americans worried that the military might grow too distant
from the people. Today, the reverse has happened. The American military
has become too much like the society it exists to defend. Indeed, the military&iacute;s
crisis provides a metaphor for the ills of the culture as a whole. In a
sense, when Americans look at the military, they&iacute;re looking into
a mirror. <BR>
<BR>
And it&iacute;s time to start asking: Do we entirely like what we see?<BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>I. Toward a new covenant</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Any covenant between people and military must contain two
elements: a clear statement of what the people expect and require of the
military, and a statement of what they&iacute;re prepared to do to ensure
that the military meets these requirements. But first, it would be useful
to clarify one of the most abused and misunderstood concepts in the American
political lexicon: civilian control of the military.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Civilian control of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The American military belongs to the American people. It
does not belong to the government. Today, the government has expanded the
doctrine of &igrave;civilian control of the military&icirc; in ways that
the Founders would have deemed abhorrent, and which common sense indicates
can only lead to catastrophe.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Founders desired civilian control of the military to forestall
military adventurism, foreign and domestic. But control was never meant
to entail government micromanagement and arbitrary interference in purely
military matters. The Congressional power to raise armies and maintain navies
did not imply that Congress should routinely substitute its opinions for
the professional judgment of the military on military matters. The president&iacute;s
role as commander-in-chief does not entitle him to command troops in the
field . . . or to supervise routine military matters and operations from
the comfort of the Oval Office. No one save the Supreme Court ever decreed
that the Court should intervene in military affairs. Civilian control meant,
and should mean, making sure that the military remains subordinate and responsive
to the will of the people (through the instrumentality of the government)
in its defense of the people. The government abuses its authority when it
forces the military to abdicate its professional expertise and values to
honor the whims and advance the fortunes of whoever happens to occupy the
White House or hold some position in Congress.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The institutional trend toward civilian micromanage-ment and
interference in purely military affairs began in 1947, with the establishment
of the Department of Defense, and creation of a secretary of defense whose
full-time job it was to manage services whose secretaries formerly reported
directly to the president. The trend intensified during the Kennedy and
Johnson years, when secretary Robert McNamara , who pointedly denied the
validity of military expertise &igrave;There is no more strategy, only crisis
management&icirc; &oacute; usurped many of the planning and budgetary powers
of the services, and began using the military for social engineering and
experimentation. Project 100,000, which forced the military to accept unqualified
entrants for service during the latter years of Vietnam, may indeed have
helped some unfortunate souls. For the military, it was at best a costly
and disruptive additional burden. Since then, the routine and often arbitrary
substitution of civilian for military judgment in purely military matters
has permeated the military and corrupted its functioning, its ethics, and
its morale.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, the military of a democratic society must reflect,
to the extent possible, the core values of that society: equality, justice,
the value of the individual. But the military is also a unique profession,
engaged in a unique activity. The issue is balance, and the balance of one
era will differ from another. Today, the government is upsetting that balance
by advancing PC civilian agendas, just as surely as it upsets the balance
by buying pork-barrel weapons or maintaining useless bases while starving
essential programs. In this sense, the use of the military to advance PC
civilian agendas is part of the larger problem of the limits of governmental
interference in internal military affairs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the people</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>In the abstract, the requirements of the people have not
changed one iota since the Founders determined to provide for the common
defense. These include protection of people and territory; defense of vital
national interests; and the occasional use of military capabilities for
other purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But defense is not an abstraction. Forces are raised and maintained
to deal with specific threats in specific places at specific times. They
also exist to deal with the unexpected, the evolving, and the accidental.
They cannot, therefore, be artificially limited by bureaucratic or professional
preferences, or by constricted views of what a military should or should
not do. This is especially true in periods of rapid change.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, this does not mean that, in such periods, &igrave;anything
goes.&icirc; The present world and domestic situations are complex and in
some ways incoherent. Still, the lack of a clearly-defined mortal enemy
&oacute; an Axis or a Soviet Union &oacute; and the lack of a clear national
consensus on certain cultural and moral matters does not justify incoherence
or expedient military thinking. Nor should the blurring of previously distinct
boundaries between domestic law-enforcement and the military be used as
an excuse for avoiding serious consideration of why that blurring may be
necessary. The United States may have to live without a clear declaratory
strategy for some time to come, and with an increasingly unpalatable cultural
and social situation. But, in the long run, it cannot live without a clear
sense of the requirements of national survival and welfare.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Homeland Defense</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>First and foremost, the people require that the military defend
their lives, territory, and property against deadly attack. Today, this
means defense against weapons of mass destruction (WMD), whether a single
terrorist device or an accidental or limited launch by a hostile state or
subnational group. Sadly, it may also include defense against domestic terrorism/insurrection
that may have foreign support. Defense against WMD is no longer a nice-to-have
adjunct to conventional military capabilities. Nor does it become a law-enforcement
matter when such devices are assembled or brought into the United States,
rather than fired at it. Indeed, never before has the fundamental problem
of home defense seen such a confluence between foreign and domestic threats.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Militarily, the vital task is: How to locate little things
(Scud launchers, cruise missiles on yachts, suitcase bombs, anthrax canisters)
in big places (the Iraqi desert, Manhattan, the Pacific Ocean) and then
get the information to those who can do something about it before the detonation.
The military&iacute;s primary responsibility here is to develop and field
&igrave;multi-use&icirc; defenses and supporting systems that can protect
troops in the field, theater-level operations, and the homeland. For example,
Aegis-equipped naval vessels, originally designed to protect carrier battle
groups against massed air attack, can do picket duty off the coast of Saudi
Arabia . . . or Puget Sound. 747s equipped with anti-missile lasers can
deploy in defense of London or Long Beach. Countering small numbers of relatively
rudimentary weapons is far easier than the challenges faced during the Cold
War. Vital technologies are far more advanced. Only lack of political will
(and wisdom) prevent anti-WMD defenses from becoming reality.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The military&iacute;s second homeland responsibility entails
operating in that gray area between conventional war and law enforcement.
Here the military finds itself in an alliance of convenience with the civil
libertarians. Neither wants the military involved, the former for professional
and bureaucratic reasons, the latter for fear of constitutional trespass.
Both concerns are valid. But the military&iacute;s responsibility is to
defend the nation against the threats it faces, whether those threats be
&igrave;conventional&icirc; or not. And whatever else may be said of the
Bill of Rights, it is not a suicide pact. Military participation in two
counter-terrorism activities &ntilde; intelligence and armed response &ntilde;
must, of course, be carefully monitored and limited when it occurs within
the United States. But it must not be proscribed for fear that any military
involvement automatically and inevitably produces mass violations of civil
liberties, military dictatorship, or worse. The issue is balance, not a
spurious either/or.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third homeland responsibility is disaster relief after the
use of WMD. This mission should be entrusted to the National Guard, and
funded appropriately. The advantages are obvious. Guard units already know
the territory they&iacute;ll work in and routinely participate in non-terrorist
disaster relief. Since the active-duty military rarely needs this capability
in peacetime, assigning the mission to the Guard cuts the expenses by 50
percent or more. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Major conventional conflict</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Properly maintained and modernized, U.S. conventional forces
will remain by far the most capable on earth. Their primary function should
be to serve as a deterrent. Failing that, conventional forces should be
prepared to win, quickly if possible, but always decisively and with minimal
loss of life.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>These capabilities need not be linked to dubious concepts such
Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, ground power should reside in
the reserves and the National Guard. These forces cost considerably less
than full-time equivalents and can be made combat ready in less time than
&igrave;weekend warrior&icirc; folklore &ntilde; or the instinctive preferences
of the active establishment for active forces &oacute; would indicate. This
does not mean, of course, that reliance on reserves should be used to justify
excessive cuts in active structure. Simplistic formulas such as &igrave;all
heavy forces into the Guard&icirc; should be avoided. It does mean that
the bulk of the country&iacute;s land combat power should reside with the
people.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is true for another reason. Mobilization of the reserves
and Guard provides a crucial test of popular will and support, as the Persian
Gulf experience demonstrated. The war demonstrated this because, in the
aftermath of Vietnam, the Army structured itself so that it could not wage
protracted war without the reserves. That policy paid political as well
as military dividends. Further, in this era of power devolving from the
federal to state levels, the National Guard &oacute; a classic &igrave;multi-use
system&icirc; &oacute; should be strengthened.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Operations other than war and short of war</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States cannot be the world&iacute;s policeman. It
should not try to be the world&iacute;s social worker, therapist, or nanny.
There is more misery out there than America can ever hope to alleviate.
U.S. forces do not exist for these purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, a world in which aggression runs rampant, and in which
atrocity becomes standard media fare, is in nobody&iacute;s interest, save
that of aggressors and criminals. From time to time, humanitarian, peace-keeping,
or peace-enforcing operations may become desirable. The American people,
generous and humane, understand this. They also understand that such operations
rarely achieve their objectives. And those with experience in this area
know that such operations are costly, demanding, demoralizing, and distracting.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because of the uncertainty of the world situation, it is probably
unwise to rely on a checklist approach to decision-making. As a rule, commitment
to other-than war operations generally should be regarded with healthy skepticism
and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Further, belief in the value of &igrave;America&iacute;s
global leadership role&icirc; should not be used as justification for imprudent
engagement. &igrave;Showing our resolve to show our resolve&icirc; rarely
fools anyone for long. Further, every global problem is also a regional
and local problem, and best handled at those levels. Only when these fail,
or cannot succeed without U.S. support, should direct involvement become
an option. And if U.S. direct involvement is vital, it goes without saying
that no compelling reason exists to place U.S. forces under foreign command.
It also goes without saying that funding for such operations should not
come out of military appropriations, and that other nations should be encouraged
to contribute.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Beyond this, operations short of/other than war should make
maximum use of reserve and National Guard assets. This has been true since
Vietnam for certain capabilities, including air transport, medical, special
operations, and supply. Reserve and Guard use should be expanded to include
ground forces. Just as mobilization provides a de facto &igrave;people&iacute;s
veto&icirc; on entering major war, so does selective participation offer
a test of popular support for lesser contingencies.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>We now come to the most difficult issue: What are the obligations
of the American people to the military? Throughout most of this country&iacute;s
history, the answer has been, nothing. Properly speaking, there has never
been a covenant between people and military, certainly nothing on the Israeli
or Prussian models. There has been no need.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>American attitudes toward the military have always been conflicted.
Belief in military service as an obligation of citizenship coexisted with
a lively detestation of that obligation&iacute;s practical expression, the
draft. Admiration of the military as a profession &oacute; admiration for
qualities of courage, purpose, discipline, and devotion &oacute; still thrives,
but so does distaste for &igrave;lifers&icirc; and contempt for bureaucrats
in uniform. Traditionally, the military has enjoyed a higher status than
the well-publicized &igrave;detestation&icirc; of the left might suggest.
But this good will rarely has translated into direct support for the institution.
Americans have paid taxes, sent their sons and daughters, supported the
troops, and aided the veterans for centuries. The people have also benefited
the military by their innate caution regarding foreign involvements and
reluctance to accept heavy casualties. But the sense of obligation has been
attached to citizenship and to country, not to the military as such. Never
before have the American people been asked to defend their domestic political,
social, and cultural forces.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the American people have two new responsibilities
toward their defenders. The first is to insure adequate funding for development
and deployment of defense against WMD, and for modernization sufficient
to maintain the conventional deterrent (a modernization that should include
further downsizing and outsourcing of support functions and major restructuring
of combat forces). The second responsibility is to defend the defenders
against civilian PC agendas that produce significant erosion of military
capability, while the military evolves a new balance appropriate to its
needs and democratic values of equality and opportunity. It is often forgotten
that, when President Truman ordered the desegregation of the military, African
Americans were already present in force, and had proven themselves in two
world wars. The inclusion of women in non-support roles is an entirely different
matter; no civilization in history has ever tried it, save in extremis.
So are issues related to the inclusion of openly homosexual men.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>II. To contour the debate</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Since the 1970s, the U.S. military has been under implacable
assault by an array of radical feminist, gay-rights, and other forces who
regard the military as &igrave;key terrain&icirc; in the Culture War and
who appear willfully oblivious to, and sometimes delighted by, the damage
they do. But (to reiterate) only recently has conservatism recognized the
seriousness of the assault. The conservative strategy has been to reaffirm
the obvious: that the military exists to perform certain unique functions;
that its traditional values relate to its functions; and that whatever harms
the ability to perform those functions is unacceptable. This strategy is
not wrong. But, to those with agendas of their own, and to much of the public,
it is largely irrelevant.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In order to begin to correct this situation&oacute;in order
to defend the defenders successfully&oacute;it is necessary to reformulate
the issue, away from the scripted pseudo-exchanges of &igrave;rights versus
readiness,&icirc; toward forms resonant in the larger culture and society.
This can be done in two ways: first, by changing the structure of the debate
and, second, by presenting the military as symbolic of what&iacute;s been
happening in the country as a whole. Conservatives and concerned centrists
must not confine themselves to presenting the military as an institution
apart, the unique exception to the rules. The present crisis should be seen
as a metaphor for what happens when individual &igrave;rights,&icirc; sexuality,
and &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; come to negate, not only individual responsibilities,
but also common purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Therefore, emphasize the following:</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The vast majority
of women and minorities in the military are not the enemy. The problem rather
comes from those self-appointed activists who presume to speak and act on
their behalf, while damaging the very institution to which these women and
minorities have dedicated themselves. Equality is here to stay, and equality
means equality of responsibility as well as equality of opportunity. Equality
of opportunity includes the chance for honest failure: There are things
not everyone can do, and honest failure is no disgrace. Equality of responsibility
does not, and cannot, mean sameness.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>There is no such
thing as a &igrave;right&icirc; to serve in the military. No one has it.
Nor is there any right to any particular job or security clearance. There
is no right to remain in the military, commensurate with civilian employment
protection. To define the military in terms of rights is to reduce it to
a vehicle for advancing the careers and agendas of individuals and pressure
groups. This is like saying that the purpose of a business is to benefit
its employees, with no reference to what that business is supposed to produce
or how it functions against the competition. Military necessity takes precedence
over manufactured individual &igrave;rights.&icirc;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>But &igrave;military
necessity&icirc; is not an historical absolute. Once, military necessity
required corporal punishment and drumhead courts martial. Once, military
necessity seemed to require exclusion of African Americans. In the largest
sense, a democracy&iacute;s military must reflect its values. Today, these
values include an unprecedented degree of tolerance and willingness to experiment
with social arrangements. But even these values must, in the end, recognize
that reality imposes limits, in the military as in all other activities.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>That said, sexuality
poses peculiar problems for the military. Sexuality, unlike race or ethnicity,
entails behavior. Sexual behaviors acquire special significance in an institution
as hierarchical as the military, and under conditions of extreme danger,
stress, and privation. The radical feminist agenda requires that heterosexual
males conform completely to their codes of behavior and thought, while demanding
nothing of women. The gay agenda demands total acceptance under any and
all conditions. One need not be either male chauvinist or homophobic to
ask what self-controls might be required of women and gays, especially under
extreme conditions. By the same token &oacute; and this is an issue that
conservatives have yet to address &oacute; it seems wrong to exclude entire
categories of persons from service, or from certain kinds of service, on
the basis of what they might do. It also seems wrong to legitimize the notion
of &igrave;behavioral minorities.&icirc; A more compelling approach would
be to emphasize that the responsibilities of women and gays toward the military
&oacute; indeed, toward the country &oacute; could conceivably include not
serving, or not serving in particular capacities.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And therein may lie a possible new balance, with &igrave;role
model&icirc; potential for the larger society. At a July 1996 Heritage Foundation
National Security Symposium, retired Army Col. William Hauser suggested
that the military should be deemed to have a central &igrave;core&icirc;
&ntilde; the combat arms &ntilde; which must be allowed to retain its traditional
values and exclusions. The non-combat portions of the military could adopt
far more liberal personnel policies. The PC left will no doubt object that
this violates their principles of &igrave;equality&icirc; as the only absolute,
and &igrave;equality&icirc; no matter what the real-world cost to other
people and to common purposes. Conservatives may emphasize negative effects
on readiness and object to the perceived surrender of principle. Still,
it seems a reasonable compromise: exclusion only when absolute military
necessity requires it, inclusion the rest of the time.</FONT> <BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5></FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>To bring about a new covenant between people and military,
two separate but related efforts are necessary. One is to emphasize that,
while the abstract responsibilities of the military have not changed, the
real-world situation is unprecedented. Old formulas, old divisions of labor,
no longer avail. The second is to emphasize that support of the military
can no longer be limited to paying taxes and waving flags. The defenders
need to know what they&iacute;re expected to defend, and that they will
be defended in turn. One effort should resemble that of the late 1970s and
early 80s in making public the need to rebuild America.s defenses &oacute;
a campaign that helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1980, and then aided his defense
program during the crucial first years. The other effort should resemble
that of the late 1980s and early 1990s, documenting and publicizing PC in
the military as it was exposed on campus. In purely military terms, the
goal should be to convert popular awareness into pressures for policy changes
that will bring about a new and livable balance. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But, in the larger sense, the military disarray must be addressed
as part of the larger American crisis of values: specifically, of creating
a world of endless &igrave;rights&icirc; and demands, to the exclusion of
responsibilities and purposes, of elevating sexuality to the status of an
absolute, and of making &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; a legally actionable
standard of conduct. In this final sense, the goal should be to make the
struggle over the military the &igrave;beginning of the end&icirc; battle
of the Culture War &ntilde; to demonstrate both the limits of PC engineering
and the ability of the military to adapt to changing civilian values, and
thereby to suggest that reasonable compromise &ntilde; the way of democracy
&ntilde; can be attained, whether the PC crowd likes it or not.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And, in the end, the debate over the proper composition and
uses of the military reveals one of the fundamental truths of civilized
life. If what unites us is more important than what divides us, we are friends;
we can work it out. If what divides us is more important than what unites
us, we are enemies; our relations will be determined by the exercise of
power. The uniting issue here is the survival and security of the United
States: a goal which can be achieved in many different ways. Only those
united in this matter should have standing in this debate.</FONT> <BR>

<P>&quot;Modern American life . . . is characterized by new communities
far more numerous and far less intense than those of earlier ages.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So wrote historian Daniel Boorstin more than 30 years ago. At the time,
he was speaking of &quot;consumption communities,&quot; and the notion that
those of similar lifestyle have more in common with each other than with
their geographical, religious, or ethnic compatriots.<BR>
<BR>
Concluded Boorstin:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The modern American is tied &shyp; by the thinnest of threads and
the most volatile, switchable loyalties &shyp; to thousands of other Americans
by nearly everything he eats or drinks, or wears, or reads. . . . We are
held to other men, not only by a few iron bonds, but by countless gossamer
webs tying together the trivia of our lives every day.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since then, several generations of social critics, researchers, and politicians
have made entire careers deploring the weakening, if not the outright demise,
of those few &quot;iron&quot; bonds of family, faith, community, country.
The Right, religious and non, touts the so-called traditional values that
made sense before the iron rusted. The Communitarians proffer an apolitical
return to the neighborhoods where you heard gossip about your sins on your
way back from (or to) committing them, albeit with a much-abbreviated catalogue
of sins. Most recently, political scientist Robert Putnam has decried the
&quot;Bowling Alone&quot; phenomenon: the decades-long decline in old-fashioned
voluntary group membership, and presumably therefore in sociability. And
nearly everybody, from the Christian Coalition to the Politics of Meaning
crowd, agree that this is a civilization of human beings seemingly unable
to relate to much of anything beyond the twitchings within their tummies,
their genitalia, and their skulls.<BR>
<BR>
Or maybe not.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most remarkable phenomena of the last few decades has been the
&quot;small groups&quot; movement &shyp; actually not a movement at all,
but the spontaneous rise of myriad little organizations, some <I>ad hoc</I>
and evanescent, others more permanent. Sociologist Robert Wuthnow estimates
that as many as 30 percent of all Americans may participate in such activities.
In his recent book, &quot;Sharing the Journey,&quot; he suggests that these
groups, which feature minimal levels of commitment, easy entry and exit,
and which usually concentrate on a single activity, are now a permanent
fixture of American life. A glance at the newspaper personal section will
reveal their extent: everything from Bible study to addiction recovery,
from confederations of space alien abductees to Adult Survivors of Fairly
Normal Parents. Many view these groups as little more than psychotherapeutic
and spiritual versions of Boorstin's &quot;consumption communities,&quot;
providing audiences for the empty and the self-obsessed. Wuthnow, while
acknowledging their limitations, sees them as valuable, provided they're
expected to augment, not replace, the older and larger assemblages.<BR>
<BR>
But maybe not.<BR>
<BR>
To understand the significance of the small group phenomenon, and the corresponding
decline in more permanent affiliations, it may be necessary to deep-six
two common sense notions: that small groups are trivial, and that the &quot;iron
bonds&quot; are natural. In fact, in a world of political and economic megastructures
and accelerating cultural globalization, these groups may provide a vital,
and perhaps a final, access to sanity. Perhaps they can help restore the
civility that civilization, by virtue of its scale and unnatural harshness,
takes away<BR>
<BR>
As a species, <I>homo sapiens </I>may be 100,000 to 300,000 years old. For
all but a few thousand of those years, <I>homo sapiens</I> lived in small
groups of hunter-gatherers. Evolutionary biology tells us that we are genetically
encoded for such an existence, that our genetic make-up has not changed
since the Neolithic Revolution which established sedentary civilization,
and that genetic coding includes behavioral repertoires as well as physiological
characteristics. Yes, humankind is the only species to evolve culturally.
But the fact remains: We are programmed to live in small groups.<BR>
<BR>
Yet we cannot. Even if we could, few of us would wish to return to such
a life, or endure the small group as the limit of physical survival and
social reality. &quot;Back to the Pleistocene&quot; is not an option. But,
in a world of seemingly endless impersonal and anonymous possibilities &shyp;
a world of people who often feel compelled to avail themselves of more possibilities
than might be good for them &shyp; some form of participation in small groups
makes genetic, and therefore psychological sense. The combination of right-size
and reasonable distance from others can be both therapeutic and civilizing:
indeed, more civilizing than life amid the megaliths and the masses which,
whatever their material contributions, have always been acknowledged as,
in so many other ways, dehumanizing. Small groups provide &quot;transient
stability&quot; in a world of civilized creation which inevitably gives
rise to decidedly uncivilized, and ofttimes savage behavior. <BR>
<BR>
But if this is true, or even plausible, an uneasy question arises. What
about loyalty? If conventional structures no longer command it, and if small
groups don't demand it, and if self-interest and survival no longer adhere
to anything in particular, what can hold civilization together? Will jogging
clubs and support groups, Republicans and Democrats, Star Trek conventions
and alternative Sunday schools, be enough? Can a world be maintained on
trivia?<BR>
Or would it even have to be?<BR>
<BR>
Archeology and anthropology show that small hunter-gatherer groups tend
toward the nonviolent. Their moral codes tend to be self-enforcing. Few
dare risk banishment from the group; few dare attack their sole source of
survival. Still, history shows that, ever since the species settled down
and opportunities for interactions with strangers began to increase, humans
have oppressed, tortured, and killed each other over different concepts
of what the &quot;iron bonds&quot; beyond the small group should be. Would
the spiritual and therapeutic hunter-gatherers of postmodern civilization
be willing to fight over the &quot;gossamer webs tying together the trivia
of our lives every day?&quot; It all depends, I guess, on what one considers
trivial.<BR>
<BR>
And on how many of them there are.<BR>

Has American Judaism lost its roots?</CENTER>

<BR>
Modern American spirituality is a lot like Interstate Five. Everybody seems
to be on it. Nearly everybody's changing lanes. The road signs are large
but not always helpful. Entry and exit can be tricky. If you drive long
enough you end up in Canada &shyp; decent and pleasant, though not often
inspiring. But if you drive long enough the other way, you find yourself
in . . . well, California.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, American Judaism took to the interstates. Specifically, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), the major Reform organization,
began offering &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; outreach seminars, designed
for anyone with any kind of interest in the subject. Seattle was the 16th
city on the UAHC list. From March through May of this year, thirteen sessions
were conducted at area Reform temples.<BR>
<BR>
I became aware of the program through an ad in the EastsideWeek. <I>A  Three
Session </I>Journey &shyp; Come <I>Share</I>. The simple invitation accessed
some files I thought I'd deleted decades earlier. Not an entirely  pleasant
retrieval. Despite, or perhaps because of the discomfort, I made the phone
call. For the first time since 1973 (a bizarre Passover <I>seder</I> in
the Marines) I would enter a Jewish activity. Just to check up on the tribe,
I told myself. Just to see if  anything had changed.<BR>
<BR>
Nothing had. And, perhaps, everything. And, perhaps, much more than the
tribe was involved.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
To anyone over 40 with knowledge of the American Jewish experience &shyp;
my own background was Orthodox, intensely ethnic/Yiddish, and included yeshiva
time &shyp; the most striking aspect of the current situation is what's
no longer there. The old ethnicity: gone. This was, of course, inevitable.
The immigrant generations have passed, and with them their dialects, their
neighborhoods, their ways. And so have most of those who knew them well,
and who participated in American Jewry's version of the Eternal Triangle:
the three-generation struggle of immigrants, their conflicted, striving
children, and their affluent, baby-boomer-bratty grandkids to adapt and
succeed, yet  keep the faith available.<BR>
<BR>
Reform Judaism began in Europe two centuries ago as an avant-gardish, highly
intellectualized attempt to bring Judaism into the modern world, to offer
alternatives to the tradition-encrusted Orthodoxies of  the  ghetto and
the ghetto mentality. In the United States, Reform became a  pensive half-way
house for ambitious immigrant children, eager to shed their parents' ways
yet unwilling or unable to discard the old faith entirely. A Yiddish joke
tells of a conversation between an old Orthodox mother and her successful
Reform son. Do you still keep Kosher, Hymie? No, Mother. Do you still go
to <I>shul? </I>No, Mother. Do you date Jewish girls? No, Mother.<BR>
<BR>
So tell me, Hymie. Are you still circumcised?<BR>
<BR>
Beneath the humor, the anguish of  a past, no longer visible. Some one else's
war.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also, the Holocaust as an omnipresent, suffocating yet binding American
Jewish reality. The memory's been institutionalized and, to some extent,
denatured. It has to be to survive beyond the lives of those who knew it,
and of it, personally. There's the museum in Washington, D.C., its power
fittingly unspeakable. There's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and a healthy
academic and literary output. But the Holocaust  memory-as-solidarity is
different when the European branch of your family ended up in Auschwitz
and you learn the details from those who knew and mourn them. It's different
when the woman next door has a number on her arm that she neither conceals
nor talks about, and three houses up, the couple from Dachau  won't let
their kid out of their sight and on quiet nights you can hear their dream-screaming,
<I>Gangsters</I>! <I>Teuffeln!</I> and your street's more or less like the
rest of the neighborhood in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also: Israel &shyp; or, at least, the pre-1967, or pre-1982, or pre-1996
wide-eyed adoration and unquestioning support. &quot;Exodus,&quot; Leon
Uris' perennial seller about the creation of the Jewish state, used to be
dismissable as bad fiction. Now it's obscene.<BR>
<BR>
But, most of all, American Judaism no longer seems quite so special, American
Jews no longer quite so intriguing. Certainly, chunks of the old culture
have been mainstreamed. Jewish humor's everywhere; Yakov Smirnoff now works
The Nashville Network. There are probably more varieties of bagels in Seattle
than synagogues. But by the standards of the 1950s/1960s, when a confluence
of forces (Israel, the Holocaust, economic and intellectual success, the
waning of the more virulent anti-Semitisms) made Jews a fashionable minority,
it's over. And today, despite the well-hyped pronouncements of Mr. Farrakhan,
a few militia G-mo's, and some armed-and-ugly confrontations back east,
Jews don't get persecuted much anymore. Indeed, by the standards of the
1950s/1960s, most American Jews don't even seem all that interested in each
other, or themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Some years ago, the UAHC noticed this. Their sociological and statistical
researches showed that over half of all American Jews consider themselves
unaffiliated with any form of  organized Judaism. Over half of all Jews
now marry outside the faith. If present trends continue, American Jewry
could constitute less than one percent of the population within a couple
of decades.<BR>
<BR>
So the UAHC took the first step toward renaissance. They got a grant. Then
they put together &quot;A Taste of Judaism.&quot;  Kathryn Kahn, the national
program co-ordinator and assistant director of the UAHC's Commission on
Reform Jewish Outreach in New York, says that much of the material derived
from previous experiences working with lapsed Jews wandering home and interfaith
couples in which the Jewish partner wanted to cling to some part of the
tradition, but couldn't articulate why. &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; would
take it national.<BR>
<BR>
Says Kahn: &quot;We wanted to set up a barrier-free program. No cost. No
books. No homework. A minimal investment in time. We wanted to let Judaism
speak for itself. We started out with the three Jewish verities of God,
Torah, and Israel. But we felt that might be a little formidable, so we
changed it to Spirituality, Ethics, Community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Kahn, the program's success astonished even its creators. &quot;We
ran ads in secular publications. They weren't professionally done. People
said the ads just jumped off the page at them. Since 1994, we've had over
4000 people take the seminar. We're just starting to send out a major survey,
asking people at least six months out of the course, 'What Jewish choices
have you made?' We may never know the full impact. But we've had conversions,
temple joinings, many levels of response.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pam Waechter, the program's Seattle-area co-ordinator, says that the series
drew over 850 queries. 470 people took this year's offerings; there's a
waiting list for 1997. She adds that much of the interest here came from
adult children of interfaith marriages who'd been raised as Christians,
or in no tradition. <BR>
<BR>
So perhaps American Jews are still interested; all they need to re-up is
just some no-heavy-lifting spirituality. Or perhaps it's part of something
larger, a more general American returning to God and roots.<BR>
<BR>
In part, no doubt. But the most striking aspect of the &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot;
was that, within the context of Reform Judaism's oddly constricted view
of things, and beneath the back-to-faith patina, the class was doing something
of which it seemed utterly unaware. Of course, there was no way for them
to know that they were engaging in an ethical exercise of pagan origin which
could well provide the moral basis for 21st century American civilization,
Jewish, Christian, humanist, and a whole lot else.<BR>
<BR>
But first, let's  look at it the old-fashioned way.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Twenty-five people show up at Temple D'Hirsch Sinai on Pike Street. During
the obligatory self-introductions, more describe themselves as &quot;recovering
Catholics&quot; than wayward Jews. There's a cute little blonde who's pondering
conversion, some interfaith couples (one very pregnant), a Mercer Island
Episcopalian woman now dating a Jew, a black gentleman of the Ba'hai faith,
professing curiosity. A few others, Gentiles, mention curiosity; they either
 want to understand their Jewish friends, or have no Jewish friends but
want to understand, anyway. No one would mistake this crowd for refugees
from the club scene. They're older, serious, earnest.<BR>
<BR>
There's no strict curriculum. According to Kahn, the instructors were &quot;asked
to pick passages [from the Torah and other literature] that they feel passionate
about, and to talk on those.&quot; The temple provides the instructors:<BR>
<BR>
Associate Rabbi Beth Singer, one of those clergypersons who can't pronounce
her title without italicizing it and who, on ordination day, must have been
issued an inexhaustible supply of timed-release sincerity capsules. She'll
do Spirituality  (the session originally designated, &quot;God&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick, a retired public school teacher now working as the temple's
director of education. <I>(Gott i</I>n<I> Himme</I>l, he looks just like
my Uncle Milton). Chernick's the teacher everybody had once, if they were
lucky, the lively guy who humanized the course they dreaded taking. He was
also Chaucer's clerk in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; &shyp; &quot;Glad
would he teach, and gladly learn.&quot; He'll handle Ethics (formerly known
as &quot;Torah&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
Cantor Kenneth Koransky, a South African-emigre with an international reputation
and a passion for the people he sings for. He'll teach Community. Israel
receives mention as a place where Israelis do not follow the traditional
ways.<BR>
<BR>
The course is designed to entice people to Judaism,  not to confer advanced
degrees or conduct Talmudic disputations. But, almost immediately, two intellectual
weaknesses become apparent. One is an astonishing lack of basic knowledge
among the instructors, far in excess of the usual podium tongue-slippages.
One does not expect to hear from an ordained rabbi that King David built
the First Temple or that &quot;parts&quot; of the Hebrew Bible are found
in the Christian Old Testament. The class, properly more concerned with
impact than with trivia, says little about it. At one point in his session,
Koransky asks aloud why he keeps turning to me for answers, and muses that
I look like a rabbi, sent to spy on the proceedings. I'm not, I tell him.
I'm far worse. I'm a journalist.<BR>
<BR>
And don't mess with me, man. I been to<I> cheder</I>.<BR>
<BR>
The second flaw, and the second astonishment, concerns more substantive
matters. Reform has always tended toward a certain self-satisfied  parochialism:
part 19th century social gospel, part anachronistic New Deal liberalism,
part 60s time warp, with PC aplenty for spice. The positions, and the posturing,
hadn't changed one iota in thirty years.  The great sin of the Pharisees
&shyp; the  pride-in-goodness which even Jesus found incorrigible &shyp;
still resides among those who've done their best, for centuries, to distance
themselves from the Pharisees' putative descendants.<BR>
<BR>
Rabbi Singer leads off. She assures the room that she will be &quot;nonjudgmental&quot;
and &quot;noncoercive.&quot; She flits over a selection of quotations compiled
by a Rabbi Rossove of Temple Israel, Hollywood, CA. She tells the class
that Judaism is &quot;experiential,&quot; that you don't have to believe
in God to be a good Jew, as long as you feel it. She calls Orthodox Jews
&quot;fundamentalists&quot; &shyp; the first time I've ever heard one Jew
apply that inappropriate epithet to another. She asserts that, as far as
the old ways go, &quot;We take what makes sense to us and skip over the
rest.&quot; Some things &shyp; homosexuality and women, for example, &quot;they
just didn't understand the way we do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Concludes Rabbi Singer: &quot;Sometimes I wish I could go through the Torah
with a bottle of White-Out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Then &shyp; wink/wink, giggle/giggle &shyp; &quot;Don't quote me on that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I decide to write. After class,  I identify myself to her as a journalist
and ask for a one-on-one follow-up interview to discuss her teachings. She
tells me how busy she is. A few weeks later, I leave another request on
her voice mail. Two days after, a woman from the temple calls. Rabbi Singer
wants to investigate my background before &quot;granting an interview.&quot;
The next day, another woman checks in. Rabbi Singer will be unable to schedule
anything, but I am authorized to write that she &quot;enjoyed teaching the
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reform seminaries, if they do not already do so, might consider offering
instruction in media relations.<BR>
<BR>
(Author's note: Before sending this article off into cyberspace, Rabbi Singer
received a third interview request. She did not respond.)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick takes Ethics. He's excellent on expounding Jewish notions of
the sacralized life. You can sleep with your girl friend and it's not a
sin. But it's better if you do it married. You can eat your food without
a blessing, but it's better to say a little grace. No, you don't have to
believe in God, or in any particular conception of God, but we do insist
on monotheism and we do these things because God commands them.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming God exists.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick teaches with fervor that the essence of Jewish ethics is how
we treat each other, and how we work to bring on the Messianic Age that
may or may not require a physical Messiah.<I> Tikku</I>n<I> Ola</I>m. Repair
of the world. We must do this for the poor. We must do that for the environment.
I ask him if this ethic mandates any particular political ideology or action.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You bet it does. We don't have to get into the details here, but everybody
knows what they are. We have an obligation to insist that our government
reach where we can't. We have to be sure that our government is acting as
ethically as we are. If we're going to be holy, we have to use every venue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I don't respond that Jerry Falwell couldn't have put it any better. A few
days later, at lunch, I ask him to elaborate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, if caring about other people means you're a liberal, then I'm
a liberal. If not caring means you're a conservative . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Does caring require fealty to any particular bureaucracy or way of doing
things?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, obviously not . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OK. This guy's sincere. In Jewish ethics, civility comes before scoring
points.<BR>
<BR>
Koransky, in class and on the phone later, proves the most challenging.
&quot;A Jew can eat a ham sandwich on Yom Kippur,&quot; he says, &quot;and
still be a Jew. Not a good Jew, but a Jew. You can disbelieve in God and
still be a Jew. But you can't be a Jew by yourself. Without the synagogue,
what does the Jew have?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I ask him whether a Jew can acknowledge his identity and heritage and believe
in God, but not care for the company of his fellows.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jewish self-hatred is an old thing. So is social-climbing. So is disagreement.
Once, two Jews were stranded on a desert island. A few years later, a ship
happened by and rescued them. One of their rescuers noticed that they'd
built three synagogues. He asked why. 'Well,' one of the Jews said. 'That's
the synagogue I attend. That's the synagogue he attends. And that's the
synagogue neither of us would be caught dead in.'<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The unaffiliated Jew,&quot; he concludes, &quot;just hasn't come home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
No exceptions?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't be a Jew in a vacuum.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Still, there are vacuums and vacuums. Solitude is not the worst. Far more
vacuous (forgive the pun) is so much of what passes for modern American
religious questing &shyp; the endless shopping down at the spiritual supermall,
looking for just the right accessories for just the right spiritual life-style,
and for that perfect, nonjudgmental, noncoercive, get-the-White-Out deity.
 Seen in this sense, Reform Judaism's just one more boutique.<BR>
<BR>
Yet seen in another, exactly the opposite is true. Throughout this century,
the Orthodox Jewish rap against Reform was that they wanted to be Jews without
doing the hard Jewish work, indeed, to be Jews without being anything Jewish
in particular.  The yeshiva boys might drive you crazy, but at least you
knew where to find them. Reform wasn't Judaism. It was warm-and-fuzzy, feel-good
religion; it was an accommodation of convenience for life among the<I> goyim</I>.
In the end, to borrow a phrase, there was no &quot;there&quot; there.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick disagrees vehemently. The people he deals with, especially
in his adult education classes, aren't dilettantes. They're determined to
find a way to make Judaism a real presence in their real lives. Their what
to leave in/what to leave out decisions are based on personal and family
needs, not fashion or whim. I got the same sense with the people in the
seminar &shyp; that the question on their minds was neither what's hot nor
what's not, but<I> How shall I liv</I>e?<BR>
<BR>
And therein lies the possible ethical future of this land.<BR>
<BR>
To explain:<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the only civilization in history to adopt, as its de
facto official value-system, &quot;How do I feel, especially about myself?&quot;
No other culture has ever elevated feeling &shyp; emotion beyond all external
validation or linkage to the outer world --  to the status of an absolute.
Most would have considered it insane. It doesn't work. The wreckage of the
attempt lies all about us: failed marriages and relationships, failed politics,
the culture of anarcho-banality, the endless immersion in the formulaic
pornographies of violated flesh and spirit.<BR>
<BR>
But for those who wish to move beyond the failed American psychobondage,
modern ethics offers only two alternatives, neither really workable. One
is submission to some external authority, technically known as the deontological
approach. What does the Pope say? What does the Torah say? What does the
Party say? How would Dan Quayle, or Hillary Clinton, handle this situation?
What would Arnold Schwarzenegger think of me?<BR>
<BR>
What is the law?<BR>
<BR>
Some folks need to submit. Others choose to do so, often in the belief that
they're returning to &quot;tradition.&quot; or doing it for the sake of
the kids, or just to structure their lives. But a multicultural, essentially
libertarian society doesn't have this option. As far as the rules go, one
size no longer fits all.<BR>
<BR>
The other modern ethical alternative is to live by trying to predict the
results of one's actions. But consequentialism doesn't work much better.
No one can know all the implications, or control all the results. Should
I marry Jack or Jill? If I give this street person money, will she use it
for food or drugs? At the political level, consequentialism leads from inept,
intrusive social engineering to the tyrannies of  &quot;the greatest good
for the greatest number.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there is a third alternative, slowly emerging from centuries of obscurity.
Its technical moniker is &quot;virtue-ethics&quot;.  It first regained general
notice in the 1970s, with the publication of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre's<I>
After Virtu</I>e. Since then, its most effective expositors have been classicists
and philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum <I> (The Therap</I>y<I> of Desire</I>)
 and Julia Anna<I>s (The Morality of Happiness)</I> &shyp; women writing
for a general audience, but also seeking  an ethic for women of the post-feminist
era. During the Vietnam War, virtue-ethics were practiced by the American
prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton. Admiral James Stockdale, who won the Medal
of Honor for his prison leadership and who once described himself as &quot;the
lawgiver of an autonomous colony of Americans who happened to be located
in a Hanoi prison,&quot; had studied virtue-ethics in graduate school. His
extensive writings on how he and his comrades adapted and applied them in
prison were totally ignored by the media during  and after Stockdale's painful
performance in the 1992 vice-presidential debates. (For the record: Jim
Stockdale introduced me to the field, first in his writings, then in a series
of personal conversations and letters in the 1980s. Everybody should have
the opportunity to get to know a great man or woman, at least once.)  <I>
</I><BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, the relevant question is neither &quot;What are the rules?&quot;
nor &quot;What are the consequences?&quot; It is certainly not, &quot;How
do I feel?&quot; Nor does it have much to do with the currently fashionable
&quot;Books of Virtues&quot; available in the bibliotherapy section of your
local bookstore. The vital question is &quot;How should I live?&quot; Rules,
emotions, consequences all matter, but only as guides. The North Vietnamese,
for example, did not want to torture their prisoners. They wanted information,
propaganda statements, help in breaking other prisoners. The torture decision
was American. Knowing full well that, in the torture room, they would ultimately
submit, they nonetheless decided that<I> their live</I>s required them to
take torture before surrender . . . and then to start the whole hideous
process again the next time.<BR>
<BR>
Virtue-ethics is a Hellenistic creation. It dominated the final centuries
of antiquity. It comes in many forms, among them the Aristotelian, Epicurean,
Stoic. It leaves many concepts vague. Virtue-ethics provides no answers
to the question it poses: How shall I live? It does offer ways of finding
answers.<BR>
<BR>
An Aristotelian might hold that virtue is the &quot;golden mean,&quot; that
midpoint between excess and defect in any character trait. Courage, for
example, would be the mean between cowardice and rashness. The wise woman
would then apply this trait to the situations of her life. An Epicurean
might hold that, since the world is a meaningless jumble of atoms and random
events, and since the gods either don't know we're around or else don't
give a damn, the wise person maximizes his or her own pleasure &shyp; but
only in ways that don't cause painful and anxious dependence on that pleasure.
 Curiously, the virtue-ethic most appropriate to a libertarian, multicultural
society &shyp; a society desperately trying to amend its materialistic,
planet-trashing ways &shyp; might well be an updated Stoicism.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism today connotes little more than heroism in the dentist's chair,
or taking the bad news in a certain way, on maybe Mr. Spock on the bridge
of the Enterprise. In reality, it's far more subtle.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism was founded in the third century, BC by Zeno, a native of Cyprus,
an  island with a large Jewish community. The doctrine received its name
from the Stoa, or colonnade in Athens, where he held forth. Its most famous
expositors were a Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and a Greek slave, Epictetus.
Stoicism, the most popular of the philosophies of late antiquity, filled
that half-millennium gap between the waning of the pagan gods and the rise
of Christianity. Many of its concepts were, in fact, taken into the new
faith. And many of its concepts have an oddly Jewish intinction.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism holds that there is indeed deity in the universe. Most often that
deity is pantheistic, present throughout creation but with no separate existence.
Yet Stoicism also allows for other gods, capable of suffusing human affairs.
 Stoic cosmology bears an eerie likeness to the current Big Bang theory.
And the Stoic insistence that the universe is an inter-related whole, with
that condition conferring ineluctable responsibilities on humanity, anticipates
modern deep ecology by two thousand years.<BR>
<BR>
But what matters here is the Stoic answer to the question, &quot;How shall
I live?&quot; Stoicism doesn't say, &quot;Be rid of your feelings.&quot;
It does say, &quot;Don't let your feelings &shyp; especially certain kinds
of feelings &shyp; jerk you around.&quot; Stoicism holds that the only thing
we can truly call our own is our will (or, if you prefer, intellect or spirit).
All else is beyond our control, and therefore, in technical terms, &quot;indifferent.&quot;
But some indifferents are clearly to be preferred to others, because we
are creatures inextricably involved with our fellows,, with the environment,
with deity. What form those relationships take depends on chance and circumstance.
Stoicism, for example, would never say, &quot;Get married. Have kids.&quot;
It would say, &quot;Whatever you choose, you cannot escape the responsibilities
to yourself and others inherent in that choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Epictetus put it, &quot;Let whatever seems to you the best, be to you
an inviolable rule.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Or Marcus Aurelius, writing his own creed: &quot;The man who values a soul
that is rational and universal and social no longer cares for anything else,
but aims solely at keeping the temper of his own soul and all its activities
rational and social, and works together with his fellows to this end. .
. . I have a city and I have a country; as Marcus I have Rome, and as a
human being I have the universe; and consequently what is beneficial to
these communities is the sole good for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But only Epictetus could decide what was the inviolable rule for Epictetus,
and only Marcus could make the final decision in what Marcus would do about
it.      <BR>
<BR>
In this sense, Reform Judaism is a something of a Stoic virtue-ethic. God
remains vague. A Jew can accept anything from a personal deity to a suffusion
of the universe with ethical implications. Laws and traditions offer guidance
only, even if their origin is taken as divine. The sovereign individual
reasons, asks,<I> listen</I>s, and decides. And &shyp; a fundamental tenet
of nearly all virtue-based systems -- this sovereign deciding leads the
individual, in the end, to the conclusion that others, and community, and
planet, and deity, make legitimate claims.<BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, you can't be  sovereign &shyp; or human &shyp; in a vacuum.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot; people see themselves as participating
in, and encouraging, a return to tradition. Perhaps it would be more accurate
to say that they're returning to a blending of traditions. Or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that all ages blend traditions, whether they
care it admit it or not. We live amid a mingling of strange gods. But then,
so did Abraham, and Moses, and Aristotle, and Jesus. As for virtue-ethics,
you don't have to be pagan to understand, or practice it.<BR>
<BR>
You also don't have to be Jewish.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Military as Metaphor</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>The United States defense establishment is approaching the verge
of open rebellion and internal collapse. If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, it
will probably happen in 1997. If Mr. Dole wins, it might take a little longer.
At this point, perhaps the only thing that can avert it is getting the American
people involved. The most pressing defense issue in this country is now
the need for a new covenant between the people and the military they support
with their treasure, their lives, and their blood.<BR>
<BR>
The revolt will begin over money. It no longer matters whose figures you
play with; the money to sustain and modernize the armed forces, in their
present configuration, simply isn't there. After the 1997-1999 projected
cuts, an additional twenty percent force reduction (personnel, weaponry,
readiness) may be inevitable. &quot;Rationing the poverty&quot; among the
services is no longer an option. Nor should it be, given the long-acknowledged
and long-ignored need to restructure for the 21st century.<BR>
<BR>
The rebellion could begin with a single service, reminiscent of the 1949
&quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; after cancellation of the &quot;supercarrier&quot;
that eventually evolved into the modern aircraft carrier. It could easily
erupt into open and vicious inter-service rivalry and turf battles, with
each service protecting its favored systems, and the roles and missions
that justify them. (One of the great technological truths of 20th century
warfare is that, while weapons systems have proliferated, effects have converged.
It is now possible to do things in many different ways: a fact studiously
ignored when it points to the need for major changes in service tasks.)
The revolt may also have an intense - and intensely public -- reserve aspect,
as the services attempt to siphon dollars to the active forces. However
it happens, it won't be pretty.<BR>
<BR>
The internal collapse will come about - indeed, it's already underway -
because of money, and because of the continuing subjection of the military
to civilian social and cultural agendas and experiments, and the continuing
refusal of the senior leadership to (as the beer commercial has it), &quot;know
when to say when,&quot; even at the cost of their careers.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Webb, decorated Marine veteran and former Navy secretary, made the point
loud and clear in his recent speech at the Naval Academy. But Jim Webb can't
do it alone. It's time for the American people to get loud and be clear
about what they expect from their military.<BR>
<BR>
A new covenant between people and military might sound something like this.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Listen up, Pentagon. You too, Commander-in-Chief (assuming that you
happen to be on active duty). You've got three primary missions. The first
is to defend We the People against that which threatens us the most. Currently,
that's weapons of mass destruction, especially small numbers of crude weapons
in the hands of small, crude nations and unlovely subnational groups. Deterrence
can't do it all. We expect to be defended, even if it means interfering
with some of your bureaucratic priorities. It's doable. Just do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your second task is to maintain conventional forces strong enough
to deter conventional aggressors, or whup them handily. This doesn't mean
large standing forces. It means restructuring to take maximum advantage
of U.S. technological superiority (especially in aerospace), and making
maximum use of the reserves and National Guard. Mobilizing the reserves
is We the People's de facto veto on going to war. If you don't have the
political support to invite us along, don't go.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your third task is to conduct (from time to time) humanitarian and
short-of-war operations, such as Bosnia, also with maximum use of the Guard
and reserves. We don't want to be the world's policeman; we'd rather not
be the world's nanny, guru, or sociopolitical therapist. But sometimes we'll
need to use a little muscle, just to remind the planetary DINGOs (Disturbers
of International Good Order) that we're capable of it.<BR>
&quot;Now, regarding who serves, and how, and why.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get two things straight. (And pay attention, federal government, because
we're demanding some major policy and legislative changes here.) First,
nobody has a right to serve. Second, nobody should be excluded from service
simply because somebody else doesn't like his, or her kind messing up the
club. As a society, we're dedicated to equality. But equality doesn't mean
sameness. And equality of opportunity includes the right to honest failure.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Minorities, women, and gays are in the military to stay. They should
have exactly the same rights, and be held to the same standards, as all
others in their positions. It's no disgrace for a woman not to be able to
fly an F-14; few people can. (By the same token, the Air Force has no need
of white male pilots; women and minorities can provide adequate numbers
and skill levels.) It's no disgrace for most women to be weaker than men.
But it is a disgrace for people to be recruited or promoted according to
quotas or &quot;guidelines.&quot; It is a danger for people to fly airplanes
they're not qualified to pilot. And it is preposterous when the Army, for
example, evaluates co-ed basic training on the basis of &quot;equality of
effort,&quot; not equality of results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are no gender-normed battlefields.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And speaking of battlefields, let's talk about sex. When homosexuality
is practiced within a unit, that unit becomes vulnerable to collapse. Ditto
heterosexuality. Sex within the same chain of command compromises that chain.
Sexual harassment is abhorrent. Zero tolerance. But the criterion for action
against offenders should be behavior, not gender or inclination It certainly
should not be unsubstantiated and anonymous allegations, the Tailhook Transgression
(guilty by virtue of just being there), or a single slip of the tongue,
no matter how boorish.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Finally, we're going to help you do all this in two ways. First, we'll
give you about a quarter-trillion a year to play with. More when you're
out there doin' it for fair. That should be enough, if you get your priorities
in order and use it right. Second, we're going to lessen the social and
cultural pressures upon you by severely limiting your vulnerability to lawsuits
from the civilian sector. Your minorities, your women, and your gays are,
by and large, competent and dedicated. But many of their self-styled civilian
defenders are more interested in scoring points - and wrecking institutions
- than in providing for the common defense. They impose their agendas on
you, whose reason for being is to defend us, not submit to their demands.
We want you to be free of endless predatory litigation and threat of litigation
while you're figuring out how to function in this post Cold War world and
this post racist, post patriarchal, post homophobic society that We the
People - fine People that we are - have become.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there is no reason to believe that, short of national emergency,
the American people will devote much thought to their military. They rarely
have before, and for that reason, many worry about the military becoming
a world too-apart. Yet perhaps the opposite is happening. In many ways,
the military has become a metaphor for the larger civilization - the loss
of purpose to peripheral concerns; the surrender to intimidation and expediency;
the vicious, wanton destruction of reputations, careers, and life. Why should
Americans think about the military now? Because it's like looking into a
mirror.<BR>
<BR>
Do we like what we see?

NEW AGE CHANNELLING FOR RIGHT-WING WONKS</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Dr. Philip Gold<BR>
Discovery Institute Senior Fellow</B></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Got a grant to write a culture book. Started reading New Age stuff (Know
Thy Enemy). Unbidden, the question arose: Can conservatives also recover
past lives? I asked a very liberal, very Buddhist lady friend. She replied
that conservatives could not recover past lives until they acquired present
ones. That made it personal. I decided to attempt Recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a dark and stormy night. I sat on the porch with the necessary meditation
aids -- scotch 4 soda, good cigars, meat-based munchies, and a yellow legal
pad to record the results. Trees howled. Wind swayed back and forth. And
when I accessed my first prior life -- Betakh-Betakh, senior fellow _ King
Solomon's think tank, the Center for_ Proverbial Wisdom -- I knew that the
Foundation would soon be getting its money's worth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fourteen other lives were recovered that night. Names have been omitted
when unverifiable and *** indicates possible false recovery.<BR>

<BR>
In sum, the Recovery was an unqualified success. Only problem is, the book's
getting impossible to write. Everybody has their ideas, wants their input,
needs to share. Except for Hiddekel, Perpetua, and Sir Hamilton. They just
edit.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Apollo Covenant beyond the Oscars</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
by <A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold</A></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
     &quot;Apollo 13&quot; did well at the box-office last year. A few nights
ago, it garnered _______ Academy Awards, for ___________. (Or: A few nights
ago, it didn't do quite so well at the Academy Awards, going zero for seven.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The movie was a hit for three reasons. Two are obvious. The third pertains
to the national crisis of soul, although not in a comfortable manner. Because
of this discomfort (actually, more of an existential bad faith), the real
significance of the film remains only dimly and squirmily acknowledged.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Dramatically, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a natural: a fast-paced technothriller
about a business-as-usual moon mission that went terribly wrong, then heroically
right. It was also a natural because it happened to be true. Technothriller
fused with nostalgia, for those years of hope and aspiration before JFK
got his sex life deconstructed and the Cold War's end deprived us of the
folks who, alone of all the powers on earth, could determine whether we
were Ahead or Behind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     But in a larger sense, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is about civilization
itself, and what it takes to sustain it. Seen this way, the movie teaches
some lessons that this country and its politicians and pundits -- for all
the glib-and-gushy verbiage about &quot;restoring trust and civil society&quot;
-- still haven't taken to heart.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The U.S. space effort of those years was, in essence, a set of three
covenants. One was between the government and the people, in accordance
with the constitutional requirement to provide for the common defense and
promote the general welfare. The Apollo project went forward to acquire
knowledge and opportunities, and as part of the global confrontation with
the USSR. That the knowledge and opportunities never materialized, and that
the Cold War aspect now seems questionable, does not negate the constitutional
validity of the covenant. The state, on behalf the the people and with broad
popular support, did what was deemed necessary at the time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second covenant was between the state and the men and women of
the space program itself, to make possible and sustain their success. This
the government honored as long as convenient. In a sense, the space program
met the same fate as Vietnam: not defeat, but abandonment. Perhaps, had
the government honored its commitment to exploration more steadfastly, greater
benefits might have been derived.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      But the most important covenant here was between the men and women
in the civil society of the space program, mutually pledging, if not their
fortunes, certainly their lives and sacred honor in the common endeavor.
In the film, Tom Hanks (playing astronaut Jim Lovell) tells his wife about
the first moon landing: &quot;It wasn't a miracle. We just decided to go.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    But the Apollo Covenant would have been quixotic without three human
virtues, each developed to near-perfection by the covenantors.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
   The first is hard-earned competence. After astronaut Ken Mattingly aces
a surprise simulator emergency, he waves off the praise and asks to work
the problem again because his performance hadn't been perfect. Lovell's
response: &quot;Let's get it right.&quot; When Mattingly's last-minute replacement,
Jack Swigert, muffs a similar drill, crewmate Fred Haise exudes a contempt
that doesn't abate until Swigert's final-hours display of skill and endurance
in preparing the command module for re-entry. &quot;Way to go, Jack&quot;
-- followed by Swigert's stoic, silent, and eloquent acknowledgement of
a covenant kept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Perhaps those who teach that self-esteem derives from psychobabble,
or that respect need not be earned, should include this film in their curricula.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second virtue is trust. Not touchy-feely emotion, but confidence
based upon experience of each other's competence and character. When flight
director Gene Kranz receives the devastating recommendations that they must
shut down the fuel cells (thereby &quot;losing the moon&quot;) and later
must power down the lunar module-lifeboat, his resistance fades before his
reasoned trust. When Swigert doubts that Houston can concoct a re-entry
procedure, Lovell assures him that &quot;they've got half the Ph.Ds on the
planet working on it.&quot; But near the end, when the crew almost believes
they're doomed, Deke Slayton tells them that &quot;Ken Mattingly's in the
simulator.&quot; Lovell's face and voice radiate relief.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Ken's working on it . . .&quot; One man they know and trust, worth
more at that moment than half the Ph.Ds on the planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The third virtue is courage, in Plato's definition: &quot;endurance
of the soul,&quot; in the face of both hardship and expediency. When Kranz
learns that President Nixon &quot;wants odds,&quot; presumably to prepare
for political damage control, Kranz replies: &quot;We're not losing those
men.&quot; When the &quot;Grumman guy&quot; starts hedging that his company
&quot;can't make any guarantees&quot; about the lunar lander's performance
in space,  Kranz first tries to stiffen him. &quot;I'm not interested in
what anything was designed to do. I'm interested in what it can do.&quot;
Later, he writes the guy off as beneath contempt. When he tells his flight
controllers, &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; he knows they understand
what he means, and they know he means it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Marilyn Lovell displays similar endurance, her circumstantial passivity
spiked by unwillingess to tolerate anything less than honesty from NASA
and her abhorrence of media ghoulishness. Indeed, among the Apollo convenantors,
those on the ground displayed endurance of the soul equal to those in the
space craft. It was fitting, if no doubt unintentional, that the film's
two nominations for acting excellence went to Ed Harris, who played Gene
Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     In sum, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a morality play. Its moral: You can
have your civilization, your accomplishments, your greatness. But it isn't
free and it isn't safe and it isn't easy. And, unless you're committed to
doing what it takes, one day failure will become an option.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     And then a fact.<BR>
<BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>The awful case of Commander Stumpf</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B><I>From the Seattle Times Friday, January 26, 1996<BR></I></B><H1><CENTER>UNWRITTEN LAWS GROUND <BR>STAR NAVY PILOT</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>By <BR><I>Philip Gold </I></CENTER></H3><HR><BR><BR>The Romans had a proverb. Of all our laws, some are written and some arenot. <BR><BR><BR>As is often the case with proverbs, their surface simplicity conceals deepertruths. In this instance, at least two. <BR><BR><BR>First, written law can't do it all. There must be other sources of valueand discipline and mercy: religion, morality, honor, tradition and commonsense. <BR><BR><BR>Second, these &quot;unwritten laws&quot; are just that - laws. They toocan become unjust, oppressive, insane. <BR><BR><BR>Latest American example: The case of Commander Robert E. Stumpf, UnitedStates Navy. The particulars concern his career. But his situation shouldbe a warning, a clear signal that the &quot;unwritten laws&quot; of thecivilian political processes are corrupting the military, just as they'vetainted politics. And the growing bipartisan support for Cmdr. Stumpf shouldalso be read as a sign. The American people are beginning to say, enough.Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf is, by all standard measurements, a man on the fast track to thestars. An accomplished fighter pilot, he flew with distinction in the GulfWar, commanded the Navy's elite Blue Angels precision flying team and enjoysa fine reputation within the service. The Navy selected him for promotionto captain in 1994; the Senate confirmed him. He was then selected for futureassignment as an aircraft carrier group commander, perhaps the most covetedflying job in the Navy. <BR><BR><BR>Now, what's wrong with this picture? For starters, three things: Cmdr. Stumpf'spresence at the notorious Tailhook '91 convention; a Navy clerical error,and the judgment of some people in very high places. Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf attended Tailhook under orders to receive an award for the squadronhe commanded. He flew there in an F/A-18, logged as a training mission -a totally acceptable practice, when such training missions have to be flownanyway and other forms of transportation are either inconvenient or costly.Cmdr. Stumpf was present in one of the &quot;hospitality suites&quot; andwitnessed a hired stripper's performance; tacky, but hardly illegal. Heleft and retired for the night before some reprehensible but consensualactivities took place. No assaults occurred in this particular suite. .<BR><BR><BR>Stumpf was later investigated by the Navy, along with everybody else sweptup in that botched inquisitorial frenzy. He was completely exonerated andreturned to duty. <BR><BR><BR>His second ordeal began a few months ago, after the Senate had confirmedthe promotion list on which his name appeared. Apparently, the Navy hadviolated Senate instructions to &quot;flag&quot; the name of anyone connectedwith Tailhook. The Navy informed the Senate Armed Services Committee ofthe error. It seems senatorial pique at having been &quot;deceived&quot;coincided with an anonymous phone-accusation campaign directed at the committee.Last October, apparently at a non-quorum meeting, the committee voted tooppose the promotion. The result was a letter so indicating to Navy SecretaryJohn Dalton, signed by committee chairman Strom Thurmond and ranking DemocratSam Nunn. The letter noted that, since, the full Senate had already acted,rescinding the promotion was the Navy's job. <BR><BR><BR>Secretary Dalton complied. <BR><BR><BR>As of this writing Cmdr. Stumpf has been informed neither of the &quot;accusation&quot;against him nor the identity of his &quot;accusers.&quot; He has been refusedpermission to meet with the committee, or to defend himself in writing.Mr. Dalton defends the reversal by citing the need to maintain the &quot;integrityof the process.&quot; Also as of this writing, the Navy is considering anew policy to let promotion boards view &quot;potentially adverse&quot;information on officers that would not be contained in an individual's officialfile - such as anonymous accusations. The Marines have already adopted thispolicy. <BR><BR><BR>Let's dispose of the obvious first. Tailhook was abhorrent. So was the Navy'sresponse. The guilty walked. The innocent bled. The service humiliated itselftwice over. <BR><BR><BR>Also obvious is the fact that the Navy needs to change its &quot;unwrittenlaws&quot; governing treatment of female service members, perhaps its attitudetoward women in general. However, the Navy and the Pentagon, need to startstanding up to the shrill minority of feminists for whom no sacrificialexpiation will ever be enough. How ironic it is that service women havemore in common with their male &quot;oppressors&quot; than with their anti-military&quot;defenders&quot; in The Sisterhood. And how sad it is that militarywomen now complain that they can't get the kind of counseling and mentoringthey need from their male superiors. The guys are afraid to be alone withthem. <BR><BR><BR>Now to the less obvious but vital fact. The handling of Cmdr. Stumpf's casereflects what is now the unwritten law of the United States. While the &quot;written&quot;legal system stands ready to excuse almost anything (remember O.J.?), theunwritten system is always ready to convict. Accusation now equates to guilt,perpetual guilt. Punishment is automatic and severe. And those who are persecutedbecome not deterrent examples of evil, but warnings to &quot;good people&quot;to stay away. <BR><BR><BR>Men and women are leaving the service in disgust, their numbers lost amidthe statistics of the personnel drawdown. Others, whose names will neverbe known, are simply refusing to enter. The same is happening in civilianpublic life. <BR><BR><BR>Who needs it? When a hero's career can be destroyed for simply being ina room where somebody else later did something; when a woman can lose aCabinet appointment because she didn't pay her nanny's Social Security;when a man can win a Supreme Court seat yet remain pilloried for life onthe basis of He Said/She Said, this is no longer a partisan issue. Thisis not the upholding of any moral standard remotely related to reality.This is a vicious, pharisaical, ex post facto, pseudo-moral McCarthyism,and worse. <BR><BR><BR>Cmdr. Stumpf should be the symbol around which can rally everyone - Democrat,Republican, civilian, military, male, female - who wants this way of doingthings stopped. <BR><BR>Let the inquisitions end here. <BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospace studiesat the Seattle-based Discovery Institute and a lecturer at Georgetown University.</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Psychobabble Rising</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><I>Insight magazine December 18, 1995<BR></I></H3><H1><CENTER>Psychobabble Rising, but we <I>Feel the Pain</I> </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I><A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold </A></I></CENTER></H3><BR><HR>Bill and Hillary. The president who feels your pain. The presidentialpartner (n&eacute;e first lady) who informs you that you know your lifeis empty and touts the Politics of Meaning as therapy. The couple who consideropposition to their caring policies as mean-spirited, unfeeling and paranoid,and who take to the airwaves to instruct the republic on how to talk tothe kids about everything from cigarettes to the Oklahoma City bombing.<BR><BR><BR>Ever since the Clintons first entered our collective consciousness (andcollective unconscious?) both the pundits and the people have noted theirpenchant for psychologized discourse. Columnist Suzanne Fields recentlysuggested that Clinton seems to aspire to a role nowhere mentioned in theConstitution or other legislation: therapist-in-chief. Most Americans probablyhave not viewed this as anything to get paranoid, neurotic, obsessed orborderline-disordered about. After all, psychobabble is everywhere. <BR><BR><BR>And that's the problem. Psychobabble-the reduction of personal and politicaldiscourse to minimal psychologized vocabularies-is no passing fad. It is,instead, the culmination of a century-long process. And, in many ways, Clinton-aman who seems to have neither core nor anchor, and scant sensibility savefor his image of others' image of him-is an appropriate president for anation in the final stages of psychologized dysfunction. <BR><BR><HR><H3><CENTER>***Psychobabble-discourse in psychologized vocabularies-is nopassing fad.*** </CENTER></H3><HR>A little history tells a lot. <BR><BR><BR>A century or so ago, this country experienced a deep cultural crisis. Comfortableold spiritual verities were yielding to the domineering, irrefutable truthsof materialistic science. As the cities filled with the new middle classesof the corporate workforce and with millions of immigrants, once-stablesocial patterns and traditions deteriorated. America seemed destined tobecome a multicultural, amoral mess. Divorce rates were rising. Crime wasrampant. Not everybody read, or even worse, respected the same books. Allthe little issues seemed to combine into one big issue that no one couldquite define, let alone solve. <BR><BR><BR>Enter the shrinks. <BR><BR><BR>One of the salient characteristics of the so-called Progressive Era (roughlyTeddy Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson) was the bipartisan deification of expertiseand the professionalization of just about every human activity that couldbe professionalized. Psychiatry was a profession, albeit a poorly regardedand remunerated one. Psychiatrists worked at the margins of medicine andsocial relevance, mostly in state and charitable mental hospitals and asylums.Meanwhile, in the ruts and grooves of academe, psychology was strugglingto establish itself as a separate and independent branch of human knowledge,i.e., as university departments with their own budgets and as an organizedbody of practitioners with lots of dull journals to read and pompous conventionsto attend. <BR><BR><BR>Both groups decided that respectability and affluence could be attainedby expanding their purview. Psychiatry, with a nudge or two from Freud andhis claque, decided that the whole world was sick and in need of its ministrations,whether it knew it or not. Ditto psychology, and that strange amalgam, psychotherapy,was born. <BR><BR><BR>(Scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as psychotherapy, onlya melange of competing theories and practices. Imagine a chemistry thatcontained 50 different definitions of a molecule.)<BR><BR><BR><BR>The therapists also decided that they could be of inestimable value by insertingthemselves and their notions into the workings of every aspect of the stateand on behalf of causes that appealed to them personally. So these new expertson the human spirit began peddling their wares everywhere they could findcustomers. <BR><BR><BR>And find them they did-in social work, the juvenile- and criminal-justicesystems, in education and the other disciplines, among the clergy, the literati,the artistes. Some worked out of universities; other found employment withthe government or the private sector, teaching corporations how to manufacturedocile workers and ardent consumers, helping the government hype its warsand policies and generally convincing the populace that theirs was the kingdomand the truth. <BR><BR><BR>By the 1950s, few Americans could find a mate, raise their kids, confronttheir troubles or know what to feel without seeking, or being affected by,these experts. In the 1960s, politics itself became psychologized-protestbecame a form of growth and fulfillment and the issue protested matteredless than the protest. Jimmy Carter probably was the first president whosemajor attractiveness was his therapeutic value. Feminism devolved into the-personal-is-politicalschtick of consciousness-raising and if-I-feel-oppressed-I-must-be. Nukeshad to go because they upset the kids. Welfare is good because it's caringand compassionate. Ecological legislation will help restore our global consciousnessand that is the primary goal, regardless of the real-world effects. <BR><BR><BR>Then came the talk shows. And the recovery books. And the &quot;abuse excuse&quot;in law. And the Clintons, who, like so many of their generational and politicalconfreres, insist on judging policies by their intent and not their results,and who attack their opponents' emotions, not their ideas. Thomas Sowellsees this as the fundamental characteristic-and perhaps weakness-of theliberal self-anointed. <BR><BR><BR>Psychologized discourse has been around for a century. It has had a centuryto prove that it can't deliver. It's not just that if heart surgeons hadthe same success rate as psychotherapists, they'd all be in prison. It'sthat a civilization in thrall to the psychological can't work. It createspeople who can conceive of themselves only as isolated units with the outerworld important only as a source of frustration or gratification. It createsa politics in which emotions become the goal, not the fuel. It makes rationaldiscourse impossible. <BR><BR><BR>And Bill Clinton represents the final stage of this deterioration. It isreported that, in his latest incarnation, he intends to campaign in 1996by portraying the Republicans as &quot;heartless.&quot; <BR><BR><BR>Democrat or Republican-do you like this form of governance? <BR><BR><BR>In your politics? In your courts? In your culture? In your private lives?And in your souls? <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a lecturer at Georgetown University. </I></B></CENTER><P><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Homee</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

But a nation can bestrong in the wrong ways. Since the 1994 election, there has been a growingdebate over the condition of the American military. Unfortunately, it isthe wrong debate, leading to the wrong conclusion-that America's defenseproblems can be solved by money alone. In reality, the present defense establishmentis an Industrial Age organization struggling to adapt to two new worlds:that of the post-Cold War disorder and that of the microchip. This year,the American people will devote well over a quarter-trillion dollars tothis increasingly obsolescent military structure. Because of mistakes duringthe post-Cold War builddown, some small selective, short-term increaseswill be necessary. But in the long run, the proper course is not to spendmore. The proper course is to spend smarter. This Discovery Inquiry offersa conceptual tool for thinking about such change. </I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><H4>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </H4><BR><BR>The current debate over national defense exhibits a curious sterility. Onthe surface, much of it involves the impassioned swapping of clich&eacute;s.Yes, we will always need somebody with a rifle on the ground; yes, aircraftcarriers can do things land-based aviation can't; yes, land-based airpowercan do things carriers can't; yes, redundancy of capabilities is important.Such statements have a &quot;true but not very helpful&quot; quality, sincethey say nothing about the proper mix of forces, or how to prepare and employthem. And, rather often, the clich&eacute;-mongers turn out to be thosewith special interests to protect. <BR><BR><BR>Beneath the bromides, the debate centers on two issues. One is readiness:real and perceived current inadequacies and the perhaps imminent dangerof a hollow force, unable to accomplish its missions, due to lack of training,equipment, and supply. The other is the capability of the current force,even if fully prepared, to handle the two &quot;nearly simultaneous majorregional conflicts&quot; posited as the strategic baseline in the Clintonadministration's Bottom-Up Review. <BR><BR><BR>So far, much of this debate has been an exercise in bean-counting, i.e.,quantitative assessments of how many billions spent, how many ships, divisions,and planes available, how many training days missed. These dry statisticsare often counterpointed by what might be termed &quot;analysis-by-anecdote&quot;-amelange of uncritically collected and repeated horror stories. <BR><BR><BR>The problem with this approach is twofold. First, readiness, like education,is a difficult condition to quantify. Statistics are easily manipulated,and readiness itself means nothing without asking: &quot;Readiness for what?&quot;For example, not everybody goes to war at once. If a division requires onemonth to prepare for deployment, but transportation won't be available forthree, high readiness is actually wasteful. Further, the services are stilldownsizing; it makes no sense to lavish resources on units slated for abolition.Many of the readiness horror stories appear to come out of lower-priorityunits. <BR><BR><BR>But more importantly, indices of readiness say nothing about what kindsof forces the U.S. ought to have. The analogy may be extreme but, in 1939,the Poles had the most ready cavalry in Europe. It is true that, short-term,the present force must be maintained at adequate, perhaps unprecedentedlyhigh levels. And, in fact, there is evidence that shortages have begun toaffect higher-priority units. But it is also true that the current forceis simply too large to be maintained at such readiness on any politicallyconceivable peacetime budget. Thus, the very attempt to maintain too largea force actually decreases overall readiness. A smaller force, differentlystructured and postured, is the logical alternative. <BR><BR><BR>Not surprisingly, the same bean-counting mentality that decrees the presentforce unready also calls for larger forces if the strategic requirementsof the Bottom-Up Review-the Clinton administration's conventional defensestrategy-are to be met. But the fundamental problem with the Bottom-Up Reviewis not that the forces available are inadequate. The problem with the Bottom-UpReview is that it's conceptually inadequate, and should be treated as such.<BR><BR><BR>The Bottom-Up Review posits the need to win two more-or-less simultaneousconflicts, presumably one in the Persian Gulf and one in Korea. The rationaleis that, should the U.S. find itself immersed in one war, another regionalpredator might be tempted to take advantage of the fact and start a second.Whether this might happen is speculative, at best. Less speculative is thefact that such a situation would be a national emergency unparalleled sincePearl Harbor (especially if an Iranian-Iraqi alliance ever materializes).Yet the Bottom-Up Review counts only active forces. In a two-front, perhapsa two-continent war, early and massive reserve mobilization would be unavoidable.<BR><BR><BR>Further, the Review accepts-indeed, effectively mandates-an operationalconcept guaranteed to produce maximum U.S. casualties and minimum results.In both wars, the U.S. would permit the aggressor to strike cross-borderfirst. U.S. forces would then &quot;stabilize the front,&quot; await reinforcements,counterattack and restore the status quo ante. Some of these forces, mostnotably heavy bombers and Marines, would &quot;swing&quot; between warsin a process lasting several months. This &quot;wait-get-hit-stabilize-reinforce-and-restore&quot;approach, itself a legacy of NATO planning for a Soviet invasion, workedin Desert Shield/Desert Storm largely because of Saddam Hussein's acquiescence.It must be doubted that the U.S. will ever again find so breathtakinglyco-operative an adversary. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, the Bottom-Up Review is far from the first U.S. strategy to sufferfrom a bad case of what is known at the Pentagon as the &quot;plans/realitymismatch.&quot; In the 1960s, Mr. McNamara and his Whiz Kids produced the&quot;2 1/2 War Strategy&quot;-simultaneous combat with the Soviets, theCommunist Chinese, and somebody else in a little war somewhere. (That 1/2war turned out to be Vietnam, which nearly wrecked the defense establishment.)Under Nixon, it became the &quot;1 1/2 War Strategy.&quot; During the Carteradministration, a &quot;Swing Strategy&quot;-moving hollow forces from warto war-enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame, and, mercifully, zero momentsof employment. <BR><BR><BR>In this sense, the Bottom-Up Review is not much different from its predecessors,and proof once again of General Eisenhower's dictum that &quot;Planningis essential; plans are useless.&quot; Or perhaps the Bottom-Up Review shouldbe regarded as merely a particularly inept transitional document, somethingto stick in the drawer until the world situation clarifies. But it mightnot be a bad idea if that drawer were to remain empty for a while. If theUnited States cannot currently produce a serious military strategy, perhapsit makes more sense to concentrate on the resources first. Then, with thattask underway, it might be useful to rewrite the brochure. <BR><H4>FORCE STRUCTURE, ROLES AND MISSIONS </H4><BR><BR>The military capabilities of any defense establishment are embedded in itsforce structure. Creating this structure is both art and science. Structuringentails an endless series of decisions and trade-offs: what to leave in,what to leave out, how to achieve the necessary combat synergies. Forcestructure is everything from how many divisions in the Army (and whetherdivisions are still a useful kind of organization) to how many riflemenin a squad and who will carry the grenade launchers and machine guns; howmany ships in the fleet and of what types; how many heavy bombers and whatkinds of munitions they will carry. <BR><BR><BR>Theoretically, and usually in practice, a nation's force structure is determinedby its geographical position and strategic needs. Historically, for mostnations, necessity requires that one service or form of power dominate;the others support. In the 20th century, for example, Germany and Russiawere land powers. Both got into serious strategic and economic trouble whenthey started acquiring navies they didn't need, but that threatened maritimepowers. Conversely, Great Britain was primarily a naval power; extendedland combat in two world wars devastated the country. Israel is a land power,although its situation dictates a very strong Air Force. Other countries-NorthVietnam comes to mind-succeed with little besides ground forces. <BR><BR><BR>Further, a country's force structure will be determined by whether its warsare fought at or close to home, or far away. Expeditionary forces cost muchmore than equivalent territorial forces, since they require sea and airlift,resupply, and, often, foreign basing. Expeditionary forces also tend tobe professional and available for duties short of all-out war. Often, theiruse does not signal long-term commitment. Territorial forces, on the otherhand, are often filled by conscripts, and-in the democracies-usually limitedto home defense or foreign wars fully supported by the population. <BR><BR><BR>But America's strategic needs are unique, and its military exhibits characteristicsof both territorial and expeditionary forces. <BR><BR>U.S. forces are, virtually by definition, expeditionary. They are also professional.But they operate under the severe political limitations characteristic ofdemocracies, not the least of which is the requirement that victory be rapidand relatively bloodless. U.S. force structure is also unique. No nationhas ever amassed the same mix: the normal array of land, sea, and air capabilitiesplus: <UL><LI>a fleet of large-deck aircraft carriers <LI>the world's largest Marine Corps <LI>long-range stealthy bombers <LI>an incomparable C3I (command, control, communications, intelligence)capability. </UL><BR><BR>America's mix of normal and unique, territorial and expeditionary capabilitieshas evolved throughout the 20th century. However, for a variety of reasons-fromchanging threats to technological revolutions and the popular insistenceon short, perhaps impossibly &quot;clean&quot; wars-the present structureis no longer adequate. The mix must change. <BR><BR><BR>Prior to the First World War, things were simple. If it happened on land,the Army tended to it; the Navy pursued its activities at sea. There were,of course, a few overlaps. The Army maintained coastal fortifications andartillery. The Navy might occasionally bombard a shore or land small partiesof Marines. But neither service could do, or take, the other's job. <BR><BR><BR>The airplane blurred this tidy division of labor. So did the mixing andmatching of hitherto unrelated systems. In World War II, carrier aviationroutinely struck ground targets. Land-based planes could take on fleets,provide convoy protection, etc. Simultaneously, a plethora of new capabilitiesdeveloped: armor, paratroops, submarines, large-scale amphibious forces,and strategic bombers, to name a few. Later came helicopters, missile-firingsubmarines, and the precision-guidance revolution. <BR><BR><BR><I>The result is that today, while military technologies and systems haveproliferated, their effects have converged</I>. It is now possible to fightin many different ways. For example, it used to be axiomatic that the bestanti-tank weapon was another (preferably larger) tank. But today, thereare easily over twenty different ways to destroy tanks: other tanks, infantryanti-armor weapons, special artillery munitions, helicopter gunships, attackaircraft, various mines. Conceivably, in a few years, submarines will beable to fire cruise missiles carrying anti-tank submunitions, each guidedto its target by internal sensors or by satellites. When ships underwaterfight tanks well-inland with the aid of systems in space, clearly, the conductof war could use some sustained rethinking. <BR><BR><BR>But there is another aspect to this proliferation and convergence of technologiesand systems. Capabilities that once were unique or clearly complementarycan begin to seem redundant, especially in an era of nebulous threats andconstrained resources. For example, once aircraft carriers and Marines couldgo where land-based aircraft and paratroop couldn't; ships had longer rangesand more staying power than planes, and that was that. They still do, butsuch staying power may not always be a relevant characteristic. Today, AirForce heavy bombers operating from only three bases (in the United States,Guam, and on Diego Garcia) can strike anywhere on earth within eighteenhours of alert. Paratroops out of North Carolina can reach, say, Beirut,faster than Marines steaming through Gibraltar. Thus, there are now at leasttwo ways to perform long-distance &quot;get-in-and-get-out&quot; air andground operations. <BR><BR><BR>This is not to say, of course, that carriers and Marines are obsolete. Farfrom it: Each service still possesses unique core competencies. Nor is itto suggest that redundancy is undesirable; in war, redundancy is vital.But it is to suggest that the current structure and mix of forces can bereconfigured to make maximum use of this new array of capabilities in anaffordable manner-even if this involves some alteration of each service'straditional roles and missions. <BR><BR><BR>From time to time, the Pentagon's internal struggle over roles and missions(technically, roles, missions, and functions) enters public consciousness.The subject can seem arcane. In reality, though, it's as simple as it issignificant. Imagine a theater company. Its mission is to stage &quot;Hamlet.&quot;To do this, it requires an on-stage cast. Each member plays a role. Somemay play, or prepare to play, more than one. Finally, the troupe needs alarge number of supporting functions: lights, tickets, PR, etc. <BR><BR><BR>At the highest military levels, joint and unified commanders (the GeneralSchwarzkopfs) receive missions. They draw their cast of characters and supportingspecialists from the individual services and from the larger defense establishment.Obviously, the needs of the combatant commands should determine what theservices purchase and train for. Indeed, the unified commanders and thePentagon's Joint Resources Oversight Council have achieved significant influenceover the process. But the individual services still write their own budgets,in accordance with roles and requirements carved into law decades ago. Andthe legal and bureaucratic history of this assignment process has been,in large measure, the history of making sure that the services get whatthey want. <BR><BR><BR>But today, the problem is how to make the new array of capabilities relevantto the myriad challenges of the 21st century. And one of the great hindrancesto a new force structure is the old division of labor. <BR><BR><BR>What follows is not so much a detailed list of recommendations for reallocationof roles, missions, and functions as it is a way of thinking about suchreallocations. <BR><BR><BR>To repeat: The problem is not money. This country can defend itself on abit less than three hundred billion dollars a year. But the establishmentmust be restructured. Less-of-the-same no longer avails. <BR><BR><BR>And neither does more-of-the-same. <BR><H4>GUIDING CONCEPTS FOR A NEW DEFENSE</H4><BR><BR>The following points provide a conceptual framework for restructuring defense.Full implementation would probably require changes to Title 10, USC, andto Department of Defense Directive 5100.1, the basic legal and tasking documents.For present purposes, such specific changes need not be addressed. <OL><LI><B>1) We're in an asymmetrical arms race. </B>It is obvious that thepost-Cold War world offers a variety of threats, from heavily armed aggressorstates to terrorist splinter groups. Less obvious is the fact that thereis an arms race going on-an historically unique arms race, in that it isthoroughly asymmetrical. The United States is, for practical purposes, outof the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) business. Development and productionof precision-guidance weapons and systems are now primary. Meanwhile, theplanetary predators develop or purchase nuclear, chemical, and/or biologicalweapons, along with crude but serviceable delivery systems. Thus, the fundamentaltask is to make U.S. power effective against both conventional forces andweapons of mass destruction. <LI><B>2) Culture constrains combat.</B> The American people, for reasonsranging from innate decency to media hype and hysteria, will not acceptprotracted land combat or heavy casualties. This means that, politicallyas well as militarily, it is vital to deter aggression or, failing that,to win rapidly and decisively. This is especially true because future aggressorsmay well try to create conditions in which the United States deters itselffrom responding to aggression. This can be done by initiating conflict inwhich protracted fighting and heavy casualties will be inevitable, or bystriking so quickly and successfully that response becomes pointless orcounterproductive. To avoid these situations, conventional deterrence mustbe overwhelmingly credible. Should deterrence fail, the rapid use of overwhelmingforce will be imperative. <LI><B>3) The U.S. is an aerospace power</B>. This overwhelming force hasa special character. Militarily, the United States is neither a land nora sea power, as these terms have traditionally been understood. The U.S.neither defends its territory against invasion nor covets the lands of others;there are few pieces of real estate anywhere for which this country wouldfight. Nor is there an enemy fleet to seek out and destroy, or sea lanesmenaced by raiders. The United States is, instead, an aerospace power: thefirst and only one in history. Aerospace power, in all its aspects, is thegreat American comparative advantage. Aerospace does not mean exclusively,or even primarily, &quot;Air Force.&quot; It centers on the Air Force, butalso includes naval aviation, Army capabilities, and-of great importance-precision-guidedweaponry and C3I systems. True, aerospace power will not be relevant toevery situation. But, since it is the great U.S. advantage, and since theAmerican people abhor bloody ground combat, as a general rule: Whatevercan be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. <LI><B>4) Aerospace forces come first.</B> It is time to recognize thatthe precision-guidance revolution, coupled with long-range and stealthydelivery platforms (submarines as well as aircraft) has the potential tochange the nature of conventional combat. For millennia, it has seemed axiomaticthat, since people live on land, wars must ultimately be settled on land,i.e., by the taking and holding of territory. However, as Clausewitz pointedout, war is a political act, intended to compel the enemy to do our will.In any given situation, territory may be a vital element of victory; itmay also be irrelevant. Terrorist groups or rogue states may or may notpossess territorial ambitions. Still, it has remained taken-for-grantedthat, in conventional war, the land campaign must be the centerpiece. Allelse supports the ground war. <BR>But in Desert Storm, land combat didn't win the war. Land combat finishedit. In the future, presidents and commanders may wish to repeat the DesertStorm sequence: a devastating air war followed by a relatively easy groundcampaign. Alternatively, they may decide, or be forced to decide, that theland campaign must be central. But they should have the aerospace option.This means that the Air Force's unique capabilities-global range, stealth,advanced precision weaponry-should not be tied, doctrinally or operationally,to the ground campaign. It also means that the air components of the otherservices should be kept strong and employed creatively within their ownrealms. <BR><BR><LI><B>5) Force structure must reflect reality.</B> From this it followsthat U.S. structuring priorities should be:<BR><BR>  <UL>  <LI>Aerospace power in its many aspects   <LI>Rapid response Marine and Army forces possessing substantial combatpower. This includes a Marine Corps of about 175,000 and a selection ofArmy paratroop, air-mobile, and light infantry units at battalion/ brigadelevel, plus other (Ranger, Special Forces, etc.) units.   <LI>Heavier Army units at brigade/division/light corps level capable ofrapid deployment and employment.   </UL></OL><BR><BR>For the Army, this entails both continuation of a post-Vietnam trend anda radical rethinking. In the 1970s, the Defense Department chose, for budgetaryand political reasons, to adopt and seriously implement the &quot;TotalForce Policy,&quot; declaring the reserves equal to the regular forces forplanning and employment purposes. This meant, among other things, that theArmy couldn't engage in protracted war without reserve mobilization. TheArmy wisely accepted this policy, recognizing that reserve mobilizationprovided a crucial test of popular support and national commitment. In the1990s, this policy should be pursued with renewed vigor. <I>Militarily aswell as politically, the capability to wage sustained ground warfare shouldreside with the people</I>. Today, the Army is a force of over a million,when reserve and National Guard units are counted: certainly an adequatenumber, if properly structured and prepared. <BR><BR><BR>Two principles follow. First, if a threat is not worth mobilizing the reservesto counter, or if the reserves can't be mobilized for political reasons,it's probably not wise to get into a major war. And, second, If large unitscan't be ready to fight in a very few weeks, they probably belong in thereserves. <BR><BR><BR>As a practical matter, this means that the Army must reconsider the natureof its larger active-force units. The old division and corps structure,with its many layers of command and staff, and its ponderous logistical&quot;tail&quot; may well be obsolete; future forces might better be a flexiblemix of brigades tailored into light corps, with reduced staffs and supportunits. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, not every active unit, regardless of size, can be ready all thetime. But large unready active units are a waste of money. The Army is themost labor-intensive of the services, and there are significant cost savingsin cutting personnel. Since World War II, the Army has been structured forexpansion as well as for immediate employment. World War II demonstratedthat, while a lieutenant or a private might be turned out in a few months,competent senior officers and non-commissioned officers took many yearsto develop. In effect, the Army stockpiled these people on active duty againstsome future mobilization requirement, finding them employment in bloatedstaffs, unnecessary organizations, and endless schools. But the days ofIndustrial Age warfare-of protracted mass mobilization-are gone. The activeArmy needs to downsize even more, modernize, and capitalize. And, in fact,the Army is moving toward these goals in a variety of experimental programs,although there is a certain reluctance to admit it too openly. This trendshould continue. <OL><LI><B>6) Structure determines spending priorities.</B> Defense spendingshould accord with these priorities. And, for the next few years, one ofthe top priorities should be acquisition of ample precision-guided munitionsand supporting systems, plus stockpiling of critical parts in the eventof a &quot;surge&quot; production requirement. The United States is indeedan aerospace power, but that doesn't mean that, just because something haswings, the Pentagon has to buy it. There must be rational trade-offs betweenplatforms and munitions. </OL><BR>The best example here is the B-2 stealth bomber. At over $800 million percopy for the 20 already on order, and at $20,000 per hour to operate, theplane is simply too expensive. Nor are next-generation fighter and attackaircraft an urgent priority; upgraded current models will serve for thenext few years. True, sometime after 2000, new aircraft will be required,and development should proceed aggressively. Air superiority is not a God-givenAmerican right; it must be maintained. But, for the next few years, themunitions will be more important than the platforms that launch them. Whenthe price of a B-2 bomber is also the cost of more than 800 Tomahawk cruisemissiles, for the Navy and the Air Force, the correct choice is obvious.<BR><BR><BR>Other high priorities include aggressive development of next generationsystems and ample funding for the Army's experimental programs. R&amp;Dis future readiness; it should not be sacrificed to maintain the presentforce at the present size. A final priority: airlift and fast sealift. Themost powerful military on earth is useless if it can't get to the war, orsustain itself once there. <BR><OL><LI><B>7) Presence and peacekeeping options expand</B>. In recent years,two activities short-of-war have consumed enormous resources. One is theso-called &quot;presence mission,&quot; i.e., keeping combat-ready forcesin and around various global hot spots. The most effective presence is,obviously, permanently overseas-based, combat-capable forces. But, for betteror worse, U.S. forces are coming home. The next-best presence forces aredeployed aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine amphibious ready groups;these units are mobile, operate in international waters, and have significantcombat power and sustainability. They are also vital during the transitionfrom crisis to war, and as the &quot;enabling&quot; force that permits theArmy and Air Force to get ashore. But they are also expensive, and presencemay now be defined as more than the up-close-and-personal. </OL><BR><BR>To the extent that presence is a condition in the mind of would-be aggressors-theknowledge that the stealth fighters and bombers and the Tomahawk-firingsubmarines and the paratroops are also out there-these capabilities mayaugment, and sometimes replace, more traditional forces. It's not a perfecttrade-off, but one that is both available and reasonable. The trade-offcan also lead to the conclusion that the constant deployment of carrierbattle groups may no longer be necessary in certain areas. The Navy hasrecognized this for years. Its efforts and experiments in &quot;adaptiveforce packaging&quot;-sending out presence forces without the large-deckcarriers-should continue. Marine amphibious carriers and surface ships armedwith precision-guided weaponry may not be as powerful or versatile as thebig-deck battle groups, but the option is valuable. <BR><BR><BR>The other major short-of-war activity consists of peace-keeping and humanitarianoperations. These are expensive, exhausting, and demoralizing. They alsowreak havoc with operating schedules and tempos, especially when a crisiserupts and the Joint Chiefs call on whatever units might be available. Aspecial Army peacekeeping division might not be a bad idea; if established,it should not count against Army end strength, or be funded out of Armyappropriations. <BR><OL><LI><B>8) Home defense belongs in the structure.</B> Finally, defense, likecharity, begins at home. Although the United States is not vulnerable toinvasion, it is entirely open to attack by weapons of mass destruction.Too often, the debate over continental defense comes down to a spuriouseither/or. &quot;Why build defenses when bombs can be smuggled in?&quot;and equivalent arguments. But it's not either/or. And, in fact, many ofthe battlefield and theater weapons now coming into the hands of potentialpredators could be used against the continental United States. Launchinga crude cruise or ballistic missile from a yacht or merchant ship on thehigh seas may well be easier than assembling and emplacing so-called &quot;suitcasebombs.&quot; These weapons can now be targeted with the aid of commerciallyavailable satellite navigation systems. </OL><BR><BR>And the United States is not alone in facing this problem. Many other nationshave a vital interest in defense against limited attacks. Russia, especially.It is therefore imperative that the United States begin a serious home defenseprogram, based upon maximum use of available and developing battlefieldand theater defenses, and in concert with other nations, whenever possible.What will it cost? Less, no doubt, than someday pondering the crater whereManhattan once stood, or the million bloated corpses that used to be thegood people of Puget Sound. <BR><H3>Conclusion </H3><BR><BR>The preceding has dealt with the conceptual framework for defense restructuringin a transitional era. Today, there is no defining threat. There is, however,a defining opportunity, created by changing technologies and world politics.These require a new force structure. But unnecessary defense spending is,domestically as well as internationally, a clear and present danger. Evenduring the coldest days of the Cold War, President Eisenhower could warnthat it was possible to spend too much on defense, and to spend it wrongly.His admonition is still apt. <BR><BR><BR><HR><H4>Dr. Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and directorof the Institute's Aerospace 2010 Project.

<H1><CENTER>SAM BEARD WANTS TO RESTORE HOPE IN AMERICA BY REFORMING SOCIAL
SECURITY</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Any American currently earning $10,000 per year pays $23.85 a week, or $1,240
a year, into Social Security.  If invested at market rates, at the retirement
age of 65, that investment would make anyone a millionaire (before inflation).
 That is the conclusion of Sam Beard, Chairman of the National Development
Council, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow, and author of Restoring Hope
in America: The Social Security Solution, to be published by ICS Press of
San Francisco in May.  Beard, who has worked for four U.S. Presidents, has
been investigating Social Security and exploring ways that all Americans
can be secure in retirement.  <BR>
<BR>
He begins a national book tour in Seattle at a Discovery program on May
14, 1996 at Kane Hall (Room 220) on the University of Washington campus.
 Co-sponsored by the UW Graduate School of Public Affairs and the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, the program begins at 7:00 p.m. and is free to Discovery
members; $5.00 for non-members.  Students will be admitted for free.  <BR>
<BR>
To assure seating, members are encouraged to call Discovery Institute at
287-3144.  While tickets will be sold at the door, <A HREF="http://www.discovery.org/cgi-bin/register.cgi">non-members

<H1><CENTER>Former head of EPA speaks out on the politics of the environment</CENTER>

<PRE>
What have been the effects of the current Congress on the state of the environment? Specifically, what
changes has the new Congress considered in the statutory base of the Environmental Protection Agency? What
effects do the differences in Eastern vs. Western approaches to environmental legislation have on this
important issue?

These and other issues are addressed by William D. Ruckelshaus, former head of the EPA at an April 23,
1996 Discovery Institute luncheon. Currently Chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, Ruckelshaus recently
testified before the U.S. Congress on retooling the EPA statutory base to promote industry flexibility and
creativity while continuing to protect the environment. The luncheon is at the Four Seasons Olympic Metropole Room from Noon to 1:30 p.m. 

Cost for Discovery members is $40; non-members $45. Tables of ten are available for $400. Preregistration
is required, and prepayment is due by April 19, 1996. Please use the Event Order Form on the back page, or
call Julie Lanz at Discovery at 287-3144 for further information.

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law &amp; Policy Forum housed on Discovery website</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>

The tremendous growth of the Internet over the past few years has brought a host of issues to the fore. Those
of immediate concern include security, intellectual property, digital records management and access,
jurisdiction, taxation, privacy, electronic payments and transactions, and the resolution of Internet disputes.
Attempts by governmental bodies to resolve these issues have resulted in rulings that are inconsistent and
unsatisfactory to the vast majority of Internet users.

To resolve current and future issues of importance to the international community of users, the Internet Law
Task Force (ILTF) was created at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium held in Seattle last year. After
months of deliberations, the Internet Law and Policy Forum has been created. A non-governmental, global
organization, it is based for the interim at Discovery Institute. The goal of the Forum will be to achieve a
secure Internet, facilitate Internet communications in an atmosphere of self-regulation, and achieve the
harmonization of Internet law and policy at a global level, according to Albert Gidari, Discovery Senior
Fellow and one of the organization's founders.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H1><CENTER>From the President</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>
This redesign of Discovery Journal is a sign of the Institute's move &quot;to the next level&quot; of activity and maturity. 
Board members, friends, and other advisors all urged us to make a prompt and brisk leap ahead. It is happening
this year.


We have enlisted for the first time an Executive Director and are setting out to hire a professional development
officer. The redesign of publications will extend to our other publications: Inquiry, our white paper series, and
Views, our compilation of Discovery Fellows' articles. Thanks to the generosity of the M.J. Murdock
Charitable Trust and our corporate sponsors, we have built a well-received interactive Internet website and are
creating a new computer network for staff and Fellows. 


Financial planning, staff functions, and events development are all being reorganized. There are several new
projects--and Fellows--to be announced soon. Having been the grateful guests of the Perkins Coie law firm
for nearly six years, we also expect to move soon into new, more capacious offices. 
Discovery Institute's purpose is clearer than ever: to move beyond today's public policy problems to discover
tomorrow's opportunities. We look for the big idea. And for practical ways to make it happen. Guiding our
big ideas (such as the freedom model of high technology, exploring life after materialism, common sense
environmental law, revolutionizing Social Security, and overhauling the adversarial legal system) are the
principles of personal responsibility, civic virtue, free market economics, internationalism, and representative
democracy.


Discovery Institute has always stood for this purpose and these principles. Only now we are trying to move
ahead a bit bolder and faster. 


We appreciate your joining us on the journey.


All the best,
Bruce Chapman</PRE>

Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder continues to be widely-published and sought after for his thoughts
on the future of high technology and telecommunications. Gilder's &quot;Telecosm&quot; series is featured in each issue of the highly influential Forbes ASAP magazine. His work
was the subject of a lengthy cover story in the March 1996 issue of Wired magazine. In addition, his theories
were the focal point for a piece in the January 1996 issue of the same magazine.

Frequently testifying before the U.S. Congress, <A HREF="ggtstmny2.html">(read Gilder's April testimony)</A> Gilder will next appear in April before the Senate Commerce
Committee on the need for change in spectrum allocation policy and the future of the FCC. In late March,
Gilder will premiere an eight hour multimedia presentation on the technological future, developed at Discovery
recently. The first showings: a conference of 1,000 business executives in Brazil, followed by presentations
in Japan and Italy. In addition to his work on high technology, Gilder has written a number of notable articles recently on other
subjects: on the immigration debate (&quot;Geniuses from Abroad&quot;) in the Wall Street Journal, and on welfare
reform (&quot;How Welfare Seduced Sam Brewer&quot;) in the February 1996 Reader's Digest. </PRE>

<PRE>Discovery Institute's annual <A HREF="religion.html">George Washington Fellows Program</A> will be held this Summer from July 15 to
August 11, 1996. An intensive four-week seminar on religion and politics for upper-level undergraduates and
first-year graduate students, the program is designed to give Fellows an in-depth understanding of the role
religion can play in a free society.

In addition to regular classroom discussion sessions, there will be a number of special forums on specific issues
led by nationally-recognized scholars and thinkers. Past forums have been led by George Gilder, George
Weigel, Edwin Meese, and Program Fellows Stephen Meyer and Edward Larson.

Questions or requests for information should be directed to Dr. John West at Discovery Institute. Applications
may be obtained by calling 287-3144. The deadline for applications is April 26.

<H3>Upcoming conference</H3>
<PRE>The Religion, Liberty, and Civic Life Program will also sponsor a one-day conference on &quot;Faith and Politics&quot;
on August 10, 1996 at Seattle Pacific University. The proceedings from last Summer's conference, &quot;The Death
of Materialism,&quot; have recently been published as a special issue of The Intercollegiate Review. More
information on this year's conference may be found in the June issue of the Journal.

<H3>Book publication</H3>
<PRE>The University Press of Kansas will publish <I><A HREF="preface.html">The Politics of Revelation and Reason: Religion and Civic Life
in the New Nation</A></I>, the new work by Discovery Fellow John West. 

Described by noted historian Mark A. Noll as &quot;a fresh, well researched, and extremely well-balanced account
of religious-political connections in the early republic,&quot; the book by the Director of Discovery's Religion,
Liberty, and Civic Life Program will be released in May.  Though West's book focuses primarily on the past rather than the present, he thinks it holds many lessons for
today. 

&quot;The more I studied the early years of our nation,&quot; says West, &quot;the more I realized that present controversies
are simply a continuation of arguments that have been going on from the start. There is a tremendous amount
we can learn from how religion became involved in politics in early America. The issues may be different,
but the principles are the same.&quot;

Discovery members wishing to place prepublication orders for the book should call the Institute at 287-3144.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>According to a recent study, people who are now in their

<BR>
</B>THE FACTS ARE CLEAR. When the baby boomers hit retirement, Social Security
will run out of money, and the timetable for reform requires meaningful
change by the end of the century. Based on over three years of extensive
research and consultation with S.S.I. experts and authorities, <I>Restoring

benefits and guarantee financial security in <B>your</B> retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Social Secuirty reform must happen within the next five years or America
will face economic disaster in the next century, and unacceptable social
consequences in the pitting of young against old. Resotring Hope In America
is a call to action -- action based on accountability and reason in establishing
a new &quot;Declaration of Financial Independence&quot; for the modern workforce
and instituting guidelines for pension management by the government.<BR>

</I>Carl Jung Meets Newt Gingrich</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <A HREF="gorsky.html">Frank Gregosrky</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="warn-stripe-1.gif" WIDTH="774" HEIGHT="8" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>No one who ever worked with Newt Gingrich has a complete picture of him.
In fact, the only man to portray him fully died over 30 years ago -- and
the two never met. This essay comes as close as anything will to bringing
them together.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Back in April 1983, Newt told his D.C. staff: &quot;There are consistencies
of pattern but not consistencies of process. You can't predict from day
to day what I'll do, but you can predict from day to day what, in a general
way, I'll be doing.&quot; In those days, he struggled to be heard and heeded.
He assumed his staff could maximize his reach, if only they understood his
method. He thought his GOP colleagues could seize the House, if only they
would implement his latest 25 projects. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Newt explained himself blue, while they -- most staff, many allies --
ran themselves ragged. Eventually, many of us just ran. Even when we could
finally &quot;do what he wanted,&quot; he suddenly no longer wanted it.
Becoming GOP Whip finally put some order into Newt's daily operations, and
the Speakership may complete the process. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet my guess is that his hyper-creative entrepreneurial nature will regularly
override the new post's structure and scheduling. If so, Newt's associates
still require a yardstick, a divining rod, to truly &quot;understand&quot;
him. I have one, and I'll tell you where to obtain it. But first, savor
its best parts, in bold, followed by a comment or two on each.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>[His] morality is governed neither by thinking nor by feeling; he has
his own characteristic morality, which consists in a loyalty to his vision
and voluntary submission to its authority. </B>Much like Bill Gates creating
Microsoft or Andy Grove guiding Intel, Newt Gingrich obeys his vision. Unlike
them, he is used to flying solo. As he told a senior staff group in September
1982: &quot;I only have coherently explainable positions when I'm forced
to stop and develop them.&quot; Otherwise he keeps piling intuition atop
intuition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The stronger his intuition, the more his ego becomes fused with all the
possibilities he envisions. He brings his vision to life, he presents it
convincingly and with dramatic fire -- he embodies it, so to speak. But
this is not play-acting, it is a kind of fate. </B>Yes, Newt has &quot;known&quot;
since teendom how he was fated to shape and lead a transformed Republican
Party. Ego may help power such a person's overarching goal, but it is never
the determining motivation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>He seizes on new subjects with great intensity, sometimes with extraordinary
enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without any compunction
and apparently without remembering them, as soon as their range is known
and no further developments can be divined.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B>Anyone in Washington ever put in charge of a &quot;Newt project&quot;
will nod at this passage's correctness. As Newt said in 1983: &quot;I don't
do by planning, I plan by doing.&quot; It's a workable formula for a creative
individual surrounded by acolytes, but tends to cause chaos in a growing
structure run by colleagues who need to trust the central figure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that he has always
just reached a final turning point, and that from now on he can think and
feel nothing else</B>. Anyone who has just heard the latest of several Gingrich
presentations will concur. Newt acts and talks as if it's a total departure,
when usually it's a 5-10% modification. Though amusing to insiders, this
relentless enthusiasm keeps his talks immune to the cynicism lurking in
every Washington job. More importantly, it facilitates national recruiting.
(Cynics sometimes get to wage war, but only charisma can raise an army.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The intuitive is never to be found in the world of accepted reality values,
but he has a keen nose for anything new and in the making. Because he is
always seeking out new possibilities, stable conditions suffocate him.</B>
And this is why Gingrich, even as Speaker, will be a revolutionary. He could
not manager the status quo, making deals for the sake of comity, even if
he wanted to. This forecast has little to do with conservative ideology,
and everything to do with the type of leader and movement-personality he
is fated to be.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And what type is that? An Extroverted Intuitor. My hidden source tells the
complete story -- on pages 222-25 of The Portable Jung, a 1986 Viking paperback
edited by the late Joseph Campbell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the visionary psychologist Carl Jung never met the brilliant
partisan Newt Gingrich. Yet every single line in the pages I cite appears
to apply. (They come from his 1923 work Psychological Types, which 20 years
later was used to design the first of the Myers-Briggs evaluations.) With
such a tool, why rely on insider gossip and ideological tracts? Carl Jung
long ago wrote Newt's basic script. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Since his intuition is concerned with externals and with ferreting out
their possibilities, he readily turns to professions in which he can exploit
these capacities to the full. Many business tycoons, entrepreneurs, speculators,
stockbrokers, politicians etc. belong to this type.<BR>
<BR>
</B>For a striking case study, explained by a guru Gingrich also likes,
consult Peter Drucker's 1983 essay on Thomas Watson Sr., whose vision drove
IBM beyond time clocks and keypunch machines: &quot;Watson saw and understood
the computer 15 years before the term was even coined. He knew right away
that it had to be radically different from a high-speed calculator. And
he did not rest until his engineers had built&quot; the SSEC in 1947, which
was the first machine &quot;to combine electronic computation with stored
programs, with its own computer language, and with the capacity to handle
its instructions as data.&quot; (See chapter 33 in The Frontiers Of Management.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Technologies then came in response to Watson's leaps of information-age
insight. Similarly, <BR>
the Republican-run House now taking shape will fill in gaps envisioned by
Gingrich's intuitions of 20 years ago. Politics needs its entrepreneurs,
too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Final Jung sampler: <B>Such a type is uncommonly important both economically
and culturally. If his intentions are good, i.e. if his attitude is not
too egocentric, he can render exceptional service as the initiator or promoter
of new enterprises. He is the natural champion of all minorities with a
future.<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
Doesn't that final line clinch my case? House Republicans finally have a
future, Newt's intentions are good, and he has enough independently elected
peers to head off dangerous lurches -- all of which makes the prognosis
excellent: American governance is embarking upon a five or 10-year stretch
that, at least on domestic reform, will make Reagan's best years seem like
a sloppy rehearsal. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before I left his payroll, Newt advised the staff to read up on
Churchill. In one of the Manchester books, I found this description of him
at age 4l: &quot;He is a wonderful creature, with a curious dash of schoolboy
simplicity and what someone said of genius -- 'a zigzag streak of lightning
in the brain.'&quot; So said Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, sounding like
Bob Michel appraising his own successor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this city, reading Winston Churchill is more common than studying Carl
Jung texts. But, if you seek to confirm a the new Speaker's &quot;consistencies
of pattern if not of process,&quot; Jung's piece, written 20 years before
Newt was born, offers the only direct path. It will help us &quot;predict
from day to day what, in a general way, he'll be doing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I needed Doctor Jung's description a dozen years ago, but didn't know where
to look. Now you do. After you read it, you might say a prayer for the current
generation of Gingrich aides. Why? It goes back to the point Drucker made
about Watson: &quot;Because visionaries cannot explain to the rest of us
what they see, they have to depend on command.&quot; <BR>

<P>Just by going about their highly difficult business, President Clinton
and Speaker Gingrich have been redefining campaigns and coalition-management.
Out of improvisation and intuition, they are trying things that might --
I would say should -- become a model for elected officials generally.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone knows how a politician in search of power goes about making commitments,
implicit or explicit, to his or her natural constituencies, in the hopes
that all of them add up to a majority on election day. When the commitment-making
is blatant (Walter Mondale in 1984) or merely clumsy (George Bush in 1992),
the candidate is assaulted by the other party for &quot;pandering.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So far, so normal. But consider what signals are sent to the profession:
All candidates, from their first race on, are conditioned to see the commitment
game as a tightrope to be walked. Don't lean too far either way. Don't seem
aloof, but neither should you appear overobligated. Be loyal to your &quot;base&quot;
-- without becoming &quot;owned&quot; by these same voters' lobby groups.
Keep your options open in Washington -- but beware winding up with no one
who will fight to re-elect you at home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most voters see through the above balancing act, and many politicians become
exhausted by it -- that's the bad news. The good news is that Messrs. Clinton
and Gingrich -- fellow baby-boomers and master orators who imagine they
can convince anyone of anything -- have been developing a new set of tools
for riding herd on to their respective partisan coalitions. I call it transactional
leadership -- a sort of &quot;share the risk&quot; public deal-making that
emulates the norms of private life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider a typical marriage in trouble. The husband is silent, morose, and
sick of being asked to share his feelings. The wife has therefore taken
to overstressing hers, and becoming both more needy and more bitter. One
public couple -- Michael and Kitty Dukakis -- played out this mirror-imagery
in the late 1980s. He was the rock, she was the hailstorm -- but, under
presidential-campaign pressure, each tendency made the other worse. Like
political forces, the two &quot;parties&quot; in a marriage can get dug
in at extremes that end up shriveling their union's productive &quot;center.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now consider a partnership, perhaps in real estate or law. Office footage
is being cut in half, so is the client-base, and the next year looks to
be a long dark trough. The partners can dig in and make demands, or they
can reach out and enlist this crisis of survival for some kind of longer-term
win/win. The partners could all commit to go six months without salary,
plowing all new revenue into (a) paying the unavoidable bills and (b) advertising
and other business-development. In short, share the risk -- and prove your
staying power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What the marriage crisis needs is this: &quot;I'll take the risk of reforming
if you take a risk and make some of your own needed changes. We will suffer
differently, but together, and in a hopeful direction.&quot; The business
example is one of going back to &quot;sweat equity,&quot; as if the partners
are starting the enterprise from scratch, by taking a blood oath to recapitalize
and build for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ask yourself: Does anything like that ever happen in the public phase
of politics? Forget the backstage favor-swapping and vote-trading among
individual legislators -- I'm talking about a top political figure proposing
a public transaction, to part of his electoral coalition, so a political
risk can be shared on the way to eliminating it. Technically this is not
a straight &quot;deal,&quot; but more of a negotiation begun while everyone
watches. The leader says: I'm willing to take the heat [for the group this
audience represents] on an unpopular vote. And I expect you to change your
act, and image, over the next two years so we don't have to bleed again
in the next Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of all national leaders, Newt Gingrich is the only one I see doing this
with gusto. I first witnessed it as his deputy press-secretary in September
1978, when President Jimmy Carter and a heavily Democratic 96th Congress
were pushing national price controls on hospitals. All the Georgia medical
groups expected Newt, about to win the first election, to fight his home-state
President's bill. And he said he would -- but he also told the Atlanta AMA,
point-blank, that they faced ultimate NATIONALIZATION if they stuck with
business-as-usual and ignored middle-class fears about profiteering and
bureaucracies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was great: A candidate telling his own supporters they can count on him
only so far. And beyond that? Get real, folks. Get serious about your own
survival in a democracy where the debate never stops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen years later, during the first version of his famed &quot;Renewal&quot;
course, Gingrich did something similar. He told both the FDA and the AMA
-- the latter still an ally, the former a growing &quot;enemy&quot; -- to
work toward reform according to the same unifying principle. Listen to how
Newt phrases it:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Guess what, gang? An awful lot of what the<B> </B>AMA is about is
a medieval guild: It is setting up government required rules that only if
you go through THIS school, pass THIS board, and are accepted by THIS group,
will we certify you. Now I don't think we should say, 'You want to do brain
surgery like Jethro on<I> The Beverly Hillbillies,</I> show up Tuesday...'
There ARE things you want certified; [but] I do think -- whether it's hospitals,
drugs, doctors or the Food &amp; Drug Administration -- there is a lot of
potential FLEXIBILITY in delivering things, and we need more pragmatism
and less credentials.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus spoke Newt, in November 1993, at Kennesaw State. The very same month,
to a quite different audience but one vital to his survival, Bill Clinton
also talked candidly. In Memphis, after a dazzling account of Martin Luther
King, middle-class black progress and urban mayhem, the President told a
vast assembly of black ministers: &quot;We have to make a partnership --
all the government agencies, all the business folks. But where there are
no families, where there is no order, where there is no hope, where we are
reducing the size of armed services because we have won the Cold War, who
will be there to give structure, discipline, and love to these children.
You must do that and we must help you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that moment, Clinton was leading the coalition that passed NAFTA. He
had just surprised Republican free-traders by enlisting most of the large
environmental groups. A re-elected George Bush could never have brought
these groups into the free-trade fold, and the way Clinton pulled it off
(with those so-called &quot;side agreements&quot;) amounted to competent
coalition-juggling -- and fairly public too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During his '92 campaign, Clinton had proposed a &quot;New Covenant,&quot;
under which different types of responsibility would become the price for
continued government support. His party, running Congress during 1993-94,
did not go along. Ironically, those Republicans who aren't ideologically
opposed to activist government -- chief among them Speaker Gingrich -- COULD
go along with the Clinton's 1992 themes as well as his Memphis framework.
So? Look for the New Covenant to come back in '96 with a different name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Certain U.S. Presidents (JFK and LBJ occasionally, Teddy Roosevelt all the
time) have put forth sweeping proposals -- &quot;deals&quot; in the national
interest -- to groups inside their own political tent. Doing so acknowledges
the latter's influence -- while forcing them to use at least some of it
for a non-selfish purpose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contrast that with today's Republican candidates for President -- the people
who expect to replace Clinton and become Gingrich's main ally. They trudge
before all the hot groups -- gun-owners, medical interests, tobacco farmers,
Perot conventioneers -- and hand out plates of red meat festooned with iron-clad
pledges. FOR WHAT? No one, not even a habitual horse-trader like Phil Gramm,
so much as hints that these single-issue or self-righteous voter blocs owe
him, or the country, anything back. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Mr. Would-Be President and Guardian of the National Interest, if you
are too much of a weenie to suggest something exalted, everyone watching
on C-SPAN assumes you require only the petty: PAC money and petitions and
buses for election day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Especially today, more national officials need to notch down their interest-group
checkmarking and try out the Gingrich/Clinton model: BE real in your major
addresses, and GET real with some of your otherwise demanding audiences.
Float a deal -- not a petty one, but exalting: &quot;I will stick my neck
out for you here, but I expect a helping hand to transform this issue afterward,
for America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guess what? Whoever sees this play out whole will be reassured. After all,
national cynicism is so thick that few believe a candidate acts on altruism
or principle anyway. We assume their &quot;no strings attached&quot; pledge
is supposed to be rewarded, <I>sub rosa</I> and backstage, by money or access
later. Wouldn't it be far healthier to see our political leaders TRADE the
risks they take for some compatible restraint or innovation from the interest
groups each one has to work with? Bill Clinton did so to save NAFTA, and
Newt Gingrich is already refining this creatively &quot;transactional&quot;
leadership model for the great Medicare struggle. More leverage to him.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>By Design: A Whitworth professor takes a controversial stand
to show that life was no accident</CENTER>
</H1>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></CENTER>
<P><B>The year was 1952.</B> In a laboratory at the University of Chicago,
a young graduate student named Stanley Miller set up an experiment that
would profoundly affect the way scientists thought about the most vexing
and factious of scientific questions: How did life begin on Earth? Using
a flask of boiling water, some tubing and a couple of electrodes, Miller
began exposing a mixture of reduced gases - methane, ammonia and hydrogen
- to an electrical charge. When he popped the top off his flask a week later,
he found something astonishing. In addition to the yellow-brown &quot;tar&quot;
that had formed on the inside of the flask, the reaction had produced some
amino acids - the organic building blocks of protein molecules, which are,
in turn, the building blocks of life.<BR>
<IMG SRC="meyerclass.jpg" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="136" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="left"><HR WIDTH="92%">
<H2><I>In class, Meyer uses the simplest of visual aids to convey the complexity
of a living cell.</I></H2>
<H3><HR WIDTH="92%"></H3>
When Miller published his findings the following year, the mainstream press
heralded his work as a monumental step in explaining how life on a primordial
Earth could have sprung forth from a lifeless sea of chemicals. It was that
same year that James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University in
England ushered in the era of molecular biology when they elucidated the
DNA strand and showed how genetic information was stored and transmitted.
Science, it seemed, was well on its way to answering the colossal questions
posed by life itself.<BR>
<BR>
But 40 years after Miller performed his historic experiment, scientists
are not appreciably closer today to discovering how a lifeless pool of chemicals
could have possibly organized itself into even the most primitive single-celled
organism, said Stephen Meyer, a Whitworth College philosophy professor who
has staked out a very controversial position in the origins debate. In fact,
Meyer said, the materialistic theories of life's origin that Miller's experiment
nourished and the accompanying neo-Darwinian view of evolution exhibit all
the symptoms of a theoretical research paradigm in distress. As Meyer describes
it, making the leap from a few simple amino acids stuck on the side of a
flask to a living, functioning, self-replicating cell is the equivalent
of trying to take a young child's first syllables and rearrange them into
Stephen J. Hawking's A Brief History of Time. And no one has been able to
get past the first steps in the process, Meyer said. <BR>
<BR>
But if nature isn't capable of generating life by its own devices, as Meyer
maintains, how did we get here? According to Meyer, nature had some help.
To the consternation of many scientists throughout academe, Meyer and a
group of up-and-coming young scientists and philosophers across the country
espouse a theory called &quot;intelligent design&quot; to explain the origin
of life. In the process, Meyer has become one of the central players in
the newest twist of an age-old debate. <BR>
<BR>
Simply stated, intelligent design theory argues that life on Earth arose
via the purposeful act of an intelligent agent, which people might choose
to view as a deity. At some point when the planet was young, say 3.5 billion
years ago, there was an intervention by an intelligent agent that somehow
provided what was needed - sequenced information, organic material, energy,
etc. - for life to spring forth on a lifeless planet. Furthermore, and this
is key to the theory, proponents of intelligent design maintain that evidence
of design in even the simplest living organisms is scientifically detectable
by applying new mathematical and informational theories.<BR>
<BR>
In the last two years, Meyer's opinion pieces and columns on the origins
debate have appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Insight
magazine, and many scientific and philosophical journals. Meyer has helped
organize origins symposia, presented papers, contributed to books, and engaged
one of the most divisive issues of the scientific enterprise with dogged
prolificacy. He has spoken at origins conferences from the University of
California-Berkeley to Cambridge University, where he gave a plenary address
at the &quot;Cosmos and Creation&quot; symposium last summer. At 36, his
vita is as thick as those of scholars many years his senior. Currently,
with grant support from the Pascal Center for Advanced Studies in Science
and Religion, Meyer is writing a book about design with Bill Dembski, an
expert in math and complexity theory, and Paul Nelson, who recently received
his Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from the University of Chicago.<BR>
<H3>Skepticism evolves</H3>
A 1980 Whitworth College graduate who majored in physics and geology, Meyer
took a job out of college as a geophysicist with Atlantic Richfield. Meyer
said that throughout his undergraduate years, he had always reconciled his
scientific work and religious convictions by believing that evolution and
theism were not incompatible. &quot;I was quite comfortable accepting the
standard evolutionary story, although I put a bit of atheistic spin on it
- that (evolution) is how God operated.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
While working for ARCO and living in Dallas, Meyer attended a conference
that brought together top philosophers, cosmologists and origin-of-life
biologists to debate the religious implications of contemporary scientific
findings. &quot;I remember being especially fascinated with the origins
debate at this conference. It impressed me to see that scientists who had
always accepted the standard evolutionary story were now defending a theistic
belief, not on the basis that it makes them feel good or provides some form
of subjective contentment, but because the scientific evidence suggests
an activity of mind that is beyond nature. I was really taken with this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although he enjoyed his work in the oil industry, Meyer had always wanted
to go to graduate school. He applied for a Rotary International Scholarship
to Cambridge University but finished runner-up to the former Miss Texas.
A year later, when oil prices took a plunge and his level of job security
followed, he again applied for the Rotary Scholarship, received it, and
was off to Cambridge University. There he studied the philosophy of science,
wrote his dissertation titled &quot;A Methodological Interpretation of Origin-of-Life
Research,&quot; and earned his Ph.D. Meyer returned to Whitworth College
in 1990 as an assistant professor of philosophy and was named the1993-94
recipient of the Dean's Award for Junior Faculty Achievement. This fall
he was promoted to associate professor. In addition to his philosophy courses,
he is a member of the teaching team for CORE 350, an interdisciplinary course
that explores the scientific tradition and its impact on the world. <BR>
<H3>Purposefulness vs. purposelessness </H3>
It was in 1859 that Charles Darwin's Origin of Species rocked the scientific
and theological worlds by declaring that life, in all its diversity, complexity
and splendor, had evolved from the simplest of life forms over billions
of years. Human beings were not the handiwork of a divine creator, but rather,
in the words of the late Har-vard evolutionist G.G. Simpson, &quot;Man was
a result of a purposeless process that did not have him in mind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The biggest question at the root of the origins debate is purposeless
chance versus intelligent design or guidance,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Is
life the result of purposeless or purposeful causes? At the most basic,
most fundamental level , you see incredible evidence for intelligent design.
It's becoming clearer and clearer that the ordinary processes of nature
that we see in operation now do not produce the kinds of structures and
complexity that we see at work in a cell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer argues that by using modern information and probability theory, evidence
of design in the form of non-random information sequencing in living organisms
is detectable. He points out that astrophysicists are already using a similar
technique to search for evidence of intelligence in another realm. The $100-million
Search for Extraterrestrial Life project, or SETI, is essentially a giant
interstellar microphone that monitors the cosmos for non-random messages.
The purpose of the project is to detect evidence of intelligent life in
the universe. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer said the same mathematical approach can be applied to biology to probe
for intelligent design. Within each living cell there is a chemical code
or language that exhibits non-random, aperiodic complexity. To Meyer and
his colleagues, the non-random sequences of these chemical messages strongly
suggest design. Even the simplest single-celled organisms show daunting
complexity and organization, Meyer said. These organisms exhibit a functional
integration of parts, information storage and transfer mechanisms, regulatory
and feedback loops, hierarchical levels of organization. &quot;If we were
to see these kinds of features in any other artifacts, we would immediately
infer that they were designed.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Horse heads in the clouds</H3>
But Meyer's critics, who would constitute the bulk of the scientific community
at research universities around the world, say Meyer has hopped the fence
that separates science from philosophy and theology, and has dressed up
an antique creationist theory as science. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a feeling of deja vu here - we've been through all that and
it's plowed ground,&quot; said Richard Dickerson, professor of biochemistry
and geophysics at UCLA, and former director of the Molecular Biology Institute
there. &quot;Intelligent design is a disguised form of creationism. To say
that a life form arose because of a designer goes beyond science. That's
philosophy. It's religious apologetics, which is not necessarily a bad thing
so long as it's not done in the name of science.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ken Kardong, an associate professor of zoology at Washington State University
who teaches evolutionary biology, agrees that intelligent design is an incarnation
of an idea that has its roots in the early 19th century, and the same flaws
apply. &quot;These kinds of views are fun to discuss and play with, but
I would be very reluctant to see these old arguments recirculated,&quot;
said Kardong, who said he has his own problems with some aspects of neo-Darwinism,
but believes that the theory will evolve to solve more and more riddles
of the origins debate. &quot;When you start calling something in nature
'designed,' it is an inference, not a fact. It steps outside of the context
in which scientists do their work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kardong likens intelligent design theory to looking at a bank of white fluffy
clouds. When you see a cloud that's shaped like a horse head, does that
mean it's been designed; does that mean a purpose can be inferred? No, said
Kardong, not if you want to stay within the realm of science. The problem
with intelligent design is the same because it does not start with a neutral
point of view. &quot;If you look at enough clouds, you're going to see a
horse head.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lee Anne Chaney, associate professor of biology at Whitworth, also offers
a dissenting view of intelligent design theory. &quot;As a Christian, part
of my belief system is that God is ultimately responsible. But as a biologist,
I need to look at the evidence. Scientifically speaking, I don't think intelligent
design is very helpful because it does not provide things that are refutable
- there is no way in the world you can show it's not true,&quot; she said.
&quot;Drawing inferences about the deity does not seem to me to be the function
of science because it's very subjective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yet Meyer disputes the demarcationist argument that intelligent design is
inherently unscientific. &quot;Scientists make design inferences all the
time,&quot; he said. &quot;No geologist, for example, would attribute the
origin of the faces on Mount Rushmore to wind and erosion, nor would an
archaeologist insist that the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone are the
result of purely natural causes. In the case of the Rosetta Stone, we infer
design because we know that only intelligent agents have the capacity to
produce the encoded information that the inscriptions contain. There is
an important and clear difference between a &quot;picture&quot; in a cloud
and an encoded message. And modern probability theory entirely supports
this conclusion.&quot; <BR>
<H3>Secular high priests</H3>
Beyond the weighty issue of how life originated, the origins debate raises
big questions about the nature and philosophy of science. Just what is science,
and when it comes to the issue of origins, what delineates science from
philosophy and theology? Is science only concerned with the material universe
and the laws of nature, the observable, the physical, the empirical, the
falsifiable? Or with the contentious question of life's origins, where direct
observation is not possible, can science make room for something more?<BR>
<BR>
According to Meyer, no case better illustrates the politics of origins than
the plight of San Francisco State University Biology Professor Dean Kenyon.
Although his supporters and critics disagree as to the value of his work
in the discipline, Kenyon co-authored the 1969 textbook, Biochemical Predestination,
which was considered one of the most authoritative explanations of how a
living cell could have organized itself from lifeless chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But by the 1980s, Kenyon had begun to have his doubts about the dominant
scientific paradigm he had worked hard to advance, and he began to share
those doubts, along with information about intelligent design, with his
students. In 1992, following complaints from several students that Kenyon
was teaching creationism, the head of the biology department at SFSU removed
Kenyon from the classroom. The Kenyon case became something of cause celebre
for Meyer and others working on intelligent design. After Meyer did an op-ed
piece about Kenyon's case in The Wall Street Journal, and pressure from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee and the American Association of University
Professors mounted, Kenyon was reinstated. Nevertheless, the biology department
at SFSU has proposed a ban on further discussion of intelligent design theory
because it is &quot;unscientific.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Kenyon case teaches us a lot about who de-fines the rules of the
debate,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Kenyon was silenced not because any of his
data were inaccurate, or because his students didn't like him. He was silenced
because his dean sought to impose a definition of science that made Kenyon
fall out of bounds.&quot; <BR>
In order to justify this kind of thinking, many in the scientific establishment
use self-serving definitions of science to justify excluding intelligent
design, Meyer said. But the &quot;rules of science&quot; that exclude intelligent
design are applied selectively. &quot;Dean Kenyon was accused of violating
the canons of the scientific method because he had inferred an unobservable
entity - an intelligent designer. Yet scientists, including evolutionary
theorists, routinely infer the existence of entities that cannot be seen,
such as fields, forces, quarks and past mutations, to name a few.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that, in any case, attempts to draw a rigid line separating science
from philosophy or religion do not work. &quot;Origins theories invariably
have religious and philosophical implications one way or the other. There's
a lot more going on here than just a debate over data. There is also a power
struggle over who will get to tell the creation story for our culture. For
years, materialistic-minded biologists have functioned as a secular high
priesthood. They have defined what the questions are, what the rules are,
and what answers can be considered. Now, as more scientists are realizing
that nobody really has any idea how nature could have produced the complexity
and information in the first cell, many are challenging the authority of
that elite. Unfortunately, some in the scientific establishment are resorting
to intimidation to stifle dissent.&quot;<BR>
<H3>The insect and the elephant</H3>
In a recent edition of Insight magazine, Meyer debated these issues with
Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education in
Berkeley, Calif. Scott, who also believes that intelligent design is dressed-up
creationism, gave her appraisal of Meyer's place in the origins debate.
Scott likened Meyer to an insect next to the elephant - &quot;a minor annoyance
if it's noticed at all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that ad hominem comments aside, he realizes that as a proponent
of intelligent design theory, he is vastly outnumbered in the scientific
world. But that is starting to change as more scientists begin to look for
an alternative to strictly materialistic theories, he said. &quot;There's
tremendous optimism and enthusiasm - a whole network of people are working
on this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And indeed, intelligent design does appear to be catching on in some circles.
At the Cambridge University conference last summer, several senior scientists,
including biochemist Michael Behe of Lehigh University, cell biologist David
Shotton of Oxford University and polymer scientist Walter Bradley of Texas
A&amp;M University gave sympathetic papers in a seminar that Meyer had organized
on &quot;Detecting Design in Creation.&quot; Recently, Princeton University
plasma physicist Robert Kaita gave intelligent design theory favorable mention,
calling it &quot;eminently reasonable&quot; in a Wall Street Journal piece
on the origins debate.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, Meyer and other scientists and philosophers who are pursuing intelligent
design theory have started their own E-mail bulletin board on the Internet,
where they exchange ideas, critique each other's work, and chart out a new
theoretical research program to test their hypothesis. Today there are more
than 130 scientists and other academicians contributing to the E-mail network.
It's like talk radio for the scientifically disenfranchised.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the history of scientific revolutions, numbers don't mean much,&quot;
said Meyer. &quot;Very few people can cause meaningful changes if they have
the goods and can deliver them. Right now we're in the very early stages
of a new approach to things.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But what is Meyer's place in the origins debate? Is he just an insect next
to the elephant? Definitely not, said Phillip Johnson, the Jefferson E.
Peyser professor of law at the University of California-Berkeley, author
of Darwin on Trial, and initiator of the E-mail bulletin board. Johnson,
who also supports intelligent design theory, said Meyer is on the leading
edge of an effort that is attracting more and more researchers and could
ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in the scientific world. &quot;Right
now the intellectual ground is being plowed for a critical debate whose
time has come. Steve and his colleagues are raising some tremendously important
issues,&quot; Johnson said. <BR>
<H3>Young Earth creationists - NOT!</H3>
As important as it is for Meyer and his colleagues to articulate precisely
what their views are in order to establish some credibility in the mainstream
scientific community, it may be equally important for them to establish
firmly what their views do not represent. That may be the greatest obstacle
they face - not being grouped with the marginal characters of the origins
debate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's interesting - when I first came to Whitworth, some people thought
I must be one of those people from the young Earth creationist camp, which
is simply not true,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;We're not absolutists, we're
not fundamentalists in the sense that we want to commit to a certain story
and we're not young Earth creationists, We're fairly minimalist. What we
want to say is that however life arose, design is certainly detectable from
the things we see.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer does not dismiss all aspects of evolutionary theory; he says it's
clear that over time life has evolved and diversified. &quot;That's microevolution
and no one disputes that,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;The big question involves
macroevolution, the origin of new structure, the origin of new information,
the proper sequencing of that information, the origin of major body parts
and functionally integrated systems. Those are unsolved questions. And yet
we have this great extrapolation from very little data, and it is promulgated,
pushed and advertised to the culture as what science has discovered.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Purposeful tension</H3>
It is no accident that Steve Meyer has taken up shop at Whitworth College.
It is a place where faculty purposefully integrate their Christian faith
into the disciplines they teach. But it is also a place with a solid academic
reputation where faith and the pursuit of knowledge do not stand in the
way of one another, he said. That purposeful tension allows Meyer to vigorously
pursue an alternative approach to the origins issue without fear of reprisal
or of being relegated to the fringe.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whitworth doesn't have the reputation of being a stridently fundamentalist
school and it does have a strong academic reputation,&quot; Meyer said.
&quot;It's a place where I can speak on these issues and not bring immediate
scorn and eye rolling. A lot of my colleagues at secular universities could
not have spoken out on the Kenyon issue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How do his colleagues at Whitworth view Steve Meyer? Several faculty members
said that Meyer is a razor-sharp intellect, a great teacher, a dynamic lecturer
who energizes his students, and a prolific writer and researcher who has
vigorously engaged the most challenging issues of his discipline. Yet his
unabashed advocacy of a controversial theory does not come without some
intellectual discord. Some faculty members also said Meyer can be too polemical
and that he tends to turn the scientific method on its head. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer knows that there will never be a shortage of people to disagree with
him. &quot;Howard Stien (professor emeritus of biology) and I used to go
around and around on this issue,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;People thought
we were great enemies and that we didn't like each other, but we were actually
great friends. Howard was just more willing to wait for the Darwinists to
solve the problem while I was looking for another approach.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lois Kieffaber, professor of physics and one of Meyer's CORE teaching partners,
finds herself a bit torn when asked about intelligent design theory and
its philosophical implications for the scientific world. &quot;I do not
rule out the possibility that a supernatural or design event could leave
a footprint in the materialistic world that could be interpreted and read,&quot;
she said. &quot;However, whenever you try to put forth a theory like this
to explain what's happened in the past, you have no way of proving it false.
It's both exciting and scary to think about the boundaries of science being
pushed back. Can the material world give evidence of the immaterial world?
That would be a dramatic change in the way science works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Hans Bynagle, Whitworth's library director who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy
from Columbia University, said he believes Meyer is fighting an important
philosophical battle on an issue that challenges the governing rules of
science. And Bynagle believes science needs to open up if it seeks to find
elusive truths. &quot;We divide up knowledge into boxes for the sake of
organization and convenience. But we can't assume because we draw those
boxes that when we look at reality, everything is going to fit neatly in
those boxes; nor can we rule out certain things because they don't happen
to fit neatly into those boxes.&quot;<BR>
Whether they agree or disagree with him on the origins issues, students
taking a class from Meyer can be assured of lively, thought-provoking discussions
that force people to think through their assumptions about the world. Perhaps
Forrest Baird, professor of philosophy at Whitworth, puts it best. &quot;Steve
brings diversity to Whitworth and he brings a very important kind of diversity
- diversity of ideas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For Meyer, this debate is just beginning. Discussion of these issues is
taking place on a level that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago, he
said. The pinhole is becoming a crack. &quot;We are trying to create space
in those branches of science that are concerned with ideologically charged
questions,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;We want to show that there is an evidential
basis for intelligent design and that the evidence is there. The next 10
to 15 years are going to be very interesting.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>When most of us think of the controversy over evolution</B>
in the public schools, we are likely to think of fundamentalists pulling
teachers from their classrooms and placing them in the dock. Images from
the infamous Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial of 1925 come to mind. Unfortunately,
intolerance of this sort has shown itself in California in the 1990s as
a result of students complaining about a biology instructor. Unlike the
original Scopes case, however, thiscase involves a distinguished biology
professor at a major university -- indeed, an acknowledged expert on evolutionary
theory. Also unlike Scopes, the teacher was forbidden to teach his course
not because he taught evolutionary theory (which he did) but because he
offered a critical assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
The controversy first emerged last fall after Dean Kenyon, a biology professor
at San Francisco State University, was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot;
by John Hafernik, the chairman of his biology department. Mr. Kenyon, who
included three lectures in biological origins in his introductory course,
had for many years made a practice of exposing students to both evolutionary
theory and evidence uncongenial to it. He also discussed the philosophical
controversies raised by the issue and his own view that living systems display
evidence of intelligent design -- a view not incompatible with some forms
of evolutionary thinking. <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Hafernik accused Mr. Kenyon of teaching what he characterized as biblical
creationism and ordered him to stop. <BR>
<BR>
After Mr. Hafernik's decree, Mr. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote
the dean, Jim Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kelley replied by insisting that Mr. Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view,&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation
on a young earth.&quot; Mr. Kenyon replied again (I paraphrase): I do teach
the dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and
that some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. <BR>
<BR>
He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching introductory
biology and reassigned to labs. <BR>
<BR>
There are several disturbing aspects to this story: <BR>
<BR>
First, Mr. Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary theory and the
scientific study of the origin of life. He has a Ph.D. in biophysics from
Stanford and is the co-author of a seminal theoretical work titled &quot;Biochemical
Predestination&quot; (1969). The<BR>
book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific publications
on the origin-of-life problem. But by the late 1970s, Mr. Kenyon began to
question some of his own earlier ideas. Experiments (some performed by Mr.
Kenyon himself) increasingly contradicted the dominant view in his field.
Laboratory work suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves
into complex information-bearing molecules such as DNA -- without, that
is, &quot;guidance&quot; from human experimenters. <BR>
<BR>
To Mr. Kenyon and others, such results raised important questions about
how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was. If undirected
chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information found
in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence have
played a role? By the 1980s, Mr. Kenyon had adopted the second view. <BR>
<BR>
That a man of Mr. Kenyon's stature should now be forced to lobby<BR>
for the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of
origins, is absurdly comic. Mr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in
the world about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research
scientists. Yet he now finds that he may not report the negative results
of research or give students his candid assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
What is more, the simplistic labeling of Mr. Kenyon's statements as &quot;religion&quot;
and the strictly materialistic view as &quot;scientific&quot; seems entirely
unwarranted, especially given the philosophical overtones of much origins
theory. Biology texts routinely recapitulate Darwinian arguments against
intelligent design. Yet if arguments against intelligent design are philosophically
neutral and strictly scientific, why are Mr. Kenyon's arguments for intelligent
design inherently unscientific and religiously charged? In seeking the best
explanation for evidence, Mr. Kenyon has employed the same method of reasoning
as before he changed his view. His conclusions, not his methods, have changed.
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is that in biological origins theory, dominant players currently
insist on a rigidly materialistic mode of explanation -- even when, as Mr.
Kenyon maintains, explanation of the evidence requires more than the limited
powers of brute matter. Such intellectual strictures reflect the very essence
of political correctness: the suppression of critical discourse by enforced
rules of thought. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, San Francisco State University's Academic Freedom Committee
has come to a similar conclusion, ruling decisively this summer in Mr. Kenyon's
favor. The committee determined that, according to university guidelines,
a clear breach of academic freedom had occurred. <BR>
<BR>
Apparently, however, Mr. Hafernik and Mr. Kelley disagree. Mr. Hafernik
has emphatically rejected the committee's recommendation to reinstate Mr.
Kenyon, citing his own freedom to determine scientifically appropriate curriculum.
In response, the American Association of University Professors informed
the university last month that they expect Mr. Kenyon's mistreatment to
be rectified. Meanwhile, as SFSU considers its response, a worldclass scientist
waits -- yet another casualty of America's peculiar academic fundamentalism.<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B>LIMITS OF NATURAL SELECTION A REASON
TO TEACH ALL THEORIES</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">by Stephen C. Meyer</FONT>

<HR></CENTER>
<H3>The sky is falling.</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or so you might think if you've been reading press accounts
of the controversy in Sultan over how to teach biological origins. Some
say that if Sultan allows students access to information challenging contemporary
Darwinism, all manner of ill will prevail. Not only would such information
confuse students about the facts, it would mislead them about the very nature
of science. Worse, it would let fundamentalist religion into the science
classroom. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Such thinking misses the mark. Contrary to predictions,
greater openness in the biology curriculum is necessary if our students
are to achieve scientific literacy and escape ideological indoctrination.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Current biology instruction presents only half the scientific
picture. For example, none of the standard high school biology texts even
mentions the Cambrian explosion, arguably the most dramatic event in the
history of life. Indeed, fossil studies reveal &quot;a biological big bang&quot;
near the beginning of the Cambrian period 530 million years ago. At that
time, at least fifty separate major groups of organisms or &quot;phyla&quot;
(including all the basic body plans of modern animals) emerged suddenly
without clear precursors. Fossil finds have repeatedly confirmed a pattern
of explosive appearance and prolonged stability in living forms&oacute;not
the gradual step-by-step change predicted by neo-Darwinian theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet students don't learn about these findings. Some science
educators justify the omission on the grounds that it would confuse students.
But scientific literacy requires that students know all significant facts
whether or not they happen to support cherished theories. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or consider another example. Many biology texts tell
about the famous finches in the Galapagos Islands whose beaks have varied
in shape and length over time. They also recall how moth populations in
England darkened and then lightened in response to varying levels of industrial
pollution. Such episodes are presented as conclusive evidence for evolution.
And indeed they are, depending on how one defines evolution. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet few biology textbooks distinguish the different meanings
associated with &quot;evolution&quot;&oacute; a term that can refer to anything
from trivial change to the creation of life by strictly mindless, material
forces. Nor do they explain that the processes responsible for cyclical
variations in beak length or wing color do not explain where birds, moths
and biologists came from in the first place. As a host of distinguished
biologists (e.g. Kauffman, Raff, Miklos) have explained in recent technical
papers, small-scale &quot;micro-evolutionary&quot; change cannot be extrapolated
to explain large scale &quot;macro-evolutionary&quot; innovation. Micro-evolutionary
changes (such as variation in color or shape) merely utilize or express
existing genetic information; the large-scale macro-evolutionary change
necessary to assemble new organs or body plans requires the creation of
entirely new genetic information. Leading evolutionary biologists know this
distinction poses serious difficulties for neo-Darwinism. Students should
too.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, students should not only know the strengths and
weaknesses of neo-Darwinian theory, they should know about alternative theories,
both materialistic and otherwise. Most importantly, they should know that
many scientists do not accept the Darwinian idea that life arose as the
result of strictly mindless processes&oacute;that many scientists see powerful
evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the case of Dean Kenyon. For nearly twenty years
Professor Kenyon was a leading evolutionary theorist who specialized in
origin-of-life biology. While at Berkeley in 1969 he wrote a book that defined
evolutionary thinking on the origin-of-life for over a decade. Yet during
the late 1970s Kenyon found himself doubting his own theory. As molecular
biologists learned more about the complexity of living things, Kenyon began
to wonder whether undirected chemistry could really produce the intricate
information processing systems found in even &quot;simple&quot; cells. Studies
of the genetic molecule DNA showed that the instructions encoded along its
spine displayed all the hallmarks of intelligent communication or language.
Kenyon and many other scientists have now concluded that the information
in DNA&oacute;like the information in a computer program, an ancient scroll
or in this newspaper&oacute;had an intelligent source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Another advocate of intelligent design, Lehigh University
biochemist Michael Behe, has just written a book entitled <I>Darwin's Black
Box</I> (The Free Press 1996). Behe explains that during Darwin's time the
biochemistry of life was as mysterious to scientists as the wires and chips
inside a computer are to small children. As long as scientists didn't know
how the biochemical machinery worked, they could reasonably believe that
life had gradually self-assembled. Now that we know the inner workings of
living systems, however, we can no longer entertain such superstitions.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In one section, Behe examines the intricate workings
of an acid powered rotary engine. What does this have to do with biology?
Well, curiously this engine does not power a lawnmower or an automobile,
but the propellor-like tails of certain bacteria. Professor Behe shows that
the intricate machinery in this molecular motor requires the coordinated
interaction of some two hundred complex protein parts. Yet the absence of
almost any one of these proteins would result in the complete loss of motor
function. To believe this engine emerged gradually in a Darwinian fashion
strains credulity. Natural selection only selects functionally advantageous
systems. Yet motor function only ensues <I>after</I> the necessary parts
have independently self-assembled&oacute;an astronomically improbable event.
Behe concludes that a designing intelligence must have played a role. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Many parents in Sultan had hoped that their students
could learn about such scientific developments. The controversy began when
two ex-teachers Brent and Cindy Rappun asked the school board to consider
placing copies of Professor Kenyon's supplementary biology text, <I>Pandas
and People, </I>in the school library. <I>Pandas</I> has been endorsed by
Professor Behe and many other scientists including professors from Princeton
and Oxford.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nevertheless, many asserted that the book's defense of
intelligent design did not qualify as science, since the intelligent designer
postulated by scientists cannot be observed or tested. Yet scientists often
infer unobservable entities&oacute;quarks, forces, fields, the big bang&oacute;to
explain observable evidence. Darwinists themselves postulate unobservable
&quot;transitional&quot; organisms and allegedly creative processes that
occur too slowly to be observed. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Further, origins theories, whether Darwinian or otherwise,
are not tested by making predictions and observing the results in controlled
laboratory settings as some seem to assume. Rather, they are tested by comparing
the explanatory power of one theory against another. Historical scientists
evaluate theories rather like detectives who must determine which crime
scenario best explains the available evidence. Contemporary design theorists
favor their theory precisely because they believe it has greater explanatory
power than strict Darwinism. And there's nothing unscientific in that. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Of course, many claimed that allowing students to consider
evidence for intelligent design would constitute religious indoctrination.
Many tried to equate design with fundamentalist religion and the discredited
&quot;creation science&quot; movement. But design theory is not &quot;creation-science.&quot;
It does not reject modern geology. Nor is it derived from religious authority
or biblical teaching. Instead, intelligent design is an inference derived
from biological evidence. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even so, all origins theories have some unavoidable philosophical
(and even religious) implications. The present crop of biology texts make
no attempt to hide the anti-theistic implications of contemporary Darwinism.
Douglas Futuyma's book tells students that Darwinism makes &quot;theological
explanations&quot; of life &quot;superfluous.&quot; Kenneth Miller's book
insists that &quot;evolution works without either plan or purpose.&quot;
By denying any evidence of intelligent design in nature, Darwinist texts
promote the anti-theistic philosophy known as materialism. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The threat of indoctrination does not come from allowing
students to ponder the philosophical questions raised by the origins issue.
Instead, it comes from force-feeding students a single ideological perspective.
The rather modest effort in Sultan to prevent this, is hardly cause for
hysteria.</FONT> <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Can scientists change their minds about controversial
ideas? Can they reject theories if evidence requires? That may depend upon
what theories are at stake. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider a disturbing case in California involving a
distinguished biology professor, Dean Kenyon. A year ago, Kenyon was removed
from his biology classroom at San Francisco State University after a few
students complained to administrators about ideas they heard in lecture.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The problem? Kenyon's approach to teaching evolutionary
theory. Professor Kenyon it seems has grown increasingly skeptical about
the textbook theory of how life first originated on earth&oacute;a theory,
as it turns out, he had earlier done much to advance. SFSU's administrators
have insisted that Kenyon not discuss the reasons for his new views with
introductory biology students. Ironically, they justified their actions
in the name of &quot;science.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Controversy in San Francisco</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The controversy emerged in the fall of 1992 after Kenyon
was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot; by John Hafernik, the chairman
of the biology department. Kenyon, who included three lectures on biological
origins (out of 27 total) in his introductory course, presented both standard
evolutionary interpretations of biological evidence and difficulties with
those interpretations. He also discussed philosophical controversies raised
by the issue and his own view that living systems display evidence of &quot;intelligent
design&quot;&oacute;a view not incompatible with some evolutionary thinking.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Hafernik accused Kenyon of teaching biblical creationism
and ordered him to stop. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote the Dean,
James Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; Was he not permitted to mention &quot;the important philosophical
issues at stake in discussions of origins?&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kelley insisted that Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation on
a young earth.&quot; Kenyon replied again. (I paraphrase): I do teach the
dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and that
some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching
introductory biology and reassigned to labs. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Recently, following pressure on the administration from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee, its Academic Senate and the American
Association of University Professors, Kenyon was reinstated. His administrators,
however, have continued to threaten to &quot;monitor&quot; his course and
content. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Academic Freedom: Disturbing Implications</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For several reasons, Kenyon's case raises troubling questions
about whether ordinary standards of academic freedom apply to science and
whether scientists must now pass ideological muster to maintain standing
in the church scientific. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">First, Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary
theory and the scientific study of the origin of life. After receiving a
Ph.D. in biophysics at Stanford, he later completed post-doctoral work at
Oxford, NASA and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1969, he co-authored
a seminal theoretical work titled<B> </B><I>Biochemical Predestination</I>.
The book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific
publications. As evidence rolled in during the late 1970s, however, he began
to question his own earlier ideas. When run under realistic conditions,
so-called &quot;simulation&quot; experiments repeatedly produced irrelevant
sludge or low yields of desired amino acids. Further, molecular biology
had revealed the presence of encoded messages along the spine of large biomolecules
such as DNA. Both experiments and developments in a field known as information
theory suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves into such
complex information-bearing molecules&oacute;without, that is, &quot;guidance&quot;
from human experimenters.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">To Kenyon and others, these results raised important
questions about how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was.
If undirected chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information
found in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence
have played a role? By the 1980s, Kenyon was sympathetic to the idea.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">That a man of Kenyon's stature should have to lobby for
the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of origins,
is absurdly comic. Dr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in the world
about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research scientists.
Yet he has been prevented from reporting the negative results of research
and from giving students his candid assessment of it.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Second, as Kenyon has repeatedly explained, his view
hardly qualifies as biblicism, let alone religious advocacy. When Kenyon
discussed &quot;intelligent design,&quot; he did so as an inference from
biological data, not a deduction from religious authority. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet even if Kenyon had been motivated by a prior belief
that &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1), it
is not clear that academic freedom means college students must be shielded
from such notions. Secular intellectuals now openly discuss the ideologies
and philosophies that motivate their scholarship and teaching, from Feminism
and Freudianism to Deconstruction and Marxism. Why must theistic professors
remain silent? </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Palatino">Ideological Neutrality?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The problem is Kenyon's
opponents assume science has a unique rational standing and ideological
neutrality. Subjective considerations from philosophy and religion do not
influence scientific theories; and scientific theories, in turn, can have
no philosophical or religious implications. Intelligent design, and its
potential implications, violates this alleged neutrality. Thus, despite
Kenyon's credentials and concern with data, Hafernik and Kelley decreed
that he had moved beyond science into &quot;religion.&quot; Therefore, he
needed to be muzzled&oacute;academic freedom notwithstanding.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This line of reasoning seems initially quite plausible,
since many areas of science have little ideological or philosophical import.
Upon closer inspection, however, it reveals a disturbing double standard
within an area of science notorious for its philosophical overtones. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">On any reasonable assessment of the origins controversy,
Kenyon's design theory and the dominant materialistic view are not two different
types of thinking, one religious and the other scientific. They are two
competing answers to the same question: 'What caused life to arise on earth?'
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This competition is tacitly
conceded in biology texts that routinely recapitulate Darwinian-style arguments
<I>against</I> intelligent design. Yet if arguments <I>against</I> intelligent
design are philosophically neutral and strictly scientific, why are Kenyon's
arguments <I>for</I> design inherently unscientific and religiously charged?
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In fact, neither approach to origins can claim philosophical
neutrality. Orthodox evolutionary theories, whether biological or chemical,
make the decidedly metaphysical claim that brute matter organized itself
into more and more complex living structures without assistance from purposeful
intelligence. Neo-Darwinism teaches, as the late Harvard biologist G.G.
Simpson put it, even &quot;man is the result of a <I>purposeless</I> and
natural process that did not have him in mind. He was not planned.&quot;
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolution conceived as a completely purposeless process&oacute;a
&quot;blind watchmaker&quot; as biologist Richard Dawkins calls it&oacute;eliminates
any role for creative intelligence in the origin of living things. It, therefore,
directly contradicts not only &quot;special creationism&quot;, but all theories
inconsistent with an aggressive philosophical materialism. This includes
&quot;God-guided evolution&quot; and even more generic notions such as &quot;intelligent
design.&quot; Whatever the merits of &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; evolution,
one can hardly assert its ideological neutrality. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Methodological Naturalism </FONT></I></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet Kenyon's opponents insist
that his approach to origins, unlike their own, does not qualify as science.
They argue that scientific theories must limit themselves to strictly materialistic
explanations. Science is by definition limited to observable realities.
Its explanations must, therefore, invoke only natural processes or events.
Scientists must obey what philosophers call the principle of &quot;methodological
naturalism.&quot; Explanations involving a designer are necessarily excluded.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This judgment may, again, seem reasonable for it comports
with popular conceptions of what most scientists, especially experimental
scientists, do. But &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; can not be justified
as a normative principle for all types of science&oacute;without doing violence
to science as a truth-seeking enterprise.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Prohibitions against inferring intelligent design are
particularly problematic in historical sciences such as archeology, forensics,
paleobiology, and origin-of-life studies. In historical sciences, researchers
want to answer different kinds of questions than in other sciences. For
example, scientists investigating the origin of life are motivated by the
question 'what happened to cause life to arise on earth?' This question
specifically asks about the cause of life's origin. Since, conceivably,
a designer could have played a role it is difficult to see why postulations
of intelligent agency must necessarily be excluded&oacute;especially if
biological evidence supports the idea. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It is true that scientists in many other scientific fields
do not generally make design inferences. They refrain, however, not out
of deference to rules dictating what they may theorize, but instead because
they are asking different types of questions: ones unconcerned with causal
origins. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the question 'how does atmospheric pressure
affect crystal growth?' The answer 'crystals were designed by a creative
intelligence' (or, for that matter, 'crystals evolved via natural processes')
entirely misses the point. The question demands an answer expressed as a
relationship between two physical entities: gases and crystals. A scientific
law expressing such a relationship can be described as wholly naturalistic.
Yet naturalism of this sort derives entirely from the particular focus of
scientific interest and the need to answer the question asked. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Answers to historical questions are, of course, also
subject to contextual constraints, but none that justify prohibitions against
considering design. Those who insist otherwise simply make an unwarranted
extrapolation. They mistakenly treat an accurate description of scientific
theorizing in one area as if it were a normative principle for all of science.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">True Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Defenders of methodological naturalism insist, however,
that prohibitions against design inferences are necessary to preserve the
rigor of scientific reasoning. For example, some of Kenyon's critics at
SFSU argue that his theory of intelligent design fails to qualify as scientific
because it refers to an unseen entity. The existence of an unobservable
designer, they say, can not be tested. Therefore, it can't be part of a
scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet many scientific theories postulate unobservable events
and entities. Physicists postulate forces, fields and quarks; biochemists
infer sub-microscopic structures; psychologists discuss their patients'
mental states. If unobservability precluded testability and scientific status,
many scientific theories would not qualify as science. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolutionary biologists themselves traffic in &quot;unobservables.&quot;
They invoke processes whose creative effects are often too slow to see and
infer the existence of extinct organisms for which no fossils remain. Like
Kenyon's designer, unobservable ancient forms are <I>inferred</I> because
their existence would explain evidence in the present. Darwinian theory
and design theory alike rely upon indirect inference and testing, not just
direct observation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">By inferring an unobservable entity, Kenyon violated
no canon of scientific method. In seeking the best explanation for evidence,
Kenyon employed the same method of reasoning as before he changed his views.
His conclusions, not his methods, changed.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Truth or Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The Kenyon case illustrates
another reason for challenging &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; in
the historical sciences: naturalism limits the ability of scientists to
seek the truth. Philosophers of science now recognize that theory evaluation
is often inherently comparative. Especially in historical sciences where
theories can not be tested by predicting outcomes or repeating experiments,
scientists must test theories indirectly. They do this by comparing the
explanatory power of competing theories to seek the best explanation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If this process of testing is subverted by excluding
theoretical options arbitrarily the rationality of science is compromised.
Theories that succeed in gerrymandered competitions can claim to be neither
'the best explanation' nor 'most probably true'. Instead, they can only
be considered 'most probable' or 'best' among artificially limited options.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">As Kenyon's case illustrates, such a situation now exists
in historical biology. Currently, evolutionary theories are protected from
challenge by arbitrary rules excluding non-materialistic theories. Yet the
question that must be asked about origins is not: 'which materialistic theory
can best explain the origin of life?' but 'what actually happened to cause
life to arise on earth?' Insisting upon strictly materialistic explanations&oacute;whatever
the evidence&oacute;may force scientists to reject a true theory for the
sake of an arbitrary convention. Science so encumbered is unworthy of the
name.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Evidence for Design</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Considerable evidence now contradicts the dominant evolutionary
approach. The universally-recognized failure of chemical evolution to explain
life's initial origin, is now matched by neo-Darwinism's failure to account
for subsequent biological form. Fossil studies now reveal a &quot;biological
big bang&quot; in which one hundred disconnected phyla (major groups of
organisms) emerged suddenly without clear precursors 530 million years ago.
Fossil finds repeatedly confirm a pattern of sudden appearance and prolonged
stability (not gradual change) in living forms. Biochemical evidence reinforces
the impression of organisms as systems whose parts&oacute;as with machines&oacute;can
not be altered gradually or dramatically without destroying the functioning
whole. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For naturalistic theories a growing awareness of biological
complexity has posed enormous, and perhaps insuperable, challenges. Organisms
display any number of distinctive features of intelligently engineered high-tech
systems: information storage and transfer capability, regulatory and feed-back
mechanisms, hierarchical logic and organization, and precisely sequenced
strings of code.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Confronted with evidence suggesting a new approach, the
full-time Darwinist lobby falls back on subjective complaints about the
&quot;imperfect&quot; design of human eyes and Panda's thumbs. They also
invoke their own self-serving rule&oacute;theories must be materialistic&oacute;to
disqualify challengers as &quot;crackpots.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet personal attacks and arbitrary rules can not suppress
alternative theories forever. With recent developments in probability and
complexity theory, the detection of intelligent design has already entered
science proper. NASA's $100 million search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) has been based upon the ability to detect the statistical and mathematical
signature of intelligently encoded messages. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Less exotic (and more successful) design detection occurs
routinely in both science and industry. Archeology and insurance fraud investigation,
forensic science and cryptography would all be impossible if prohibitions
against design inferences were applied universally. Imagine an archaeologist
forced to treat the Rosetta Stone as a natural erosional effect or a homicide
detective required to conclude that all victims died of natural causes.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Professor Kenyon believes similar absurdities now rule
origins biology. To Kenyon and others, the presence of biochemical messages
and a corresponding molecular grammar in the cell strongly suggests a prior
intelligent design. He may be wrong or right. His argument is based, however,
neither on ignorance nor religious authority, but on a biological expertise
informed by the modern informational sciences. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It has no doubt served the purposes of philosophical
materialists to portray Kenyon as a religious fundamentalist unwilling revise
dogma in the face of new evidence. In fact, it is their fundamentalism,
not his, that is on trial.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Alfred North Whitehead once said that &quot;when
we consider what religion is for mankind and what science is, it is no exaggeration
to say that the future course of history depends upon the decision of this
generation as to the relations between them.&quot; Whitehead spoke early
in this century at a time when most elite intellectuals believed that science
contradicted classical theism with its traditional belief in a divine creation,
the uniqueness of man and the immortality of the human soul. For many intellectuals
a scientifically-informed world view was a materialistic world view in which
the mere mention of entities such as God, free will, mind, soul or purpose
seemed inherently disreputable. Materialism denied evidence of any intelligent
design in nature and any ultimate purpose to human existence. As Whitehead's
contemporary Bertrand Russell put it, &quot;man is the product of causes
which had no prevision of the end they were achieving&quot; and which predestine
him &quot;to extinction in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">It is not hard to see why many intellectuals held
this opinion. Despite the now-well documented influence of Christian thinking
on the rise of modern science from the time of Ockham to Newton, much of
science during the 19th century did take a decidedly materialistic turn.
Scientific origins theories in particular seemed to support the materialistic
vision of an autonomous and self-creating natural world. For example, at
the beginning of the 19th century the French mathematician Laplace offered
an ingenious theory known as the nebular hypothesis to account for the origin
of the solar system as the outcome of purely natural gravitational forces.
In geology, Charles Lyell explained the origin of the earth's most dramatic
topographical features&oacute;mountain ranges and canyons&oacute;as the
result of slow, gradual and completely naturalistic processes of change.
Most significantly, Darwin's evolutionary theory sought to show that the
blind process of natural selection acting on random variations could, and
did, account for the origin of new forms of life without any divine intervention
or guidance. According to Darwin, living organisms only <I>appeared</I>
to be designed by an intelligent creator; nature itself was the real creator.
Even in cosmology, a belief in the infinity of space and time obviated any
need to consider the question of the ultimate origin of matter. Thus, for
scientific materialists at the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
history of the universe and life could be told as a seamless&#130; or nearly
seamless, unfolding of the potentiality of matter and energy. No longer
could it be held that a pre-existent mind shaped matter. Rather, modern
science showed that matter shaped and created the capacities of mind (and
not the reverse). God did not create &quot;the heavens and the earth.&quot;
The heavens and the earth (i.e., matter) created (via evolution) the minds
that created the concept of God. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">By the turn of the twentieth century, this once
shockingly materialistic approach to science had become the norm. Most twentieth
century scientists have assumed no limits to the explanatory power of materialistic
forces. Materialistic modes of thought and assumptions have spread from
physics and biology to psychology, sociology, criminology, economics, educational
theory, and even theology. Thus, Whitehead would in the end attempt to reconcile
science and religion by asserting that even God himself evolves. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet now at the end of the twentieth century after
many wars and genocidal policies pursued in the name of materialistic &quot;science-based&quot;
ideologies, the scientific picture of the world is rapidly changing. From
the microcosm of the cell and the quantum world, to the macrocosm of an
expanding and finely-tuned universe, the materialistic vision of nature
now seems incomplete. Even in biology where Darwin's theory, perhaps more
than any other, inspired the possibility of a fully materialistic world
view, materialism now seems to be failing as scientists have uncovered an
awe-inspiring complexity in even the simplest of living cells. Indeed, nowhere
is the inadequacy of materialistic science more evident than in the contemporary
discussion of how life in its very &quot;simplest&quot; form might have
first originated. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Problem of Life's Origin</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">After Darwin published the <I>Origin of Species</I> in
1859, many scientists began to think about a problem that Darwin had not
addressed, namely, how life had arisen in the first place. While Darwin's
theory purported to explain how life could have grown gradually more complex
starting from &quot;one or a few simple forms,&quot; it did not explain,
nor did it attempt to explain, where life had first originated. Indeed,
by the 1870s with Darwin's theory of the origin of species, Laplace's nebular
hypothesis, and Lyellian geology enjoying widespread support, the origin
of life remained as the only salient milestone in cosmic history lacking
some materialistic explanation. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet, scientists in the 1870s and 1880s assumed
that devising an explanation for the origin of life would be fairly easy.
For one thing, they assumed that life was essentially a rather simple substance
called protoplasm that could be easily constructed by combining and recombining
simple chemicals such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. Thus, the
German evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel would refer to the cell as a
simple &quot;homogeneous globule of plasm.&quot; To Haeckel a living cell
seemed no more complex than a blob of jello. His theory of how life first
came into existence reflected this simplistic view. His method likened cell
&quot;autogony,&quot; as he called it, to the process of inorganic crystallization.
Haeckel's English counterpart, T.H. Huxley, proposed a simple two-step method
of chemical recombination to explain the origin of the first cell. Just
as salt could be produced spontaneously by adding sodium to chloride, so,
thought Haeckel and Huxley, could a living cell be produced by adding several
chemical constituents together and then allowing spontaneous chemical reactions
to produce the simple protoplasmic substance that they assumed to be the
essence of life. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Orthodox Chemical Evolutionary Theory: The
Oparin Scenario</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">During the 1920s and 1930s a more sophisticated version
of this so-called &quot;chemical evolutionary theory&quot; was proposed
by a Russian biochemist named Alexander I. Oparin. Oparin had a much more
accurate understanding of the complexity of cellular metabolism, but neither
he, nor any one else in the 1930s, fully appreciated the complexity of the
molecules such as protein and DNA that make life possible. Oparin, like
his nineteenth century predecessors, suggested that life could have first
evolved as the result of a series of chemical reactions. Unlike his predecessors,
however, he envisioned that this process of chemical evolution would involve
many more chemical transformations and reactions and many hundreds of millions
(or even billions) of years. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's theory envisioned a series of chemical
reactions (See Figure 1) that he thought would enable a complex cell to
assemble itself gradually and naturalistically from simple chemical precursors.
Oparin believed that simple gases such as ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4),
water (H20), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) would have rained down
to the early oceans and combined with metallic compounds extruded from the
core of the earth. With the aid of ultraviolet radiation from the sun, the
ensuing reactions would have produced energy-rich hydrocarbon compounds.
These in turn would have combined and recombined with various other compounds
to make amino acids, sugars, phosphates and other &quot;building blocks&quot;
of the complex molecules (such as proteins) necessary to living cells. These
constituents would eventually arrange themselves into simple cell-like enclosures
that Oparin called coacervates. Oparin then proposed a kind of Darwinian
competition for survival among his coacervates. Those that developed increasingly
complex molecules and metabolic processes would have survived and grown
more complicated. Those that did not would have dissolved. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Thus, cells would have become gradually more and
more complex as they competed for survival over billions of years. Like
Darwin, Oparin employed time, chance and natural selection to account for
the origin of complexity from initial simplicity. Moreover, nowhere in his
scenario did &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;intelligent design&quot; or &quot;a
Creator&quot; play any explanatory role. Indeed, for Oparin&oacute;a committed
Marxist&oacute;such notions were explicitly precluded from scientific consideration.
Matter interacting chemically with other matter, if given enough time and
the right conditions, could produce life. Complex cells could be built from
simple chemical precursors without any guiding personal or intelligent agency.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Miller-Urey Experiment <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The first experimental support for Oparin's
hypothesis came in December of 1952. While doing graduate work under Harold
Urey at the University of Chicago, Stanley Miller conducted the first experimental
test of the Oparin chemical evolutionary model. Miller circulated a gaseous
mixture of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water vapor (H20) and hydrogen
(H2) through a glass vessel containing an electrical discharge chamber.
Miller sent a high voltage charge of electricity into the chamber via tungsten
filaments in an attempt to simulate the effects of ultraviolet light on
prebiotic atmospheric gases. After two days, Miller found a small (2 percent)
yield of amino acids in the U-shaped water trap he used to collect reaction
products at the bottom of the vessel. While Miller's initial experiment
yielded only three of the twenty amino acids that occur naturally in proteins,
subsequent experiments performed under similar conditions have produced
all but one of the others. Other simulation experiments have produced fatty
acids and the nucleotide bases found in DNA and RNA, but not the sugar molecules
deoxyribose and ribose necessary to build DNA and RNA molecules. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Miller's success in producing biologically relevant
&quot;building blocks&quot; under ostensibly prebiotic conditions was heralded
as a great breakthrough. His experiment seemed to provide experimental support
for Oparin's chemical evolutionary theory by showing that an important step
in Oparin's scenario&oacute;the production of biological building blocks
from simpler atmospheric gases&oacute;was possible on the early earth. Miller's
work inspired many similar simulation experiments and an unprecedented optimism
about the possibility of developing an adequate naturalistic explanation
for the origin of life. Miller's experimental results also received widespread
press coverage in popular publications such as <I>Time</I> magazine and
gave Oparin's model the status of textbook orthodoxy almost overnight. As
one writer put it:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;James Watson and Francis Crick unraveled
the chemical basis of life . . . Stanley Miller discovered how matter and
energy could create the building blocks of life without a preexisting cell.
Unleashed from paralysis and spurred by the Space Age, research on the origin
of life was launched by these . . .momentous achievements into an era of
discovery and achievement.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, thanks largely to Miller's experimental
work, chemical evolution is now routinely presented in both high school
and college biology textbooks as the accepted scientific explanation for
the origin of life. Yet as we shall see, chemical evolutionary theory is
now known to be riddled with difficulties; and Miller's work is understood
by the origin-of-life research community itself to have little, if any,
relevance to explaining how amino acids&oacute;let alone proteins or livings
cells&oacute;actually could have arisen on the early earth.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Problems with the Oparin/Miller Hypothesis</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Despite its status as textbook orthodoxy, the Oparin
chemical evolutionary theory has in recent years encountered severe, even
fatal, criticisms on many fronts. First, geochemists have failed to find
evidence of the nitrogen-rich &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; required by Oparin's
model. Second, the remains of single-celled organisms in the very oldest
rocks testify that, however life emerged, it did so relatively quickly&oacute;i.e.
fossil evidence suggests that chemical evolution had little time to work
before life emerged on the early earth. Third, new geological and geochemical
evidence suggests that prebiotic atmospheric conditions were hostile, not
friendly, to the production of amino acids and other essential building
blocks of life. Fourth, the revolution in the field of molecular biology
has revealed so great a complexity and specificity of design in even the
&quot;simplest&quot; cells and cellular components as to defy materialistic
explanation. Even scientists known for a staunch commitment to materialistic
philosophy now concede that materialistic science in no way suffices to
explain the origin of life. As Francis Crick has written: &quot;An honest
man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state
that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost
a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been
satisfied to get it going.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To understand the crisis in chemical evolutionary
theory, it will be necessary to explain in more detail the latter two difficulties,
namely, the problem of hostile pre-biotic conditions and the problem posed
by the complexity of the cell and its components.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">When Stanley Miller conducted his experiment simulating
the production of amino acids on the early earth, he presupposed that the
earth's atmosphere was composed of a mixture of what chemists call reducing
gases such as methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen (H2). He also assumed
that the earth's atmosphere contained virtually no free oxygen. Miller derived
his assumptions about these conditions from Oparin's 1936 book. In the years
following Miller's experiment, however, new geochemical evidence made it
clear that the assumptions that Oparin and Miller had made about the early
atmosphere could not be justified. Instead, evidence strongly suggested
that neutral gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor&oacute;not
methane, ammonia and hydrogen&oacute;predominated in the early atmosphere.
Moreover, a number of geochemical studies showed that significant amounts
of free oxygen were also present even before the advent of plant life, probably
as the result of volcanic outgassing and the photodissociation of water
vapor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This new information about the probable composition
of the early atmosphere has forced a serious re-evaluation of the significance
and relevance of Miller-type simulation experiments. As had been well know
even before Miller's experiment, amino acids will form readily in an appropriate
mixture of reducing gases. In a chemically neutral atmosphere, however,
reactions among atmospheric gases will not take place readily and those
reactions that do take place will produce extremely low yields of biological
building blocks. Further, even a small amount of atmospheric oxygen will
quench the production of biologically significant building blocks and cause
any biomolecules otherwise present to degrade rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">An analogy may help to illustrate. Making amino
acids in a reducing atmosphere is like getting vinegar and baking soda to
react. Because the reaction releases stored chemical energy as heat (i.e.
it is &quot;exothermic&quot;), it occurs easily. Trying to make biological
building blocks in a neutral atmosphere, however, is more like trying to
get oil and water (or any two inert chemicals) to react. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Stanley Miller's experiment, and others like his,
are only relevant to the origin of life if the reducing conditions he assumed
actually existed on the early earth. Since independent geochemical evidence
now strongly suggests that chemically hostile conditions prevailed, Miller's
experiment cannot be said to &quot;simulate&quot; anything. Miller's work
was heralded as a positive test of Oparin's chemical evolutionary scenario
precisely because he had selected parameters for his experiment in accord
with a then-current understanding of early atmospheric conditions. What
made Miller's experiment significant was not the production of amino acids
<I>per se</I>, but the production of amino acids from presumably plausible
prebiotic conditions. As Miller himself stated, &quot;In this apparatus
an attempt was made to duplicate a primitive atmosphere of the earth, and
not to obtain the optimum conditions for the formation of amino acids.&quot;
Now, however, the situation has changed. The only reason to continue assuming
the existence of a chemically reducing prebiotic atmosphere is that chemical
evolutionary theory seems to require it. As <I>Science</I> magazine's Richard
Kerr put it, &quot;No geological or geochemical evidence collected in the
last 30 years favors a strongly reducing primitive atmosphere. . .Only the
success of the laboratory experiments recommends it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While laboratory simulation experiments have failed
to demonstrate the plausibility of chemical evolution, they may have inadvertently
demonstrated the necessity of intelligent agency playing an active role
in the design of living systems. Ironically, even successful simulation
experiments require the intervention of the experimenters to prevent what
are known as &quot;interfering cross reactions&quot; and other chemically
destructive processes. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Assume for the moment that the reducing gases
used by Stanley Miller do actually simulate the conditions on the early
earth. Would his experimental results, then, support chemical evolution?
Not necessarily. Miller-type simulation experiments have invariably produced
non-biological substances in addition to biological building blocks such
as amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Without human intervention, these
other substances will react readily with biologically relevant building
blocks to form a biologically irrelevant compound&oacute;a chemically insoluble
sludge. To prevent this from happening and to move the simulation of chemical
evolution along a biologically promising trajectory, experimenters have
often removed those chemicals that degrade or transform amino acids into
non-biologically relevant compounds. They must also artificially manipulate
the initial conditions in their experiments. Rather than using both short
and long-wavelength ultraviolet light which would be present in any realistic
atmosphere, they use only short-wavelength UV. Why? The presence of the
long-wavelength UV light quickly degrades amino acids. Thus, investigators
have routinely manipulated chemical conditions both before and after performing
&quot;simulation&quot; experiments in order to protect their experiments
from destructive naturally occurring processes. These manipulations constitute
what chemist Michael Polanyi called a &quot;profoundly informative intervention.</FONT>&quot;<BR>

Biological Revolution and the Origin of Information /FONT&gt;</I></B> <FONT FACE="Times">Yet
a more fundamental problem remains for all chemical evolutionary scenarios.
Even if it could be demonstrated that the building blocks of essential molecules
could arise in realistic prebiotic conditions, the problem of assembling
those building blocks into functioning proteins or DNA chains would remain.
This problem of explaining the specific sequencing and thus, the information,
within biopolymers, lies at the heart of the current crisis in materialistic
evolutionary thinking.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In the early 1950s, the molecular biologist Fred
Sanger determined the structure of the protein molecule insulin. Sanger's
work made clear for the first time that each protein found in the cell comprises
a long and definitely arranged sequence of amino acids. The amino acids
in protein molecules are linked together to form a chain, rather like individual
railroad cars comprising a long train. Moreover, the function of all such
proteins (whether as enzymes or as structural components in the cell) depends
upon the specific sequencing of the individual amino acids, just as the
meaning of an English text depends upon the sequential arrangement of the
letters. The various chemical interactions between amino acids in any given
chain will determine the three-dimensional shape or topography that the
amino acid chain adopts. This shape in turn determines what function, if
any, the amino acid chain can perform within the cell. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For
a functioning protein, its three-dimensional shape gives it a &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
fit with other molecules in the cell, enabling it to catalyze specific chemical
reactions or to build specific structures within the cell. The proteins
histone 3 and 4, for example, fold into very well-defined three-dimensional
shapes with a precise distribution of positive charges around their exteriors.
This shape and charge distribution enables them to form part of the spool-like
&quot;nucleosomes&quot; that allow DNA to coil efficiently around itself
and to store information. Indeed, the information storage density of DNA,
thanks in part to nucleosome spooling, is several trillion times that of
our most advance computer chips. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To get a feel for the specificity of the three
dimensional charge distribution on these histone proteins, imagine a large
wooden spool with grooves on the surface. Next picture a helical cord made
of two strands. Then visualize wrapping the cord around the spool so that
it lies exactly into perfectly hollowed out grooves. Finally, imagine the
grooves to be hollowed so that they exactly fit the shape of the coiled
cord&oacute;thicker parts nestling into deeper grooves, thinner parts into
more shallow ones. In other words, the irregularities in the shape of the
cord exactly match irregularities in the hollow grooves. In the case of
histone and DNA, there aren't actually grooves, but there is an uncanny
distribution of positively charged regions on the surface of the histone
proteins that exactly matches the negatively charged regions of the double
stranded DNA that coils around it. Proteins that function as enzymes or
that assist in the processing of information stored on DNA strands often
have an even greater specificity of fit with the molecules to which they
must bind. Almost all proteins function as a result of an extreme &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
three-dimensional specificity that derives from the precise sequencing of
the amino acid building blocks.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The discovery of the complexity and specificity of protein
molecules has raised serious difficulties for chemical evolutionary theory,
even if an abundant supply of amino acids is granted for the sake of argument.
Amino acids alone do not make proteins, any more than letters alone make
words, sentences or poetry. In both cases, the sequencing of the constituent
parts determines the function (or lack of function) of the whole. In the
case of human languages the sequencing of letters and words is obviously
performed by intelligent human agents. In the cell, the sequencing of amino
acids is directed by the information&oacute;the set of biochemical instructions&oacute;encoded
on the DNA molecule. </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Information Transfer:
From DNA to Protein</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During
the 1950s and 60s, at roughly the same time molecular biologists began to
determine the structure and function of many proteins, scientists were able
to explicate the structure and function of DNA, the molecule of heredity.
After James Watson and Francis Crick elucidated the structure of DNA in
1953, molecular biologists soon discovered how DNA directs the process of
protein synthesis within the cell. They discovered that the specificity
of amino acids in proteins derives from a prior specificity within the DNA
molecule&oacute;from information on the DNA molecule stored as millions
of specifically arranged chemicals called nucleotides or bases along the
spine of DNA's helical strands. (See Figure 2) Chemists represent the four
nucleotides with the letters A, T, G, and C (for adenine, thymine, guanine
and cytosine). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As in the case of protein, the
sequence specificity of the DNA molecule strongly resembles the sequence
specificity of human codes or languages. Indeed, just as the letters in
the alphabet of a written language may convey a particular message depending
on their sequence, so too do the sequences of nucleotides or bases in the
DNA molecule convey precise biochemical messages that direct protein synthesis
within the cell. Whereas the function of the protein molecule derives from
the specific arrangement of twenty different amino acids (a twenty-letter
alphabet), the function of DNA depends upon the arrangement of just four
bases. Thus, it takes a group of three nucleotides (or triplets as they
are called) on the DNA molecule to specify the construction of one amino
acid. This process proceeds as long chains of nucleotide triplets (the genetic
message) are first copied during a process known as DNA replication and
then transported (by the molecular messenger m-RNA) to a complex organelle
called a ribosome. There at the ribosome site, the genetic message is translated
with the aid of an ingenious adaptor molecule called transfer-RNA to produce
a growing amino acid chain. (See Figure 3) Thus, the sequence specificity
in DNA begets sequence specificity in proteins. Or put differently, the
sequence specifity of proteins depends upon a prior specificity&oacute;upon
information&oacute;encoded in DNA.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">The explication of this system by molecular biologists
in the 1950s and 1960s, has raised the question of the ultimate origin of
the specificity&oacute;the information&oacute;in both DNA and the proteins
it generates. Many scientists now refer to the information problem as the
&quot;Holy Grail&quot; of origin-of-life biology. As Bernd-Olaf Kuppers
recently stated, &quot;the problem of the origin of life is clearly basically
equivalent to the problem of the origin of biological information.&quot;
As mentioned previously, the information contained or expressed in natural
languages and computer codes is the product of intelligent minds. Minds
routinely create informative arrangements of matter. Yet since the mid-nineteenth
century scientists have sought to explain all phenomena by reference to
exclusively material causes. Since the 1950s, three broad types of naturalistic
explanation have been proposed by scientists to explain the origin of information.</FONT>

<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Biological Information: Beyond the Reach of Chance</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">After the revolutionary developments within molecular
biology in the 1950s and early 1960s made clear that Oparin had underestimated
the complexity of life, he revised his initial theory. He sought to account
for the sequence specificity of the large protein, DNA and RNA molecules
(known collectively as biomacromolecules or biopolymers). In each case,
the broad outlines of his theory remained the same, but he invoked the notion
of natural selection acting on random variations <I>within the sequences
of the biopolymers</I> to account for the emergence of their specificity
within these molecules. Others invoked the idea of a chance formation for
these large information-bearing molecules by speaking of them as &quot;frozen
accidents.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While many outside origin-of-life
biology may still invoke &quot;chance&quot; as a causal explanation for
the origin of biological information, few serious researchers still do.
Since molecular biologists began to appreciate the sequence specificity
of proteins and nucleic acids in the 1950s and 1960s, many calculations
have been made to determine the probability of formulating functional proteins
and nucleic acids at random. Various methods of calculating probabilities
have been offered by Morowitz, Hoyle, Cairns-Smith, Prigogine, Yockey and
more recently, Robert Sauer. For the sake of argument, these calculations
have generally assumed extremely favorable prebiotic conditions (whether
realistic or not) and theoretically maximal reaction rates among the constituent
monomers (i.e. the constituent parts of the proteins, DNA and RNA). Such
calculations have invariably shown that the probability of obtaining functionally
sequenced biomacromolecules at random is, in Prigogine's words, &quot;vanishingly
small . . .even on the scale of . . .billions of years.&quot; As Cairns-Smith
wrote in 1971:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Blind chance...is very limited.
Low-levels of cooperation he [blind chance] can produce exceedingly easily
(the equivalent of letters and small words), but he becomes very quickly
incompetent as the amount of organization increases. Very soon indeed long
waiting periods and massive material resources become irrelevant.&quot;</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the probabilistic hurdles that must be overcome
to construct even one short protein molecule of about one hundred amino
acids in length. (A typical protein consists of about 300 amino acids, and
some are very much longer). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">First, all amino acids
must form a chemical bond known as a peptide bond so as to join with other
amino acids in the protein chain. Yet in nature many other types of chemical
bonds are possible between amino acids; in fact, peptide and non-peptide
bonds occur with roughly equal probability. Thus, at any given site along
a growing amino acid chain the probability of having a peptide bond is roughly
1/2. The probability of attaining four peptide bonds is: (1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2
x 1/2)=1/16 or (1/2)4. The probability of building a chain of 100 amino
acids in which all linkages involve peptide linkages is (1/2)100 or roughly
1 chance in 1030. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Second, in nature every amino
acid has a distinct mirror image of itself, one left-handed version or L-form
and one right-handed version or D-form. These mirror-image forms are called
optical isomers. Functioning proteins tolerate only left-handed amino acids,
yet the right-handed and left-handed isomers occurs in nature with roughly
equal frequency. Taking this into consideration compounds the improbability
of attaining a biologically functioning protein. The probability of attaining
at random only L-amino acids in a hypothetical peptide chain 100 amino acids
long is again (1/2)100 or roughly 1 chance in 1030. The probability of building
a 100 amino acid length chain at random in which all bonds are peptide bonds
and all amino acids are L-form would be (1/4)100 or roughly 1 chance in
1060(zero for all practical purposes given the time available on the early
earth). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Functioning proteins have a third independent
requirement, the most important of all; their amino acids must link up in
a specific sequential arrangement just the letters in a meaningful sentence
must. In some cases, even changing one amino acid at a given site can result
in a loss of protein function. Moreover, because there are twenty biologically
occurring amino acids the probability of getting a specific amino acid at
a given site is small, i.e. 1/20. (Actually the probability is even lower
because there are many non-proteineous amino acids in nature). On the assumption
that all sites in a protein chain require one particular amino acid, the
probability the probability of attaining a particular protein 100 amino
acids long would be (1/20)100or roughly 1 chance in 10130. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">We
know now, however, that some sites along the chain do tolerate several of
the twenty proteineous amino acids, while others do not. The biochemist
Robert Sauer of M.I.T has used a technique known as &quot;cassette mutagenesis&quot;
to determine just how much variance among amino acids can be tolerated at
any given site in several proteins. His results have shown that, even taking
the possibility of variance into account, the probability of achieving a
functional sequence of amino acids in several functioning proteins at random
is still &quot;vanishingly small,&quot; roughly 1 chance in 1065 an astronomically
large number. (There are 1065 atoms in our galaxy). In light of these results,
biochemist Michael Behe has compared the odds of attaining proper sequencing
in a 100 amino acid length protein to the odds of a blindfolded man finding
a single marked grain of sand hidden in the Sahara Desert, not once, but
three times. Moreover, if one also factors in the probability of attaining
proper bonding and optical isomers, the probability of constructing a rather
short functional protein at random becomes so small as to be effectively
zero (1 chance in 10 even given our multi-billion year old universe. All
these calculations, thus simply reinforce the opinion that has prevailed
since the mid-1960s within origin of life biology: chance is not an adequate
explanation for the origin of biological specificity. What Mora said in
1963 still holds:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Statistical considerations,
probability, complexity, etc., followed to their logical implications suggest
that the origin and continuance of life is not controlled by such principles.
An admission of this is the use of a period of practically infinite time
to obtain the derived result. Using such logic, however, we can prove anything.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Pre-Biotic Natural Selection: A Contradiction
in Terms<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">At nearly the same time that many researchers
became disenchanted with &quot;chance&quot; explanations, theories of pre-biotic
natural selection also fell out of favor. Such theories allegedly overcome
the difficulties attendant pure chance theories by providing a mechanism
by which complexity-increasing events in the cell would be preserved and
selected. Yet these theories share many of the difficulties that afflict
purely chance-based theories. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's revised
theory, for example, claimed that a kind of natural selection acted upon
random polymers as they formed and changed within his coacervate protocells.
As more complex molecules accumulated, they presumably survived and reproduced
more prolifically. Nevertheless, to many, Oparin's discussion of differential
reproduction seemed to presuppose a pre-existing mechanism of self-replication.
Self-replication in all extant cells depends upon functional (and, therefore,
to a high degree sequence-specific) proteins and nucleic acids. Yet the
origin of these molecules is precisely what Oparin needed to explain. Thus,
many rejected the postulation of prebiotic natural selection as question
begging. Functioning nucleic acids and proteins (or molecules approaching
their complexity) seemed necessary to self-replication, which in turn seemed
necessary to natural selection. Yet Oparin invoked natural selection to
explain the origin of proteins and nucleic acids. As the evolutionary biologist
Dobzhansky would proclaim, &quot;prebiological natural selection is a contradiction
in terms.&quot; Or as Pattee put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;. .
. there is no evidence that hereditary evolution occurs except in cells
which already have the complete complement of hierarchical constraints,
the DNA, the replicating and translating enzymes, and all the control systems
and structures necessary to reproduce themselves.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
any case, as just discussed, functional sequences of amino acids&oacute;i.e.
proteins&oacute;cannot be counted on to arise via random events, even if
some means of selecting them exists after they have been produced. Natural
selection can only select what chance has first produced and chance, at
least in a prebiotic setting, seems an implausible agent for producing the
information present in even a single functioning protein or DNA molecule.
Oparin attempted to circumvent this problem by claiming that the first polymers
need not have been terribly specific. But this claim raises doubts about
whether self-replication (and thus, natural selection) could have proceeded
at all. The mathematician Von Neumann, for example, showed that any system
capable of self-replication would need to contain sub-systems that were
functionally equivalent to the information storage, replicating and processing
systems found in extant cells. His calculations and similar ones by Wigner,
Landsberg, and Morowitz, showed that random fluctuations of molecules in
all probability would not produce the minimal complexity needed for even
a primitive replication system. Indeed, the improbability of developing
a replication system vastly exceeds the improbability of developing the
protein or DNA components of such system. As P.T. Mora put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;To
invoke statistical concepts, probability and complexity to account for the
origin and the continuance of life is not felicitous or sufficient. As the
complexity of a molecular aggregate increases, and indeed very complex arrangements
and interrelationships of molecules are necessary for the simplest living
unit, the probability of its existence under the disruptive and random influence
of physico-chemical forces decreases; the probability that it will continue
to function in a certain way, for example, to absorb and to repair, will
be even lower; and <I>the probability that it will reproduce</I>, [is] still
lower. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For this reason most scientists now dismiss
appeals to pre-biotic natural selection as essentially indistinguishable
from appeals to chance. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><B><I>Self-Organizational
Scenarios</I></B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Because of these difficulties, many origin-of-life theorists
after the mid-1960s attempted to address the problem of the origin of biological
information in a completely new way. Rather than invoking pre-biotic natural
selection or &quot;frozen accidents,&quot; many theorists suggested that
the laws of nature and chemical attraction may themselves be responsible
for the information in DNA and proteins. Some have suggested that simple
chemicals might possess &quot;self-ordering properties&quot; capable of
organizing the constituent parts of proteins, DNA and RNA into the specific
arrangements they now possess. Steinman and Cole, for example, suggested
that differential bonding affinities or forces of chemical attraction between
certain amino acids might account for the origin of the sequence specificity
of proteins. Just as electrostatic forces draw sodium ion (Na+) and chloride
ions (Cl-) together into a highly-ordered patterns within a crystal of salt
(NaCl), so too might amino acids with special affinities for each other
arrange themselves to form proteins. This idea was developed in a book called
<I>Biochemical Predestination</I> by Kenyon and Steinman in 1969. They argued
that the origin of life might have been &quot;biochemically predestined&quot;
by the properties of attraction that exist between constituent chemical
parts, particularly between amino acids in proteins. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
1977, another self-organizational theory was proposed by Prigogine and Nicolis
based on a thermodynamic characterization of living organisms. In their
book <I>Self Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems</I>, Prigogine and Nicolis
classified living organisms as open, nonequilibrium systems capable of &quot;dissipating&quot;
large quantities of energy and matter into the environment. They observed
that open systems driven far from equilibrium often display self-ordering
tendencies. For example, gravitational energy will produce highly ordered
vortices in a draining bathtub; thermal energy flowing through a heat sink
will generate distinctive convection currents or &quot;spiral wave activity.&quot;
Prigogine and Nicolis then argued that the organized structures observed
in living systems might have similarly &quot;self-originated&quot; with
the aid of an energy source. In essence, they conceded the improbability
of simple building blocks arranging themselves into highly ordered structures
under normal equilibrium conditions. But they suggested that, under non-equilibrium
conditions, where an external source of energy is supplied, biochemical
building blocks might arrange themselves into highly ordered patterns.</FONT>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Order v. Information </FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">For
many current origin-of-life scientists self-organizational models now seem
to offer the most promising approach to explaining the origin of biological
information. Nevertheless, critics have called into question both the plausibility
and the relevance of self-organizational models. Ironically, perhaps the
most prominent early advocate of self-organization, Professor Dean Kenyon,
has now explicitly repudiated such theories as both incompatible with empirical
findings and theoretically incoherent.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">First,
empirical studies have shown that some differential affinities do exist
between various amino acids (i.e., particular amino acids do form linkages
more readily with some amino acids than others). Neverthless, these differences
do not correlate to actual sequencing in large classes of known proteins.
In short, differing chemical affinities do not explain the multiplicity
of amino acid sequences that exist in naturally occurring proteins or the
sequential ordering of any single protein. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
the case of DNA this point can be made more dramatically. Figure 4 shows
the structure of DNA depends upon several chemical bonds. There are bonds,
for example, between the sugar and the phosphate molecules that form the
two twisting backbones of the DNA molecule. There are bonds fixing individual
nucleotide bases to the sugar-phosphate backbones on each side of the molecule.
There are also hydrogen bonds stretching horizontally across the molecule
between nucleotide bases making so-called complementary pairs. These bonds,
which hold two complementary copies of the DNA message text together, make
replication of the genetic instructions possible. Most importantly, however,
notice that there are <I>no</I> chemical bonds between the nucleotide bases
that run along the spine of the helix. Yet it is precisely along this axis
of the molecule that the genetic instructions in DNA are encoded. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
other words, the chemical constituents that are responsible for the message
text in DNA do not interact chemically in any significant way. Just as the
letters in a Scrabble game can be combined and recombined in any way to
form various sequences, so too can each of the four nucleotide bases attach
to any site on the DNA backbone with equal facility, making all sequences
equally probable (or improbable). Thus, &quot;self-organizing&quot; bonding
affinities can not explain the sequential ordering of the nucleotide bases
along the spine of the DNA because <I>there are no chemical bonds</I> between
the nucleotides that make the message text. Because the same holds for RNA
molecules, researchers who speculate that life began in an &quot;RNA world,&quot;
have also failed to solve the sequencing problem&oacute;i.e., the problem
of explaining how information present in all functioning RNA molecules could
have arisen in the first place. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For those who
want to explain the origin of life as the result of self-organizing properties
intrinsic to the material constituents of living systems, these rather elementary
facts of molecular biology have devastating implications. The most logical
place to look for self-organizing properties to explain the origin of genetic
information is in the constituent parts of the molecules carrying that information.
But biochemistry and molecular biology make clear that forces of attraction
between the constituents in DNA, RNA and proteins do not explain the sequence
specificity of these large information-bearing biomolecules.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Significantly,
information theorists insist that there is a good reason for this. If chemical
affinities between the constituents in the DNA message text determined the
arrangement of the text, such affinities would dramatically diminish the
capacity of DNA to carry information. To illustrate, imagine receiving the
following incomplete message over the wire. The &quot;q-ick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog.&quot; Obviously someone who knew the conventions of English
could determine which letter had been rubbed out in the transmission? Because
&quot;q&quot; and &quot;u&quot; always go together by grammatical necessity,
the presence of one indicates the probable presence of the other in the
initial transmission of the message. The &quot;u&quot; in all English communications
is an example of what information theorists call &quot;redundancy.&quot;
Given the grammatical rule &quot;'&quot;u' must always follow 'q'&quot;,
the addition of the &quot;u&quot; adds no new information, when &quot;q&quot;
is already present. It is &quot;redundant&quot; or unnecessary to determining
the sense of the message (though not to making it grammatically correct).
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Now consider what would happen if the individual
nucleotide &quot;letters&quot; (A, T,G, C) in a DNA molecule <I>did</I>
interact by <I>chemical</I> necessity with each other. Every time adenine
(A) occurred in a growing genetic sequence, it would likely drag thymine
(T) along with it. Every time cytosine (C) found a slot, guanine would follow.
As a result, the DNA message text would be peppered with repeating sequences
of A's followed by T's and C's followed by G's. Rather than having a genetic
molecule capable of unlimited novelty with all the unpredictable and aperiodic
sequences that characterize informative texts, we would have a highly repetitive
text awash in redundant sequences&oacute;much as happens in crystals. Indeed,
in a crystal the forces of mutual chemical attraction do completely explain
the sequential ordering of the constituent parts and consequently crystals
cannot convey novel information. Sequencing in crystals is highly ordered
or repetitive, but not informative. Once one has seen &quot;Na&quot; followed
by &quot;Cl&quot; in a crystal of salt, for example, one has seen the extent
of the sequencing possible. In DNA, however, where any nucleotide can follow
any other, innumerable novel sequences are possible, and a countless variety
of amino acid sequences can be built. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The forces
of chemical necessity, like grammatical necessity in our &quot;q-and-u&quot;
example above, produce redundancy or monotonous order, but reduce the capacity
to convey information and create novelty. As chemist Michael Polanyi has
said:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Suppose that the actual structure
of a DNA molecule were due to the fact that the bindings of its bases were
much stronger than the bindings would be for any other distribution of bases,
then such a DNA molecule would have no information content. Its code-like
character would be effaced by an overwhelming redundancy. . . .Whatever
may be the origin of a DNA configuration, it can function as a code only
if its order is not due to the forces of potential energy. It <I>must be</I>
as physically indeterminate as the sequence of words is on a printed page.&quot;
(emphasis added)</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">So, if chemists had found that
bonding affinities between the nucleotides in DNA produced nucleotide sequencing,
they would have also found that they had been mistaken about DNA's information-bearing
properties. To put the point quantitatively, to the extent that forces of
attraction between constituents in a sequence determine the arrangement
of the sequence, to that extent, will the information carrying capacity
of the system be diminished. Bonding affinities, to the extent they exist,
mitigate against the maximization of information. They can not, therefore,
be used to explain the origin of information. Affinities create mantras,
not messages. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The tendency to conflate the qualitative
distinction between &quot;order&quot; and &quot;information&quot; has characterized
self-organizational research efforts and calls into question the relevance
of such work to the origin of life. As Yockey has argued, the accumulation
of structural or chemical order does not explain the origin of biological
complexity (i.e., genetic information). He concedes that energy flowing
through a system may produce highly ordered patterns. Strong winds form
swirling tornados and the &quot;eyes&quot; of hurricanes; Prigogine's thermal
baths do develop interesting &quot;convection currents&quot;; and chemical
elements do coalesce to form crystals. Self-organizational theorists explain
well what doesn't need explaining. What needs explaining is not the origin
of order (in the sense of symmetry or repetition), but the origin of information&oacute;the
highly improbable, aperiodic, and yet specified sequences that make biological
function possible. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To illustrate the distinction
between order and information compare the sequence &quot;ABABABABABABAB&quot;
to the sequence &quot;Help! Our neighbor's house is on fire!&quot; The first
sequence is repetitive and ordered, but not complex or informative. The
second sequence is not ordered, in the sense of being repetitious, but it
is complex and also informative. The second sequence is complex because
its characters do not follow a rigidly repeating or predictable pattern&oacute;i.e,
it is aperiodic. It is also informative because, unlike a <I>merely</I>
complex sequence such as &quot;rfsxdcnct&lt;e%dwqj&quot;, the particular
arrangement of characters is highly exact or &quot;specified&quot; so as
to perform a (communication) function. Systems that are characterized by
both specificity and complexity (what information theorists call &quot;specified
complexity&quot;) have &quot;information content.&quot; Since such systems
have the qualitative feature of complexity (aperiodicity), they are qualitatively
distinguishable from systems characterized by simple periodic order. Thus,
attempts to explain the origin of order have no relevance to discussions
of the origin of specified complexity or information content. Significantly,
the nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of DNA have, by all accounts,
a high information content&oacute;that is, they are both highly specified
and complex, just like meaningful English sentences. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conflating
order and information (or specified complexity) has led many to attribute
properties to brute matter that it does not possess. While energy in a system
<I>can</I> create patterns of symmetric order such as whirling vortices,
there is no evidence that energy alone can encode functionally specified
sequences&oacute;whether biochemical or otherwise.</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As Yockey warns: </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Attempts
to relate the idea of order . . . with biological organization or specificity
must be regarded as a play on words which cannot stand careful scrutiny.
Informational macromolecules can code genetic messages and therefore can
carry information because the sequence of bases or residues is affected
very little, if at all, by [self-organizing] physico-chemical factors.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Return of the Intelligent Design Hypothesis<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The preceding
discussion suggests that the properties of the material constituents of
DNA&oacute;like those of any information-bearing medium&oacute;are not responsible
for the information conveyed by the molecule. Indeed, in all informational
systems, the information content or message is neither deducible from the
properties of the material medium nor attributable to them. The properties
of matter do not explain the origin of the information. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To amplify this point consider, first, that many
different materials can express the same message. The headline of this morning's
<I>New York Times</I> was written with ink on paper. Nevertheless, many
other materials could have been used to convey the same message. The information
in the headline could have been written with chalk on a board, with neon-filled
tubes in a series of signs, or by a sky-writer over New York harbor. Clearly,
the peculiar chemical properties of ink are not necessary to convey the
message. Neither are the physical properties (i.e., the geometric shapes)
of the letters necessary to transmit the information. The same message could
have been expressed in Hebrew or Greek using entirely different alphabetic
characters. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conversely, the same material medium
(and alphabetic characters) can express many different messages&oacute;i.e.
the medium is not sufficient to determine the message. This November the
<I>Times</I> will use ink and English characters to tell the reading public
that either a Democrat, a Republican or a third-party candidate has won
the Presidential election. Yet the properties of the ink and the 26 letters
available to the type-setter will not determine which headline will be broadcast
by the <I>Times.</I> Instead, the ink and English characters will permit
the transmission of whatever headline the election requires, as well as
a vast ensemble of other possible arrangements of text, some meaningful,
and many more not. Neither the chemistry of the ink nor the shapes of the
letters determine the meaning of the text. In short, the message transcends
the properties of the medium. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The information in DNA also transcends the properties
of its material medium. Because chemical bonds do not determine the arrangement
of nucleotide bases, the nucleotides can assume a vast array of possible
sequences and thereby express many different messages. (Conversely, various
materials can express the same messages, as happens in variant versions
of the genetic code or when laboratory chemists use English instructions
to direct the synthesis of naturally occurring proteins). Thus, again, the
properties of the constituents do not determine the function&oacute;the
information transmitted&oacute;by the whole. As Michael Polanyi has said:
&quot;As the arrangement of a printed page is extraneous to the chemistry
of the printed page, so is the base sequence in a DNA molecule extraneous
to the chemical forces at work in the DNA molecule.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">If the properties of matter (i.e., the medium)
do not suffice to explain the origin of information, what does? Blind chance
is, of course, a possibility but <I>not</I>, as we have seen in the case
of DNA and proteins, where the amount of information (or the improbability
of arrangement) gets too immense. The random selection and sequencing of
Scrabble pieces out of a grab bag might occasionally produce a few meaningful
words such as &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;ran.&quot; Nevertheless, undirected
selection will inevitably fail as the numbers of letters required to make
a text increases. Fairly soon, chance becomes clearly inadequate as origin-of-life
biologists have almost universally acknowledged. /FONT&gt;<FONT FACE="Times">Some
have suggested that the discovery of some new scientific laws might explain
the origin of biological information. But this suggestion betrays confusion
on two counts. First, scientific laws don't generally explain or cause natural
phenomena, they describe them. For example, Newton's law of gravitation
described, but did not explain, the attraction between planetary bodies.
Second, scientific laws describe (almost by definition) highly regular phenomena&oacute;i.e.,
order. Thus, to say that any scientific law can describe, or generate, an
informational sequence, is essentially a contradiction in terms. The patterns
that laws describe are necessarily highly ordered, not complex. Thus, like
crystals, all law-like patterns have an extremely limited capacity to convey
information. One might, perhaps, find a complex set of material conditions
capable of generating high information content on a regular basis, but everything
we know suggests that the complexity and information content of such conditions
would have to equal or exceed that of any system produced, thus again begging
the question about the ultimate origin of information.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">For
example, the chemist J. C. Walton has argued (echoing earlier articles by
Mora) that even the self-organization produced in Prigogine-style convection
currents does not exceed the organization or information represented by
the the experimental apparatus used to create the currents. Similarly, Maynard-Smith
and Dyson have shown that Manfred Eigen's so-called hypercycle model for
generating information naturalistically is subject to the same law of information
loss. They show, first, that Eigen's hypercycles presuppose a large initial
contribution of information in the form of a long RNA molecule and some
forty specific proteins. More significantly, they show that because hypercycles
lack an error-free mechanism of self-replication, they become susceptible
to various &quot;error-catastrophes&quot; that ultimately diminish, not
increase, the information content of the system over time. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Instead,
our experience with information-intensive systems (especially codes and
languages) indicates that such systems always come from an intelligent source&oacute;i.e.,
from mental or personal agents. This generalization holds not only for the
information present in languages and codes but also for the non-grammatical
information (also describable as specified complexity) inherent in machines
or expressed in works of art. Like the text of a newspaper, the parts of
a supercomputer and the faces on Mount Rushmore require many instructions
to specify their shape or arrangement and consequently, have a high information
content. Each of these systems are also, not coincidentally, the result
of intelligent design, not chance or material forces. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Our generalization about the cause of information
has, ironically, received confirmation from origin-of-life research itself.
During the last forty years, every naturalistic model proposed has failed
to explain the origin of information. Thus, mind or intelligence or what
philosophers call &quot;agent causation,&quot; now stands as the only known
cause known to be capable of creating an information-rich system, including
the coding regions of DNA, functional proteins and the cell as a whole.
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Because mind or intelligent design is a necessary
cause of an informative system, one can detect (or, logically, retrodict)
the past action of an intelligent cause from the presence of an information-intensive
effect, even if the cause itself cannot be directly observed. Since information
requires an intelligent source, the flowers spelling &quot;Welcome to Victoria&quot;
in the gardens of Victoria harbor, lead visitors to infer the activity of
intelligent agents even if they did not see the flowers planted and arranged.
Similarly, the specifically arranged nucleotide sequences&oacute;the encoded
information&oacute;in DNA imply the past action of an intelligent mind,
even if such mental agency cannot be directly observed.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Moreover, the logical calculus underlying such
inferences follows a valid and well-established method used in all historical
and forensic sciences. In historical sciences, knowledge of the present
causal powers of various entities and processes enables scientists to make
inferences about possible causes in the past. When a thorough study of various
possible causes turns up just a single adequate cause for a given effect,
historical or forensic scientists can make fairly definitive inferences
about the past. Several years ago, for example, one of the forensic pathologists
from the original Warren Commission that investigated the assassination
of President Kennedy spoke out to quash rumors about a second gunman firing
from in front of the motorcade. Apparently, the bullet hole in the back
of President Kennedy's skull evidenced a distinctive beveling pattern that
clearly indicated its direction of entry. In this case, it revealed definitely
that the bullet had entered from the rear. The pathologist called the beveling
pattern a &quot;distinctive diagnostic&quot; to indicate a necessary causal
relationship between the direction of entry and the presence of the beveling.
Inferences based on knowledge of necessary causes (&quot;distinctive diagnostics&quot;)
are quite common in historical and forensic sciences, and often lead to
the detection of intelligent, as well as, natural causes. Since Criminal
X's fingers are the only known cause of Criminal X's fingerprints, X's prints
on the murder weapon incriminate him with a high degree of certainty. In
the same way, since intelligent design is the only known cause of information-rich
systems, the presence of information&oacute;including the information-rich
nucleotide sequences in DNA&oacute;implies an intelligent source. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Scientists
in many fields recognize the connection between intelligence and information
and make inferences accordingly. Archaeologists assume a mind produced the
inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone. Evolutionary anthropologists try to demonstrate
the intelligence of early hominids by arguing that certain chipped flints
are too improbably specified to have been produced by natural causes. N.A.S.A.'s
search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (S.E.T.I.) presupposed that information
imbedded in electromagnetic signals from space would indicate an intelligent
source. As yet, however, radio-astronomers have not found information-bearing
signals coming from space. But closer to home, molecular biologists have
identified encoded information in the cell. Consequently, a growing number
of scientists now suggest that the information in DNA justifies making what
probability theorist William Dembski and biochemist Michael Behe call &quot;the
design inference.&quot; </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Conclusion<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During the last
forty years, molecular biology has revealed a complexity and intricacy of
design that exceeds anything that was imaginable during the late-nineteenth
century. We now know that organisms display any number of distinctive features
of intelligently engineered high-tech systems: information storage and transfer
capability; functioning codes; sorting and delivery systems; regulatory
and feed-back loops; signal transduction circuitry; and everywhere, complex,
mutually-interdependent networks of parts. Indeed, the complexity of the
biomacromolecules discussed in this essay does not begin to exhaust the
full complexity of living systems. As even the staunch materialist Richard
Dawkins has allowed, &quot;Biology is the study of complicated things that
give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet
the materialistic science we have inherited from the late-nineteenth century,
with its exclusive conceptual reliance on matter and energy, could neither
envision nor can it now account for the biology of the information age.
As Werner Gitt has said, throughout the natural sciences &quot;energy and
matter are considered to be basic, universal quantities. But the concept
of information has become just as fundamental and far reaching. . . information
has rightly become known as the third fundamental quantity.&quot; Or as
Norbert Weiner put it, &quot;Information is information, neither energy
nor matter. No materialism that fails to take account of this can survive
the present day.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The molecular biology of
the cell raises the possibility that &quot;no materialism&quot; will survive
the revolution beginning to take root in science. While established journals
and institutions continue to propagate the orthodoxies of a generation ago,
many scientists, philosophers of science and mathematicians have begun to
challenge these views and to formulate alternative approaches. Recent work
in probability theory has defined information more precisely and articulated
clear mathematical criteria for the identification of intelligently designed
systems, thus providing a theoretical framework for a new science based
upon the reality of design. A new book on the &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;
of biochemical systems explains why gradual undirected evolution cannot
produce such systems, and suggests intelligent design as the most viable
scientific alternative. A new peer-reviewed journal, <I>Origins &amp; Design,</I>
opens this spring with a seminal article by a former chemical evolutionist
turned design-advocate. Other work promises to reshape our conception, not
only of living things but of our science and ourselves. If the simplest
life owes its origin to an intelligent Creator, then perhaps man is not
the &quot;cosmic orphan&quot; that twentieth century scientific materialism
has taught. Perhaps then, during the twenty first century, the traditional
moral and spiritual foundations of the West will find support from the very
sciences that once seemed to undermine them. </FONT><BR>

<P>	 <B>CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND - The 20th Century has witnessed an unprecedented
expansion of scientific knowledge. It has also seen episodes of human- rights
abuse unparalleled both in magnitude and cruelty.</B><BR>
<BR>
	 Even as the double-helix discovery, the quantum theory and the development
of a polio vaccine have manifested some of man's most ennobling capabilities,
the gulags and gas chambers have demonstrated with equal force that scientific
prowess alone does not confirm the existence of civilization--if civilization
is to be measured by a commitment to protecting human rights.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Indeed, in a great many places during the 20th Century, human rights have
been an imperiled commodity. Yet in every situation, the protections accorded
human rights have reflected what cultures and governments think about the
value and dignity of man. The scientific disciplines, which have increasingly
helped to define our century's view of mankind, have indirectly played an
important role in the discussion of human rights, precisely because man's
idea of man ultimately decides the respect such rights receive.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Human rights might be defined as the legal and political manifestation
of a culture's perception of human dignity. Yet cultures do not create human
dignity any more than governments create human rights; at best, societies
will acknowledge dignity by preserving rights. Former Harvard law professor
Harold J. Berman has detected this assumption at the heart of American constitutionalism.
In the United States, he notes, &quot;the fundamental rights of individual
persons exist independently of the state.&quot; Under Soviet Marxism, by
contrast, &quot;all rights are granted by the state and are inevitably subordinate
to (its) power.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 But which way should it be? Do human rights have validity apart from government
decree or are they merely granted by it?  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the Western tradition, human rights have been said to exist independently
of the state because they have been based upon human dignity. The American
Bill of Rights, for example, offers what Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. has called &quot;a sublime oration on the dignity of man.&quot;
The word dignity comes from the Latin dignitas, meaning &quot;glory.&quot;
Historically, Western society has derived its belief in the dignity of man
from its Judeo-Christian belief that man is the glory of God, made in his
image. According to this view, human rights depend upon the Creator who
made man with dignity, not upon the state. In the American formulation,
&quot;men . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Many educated citizens in the West, however, have abandoned the traditional
view of man and replaced it with a more contemporary scientific view--one
that promulgates a less exalted view of man. In purely material, scientific
terms, human beings are insignificant oddities cast up by chance in an immense
and impersonal universe. As British philosopher Bertrand Russell concluded,
&quot;Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they
were achieving&quot; and which, in turn, predestine him &quot;to extinction
in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; Such pessimism has persisted
despite the spectacular advances that have occurred in science during the
20th Century. Though Einsteinian and quantum concepts have revolutionized
accepted ideas of matter, space and time, science has discovered nothing
to elevate the modern view of man. In this modern scientific view, only
man's material complexity distinguishes him from the other biological structures
that inhabit the universe.  <BR>
<BR>
	 This loss of what is distinctively human will in time require either promoting
animals to the human estate, or more likely, relegating man to the level
of animals. UC Berkeley biologist Thomas H. Jukes has declared that in a
few years we will hear of &quot;the rights of bacteria,&quot; since all
that differentiates bacteria from humanity is a &quot;disparity in the length
and sequence of DNA molecules.&quot;  <BR>
	 Such predictions are not merely theoretical. Dolphin experiments prompted
John Lilly to say that &quot;the day that communication is established the
(dolphin) becomes a legal, ethical, moral and social problem.&quot; The
dolphin will have qualified for &quot;human rights.&quot; A court case in
California about a great ape that learned sign language further illustrates
the point. With research funds exhausted, the ape's teachers claimed that
because the ape had learned language, it qualified for legal protection
and that to return it to the zoo would be &quot;dehumanizing.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 While some researchers have &quot;personified&quot; their apes, others
have mechanized their concept of man. One Carnegie-Mellon robotics researcher
has suggested that those who deny the &quot;consciousness&quot; of his mobile
robots display a gross chauvinism in favor of their own form of mental machinery.
A conference at Yale last year on artificial intelligence produced several
informal discussions about the problem of defining the political rights
of &quot;thinking&quot; machines. In his widely read article in Science,
&quot;The New Biology: What Price Relieving Man's Estate?&quot; Leon R.
Kass of the University of Chicago wrote &quot;we are witnessing the erosion,
perhaps the final erosion, of the idea of man as something splendid or divine,
and its replacement with a view that sees man, no less than nature, as simply
more raw material for manipulation and homogenization. Hence our peculiar
moral crisis.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the face of this situation, Western nations have signed the U.N. Declaration
of Human Rights. Most all still abide by its provisions. Without the concept
of &quot;the distinctively human,&quot; however, governments are inevitably
playing a global game of &quot;let's pretend.&quot; The most impassioned
appeals for human rights by politicians and scientists will mean nothing
if they have abandoned belief in the distinctive dignity of man. Without
this conviction there is no logical ground for supporting human rights in
the West or in the Soviet Union; there is no logical ground for human rights
at all. In such a context, those who advocate human rights practice species
chauvinism.  <BR>
<BR>
	 In response to such absurd but seemingly inescapable conclusions, some
have hoped that merely reiterating the Judeo-Christian doctrine of creation
will restore the grounds for preserving human dignity. But no doctrine can
give man dignity, let alone one that is no longer believed. No &quot;useful
fiction&quot; can rescue man from his current moral dilemma; for fictions
remain useful only as long as they are not regarded as such. Even so, Judaism
and Christianity do not teach that the doctrine of man's creation in the
Divine image establishes his dignity. They teach that the fact of man's
creation has established human dignity. Only if man is (in fact) a product
of special Divine purposes can his claim to distinctive or intrinsic dignity
be sustained. Indeed, if dignity is built into man by his Creator, then
certain rights are &quot;inalienable.&quot; Moreover it follows that if
man's dignity is a fact of his origin, human rights are independent of his
religious or philosophical convictions, just as they are independent of
the state. In short, if the traditional view of man's origin is correct,
people have human rights whether they believe they do or not.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Voltaire said that madness is to have erroneous perceptions and to reason
correctly from them. Historically, from the standpoint of human rights,
madness has prevailed in the Eastern Bloc under Soviet domination. Moreover,
the Soviet madness adheres to the pattern Voltaire described: Soviet indifference
to human rights is reasoned correctly from an erroneous perception of man
called Marxism--a materialist perception that Karl Marx himself held to
be scientific.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Yet we in the West with our own scientific view of man have created a
curious situation. The orthodoxy of Judaism and Christianity contends that
man has dignity because he has been created in the image of God. If the
orthodox view is false, as is now widely assumed in the academic and legal
professions, then one wonders how long it will be until we in the West reason
correctly from a strictly scientific perception of human nature.  <BR>
	 As renewed Soviet-American dialogue again raises the question of human
rights, we might well remember that neither the edifice of Western technical
sophistication nor the &quot;science&quot; of Marx can provide any firm
ground for asserting these rights. Instead, productive proclamations of
human rights depend upon a shared conviction that man's dignity is inherent--safe
from any political expedient--as our Western religious heritage once asserted.
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Public, and especially political, references to this heritage can doubtless
offend the sensibilities of a secular age. Yet if the traditional understanding
of man is correct, if it is not only doctrinal but factual, then governments
can derive human rights from a dignity that actually exists. But if the
traditional view is false and the modern scientific view prevails, then
there is no dignity and human rights are a delusion, not only in Moscow
but here in the West as well.<BR>

Plummer </A><BR>&amp; Charles C. Mann</I></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P>Many of the battles to come, as a Democratic Administrations faces aRepublican Congress, will be the sort of meanspirited partisan scufflesthat Americans love to deride. But sometimes the smoke and dust of the fraywill conceal a matter of principle, even philosophy-as in the case of thereauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>Like many laws, the act must periodically be reauthorized, which is to saythat the federal government must occasionally renew its own authority tofund the act's enforcement and administration. Reauthorization was scheduledfor 1992, but Congress postponed action indefinitely-its members did notwant to touch the issue in an election year. In the meantime, frustrationwith the law has been building. The inevitable debate will probably takeplace this year, perhaps within the next few months. It will be bloody,as they say inside the Beltway. At issue will be the nation's biologicalheritage, more or less, and a vision of its economic future. Conflict willbe engaged by the usual operatives: lobbyists representing some of the nation'smost powerful interest groups. <BR><BR><BR>Opponents call for narrowing the scope of the law, claiming that societyis spending billions to protect the Penland beardtongue, the fat pocketbookmussel, the giant kangaroo rat, and a cavalcade of other creatures withabsurd-sounding names. The Endangered Species Act, in their view, threatensto usurp so much private property and capsize so many jobs that it may wreckour very economy. Proponents declare the law inadequately enforced and demandthat its protections be extended to more species at a faster rate; otherwise,they claim, we risk trashing our biological life-support system. Weakenor fortify?-that is the tenor of the debate. One question is rarely addressed:Can the law be more responsive to the concerns of both sides? <H2><CENTER><BR><BR>*****************</CENTER></H2><BR>The Endangered Species Act orders the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, abranch of the Department of the Interior, to protect species recognizedas endangered, without regard to cost. The goal is to banish extinctionfrom the United States. Unfortunately, the present system has failed utterlyto do this. Species are going extinct anyway, and the threats are multiplying.For every species that Fish and Wildlife has successful removed from theendangered list in the past tow decades, it has added more than one hundredothers. <BR><BR><BR>This outcome would have surprised the members of Congress who passed thelaw, in 1973. Implicit in the debate over the act was the assumption, stillheld by many conservationists today, that endangered species could be savedwithout sacrifice: if development affects a species here, we can just movethe development or the species someplace else. since then it has becomeclear that the reasons species become endangered are not always trivial,and that saving them is not so simple. <BR><BR><BR>Anyone who has walked in the western parts of Albany, New York, can seethe problem. A hundred years ago the area hosted one of the world's largestpopulations of the Karner Blue butterfly, a lovely little bug that appearedon the endangered list at the end of 1992. The former haunts of the butterflyhave been taken over by an interstate highway, a power substation, a campusof the State University of New York, and several hundred middle-class homes.In other words, the butterfly was endangered by the satisfaction of ordinaryhuman desires to drive around, switch on lamps at night, learn about interestingthings, and live in a nice home. <BR><BR><BR>Because human interests cannot be ignored, not al species can be saved.yet the current system demands the unattainable: all species must be saved,and human interests must be ignored. Amplifying this dissonance has beenan unwillingness in Congress to award the Fish and Wildlife Service morethan a paltry budget to enforce and administer the law. As a result, theagency has been driven to impose conservation tasks on those private-propertyowners who are unlucky enough to have land that sustains endangered species.To be safe from possible prosecution, they must verify that using theirproperty will cause the creatures no harm. Endangered species thus becomea liability that encourages otherwise responsible citizens to call in thebulldozers at the first glimpse of an endangered bird or lizard. <BR><BR><BR>Both sides of the debate recognize these flaws, but they disagree on howto remedy them. Supporters of the law cling to its impossible goal, callingfor increased budgets and stricter enforcement. This would turn Fish andWildlife Service biologists into ecological mandarins, making choices forentire regions which must favor the interests of other species and not people.Such overbearing regulation would increase the incentives for landownersto destroy pristine land, with predictably disastrous environmental consequences.<BR><BR><BR>Not that opponents have a better answer. Many call for compensating landownersfor any decrease in the value of their property brought on by species protection.But this amount to little more than replacing ecological mandarins witheconomic mandarins, whose decisions would be equally predictable and equallydisastrous. <H2><CENTER>********************** </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>What will it take to do a better job of saving our natural heritage? Theforemost change must be to recognize that our values are manifold. If wevalued only trees and streams, we wouldn't hesitate to save them, no materwhat the cost. If we wanted only cement and steel, any part of nature beyondthe minimum necessary to sustain life would become expendable. If the pastis any guide, the debaters in Washington will blindly favor one side orthe other. Progress will be possible only if the unrealistic demands ofthe Endangered Species Act are scaled back and supplemented with a way ofsatisfying some of the needs of affected landowners. <BR><BR><BR>The demands of the current law should not be eliminated entirely, though.Even if a species fails a strict cost-benefit test, few people would supportits extinction without pausing to reflect. Protecting species is a taskthat deserves a place in the political life of our country, alongside otherbasic values such as protecting health, maintaining the nation's defense,and fostering education. <BR><BR><BR>In other words, a balance must be struck. Part of that balance should befor landowners to concede that our ecological inheritance is important enoughto justify some regulation of their land. Another, equally important partof the balance should be for conservationists to concede that developmentplans that threaten species are reflections of the human desire to havestores, roads, schools, homes, and the like. The two concessions point inthe same direction: neither species nor developers should win all the time.The question is when and where each should prevail. <BR><BR><BR>Moneyed interests, of course, will always threaten species and other environmentalassets that cannot pay their way. The most appropriate counterweight isnot to outlaw human nature but to award some money to environmental protection.merely throwing money at the current system, however, will only exacerbatethe problems inherent in the endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>One solution would be to create an Endangered Species Trust fund, to promoteconservation in ways more compatible with American values and culture. Thefund could underwrite a variety of programs, from ecological research toeducational advertising to conservation assistance to outright land purchase.It could encourage landowners to share their land with species in trouble.The state of Wisconsin, for example, already has such a program, which coversseven species on the federal endangered list. Landowners agree to a nonbindingprotection plan, and are rewarded with a picture of the species, a certificateof appreciation, ongoing species-management help, and, most important, thebelief that they are voluntarily doing to right thing. According to thestate, most landowners happily go along, although the program is unlikelyto deter big development plans. <BR><BR><BR>Not all species can be protected by voluntary programs, of course, and wherenecessary the trust fund could help subsidize conservation efforts by landowners.One possible model is a program sponsored by the Defenders of Wildlife,a Washington-based conservation group, which offers a $5,000 &quot;bounty&quot;to each landowner who has an established wolf den on his or her property.The trust could also promote commercial practices that are environmentallyfriendlier but costlier than current practices. As the Soil ConservationService does for farmers and soil conservation, a Biological ConservationService, funded by the trust, could encourage foresters, ranchers, and minersto modify their activities, thus reducing-though not eliminating-harm toendangered species. <BR><BR><BR>In critical cases the trust fund would have the tools to restrict land usegreatly, albeit in a noncoercive manner. It could take a lesson from Thenature Conservancy, which protects some biologically valuable land by payingfor a conservation easement-a legal contract that forbids developing a pieceof property but allows the landowner to earn income through ecologicallybenign activities, such as certain types of agriculture. As a final resort,in places where almost any human activity threatens the other inhabitants,the trust fund could buy land and protect it as a biological preserve. <BR><BR><BR>Such an effort would be expensive, but it could go a long way toward removingour natural heritage from the mire of partisan bickering. Indeed, the ideaof a trust fund has quietly attracted interest from environmental organizationsand from advocates of property rights. Combined with a scaled-back EndangeredSpecies Act, the fund could help the nation provide environmental protectionwith less social conflict. Isn't that what it means to make the law responsiveto the people and the causes it serves? <BR><BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Mark L.

Pardee Construction,the Weyerhaeuser subsidiary that owns the central portion of the land, plansto turn it into a suburban neighborhood.  But local environmental activistsbelieve it should serve a more valuable purpose:  The area forms a corridorconnecting the Los Penasquitos Canyon to the Torrey Pines nature preserves,a link that they believe would let some of the area's threatened speciestravel between the preserves.  Wanting to keep the corridor open, the activistshave been campaigning to block Pardee's plans.<BR>	Their efforts, however, have run into two big problems.  The cost of stoppingPardee could be as high as $40 million - the lands value, according to thecompany.  And the ecological value of such corridors is disputed by someof the discipline's leading researchers.  Indeed, wildlife corridors havequietly become one of the most important battlegrounds in conservation,with major development projects and the future of valuable nature preservesat stake.  <BR>	Many ecologists and conservation activists argue that corridors are criticalfor maintaining biodiversity.  &quot;Connectivity is absolutely crucial,&quot;say Reed Noss, editor of Conservation Biology , &quot;especially when you'retalking about a species that  doesn't have enough habitat in one place tomaintain a viable population.&quot;  As a result, big habitat-managementefforts in ecological hot spots such as Florida, southern California, andthe Pacific Northwest have focused on establishing links between blocksof habitat.  Corridors, Keith Hay of the Conservation Fund told Defendersmagazine (May-June 1990, pp. 19-30), &quot;hold more promise for the managementof the diversity of life than any other management factor except stabilizationof the human population.&quot;<BR><BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>&quot;Given what we know about the dispersal  of species and the persistenceof populations, &quot; he says, &quot;I think the burden of proof shouldfall on those who would deny corridors to a reserve system, not on thosewho lobby for them.&quot;</H4></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><HR><BR>	But other ecologists worry that efforts to preserve linking areas likethe one in La Jolla may be a shot in the dark.  &quot;People are encouragedto think there's a quick, easy answer - a technological fix - when there'sno evidence that quick, easy answers are forthcoming,&quot; says ecologistDaniel Simberloff of Florida State University.  Dennis Murphy, a conservationbiologist at Stanford University who advocates careful use of corridors,agrees with this assessment, pointing to the inherent difficulty of studyingcomplex ecological interactions in the field.  <BR>	One reason for the popularity of corridors, according to Hartmuth Walter,an ecologist at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles, is thatthey seem to provide a &quot;scientific&quot; rationale for activists topreserve locally favored parcels of land: &quot;It can always be describedas a unique link that must be used to preserve connectivity, which soundsbetter to them than 'just preserve this land because we don't want it developed.'&quot; But the result of this well-meaning application of science, he fears, mayin the long run not be good for either conservation of science.<BR>	Although the notion of ecological connectivity has a long history, it didnot appear in modern form until 1970, when Richard Levins, an ecologistat the Harvard School of Public Health, created the first mathematical modelof what he called a &quot;metapopulation&quot;: a set of linked local populationsof a species, each in its own separate patch of habitat.  <BR>	In Levin's formulation, the population of any given patch rises and fallsover time, there is always a small chance that the population on any individualpatch can vanish.  But the empty habitats can be repopulated if the membersof populations are able to disperse from patch to patch - if, that is, themetapopulation has sufficient &quot;connectivity,&quot; a term coined in1984 by ecologist Gray Merriam of Carleton University in Ontario.  In Levin'stheory, metapopulations can persist through time if the rate of recolonizationmatches the extinction rate.  <BR>	A widely cited example is the pool frog Rana lessonae, which lives in pondsalong the Baltic coast of Sweden.  According to Per Sjoren-Gulve of theGenetics Centre in Uppsala, the pools sometimes dry up, wiping out individualpopulations; when the pools refill, they are recolonized.  The species staysin equilibrium, as long as it has enough pools and frogs can migrate amongthem.  In a classic demonstration of the threat posed to biodiversity byhuman activity, Sjoren reported last year that the frog is threatened becauseforesters are draining and ditching these ponds [Ecology 75: 1357-67 (1994)]. <BR><H4>Theory becomes policy</H4>The intuitive clarity of such scenarios has produced a rapid flourishingof metapopulation theory.  In the 1980's modeling metapopulations becamewhat Simberloff calls a &quot;cottage industry - there must be hundredsof papers by now.&quot;  One reason for the appeal of this work, he says,is that &quot;the models are mathematically interesting.  You get thesefascinating theoretical results, like multiple stable equilibria.&quot; In such situations, the range of possible states for the metapopulationis mathematically similar to the range of possible locations for a marbleon a dented sheet of metal - it can rest in many locations, but cannot shifteasily among them.  <BR>	Theory has produced policy.  As ecologist Susan Harrison of UC Davis, putsit, many habitat managers now believe that a &quot;successful [biodiversity]strategy requires conserving numerous habitat patches and the potentialfor dispersal between them.&quot;  Corridors thus fill conservation plansin many of America's biodiversity backgrounds.  Florida has spent millionsof dollars to create them, including the construction of costly tunnelsunder interstate highways in an effort to link tracts of land suitable forthe endangered Florida panther.  In Riverside County, California, the protectionof corridors linking patches of habitat for the endangered Stephens' kangaroorat was a &quot;very important&quot; guideline in setting up the proposed17,400 hectares of reserves, according to the official habitat-conservationplan.  In the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approveda plan offered by the timber firm Murray-Pacific covering a 22,250-hectaretract of land that houses the endangered northern spotted owl.  The companygained the right to cut trees even if an owl is harmed, as long as the landitself is maintained as &quot;dispersal habitat.&quot;  On the grandestscale, the Wildlands Project - an attempt to map out a network of corridorsamong all of the nation's remaining undeveloped areas backed by Noss, MichaelSoule of UC Santa Cruz, and other influential conservation biologists -is intended to maintain connectivity across huge areas (Science, 25 June1993, p. 1868).<BR><H4>Gaps in corridor research</H4>But skeptics like Harrison and Simberloff argue that many plans to preservecorridors need closer examination.  In the first place, not all speciesexist as metapopulations.  &quot;The phenomenon  is a lot less ubiquitousthan it seems,&quot; says Harrison.  &quot;Just because you see patchy habitatsand blinking populations doesn't mean you have a situation where you havethis balance between extinction and recolonization.&quot;  And even if thereare good theoretical reasons for believing the metapopulation model applies,empirical research on connectivity is extraordinarily difficult.  &quot;Youhave to look at an entire set of populations over the landscape over a longperiod of time,&quot; she says.  &quot;The amount of energy you have tohave to collect the data running from patch to patch is incredible.  Theimportant processes - extinction and recolonization - are so rare that theyare virtually impossible to observe.&quot;<BR>	The difficulties are illustrated in research by Ilkka Hanski and threecollaborators at the University of Finland, who have conducted one of thefew large-scale studies of metapopulation dynamics.  The study, which tookplace in the Aland islands off the coast of southwest Finland, focused onthe Glanville fritillary (spotted) butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, which breedsin small dry meadows at the end of summer.  During that period, the researchteam repeatedly surveyed 1530 suitable butterfly meadows - some as smallas 12 square meters - in an area of 3500 square kilometers.  They foundthat neighboring populations tended to rise and fall in synchrony, suggestingthat the whole area indeed held a metapopulation with many possible states(Nature, 19 October, pp. 618-621).  Yet because the Finnish team has only2 years worth of data, Harrison cautions, the results of this &quot;veryambitious and very exciting&quot; study remain &quot;compatible with otherexplanations&quot; than metapopulation dynamics.  The populations couldbe independent and the synchrony only coincidence.<BR>	Even if a metapopulation exhibits connectivity, corridors may not be neededto provide it.  &quot;When you look at populations that are naturally fragmentedthey often aren't connected by corridors,&quot; says R. J. (Rocky) Gutierrezof Humboldt University in California, a wildlife biologist who has studiedbird populations in the western United States.  &quot;Yet there are populationsof these species on habitat islands.  That's an indications that  they canreach these islands independent of corridors.&quot;  He points to Manhattan'sCentral Park as an example.  &quot;You have a good complement of [northeastern]migratory birds there,&quot; he says, &quot;and there's not corridor connectingit&quot; to anyplace else.<BR>	Large mammals' need for corridors is intuitively easy to understand, becausethey often have large home ranges or use migratory pathways.  Indeed, PaulBeier, a biologist at Northern Arizona University, tracked cougars withradio collars and found that the animals always follow the same paths betweenpatches of habitat, even paths that are kilometers long and pass throughgolf courses and highway underpasses.  &quot;These animals will really usecorridors if they're available - even surprisingly poor corridors,&quot;say Beier.  And he has some evidence that such paths are needed: &quot;Thecats will not walk through a mile of tract homes.  None of the radio-taggedanimals ever did that.&quot;<BR>	But even this evidence isn't conclusive.  The best way to prove that organismsuse corridors, Simberloff says, is to cut them off and see what happens. But in a real landscape, this is a rather difficult proposition.  Beieracknowledges, for example, that he couldn't cut off all the cougars' possiblecorridors to see if they could still find their way across the landscapebecause the corridors wind through private property and under freeways. Moreover, because corridors are not always self-evident, it would be hardto know what to cut.  Ted Case, an ecologist at UC San Diego, says thatecologists usually define corridors by vegetation types - strips of forestland between the lawns of suburban developments, for instance - but speciessuch as salamanders may follow different trails.  &quot;I'm not as surethey are responding to vegetation types, rather than microbes in the soilor fungus or ants,&quot; Case says.<BR>	Finally, Simberloff also points out that corridors can have down sides. They can allow disease, predators, and exotic species to spread througha metapopulation.  And corridors, which are sometimes touted as ways toincrease genetic diversity among populations, may also function to decreaseit, because the migration among individual populations may end up geneticallyhomogenizing the metapopulation as a whole.  Like the evidence in favorof corridors, Simberloff admits, these possibilities are largely theoretical. But, he adds, &quot;there are examples of predators,&quot; such as easterndiamondback rattlesnakes, that use corridors for &quot;trap-lining&quot;- that is, lying in wait for their prey along a corridor.  He also citesa 1987 study that found corridors facilitating the spread of exotic feralpigs through forest fragments in New Zealand, menacing a genus of tree snail(in D. A. Saunders et al., Nature Conservation: The Role of Remnants ofNative Vegetation, Chipping Norton, N.S.W.  Surrey Beatty, 1987.).<BR>	<H4>Making trade-offs</H4>The land between the Los Penasquitos Canyon and Torrey Pines nature preserveexemplifies many of these issues.  The area is hardly pristine wilderness. Laced with roads and suburban neighborhoods, it is bordered on the westby the eight lanes of Interstate 5, one of the most heavily traveled roadsin the country.  But in the middle is a relatively undisturbed mesa coveredwith scrub and chaparral.<BR>	Pardee's plans call for creating a development of almost 1000 homes on160 hectares of this mesa.  In exchange, the company would set aside a numberof other parcels - including a wildlife corridor that snakes around thedeveloped areas and past I-5 by way of a tunnel an a proposed bridge, forminga 3-kilometer route between the two reserves.  This corridor will keep thetwo reserves connected, Pardee believes, and allow large predators likecoyotes, bobcats, and cougars to maintain a presence in Torrey Pines, whichin turn may help prevent it from being overrun by squirrels and smallerpredators like feral cats and raccoons.  <BR>	But corridor advocates like Soule and Michael Beck of the Endangered HabitatsLeague, a southern California environmental group that is spearheading thefight to protect the mesa, argue that this skinny, winding path is not enoughto ensure connectivity and safeguard Torrey Pines from isolation.  Theywant to see the development on the mesa moved to the southern portion, creatinga much wider corridor through the northern part and preserving much of themesa's scrub and chaparral.  And they have vowed to fight Pardee. <BR>	This is, advocates say, the only cautious and prudent course.  Noss arguesthat in the absence of hard evidence, it is always a good idea to maintainexisting connections whenever possible.  And Beck, who admits there is nodefinitive evidence to support the mesa's use as a corridor, agrees thatthe best course is to be conservative.  Pardee's development proposal, inhis words, &quot;is not biologically conservative at all.  It takes theheart out of the mesa.&quot;  He believe Pardee's needs are sufficientlyflexible to allow a wider corridor.<BR>	Skeptics think corridor boosters are going to give up a guaranteed dealthat will create open space in favor of an unproven scientific concept. Studies similar to Beier's UCLA's Walter points out, suggest large mammalsneed no more than the narrow path called for in Pardee's plans.  Moreover,he says, the &quot;caution&quot; of corridor advocates actually disguisesother risks.  Money does not grow on trees, the ecologist says, and tappingpublic coffers to buy the mesa almost certainly precludes spending fundson other conservation efforts.  Noting that exotic plants and other formsof degradation plague the Torrey Pines reserve - an observation that hasbroad scientific support - Walter asks if the area's limited conservationresources might be better spent on restoring the reserve's ecological health.<BR>	Beck worries, however, that without the biggest possible link, the degradationin Torrey Pines will only continue.  &quot;If we write off wildlife dispersalto Torrey Pines,&quot; he says, &quot;it won't have the dynamic mechanismsthat balance wildlife activity.&quot;<BR>	The debate over the corridor through the mesa, like may others around thecountry, must be resolved without the evidence scientists usually rely uponto settle such disputes.  To Walter, it is risky for scientists to comeout strongly for a concept with such uncertain empirical backing.  &quot;Howare we going to get Congress to listen to biology if they think it is beingused solely as an excuse to stop development?&quot; he asks.  And he worriesthat the result could be a discrediting of science.<BR>	Others argue that development pressure is too intense to allow researchersto work with perfect data, no matter what they do.  But they disagree aboutwhat to do  in the absence of evidence.  &quot;Corridors are not bad perse,&quot; says Harrison, &quot;but there's a range of [possible conservationstrategies], and you should at least consider them before blindly rushinginto things.&quot;  Murphy doesn't disagree, but feels that corridors shouldbe given the benefit of the doubt.  &quot;Given what we know about the dispersal of species and the persistence of populations, &quot; he says, &quot;Ithink the burden of proof should fall on those who would deny corridorsto a reserve system, not on those who lobby for them.&quot;<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Charles C.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Death and taxes are known as life's certainties. Far less common,
but much more enjoyable to contemplate, is the death of a tax. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a little-known technology may be about to accomplish what generations
of Americans have joked and dreamed about -- and both the new Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer and his predecessor, Chairman Sam Gibbons,
have said they desire: the annihilation of the income tax. Now it is becoming
possible, and perhaps even necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before proceeding to describe (in loving detail) the imminent demise, let's
remember why the murder is justifiable. The income tax discriminates against
savings and investment. Economic growth and job creating are penalized.
As the tax system grows ever more complex, and changes pile on changes,
the cost of compliance grows even more rapidly--unalloyed economic dead
weight. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of the resources that would be freed, and the human happiness that
would accrue, if all the tax lawyers and accountants were put to work doing
something useful. Think of all the gains to taxpayers once they were freed
from the burden of compliance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The cost is more than economic. The complexity of the system also causes
fear. People rarely know what the proper tax liability is. For most large
businesses and many individuals, the only thing they know is that the amount
they paid is probably wrong. And though we may be amused each April-by the
news stories about leading accounting firms and IRS offices each calculating
a different liability from the same data, the consequenes are not so funny.
Each year the IRS tries to send people to jail for not determining a liability
that is, by the very nature of the system, almost impossible to calculate.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, also, the very Congress that claims to want to get the government
off people's back is complicating the system even further. Among the various
tax cut bills that have been introduced, only Rep. Dick Armey's flat tax
bill will produce significant simplification. Left to themselves, it is
unlikely that the legislators, buffeted as they are by the lobbyists and
lawyers, will ever summon the courage to put the IRS out of its, and our,
misery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, computer hardware and software may soon do what Congressmen
and Senators will not. For centuries, people have paid their bills, and
received their income, by cash or check. But, these costly methods of payment
may be coming to a rather abrupt end. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transfers greatly reduce the costs of transaction and the possibility
of loss. Americans are now starting to pay their bills by using credit and
debit cards, and by inexpensive &quot;Smart Phones.&quot; These systems
provide customers with a full record of income and payments: good for record-keeping,
bad for privacy. In fact, the IRS is already working on a system to gather
all your financial information electronically and prepare your income tax
return for you. That might crimp the tax lawyers and accountants a bit,
but the Big Brother/police state aspects are at least as unpalatable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There is, however, a technological alternative. An experiment now underway,
called &quot;E-cash,&quot; is operating in Amsterdam by a company named
DigiCash. The electronic version of the anonymous paper dollar is now with
us. Individuals will be able to move their funds around the world, literally
at the speed of light, from one bank to another or to a creditor, without
the bank knowing to whom the money was paid, or the creditor knowing from
which bank or even country the money came. <BR>
<BR>
Through the use of cryptographic technology (scrambled numbers for personal
codes), the ease of conducting electronic transaction would be combined
with the elegant anonymity of paying in cash. The two most important features
of the E-Cash system -- security and anonymity -- will be ensured by using
cryptographic digital signatures to establish the authenticity of the payer,
wile at the same time assuring his anonymity and untraceability. The virtual
electronic dollar bills will, at the same time, be assigned individual electronic
serial numbers, which will also be checked for authenticity. The bank will
know how much to pay and what code to pay it to, but will not know the owner
of the receiving code, hence the payee too remains anonymous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, the IRS doesn't like it. But the matter may be beyond their control.
In the next few months, Americans will be offered two competing versions
of the future. The first is the society in which all of your transactions
can be monitored by the government (and other interested parties). The second
is where you as an individual choose which of your transactions will be
made available to curious eyes, and which will remain anonymous. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many in the government and other organizations will argue for a ban on anonymous
systems arguing that such capabilities benefit primarily drug traffickers,
money launderers, assorted terrorists, and plain old tax dodgers. Libertarians,
on the other hand, will warn of the dangers that accrue when government
has almost total scrutiny of individuals. One doesn't have to imagine what
a Hitler or Stalin could have done with such a system. Merely imagine anyone
trying to get Senate confirmation for government service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the fears of both sides are correct. Happily, some of the
legitimate fears of the government can be mollified by repealing the income
tax and substituting a value-added or business transfer tax. Anonymous systems
will still make it easier for criminals and evaders to do what they are
already doing successfully, especially as private encryption protocols are
developed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But without an income tax it won't matter. The gains to the American people,
economically and psychologically, will be magnificent. Even the government,
which relies on public trust, will gain. And on such terms, that would be
a very good thing. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conventional wisdom holds that the truth is usually in the middle.
But when the middle is in the space between two erroneous extremes, the
truth is probably somewhere else entirely. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Case in point: the growing debate over the income tax and possible alternatives.
The macroeconomic statist approach - the legacy of Marx, Keynes, and assorted
other socialists and do-gooders - is now discredited. Few seriously hold
that the state has unlimited potential to do good, and should be funded
accordingly. But the microeconomic statist approach, in its unthinking acceptance
of the notion that alternative taxes should bring in at least as much revenue
as the income tax, is also flawed. For the fundamental question is not how
to raise money for the state, but what is the right size government to enable
maximum economic welfare. We now know that we should bring total government
spending down from one-third to one-quarter of GDP in order to maximize
the social welfare, opportunity and freedom of our citizens. This is how
we found out. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For thirty years after World War II, it was conventional wisdom that increasing
the size of government would lead to higher levels of prosperity. However,
by the 1970s, it was evident that the macroeconomic statist model wasn't
working. In much of western Europe and the U.S., capital formation and growth
rates fell and unemployment increased. By the 1980s, it was also evident
that the economies of some Southeast Asian nations with small governmental
sectors (such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) were growing at much
higher rates than had previously been thought possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Economists thus began looking at the relationship between government size
and economic growth. In 1986, economists of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
(myself included) analyzed this relationship for 22 countries. We found
that slowdowns in growth rates were significantly correlated with growth
in the government share of GDP. Our best estimate was that government maximized
economic growth when it was between 15% and 25% of GNP. Since then, many
more studies have confirmed our work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It should not be surprising that there is an optimal size for government.
Too little government can reduce growth. Government needs to spend enough
to assure a fair and predictable system of justice, national defense, and
basic public health and education, and to enforce contracts. However, all
government spending entails extracting wealth from the private sector, either
by taxing or borrowing. The larger government becomes, the more severe these
extraction costs become. Eventually, they crowd out private sector investment,
reducing productivity, capital formation, and growth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
High tax rates reduce incentives to work, save, and invest, and involve
ever-increasing collection and compliance costs. Also public spending is
less efficient than private because it often misallocates resources and
lowers incentives for cost-controls. Government spending programs also tend
to develop their own constituencies, and generate political pressures to
increase spending that have nothing to do with the general welfare. Benefits
concentrate in certain groups, while costs diffuse throughout the population.
When these benefits take the form of income redistribution rather than,
say, defense or capital spending, negative effects are especially severe.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, for the United States, the right size government (at all levels) is
no more than 25 percent of GDP, and perhaps considerably less. About two-thirds
of this necessary reduction, from the current 33 percent to 25 percent of
GDP, should come from relative reductions in federal spending. This will
require elimination of most counter-productive spending programs, such as
agriculture and energy subsidies, and changing Social Security and Medicare
into genuine annuity and insurance programs. And, a new tax system that
is less intrusive and less biased against work, saving, and investment needs
to be designed and implemented for the correctly sized government. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The country may be edging toward serious consideration of such a simple
but profound change. The first evidence is that people are finally willing
to start thinking about it in various academic and think tank seminars.
But the real test is likely to be the election of 1996 and whether a correctly
sized government - and what it entails - becomes part of a national political
debate. </BLOCKQUOTE>

of Christians in Politics</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">With another presidential election fast approaching,
secularists are once again fanning the flames of fear against politically
conservative Christians. &quot;I can&iacute;t remember a time when the danger
to civil liberties and fundamental constitutional rights was more extreme
or more pervasive than it is today,&quot; writes Ira Glasser, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Glasser goes on to accuse
the Christian Coalition of seeking &quot;to amend the Constitution to put
religious indoctrination back into the public schools.&quot; Other secularists
routinely condemn Christians for seeking to legislate their religious beliefs
into law.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">There is a valid point lurking somewhere in this undeniably
overblown rhetoric. Like most religions, Christianity has been employed
on occasion as an engine of intolerance as some sought to propagate its
doctrines by law. However, Christianity also has been one the most powerful
defenders of freedom in the history of the world. Between these paradoxical
extremes lie the peril and the promise of Christians in politics today.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nathaniel Hawthorne aptly captured this peril and
promise in his stories about the American Puritans. Repelled by the Puritans&iacute;
religious intolerance, Hawthorne admired their realism and their unswerving
devotion to principle. The latter trait he lucidly depicted in his short
story &igrave;The Gray Champion&icirc; (1835), where a first-generation
Puritan mysteriously returns to Boston in 1689 to thwart the subjugation
of the colonies by King James II. Like a fiery Old Testament prophet, the
old Puritan  --the &quot;Gray Champion&quot; of the story's title-- denounces
the usurpations of Royal Governor Sir Edmund Andros and urges the people
to resistance. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In this story Hawthorne showed how the same rigid
idealism that spawned the Puritans&iacute; religious bigotry also produced
a powerful commitment to moral principle that made them resist political
tyranny. Hence the paradox of Christianity: its religious intolerance may
subvert republican government, but its rigorous attachment to moral principle
may be necessary to defend it.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">One of the greatest achievements of American constitutionalism
was the manner in which it resolved this paradox by harnessing the moral
idealism of Christianity while restraining its potential for bigotry. America's
Founders harnesssed Christianity&iacute;s moral idealism by stressing the
importance of morality in civic life and by acknowledging the crucial role
churches played in fostering that morality. Indeed, several Founders argued
that ministers had the responsibility to speak up about moral problems pressing
society. In the words of John Adams, &quot;It is the duty of the clergy
to accommodate their discourses to the times, to preach against such sins
as are most prevalent, and recommend such virtues as are most wanted.&quot;
At the same time, the Founders sought to temper Christianity's intolerance
by removing theological questions from the political arena, which greatly
reduced the consequences of religious intolerance by ensuring that state
power would never be used to resolve theological controversies. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The Founders' arrangement produced an institutional
separation between church and state even while forging a practical tie between
religion and politics on the basis of morality. Christians were discouraged
by the nature of the regime from using the government to promote their theological
beliefs; but the door was left open for them to enter the political arena
as citizens in order to promote government policies in accord with both
the principles of the Constitution and the &igrave;&quot;laws of nature
and nature&quot;s God&quot; on which those principles are premised. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The political activities of Christians in the new
nation reflected the Founders&iacute; understanding of the role of religion
in society. Many Protestant evangelicals opposed state funding of churches
because they thought it corrupted religion, and gradually even the congregationalists
who supported establishments of religion changed their minds. When Christians
did become involved in politics in the early nation, they generally sought
to do so on the basis of principles of civic morality that were held in
common by both reason and revelation. In the years before the Civil War
they entered the political arena by the thousands to spearhead crusades
against duelling, lotteries, war, poverty, prostitution, alcoholism, and
slavery. These political activities on behalf of secular concerns proved
that evangelicals could fulfill a vital political function by serving as
the political conscience of the nation.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the
controversy over Cherokee removal from Georgia. Federal treaties had guaranteed
the Cherokees their lands upon the condition that they become both peaceful
and &quot;civilized.&quot; The Cherokees kept their part of the bargain.
They embraced agriculture, became educated, adopted Christianity, and pursued
republican self-government. The Georgians, however, had no intention of
respecting Cherokee treaty rights, and in 1828 and 1829 the Georgia legislature
tried to legislate the Cherokee Nation out of existence, extending its laws
over Cherokee lands and demanding that the federal government remove the
recalcitrant Indians. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The evangelical missionaries who had been working
among the Indians rose to the Cherokees' defense, led by the corresponding
secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Jeremiah
Evarts. Evarts, a lawyer, helped turn the removal issue into a major national
controversy. Under the nom de plume &quot;William Penn,&quot; he wrote twenty-six
essays defending the Cherokees for the <I>National Intelligencer</I>. The
essays were a tour de force of logic, morality, and law. Evarts and other
evangelicals based their arguments against removal not simply on Biblical
morality, but on the natural right of property, the inviolability of contracts,
and the God-given equality of all men proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence,
which they argued applied to Indians as well as white men. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Unfortunately, both Congress and the President rebuffed
evangelicals' efforts on behalf of the Cherokees, and the government eventually
relocated the Indians further West in a scandalous episode of American history
known as the Trail of Tears. The controversy nevertheless demonstrated that
Christians could fulfill the role that the Founders had created for them:
they could put their idealism to constructive use by intervening in politics
on the basis of principles of natural justice rather than doctrines of sectarian
theology.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In responding to the modern secularists who attack
them, Christians today ought to learn from their predecessors in the early
nineteenth century. Contrary to the rhetoric of Patrick Buchanan, the battle
over public morality need not be a &quot;religious war.&quot; Public policy
ought to be based on public principles, and modern Christians can make this
clear by appealing to the same &quot;laws of nature and nature's God&quot;
that their forebears invoked in the public arena more than a century ago.
By articulating anew the moral common ground shared by all human beings,
contemporary Christians can silence the claim that legislating morality
is the same as legislating theology and assure their place as equal participants
in the public debate.</FONT> <BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in United States
in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were<I> &quot;forever forming associations</I>.&quot;
Tocqueville found especially noteworthy the myriad of civic associations
that Americans organized for moral and educational purposes. Instead of
looking to the government for help, publicly-spirited citizens sought to
solve societal problems on their own.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">What Tocqueville may not have realized was that this
national enthusiasm for association was of recent vintage. Although Americans
had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations
did not occur until the second decade of the nineteenth century. And perhaps
no one was more important in bringing it about than Lyman Beecher. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet
Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, Lyman Beecher
was a towering preacher and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues
commented after his death, &quot;in massive talent Lyman Beecher stood among
his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate alone.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">As a young minister in the early 1800s, Beecher faced
a disintegrating society. Church attendance was down, and alcoholism and
other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox
Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. In the political
sphere, elected officials were increasingly reticent about enforcing either
morality or piety by law, and there was growing political support for abolishing
tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism
in New England.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like
most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could
not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry
depended on religion. Now that state support for religion was collapsing,
he feared the worst. But instead of giving into despair, he came up with
a brilliant response: If the government could no longer be relied on to
support religion and morality, he announced, religious adherents themselves
had to do what the government could not.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling
people to &quot;support the gospel and attend the public worship of God,&quot;
Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. &quot;But these means
of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute
but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable
contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians,
and by all classes of the community who love their country.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher advocated replacing government support for
religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread
the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute.
In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations
would seek to create a public consensus through educational efforts because
in a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Following Beecher&Igrave;s lead, evangelicals soon
organized scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and
for social and political reform. They formed groups to help end poverty,
to teach reading and writing to the poor, and to prevent the abuse of alcohol.
Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American
Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of
the sabbath. This multitude of private associations transformed American
society in a way that few government programs ever could. By the time of
the 1830s, it was a well developed system of voluntary activity and benevolence.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">They say ministers have lost their influence,&quot;
Beecher wrote years later. &quot;The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary
efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence
than ever they could&quot; have by state support. He had learned through
experience that the free enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile
to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish.
Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and
Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state
as beneficial to true religion. But they tended to view religion as a private
matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher&Igrave;s unique contribution
was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once state
support of churches had ended.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Interestingly, even as Beecher championed Christianity&Igrave;s
civic role, he had a keen appreciation for the limits of religious activism.
Unlike many later reformers, he had a firm belief in human sinfulness, and
he harbored no illusions that human beings could create an earthly paradise.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher further recognized the dangers that political
activism posed for Christianity. Political ambitions could easily overwhelm
the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher subsequently advised Christians
to restrict their political efforts to the &quot;great questions of national
morality&quot; instead of trying to formulate an explicitly Christian position
on every conceivable political issue. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">&quot;When great questions of national morality are
about to be decided,&Oacute; he wrote, &Iuml;such as the declaration of
war; or, as in England, the abolition of the slave trade&Ouml; it becomes
Christians to lift up their voice, and exert their united influence. But,
with the annual detail of secular policy, it does not become Christians
to intermeddle, beyond the unobtrusive influence of their silent suffrage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">During our own era when questions are again being raised
about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might benefit
from Beecher&Igrave;s free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion
in public life. <BR>

The year was 1951, and England was embroiled in a bitter general election
campaign. Six years earlier the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill
had been thrown out of power. Now the same party, still led by the same
indomitable Churchill, was attempting a comeback. The conventional wisdom
was that the attempt would fail. The conventional wisdom was wrong. Voters
went to the polls on October 25, and the next morning the whole world knew
that the the Conservative Party had recaptured control of Parliament and
Churchill had regained the post of Prime Minister. <BR>
<BR>
Within a few weeks of the change of power, Churchill's office sent a letter
to C. S. Lewis, inviting him to receive the honorary title &quot;Commander
of the British Empire.&quot; One can only guess what Lewis thought when
he first read the letter, but one suspects that he appreciated it, for he
greatly admired Churchill.<SUP>1 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Despite his admiration, however, Lewis declined the proposed honor. He wrote
back to Churchill's secretary that he was grateful for the recognition,
but he worried about the political repercussions: &quot;There are always&#133;
knaves who say, and fools who believe, that my religious writings are all
covert anti--Leftist propaganda, and my appearance in the Honours List wd.
of course strengthen their hands. It is therefore better that I shd. not
appear there.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP> The letter is characteristic of Lewis, for
it shows how diligently he tried to steer clear of partisan entanglements.
He was never a party hack like John Milton; he never founded a political
movement like G.K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc; he even shunned giving
money to political causes. Prior to World War II, one of Lewis's students
informed him of his work on behalf of the Communist--backed loyalists in
the Spanish Civil War. Lewis quickly told the student that he had a rule
about not donating money &quot;to anything that had a directly political
implication.&quot;<SUP>3</SUP> After the War, Lewis continued to keep his
distance from politics. According to stepson David Gresham, Lewis was skeptical
of politicians and not really interested in current events.<SUP>4</SUP>
Lewis's own writings seem to bear this out. His wry poem &quot;Lines During
a General Election&quot; presents the following rather bleak assessment
of politicians: &quot;Their threats are terrible enough, but we could bear/
All that; it is their promises that bring despair.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP> And
as far as caring about the &quot;great issues&quot; of his day, Lewis wrote
his brother in 1940: &quot;Lord! how I loathe great issues&#133;'Dynamic'
I think is one of the words invented by this age which sums up what it likes
and I abominate. Could one start a Stagnation Party--which at General Elections
would boast that during its term of office no event of the least importance
had taken place?&quot;<SUP>6</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Paradoxically, none of this means that Lewis never said anything important
about politics. In fact, he said a great deal--more than most people probably
realize. It is startling to note just how many political topics Lewis broached
in his writings: crime, obscenity, capital punishment, conscription, communism,
fascism, socialism, war, vivisection, the welfare state, the atomic bomb.<SUP>7</SUP>
When Lewis talked about these matters, however, it was not in the way most
politicians do. He was wholly unconcerned with what political scientists
today like to call &quot;public policy&quot;--that conglomeration of compromise,
convention, and self--interest that forms the staple of much of our own
political diet. If you expect to find a prescription for solving air pollution
or advice on how to win an election, don't bother reading Lewis. He has
nothing to tell you. His concern was not policy but principle; political
problems of the day were interesting to him only insofar as they involved
matters that endured. Looked at in this light, Lewis's penchant for writing
about politics and his simultaneous detachment from the political arena
seem perfectly explicable. It is precisely because Lewis was so uninterested
in ordinary political affairs that he has so much to tell us about politics
in the broad sense of the term. By avoiding the partisan strife of his own
time, he was able to articulate enduring political standards for all time.
<BR>
<BR>
Nowhere is this clearer than in Lewis's writings on tyranny and morality.
<BR>
<BR>
Fascism and communism were the two most obvious manifestations of tyranny
about which Lewis wrote, but they were far from the only kinds of tyranny
about which he was concerned.<SUP>8</SUP> Tyranny comes in many forms, most
of which are more subtle than Stalin's gulag or Hitler's death camps. Lewis
knew this, and his most compelling writings on tyranny for us today focus
on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular, Lewis was concerned
about the tyranny that could result from the union of modern science and
the modern state. <BR>
<BR>
To understand the dangers of a scientific state, one must first understand
something about modern science. <BR>
<BR>
Modern science is premised on the notion that all things are determined
by material causes. It proposes strict laws that explain natural phenomena
in terms of physical, environmental or hereditary necessities--e.g., the
ball falls when dropped because of the law of gravity; the dog salivates
at the sound of the bell because of environmental conditioning; the mosquito
generates other mosquitoes because of its genetic code. Now no matter how
necessary such materialistic determinism may be in the study of the natural
world, it cannot be applied indiscriminately to humans without destroying
the very possibility of knowledge and virtue. Such determinism destroys
the possibility of knowledge, according to Lewis, because it undermines
the validity of human reasoning;<SUP>9</SUP> it destroys the possibility
of virtue because it denies the free choice upon which all virtue depends.

If modern science is correct that human thought and conduct are functions
of non--rational causes, then the nature of politics changes fundamentally.
Under the old order, politics involved serious reflection about justice
and the common good. But the more man thinks he is determined by non--rational
causes, the less important serious reflection becomes. Under the new order,
all that matters is achieving the end result. The only deliberation is among
social science bureaucrats, and the only question is not &quot;What is just?&quot;
but &quot;What works?&quot; Moreover, since the new order has dispensed
with the notion of man as a moral agent, &quot;what works&quot; will almost
inevitably be intrusive. As long as man was regarded as accountable for
his actions, there were certain limits beyond which the state was not supposed
to tread. Laws promulgated under the old system promised punishment, but
they could not compel obedience. This is because the very idea of punishment
presupposes free choice: One can only be punished after one has done something
meriting punishment. If a person is willing to face the consequences of
his actions, he can still break the law. His ability to choose is left intact.
<BR>
<BR>
If people act because of environmental and biological necessities, however,
the government no longer need deal with them as free moral agents. Under
the new system, preemption replaces punishment as the preferred method of
social control. Instead of punishing you for making the wrong choice, the
state simply eliminates your choice. So instead of laws telling us to wear
seat--belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
our car seats. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes
are automatically deducted from our paychecks. <BR>
<BR>
In this brave new world, the relationship between citizen and state begins
to resemble the relationship between master and slave, as Lewis pointed
out so perceptively in his essay, &quot;Willing Slaves of the Welfare State.&quot;
The cardinal difficulty with this type of scientific paternalism is that
it undercuts that which makes us human; in the name of saving man from his
problems, it abolishes man: &quot;The question&#133; has become&#133; whether
we can discover any way of submitting to the worldwide paternalism of a
technocracy without losing all personal privacy and independence. Is there
any possibility of getting the super Welfare State's honey and avoiding
the sting? Let us make no mistake about the sting. The Swedish sadness is
only a foretaste. To live his life in his own way, to call his house his
castle, to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, to educate his children as
his conscience directs, to save for their prosperity after his death--these
are wishes deeply ingrained in &#133; civilised man.&quot;<SUP>10<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis's most haunting portrait of this kind of despotism came in his <I>novel
That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>11</SUP> There the spirit of modern social
science becomes incarnate in the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments--NICE,
for short. Of course, there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists
are exactly the type of bureaucratic manipulators that Lewis attacked in
nonfiction works like <I>The Abolition of Man</I>.<SUP>12<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
At this point one can anticipate several objections: First, isn't Lewis
being unfair to science by implying that it inevitably leads to tyranny?
And isn't he being unfair to scientists by implying that all they want is
power to enslave others? And don't many modern problems--from air pollution
to congestion on our freeways--require technological solutions that can
be provided only by scientific experts?<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of such objections and replied that he wasn't against science
or scientists per se and that of course he did not think that science would
necessarily lead to tyranny of the sort depicted in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>13</SUP>
One might be tempted to conclude from this that Lewis's objection to science
was narrow--that all he really opposed was the abuse of science. But such
a conclusion would be misleading. For when Lewis said he wasn't attacking
&quot;science&quot; or &quot;scientists&quot; he seems to have had a very
specific meaning in mind. He was not attacking science insofar as it was
the quest for greater knowledge; he was attacking it insofar it was a quest
for power--in particular, for power over man. In practice this meant that
while Lewis accepted the legitimacy of natural science he rejected much
of the social sciences. Learning about chemistry or biology was acceptable,
if not honorable; trying to use chemical or biological maxims to understand
the nature of man was not. A glimpse of this view can be found in the character
of William Hingest in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I> Hingest is Lewis's prototype
for the &quot;good scientist,&quot; a brilliant and crusty physical chemist
who thinks more highly of his family tree than of his scientific prowess.<SUP>14</SUP>
Hingest is interested in science for the sake of knowledge rather than power,
and he takes a dim view of those who want to use science to control man.<SUP>15</SUP>
Indeed, he does not regard as science at all those disciplines that try
to use the scientific approach to analyze man. When Mark Studdock talks
to him about &quot;sciences like Sociology,&quot; Hingest coldly replies:
&quot;There <I>are</I> no sciences like Sociology.&quot;<SUP>16</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As for the objection that we must rely on the advice of scientists, because
only they have the answers to today's complicated problems, Lewis could
not agree. Lewis does not dispute that scientists have plenty of knowledge;
the problem is that most of it is irrelevant. Political problems are preeminently
moral problems, and scientists are not equipped to function as moralists.
Said Lewis: &quot;I dread specialists in power because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man's opinion no added value.&quot;<SUP>17 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
The cardinal danger of depending on science for political solutions, then,
is that science is divorced from those permanent principles of morality
upon which all just political solutions depend. Indeed, words like &quot;justice,&quot;
&quot;virtue,&quot; &quot;mercy&quot; and &quot;duty,&quot; are terms without
meaning within the scientific framework. And so while science is not necessarily
tyrannical, it can easily become a tool for tyrants because it has no firm
grounding in morality. The same goes for politics: Without a firm grounding
in a firm morality, politics easily slides into tyranny. <BR>
<BR>
But if morality is what we need, how do we go about achieving it? Lewis's
answer to this query is far more controversial than one might suppose. <BR>
<BR>
Many Christians today argue that morality must be founded upon the Bible.
The extent to which this belief holds sway can be seen in the catchwords
Christians use when they become involved in politics; most argue for a return
to &quot;Biblical values,&quot; &quot;Christian values,&quot; &quot;transcendent
religious truths,&quot; or (to use the dominant phrase) &quot;traditional
values&quot; based on the &quot;Judeo--Christian tradition.&quot; The terms
differ slightly, but the bottom--line remains the same: The only real source
of morality is Christian revelation.<SUP>18<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of this view, but rejected it. As he wrote in his posthumously
published essay on ethics: <BR>
<BR>
It is often asserted&#133; that the world must return to Christian ethics
in order to preserve civilization&#133; Though I am myself a Christian,
and even a dogmatic Christian untinged with Modernist reservations and committed
to supernaturalism in its full rigour, I find myself quite unable to take
my place beside the upholders of &#133;[this] view&#133; <BR>
<BR>
It is far from my intention to deny that we find in Christian ethics a deepening,
an internalization, a few changes of emphasis in the moral code. But only
serious ignorance of Jewish and Pagan culture would lead anyone to the conclusion
that it is a radically new thing.<SUP>19</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Rejecting the notion of a peculiarly &quot;Christian&quot; morality, Lewis
argued for the existence of a natural moral law known by all through human
reason. This natural moral code cannot be escaped; it is the source from
which all moral judgments come. Its fundamental truths--maxims like good
should be done and evil avoided, that caring for others is a good thing,
that dying for a righteous cause is a noble thing--are known independently
of experience. They are grasped in the same way that we know that 2+2=4.<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was certainly not the first to articulate the idea of natural law.
As any good medievalist could tell you, &quot;It's all in Aquinas.&quot;
It is also in Paul, Augustine, Cicero, Grotius, Blackstone, and the Declaration
of Independence. But this idea of natural law is precisely what many Christians
reject, even those who cite Lewis. Unintended ironies often result. In an
essay on &quot;Law and Nature&quot; written by one prominent evangelical,
for example, extensive favorable citations of Lewis's Abolition of Man appear
on one page, while this denunciation of natural law appears on another:
&quot;Even if man can treat the so--called natural laws as absolutes for
society and government, the consequence is cruelty to man. Without the reference
point in the Bible, there is no basis to judge which laws of nature are
applicable to government and man. Depending upon the man or elitist group
in power, many different things can be perpetrated and be justified on the
basis of natural law.&quot;<SUP>20<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis regarded this point of view as the cobelligerent of modern philosophy.
For just as modern philosophy attacked the ability of reason to know an
objective moral law, this sort of Christianity considered reason to be too
corrupted by sin to know objective morality apart from the Bible. Lewis
found this belief disheartening, as he wrote his brother: &quot;Did you
fondly believe --I did--that where you got among Christians, there at least
you would escape from the horrible ferocity and grimness of modern thought?
Not a bit of it. I blundered into it all, imagining that I was the upholder
of the old, stern doctrines against modern quasi--Christian slush; only
to find that my sternness was their slush&#133;. They all talk like Covenanters
or Old Testament prophets. They don't think human reason or human conscience
of any value at all&#133;.&quot;<SUP>21 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As far as I know, Lewis never directly addressed the political difficulties
of this rejection of natural law by Christians; yet these difficulties must
be understood in order to fully grasp the importance of Lewis's natural
law teaching for us today. <BR>
<BR>
The problem with tying all morality to the Bible is that it implies that
those who don't believe in the Bible cannot really be good citizens. After
all, if only believers can have access to true morality through the Bible,
perhaps only they can be trusted to make the laws. What has been called
the theological--political problem resurfaces with a vengeance, for in this
situation there exists no common ground on which believers and non--believers
can meet for debate and joint action in the political arena. The natural
law rescues us from this quagmire by articulating a morality shared by believer
and unbeliever alike. <BR>
<BR>
This is not to say that the only justification for natural law is political.
The overarching reason for Christians to believe in natural law is because
it is demanded by revelation itself. Lewis knew this with full force, but
before examining his comments we would do well to refer to the Apostle Paul.
In chapter two of Romans, Paul argues that &quot;when Gentiles&#133; do
by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even
though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of
the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness,
and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot;<SUP>22</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Now according to Paul, the Gentiles have a knowledge of morality even without
having Old Testament revelation. They do that which is right &quot;by nature.&quot;
That &quot;by nature&quot; does not mean &quot;by instinct&quot; here is
clear from the context, for Paul goes on to describe the process by which
the Gentiles come to moral knowledge &quot;by nature&quot;--and the process
is a rational one. It consists of the inner mental dialogue of the conscience
with &quot;thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot; Nor does
Paul diminish the rationality of this knowledge by the phrase &quot;written
on [or 'in'] their hearts.&quot; As Lewis argued in <I>The Discarded Image,</I>
Paul's statement here is in complete harmony with the ancient view that
morality is dictated by &quot;right reason&quot;--and more particularly,
with the Stoic conception of natural law: &quot;The Stoics believed in a
Natural Law which all rational men, in virtue of their rationality, saw
to be binding on them. St. Paul['s]&#133; statement in Romans (ii 14 sq.)
that there is a law 'written in the hearts' even of Gentiles who do not
know 'the law' is in full conformity with the Stoic conception, and would
for centuries be so understood. Nor, during those centuries, would the word
hearts have had merely emotional associations. The Hebrew word which St.
Paul represents by kardia would be more nearly translated 'Mind'.&quot;<SUP>23</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Though Romans 2:14--15 is the single explicit reference in the New Testament
to natural law theory, its importance should not be minimized on that account.
For it is the context in which this reference to natural law appears that
shows us its true importance, not the absence of other references to natural
law in the Bible. In the immediate context of the passage, Paul is trying
to explain how a just God can condemn wicked Gentiles who have not had the
benefit of the Mosaic law. Paul argues that the Gentiles have &quot;no excuse&quot;
because they themselves recognize the substance of the moral law by nature.
In other words, the natural law allows God to justly condemn wicked Gentiles.
<BR>
<BR>
In the broader context of Pauline theology, the necessity of a natural law
becomes even more evident once one focuses on the proper function of Old
Testament law. Paul emphasized that Old Testament law was worthless as a
method to save people from their sins because no one could ever hope to
perfectly fulfill it. All the Old Testament law did was to make the Jews
conscious of sin so that they would know that they needed a savior; the
law demonstrated their need for repentance before God.<SUP>24</SUP> But
Christ died to save Gentiles as well as Jews. Because God never promulgated
the moral law to them through revelation, Gentiles must have been conscious
of their sin through some other route, or they never would have known of
their need to repent. This &quot;other route&quot; is natural law. Without
it, the Gentiles could not repent and be saved.<BR>
<BR>
Viewed in this way, it does not matter that Romans is the only place where
Paul explicitly delineates the natural law for the Gentiles, because the
need for a natural law is presupposed by the very preaching of the gospel
of repentance to anyone who is not a Jew. As Lewis noted in his essay on
ethics: &quot;The convert accept[s]&#133; forgiveness of sins. But of sins
against what Law? Some new law promulgated by the Christians? But that is
nonsensical. It would be the mockery of a tyrant to forgive a man for doing
what had never been forbidden until the very moment at which the forgiveness
was announced&#133;Essentially, Christianity is not the promulgation of
a moral discovery. It is addressed only to penitents, only to those who
admit their disobedience to the known moral law.&quot;<SUP>25<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis made this same argument somewhat more fully in <I>The Problem of Pain</I>.<SUP>26</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Lest one think that I am overstating the case for natural law, let me present
a caveat: Natural law provides a basis for Christians to enter politics,
but it does not provide simple--minded solutions to specific political problems.
Nor did Lewis claim that it would--nor for that matter has any other thinker
within the natural law tradition. As Lewis more than once explained (echoing
Aristotle's <I>Ethics</I>): &quot;[M]oral decisions do not admit of mathematical
certainty.&quot;<SUP>27</SUP> Natural law only supplies general moral precepts;
prudence is required to correctly apply those precepts in particular situations.
Hence there is always the chance that one's political decision will be wrong.<SUP>28<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to those Christians who reject natural law, however, this problem
of uncertainty cannot be solved by replacing the law of nature with the
law of revelation as expressed in the Bible. The Bible rarely gives particular
advice on specific political issues. It does not tell us whether to build
nuclear missiles or invade Panama; it does not inform us what type of social
programs to enact, if any; it does not guide us in our choice of the best
tax system. The Bible invariably requires interpretation if it is to be
used as a political guidebook, and interpretation opens the door for misconstruction.
The Bible is infallible; but its interpreters are not. So the Bible can
be abused and misused as much as natural law. <BR>
<BR>
Now I am not arguing--and I know Lewis would not argue--that the Bible has
no role in the area of morality. But in a society that is not a theocracy
the Bible can never be the only standard of morality. The Christians who
lived during the American Founding recognized this fact, and their political
rhetoric was fashioned accordingly. They spoke regularly of the &quot;Laws
of Nature and Nature's God&quot; and of acting in accord with both &quot;reason
and revelation.&quot; They saw natural law as the necessary meeting point
for citizens of all religious beliefs.<SUP>29</SUP> Like the early American
Christians, Lewis recognized the inescapable need for natural law. Christians
today would do well to heed his advice.<BR>

in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious
of sin.&quot; [Romans 3: 19--20, NIV] Paul implicitly seems to include the
natural law in his discussion here. For he says that the law speaks to &quot;those
under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held
accountable to God.&quot; But the &quot;whole world&quot; obviously includes
the Gentiles as well as the Jews; and the only &quot;law &quot; they know

Now Lewis decided to start his allegory afresh by writing it in prose. Lewis
eventually titled his work <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and as the
title suggests, the work consciously echoed Bunyan&iacute;s <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s
Progress.</I> In fact, Lewis later described his own allegory as &quot;Bunyan
up to date.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">

</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Like the pilgrim Christian in Bunyan's tale, the pilgrim
in Lewis's story also seeks the celestial city. He just does not realize
that fact for most of the book. In the process of seeking personal fulfillment,
he stumbles into all kinds of intellectual, spiritual, and moral errors.

</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis wanted his story to satirize the false ideologies
and &quot;isms&quot; then rampant in western culture, especially the ideology
of materialism.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">4</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The reigning philosophy of twentieth century science and culture, materialism
decreed that everything--animals, human beings, moral beliefs, even reason
itself--could be explained as the result of purely physical processes and
properties. The roots of materialism reached back into into aniquity, but
the fearsome modern strain was born less than a century-and-a-half ago with
the writings of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche
and others.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">5</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Darwin was crucial, because he offered a scientific framework that promised
to explain morality and even reason as the product of purely natural processes.
He didn't really succeed in his grand design, but he set the research agenda
for those who came after him. Marx, in fact, wanted to dedicate <I>Das Kapital</I>
to Darwin, though Darwin declined the honor.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">6</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Ideas have consequences, and materialism's consequences
for western culture were particularly extensive and particularly poisonous
-- as the world was finding out even while Lewis started to write his book.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ORE than a thousand
miles away from where Lewis was on vacation, an old man stood weeping at
a train station. Desperately clutching his large sack filled with bread,
he pleaded with the station-master to let him on the train.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;You can go on the next train,&quot; the official
told the man, &quot;but not your bundle. Law is law--no bread can be transported
without a license.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;But how can I return to the village with empy hands?&quot;
cried the man. &quot;How shall I face the village? They await my return
and their bellies are empty.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">7 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The place was the Ukraine, where an eery emptiness was
settling on the villages and fields as famine spread during the summer of
1932. By the end of the next year, more than 7 million peasants had died
from starvation.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">8</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
This was a disaster made by man, not nature. The deaths were the result
of Joseph Stalin&iacute;s policy to subjugate the Ukrainian peasants and
force them into government-run collectives. Even while the peasants starved,
the Soviet government placed huge quantities of grain in domestic reserves
and exported an additional 800,000 tons of grain to other countries.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">9</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
As the famine worsened, villagers were prevented from travelling outside
their villages to seek help, turning the once-bountiful Ukraine into a giant
extermination camp.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The ruthless utopianism exhibited by Stalin was a natural
outgrowth of the materialist understanding of human nature. So were the
policies of the new regime rising in Germany. Even as the Ukrainian famine
reached its peak, German cabinet ministers were enacting sterilization laws
designed to weed out the &igrave;unfit&icirc; among their nation&iacute;s
citizenry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">10</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Within six years, the Nazis would set up killing centers to eliminate the
chronically ill and people with disabilities. It was in these euthanasia
centers that the techniques used to exterminate the Jews were developed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">11<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nor was the United States immune from the corrosive effects
of materialism. In 1932, Americans elected a buoyant new President who declared
in his subsequent inaugural address that &quot;There is nothing to fear
but fear itself.&quot; In the same inaugural speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
asked Congress to grant him extensive new executive powers and warned that
if Congress did not, he would unilaterally take the powers upon himself.
FDR&iacute;s subsequent &igrave;New Deal&icirc; gave hope to millions of
Americans suffering during the Great Depression, but it also layed the foundation
for a mammoth welfare state administered by experts from the social sciences&oacute;experts
who were increasingly dismissive of both moral absolutes and personal responsibility.
The impatience of social scientists with traditional morality could be seen
in the work of anthropologists like Margaret Mead, who had already published
her (now discredited) study of sexual mores in Samoa.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">12</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The denial of personal responsibility among social scientists was perhaps
most notable in the field of criminology. One criminology textbook published
in 1932 baldly stated: &quot;Man is no more 'responsible' for becoming wilful
and committing a crime than the flower for becoming red and fragrant. In
both instances the end products are predetermined by the nature of the protoplasm
and the chance of circumstances.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">13
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's attack on materialism thus came at a critical
juncture in world history. The time was ripe for someone to challenge the
materialist menace. Amazingly, Lewis finished a draft of <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s
Regress</I> by the end of his two-week vacation. It was finally published
in May 1933, the same month Hitler held a midnight bonfire in Germany for
20,000 books that went against the Nazi party line.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">14</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
It is unlikely that Lewis's book was among the books burned, but not because
Hitler would not have found it offensive. The Nazis show up in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;'
Regress</I> as dwarves who are vassals of Mr. Savage, a Nietzschean superman
who sits on a high chair &igrave;dressed in [animal] skins&icirc; and who
wears &igrave;an iron helmet on his head with horns stuck in it.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">15</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
That this was an unflattering portrait of national socialism is undeniable,
but the Nazis first had to know about Lewis&iacute;s book before they could
burn it, and I doubt they even had heard of it. Only 1,500 copies of Lewis&iacute;s
<I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I> had been printed, and alas, even these did
not sell very well. A few weeks after the book&iacute;s publication, Lewis
joked to Arthur Greeves that he expected <I>Pilgrims Regress </I>to be at
least as big a failure as his last book of poetry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">16</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
After three successive flops, Lewis must have wondered about his future
career as a writer.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet he kept writing. Eventually, he even became successful
at it, and he became one of the twentieth century&iacute;s most powerful
and prophetic voices on behalf of cultural sanity. Like Winston Churchill,
who stood alone against the Nazis when many turned a blind eye to their
evil, Lewis was one of a handful of voices in the wilderness to mount a
credible defense against the materialist onslaught during the first half
of our century. The argument he began in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I>
he continued in such books as <I>That Hideous Strength, The Abolition of
Man,</I> and <I>Miracles,</I> as well as in essays such as &quot;Behind
the Scenes,&quot; &quot;The Poison of Subjectivism,&quot; &quot;Bulverism,&quot;
&quot;Transposition,&quot; and &quot;Is Progress Possible? Willing Slaves
of the Welfare State&quot; The observations made in these writings are as
relevant for us today as when they were first written. Hitler and Stalin
may be dead, but the materialist philosophy that gave birth to them and
their regimes is not. Indeed, western society is still in the grip of at
least four of materialism&iacute;s most damning cultural legacies: the rejection
of reason and objective truth, the debunking of objective morality, the
denial of personal responsibility, and the encouragement of coercive utopianism.
Lewis has something to tell us about all four.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The Rejection of Reason and Objective
Truth</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ATERIALISM'S first
deadly legacy is the rejection of reason and objective truth. Nineteenth-century
materialists depicted our thoughts as the irrational products of environment
or heredity or brain chemistry. As a consequence, the intellectual classes
became convinced that only the reality was material, and thus the only true
explanations were reductive. If you wanted to explain a flower, you described
its cell structure, not its beauty. If you wanted to explain human beings,
you looked not to their greatest achievements, but to the raw materials
that made them up. As Leo Strauss put it, modern thought tried to &quot;understand
the higher in terms of the lower: the human in terms of the subhuman, the
rational in terms of the subrational&#133;&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">17
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One possible result of the denial of reason is that people
will become so skeptical that they will believe in nothing. But most people
cannot live without <I>something</I> to give meaning to their lives. Thus,
the ultimate consequence of denying reason is not nihilism but a leap into
irrationality. The philosopher Nietzsche foresaw this at the end of the
last century. If objective truth was dead, the only thing that could save
us from the abyss according to Nietzsche was to create our own meaning by
a sheer act of willpower. We <I>will</I> ourselves into believing something
that will give us meaning. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the Nietzschean cosmos, what is prized is not truth,
but creativity, freshness, and power: Whoever is strong enough or creative
enough to impose his vision on other people is the hero. In many respects,
we live in Nietzsche&iacute;s universe. The highest praise of a work of
art or a piece of scholarship in today&iacute;s society is not that it is
true, but that it is &igrave;fresh&icirc; or &igrave;original.&icirc; When
one looks at what passes for scholarship today&oacute;the paradigm approach
in the sciences, deconstruction in literature, and the more extreme forms
of ethnic and gender studies&oacute;it becomes readily apparent that most
scholars have given up even the pretense of seeking objective truth. What
they are concerned about is power&oacute;how long their particular ideology
will control the terms of debate. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The first step to extricating ourselves from this morass
is to understand the fallacies of the materialistic reductionism led to
it, and Lewis can help us do this.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s first sustained attack on reductionism
came in<I> The Pilgrim's Regress. </I>The core of his critique comes in
book three, &quot;Through Darkest Zeitgeistheim,&quot; which literally means
through the darkest abode of the Spirit of the Age. In the book, John&oacute;the
name of Lewis&iacute;s pilgrim&oacute;is arrested by the flunkies of a giant
who symbolizes the materialistic reductionism that was the Spirit of the
Age. John is subsequently jailed, leading to a nightmarish sequence. Lewis
relates that the eyes of the giant had the property of making whatever they
looked on transparent: &quot;Consequently, when John looked around into
the dungeon he retreated from his fellow prisoners in terror, for the place
seemed to be thronged with demons. A woman was seated near him, but he did
not know it was a woman, because, through the face, he saw the skull and
through that the brains and the passages of the nose, and the larynx, and
the saliva moving in the glands and the blood in the veins&#133; And when
he averted his eyes from her they fell on an old man, and this was worse
for the old man had a cancer. And when John sat down and drooped his head,
not to see the horrors, he saw only the working of his own inwards&#133;
and suddenly he fell on his face and thrust his hands into his eyes and
cried out, &euml;It is the black hole&#133; I am mad. I am dead. I am in
hell for ever.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">18 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">John is ultimately rescued from this dungeon by a towering
woman in blue -- Lady Reason, who slays the materialist giant with her sword.
Lady Reason tells John that the giant had deceived him about the real nature
of human beings: </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;He
showed you by a trick what our inwards <I>would</I> look like if they were
visible&#133; But in the real world our inwards are invisible. They are
not colored shapes at all, they are feelings. The warmth in your limbs at
this moment, the sweetness of your breath as you draw it in, the comfort
in your belly because we breakfasted well, and your hunger for the next
meal&oacute;these are the reality; all the sponges and tubes that you saw
in the dungeon are the lie.&icirc;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;But if I cut a man open I should see them in
him,&icirc; replied John.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;A man cut open,&quot; returned the Lady, &igrave;is,
so far, not a man: and if you did not sew him up speedily you would be seeing
not organs, but death. I am not denying that death is ugly: but the giant
made you believe that life is ugly.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">19<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's point was that reductionism really doesn't explain
that which is <I>human</I> at all. In fact, in the name of explaining man,
reductionism explains him away. As Lewis later wrote: &quot;You cannot go
on 'seeing through' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something
is to see something through it&#133; If you see through everything, then
everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible
world. To see through all things is the same as not to see.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">20
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In a wonderful 1956 essay titled &quot;Behind the Scenes,&quot;
Lewis articulated his own view of the proper relation between man and his
material components. He likened life to a stage play. In one sense, nothing
in the play is real. It is all imaginery. It is not really set in the countryside,
the people on stage are not really who they pretend to be. The only realities
are the physical sets and costumes and lighting. The play is &quot;appearance&quot;
and the sets are &quot;reality.&quot; Yet, as Lewis points out, &igrave;in
the theatre of course the play, the appearance, is the thing. All the backstage
realities exist only for its sake and are valuable only in so far as they
promote it.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">21<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis here was calling us back to a teleological view
of the universe of the sort offered by Aristotle. According to Aristotle,
you understand something not by what it came from, but by what it has become.
We understand what an oak trees is not by dissecting an acorn but by examining
a fully grown oak tree. Similarly, we understand human beings by who they
are as an integrated whole, not by trying to break them down into their
material or psychological building blocks. When we do look at the subrational,
we ought to judge it in light of the overall purpose of a whole human being.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The materialist may scoff at this approach, but as Lewis
relished in pointing out, the materialist has his own problems: For the
materialist who debunks everyone else&iacute;s ideas as the subrational
products of their brain chemistry or environment cannot avoid being debunked
himself. If he is honest, says Lewis, the materialist will have to admit
that his <I>own</I> ideas are merely the &igrave;epiphenomenon which accompanies
chemical or electrical events in a cortex which is itself the by-product
of a blind evolutionary process.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">22</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The point Lewis is driving at is that if all thoughts are merely the products
of non-rational causes, this includes the materialist&iacute;s own thoughts.
In other words, there is no reason according to materialism for materialism
itself to be regarded as true.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even people who try to water down their materialism by
granting that reason can be a valid way to truth have a problem, according
to Lewis. For if the universe is how the materialist describes it, it is
not at all likely that reason should have ever developed. &igrave;People
who take [the materialist view],&icirc; explained Lewis, &igrave;think that
matter and space just happen to exist, and always have existed, nobody knows
why; and that the matter, behaving in certain fixed ways, has just happened,
by sort of a fluke, to produce creatures like ourselves who are able to
think. By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce
the planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for
life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so
some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series
of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">23</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In sum, materialists have no ground to stand on if they
deny the reality of reason outright, and very little ground to stand on
if they claim to accept reason in part.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The Debunking of</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">Objective Morality</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">C</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">LOSELY related to
materialism's attack on reason is its debunking of objective morality, which
is its second sorry legacy. Materialists early in our century denied the
existence of objective standards binding on all cultures, claiming that
environment dictated our moral beliefs. Such relativism was uncritically
adopted by much of the social sciences, and it still undergirds much of
modern economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. In the words
of a college sociology text popular in the 1980s, &igrave;We must recognize
that judgments about good and bad, moral and immoral, depend very much on
who is doing the judging; there is no universal standard to appeal to.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">24
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The triumph of moral relativism has been particularly
evident in our colleges and universities, many of which are populated by
social scientists who berate us for our rampaging &quot;ethnocentrism,&quot;
our unmitigated arrogance in believing that our &quot;values&icirc; might
somehow be &quot;right.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Gone is the old undergraduate curriculum with its heaping
doses of the Bible, of Plutarch's <I>Lives</I> and Aristotle&iacute;s <I>Ethics;</I>
in its place is an unrelenting parade of the horrors culled from the cultures
of barbarians. Students used to study the great moments in the history of
Western civilization; now they learn about the cannibalism of tribes in
South America, or the sexual proclivities of some obscure race in the South
Pacific. The point of such lessons, of course, is to &igrave;broaden&icirc;
students&iacute; horizons sufficiently so that they will no longer believe
that their &igrave;values&icirc; are sacrosanct. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Exposed to this message for four years, even the most
sturdy students are apt to become infected. And those who do not succumb
from the disease will likely find themselves incapacitated. I recall having
breakfast with a friend who was about to obtain a degree in one of the social
sciences from a large secular university. Our discussion was wide ranging,
but when the subject of morality came up she became curiously bewildered.
Taught for years that moral beliefs are a function of culture and personal
predilections, she maintained that there were no objective grounds to justify
moral judgments against other cultures. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;What about the Nazis?&quot; I asked.&quot;Surely
we have an objective basis to condemn what <I>they</I> did?&quot; She thought
a moment, looked more bewildered than ever, and then answered to the effect
that she was personally revolted by what the Nazis did&oacute;but she could
still find no objective basis for her revulsion.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis attacked moral relativism in his opening chapters
of <I>Mere Christianity,</I> where he pointed out that all people&oacute;even
criminals&oacute;appeal to a universal standard when trying to excuse their
own behavior. And even those who claim that right and wrong are mere conventions
will hotly protest when someone wrongs them! Lewis&iacute;s line of argument
here is similar to that presented by Augustine in his <I>Expositions on
the Book of Psalms</I>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">25</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
However, Lewis&iacute;s most sustained assault on moral relativism comes
not in <I>Mere Christianity</I> but in <I>The Abolition of Man, </I>a small
incisive volume based on lectures he delivered at the University of Durham
in the early 1940s. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In <I>Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis pointed out that we
cannot escape making moral judgments. Every action presupposes a goal toward
which the actor acts, and the goal (no matter how clinically it is expressed)
represents a judgment of value. We cannot exist without making moral judgments,
argued Lewis. The only question is what those judgments will be. Speaking
within the western natural law tradition, Lewis proposed that at the foundation
of all moral judgments is one set of ethical first principles shared by
all human beings. These first principles include obligations to treat other
people justly and to keep one&iacute;s promises. It from these first principles
that all other moral judgments and ethical systems are derived. Strictly
speaking, these first principles cannot be demonstrated themselves, for
they are the first principles from which everything else is demonstrated.
One recognizes them in the same way that one intuitively knows that 2+2=4,
or that if a=b, and b=c, then a=c. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But what about the social scientists&iacute; claim that
different cultures have had radically different moral codes? In the face
of these differences, how can Lewis maintain that human beings have access
to a moral common ground? Lewis responds with typical candor in an essay
titled &igrave;The Poison of Subjectivism&icirc;:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">The answer [to the claim that cultures radically
differ on their moral codes] is that this is a lie&oacute;a good, solid,
resounding lie. If a man will go into a library and spend a few days with
the <I>Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</I> he will soon discover the
massive unanimity of the practical reason in man. From the Babylonian <I>Hymn
to Samos,</I> from the Laws of Manu, the <I>Book of the Dead,</I> the Analects,
the Stoics, the Platonists, from Austrialism aborigines&#133; he will collect
the same triumphantly monotonous denunciations of oppression, murder, treachery,
and falsehood, the same injunctions of kindness to the aged, the young,
and the weak, of almsgiving and impartiality and honesty&#133; There are,
of course, differences. There are even blindnesses in particular cultures&oacute;just
as there are savages who cannot count up to twenty. But the pretence that
we are presented with a mere chaos&oacute;though no outline of universally
accepted value shows through&oacute;is simply false&#133;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">26
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Those who want to explore this topic further can read
the appendix to <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> where Lewis has helpfully compiled
many of the common moral maxims held across cultures and across history.

<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">I</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">F materialism has
been hard on reason and morality, it has been equally destructive of personal
responsibility, which is its third poisonous legacy. By claiming that human
thoughts and actions are dictated by our biology and environment, materialism
undermined personal responsibility. The results can be seen in our criminal
justice system, our civil justice system, and even our welfare system. Ever
since sin entered the world, human beings have sought excuses for their
behavior, but materialism handed us an inexhaustible supply of excuses.
No matter what we do, it can be attributed to a cause other than our own
choices: our social environment, our subconscious drives, our brain chemistry.
An article a few years ago titled &igrave;Roots of Crime&icirc; told about
a researcher who was testing juvenile delinquents&iacute; hair in order
to prove that their violent behavior was the result of vitamin deficiencies.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">27</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
In this new scheme of things, even Hitler can be excused for his crimes,

unconscious drives.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">28 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Against this modern ethic that no one is responsible,
Lewis strove to make people aware of just how responsible they really are.
Lewis&iacute;s defense of personal responsibility was undergirded by his
commitment to Christianity. The Christian gospel proclaims salvation only
to those who recognize themselves as guilty people in need of divine forgiveness.
But materialism offers modern man a whole slew of methods to avoid facing
our guilt. If nothing is our fault, then what is there to be guilty about?
Lewis countered this mentality not so much by direct disputation, but by
trying to place a miror in front of us that would cause us to recognize
the evil in our own souls. This is most apparent in his fictional works,
where there are key moments of self-revelation when major characters realize
that they are really to blame for the fix they are in.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the novel <I>That Hideous Strength</I>, Mark Studdock
is a young sociologist who has spent his life cravenly currying favor with
others in order to promote himself. When he subsequently finds himself in
the middle of a totalitarian conspiracy, he first wonders what bad luck
put him there. &igrave;Why had he such a rotten heredity?&icirc; he whined
to himself. &igrave;Why had his education been so ineffective? Why was the
system of society so irrational? Why was his luck so bad?&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">29</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">

is and how his own choices led him to the mess he was in. <BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One cannot read Lewis&iacute;s fiction without being
convicted of the fact that we are more accountable than we would like to
think. Lewis calls us to responsibility by reminding us that every action
has a consequence, and that no wrong choice&oacute;however small&oacute;is
insignificant. As Uncle Screwtape tells his demon nephew Wormwood in <I>The
Screwtape Letters</I>: &igrave;The safest road to Hell is the gradual one&oacute;the

of materialism is coercive utopianism. Although the belief that all thought

power of human beings to reshape their world, materialism in fact inspired
a fierce strain of coercive utopianism. Claiming either that they were merely
the servants of the forces of materialism&oacute;or with Nietzsche, that

reformers tried to create secular utopias in Russia and Germany. In America,

<FONT FACE="Times">The coercive utopians in Germany and Russia were both
targets of Lewis&iacute;s scorn. Unlike many intellectuals of his time who
hated one form of totalitarianism only to embraced another, Lewis abhorred

of coercive utopianism about which Lewis was concerned. Tyranny comes in
many forms, most of which are more subtle than Stalin&iacute;s gulag or
Hitler&iacute;s death camps. Lewis knew this, and his most compelling writings
for us today focus on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular,
Lewis feared that the modern welfare state would become ever more intrusive
as government planners allied themselves with the tools of materialist social
science.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If people act because of environmental and biological
necessities, as the materialists claim, the government no longer need deal
with them as free moral agents. Under the new system, preemption replaces
punishment as the preferred method of social control. Instead of punishing
you for making the wrong choice (which was the traditional method), the
state simply eliminates your choice. Instead of laws telling us to wear
seat-belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
the car seat. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes are
automatically deducted from our paychecks. Instead of holding us responsible
for the correct use of any number of helpful&oacute;but potentially hazardous&oacute;products,
the government simply prevents those products from reaching the market.
In the hands of the social planners, the nation is their laboratory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s painted a grim portrait of this kind of
despotism in his novel <I>That Hideous Strength. </I>There the spirit of
modern social science becomes incarnate in something called the National
Institute for Coordinated Experiments&oacute;NICE, for short. Of course,
there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists are exactly the
type of technocrats that Lewis feared. In the name of science and humanity,
they claimed the right to remake society without bothering to obtain society&iacute;s
consent&oacute;let alone the consent of the individuals involved.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">While we are a long way off from the nightmare vision
depicted by Lewis in <I>That Hideous Strength,</I> we certainly should be
able to understand some of what he&iacute;s getting at. For public policy
decisions in our country are increasingly made precisely by the type of
unelected experts that Lewis talked about. During the past three decades
our legislators have transferred much of their authority to a vast array
of independent regulatory agencies staffed by unelected experts who are
largely unaccountable to average citizens. Environmental policy is a good
example. Decisions about how&oacute;and whether&oacute;to save certain endangered
species are made not by elected officials, but by government biologists
and bureaucrats. Decisions about whether we can have fires in our fireplaces
are made not by elected officials but by professional bureaucrats specializing
in air quality. Now some of these decisions we may well applaud; some we
may not. But the fact remains that we&oacute;and those we elect&oacute;have
very little to say in the matter. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But, you may ask, what&iacute;s wrong with that? Surely
it is better for experts to make decisions about these things than the average
voter or politician? After all, don&iacute;t today&iacute;s increasingly
complicated problems demand that we hand over the reins of power to the
experts?<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis didn&iacute;t think so. He did not dispute that
technocrats have plenty of knowledge; this knowledge may even be necessary
for good public policy. But it is not <I>sufficient</I> for good public
policy. Political problems are preeminently moral problems, according to
Lewis, and technocrats are not equipped to function as moralists. &igrave;I
dread specialists in power,&icirc; he said, &igrave;because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man&iacute;s opinion no added value.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">32<BR>

<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ORE than five decades
after the publication of <I>That Hideous Strength, </I>more than six decades
after the publication of <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and more than
thirty years after C. S. Lewis&iacute;s death, we still live in the shadow
of what George Gilder calls &igrave;the materialist superstition.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">33</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Lewis was a prophet, but it takes more than a prophet to make a revolution.
Yet a prophet can prepare the way for a revolution, and Lewis helped do
that.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">At the end of <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis called
for a new natural philosophy that would understand human beings as they
really are, not try to reduce them to automatons or guinea pigs. &quot;When
it explained,&quot; said Lewis, &quot;it would not explain away. When it
spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the <I>It</I>
it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the <I>Thou.</I>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">34
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis was not quite sure what he was asking for, and
-- being a realist -- he certainly was not convinced that the revolution
would actually come about. Yet during the next decade it just might. We
live during an era of tremendous and tumultuous change, and nowhere is the
tumult more evident than in the sciences. Recent developments in biology,
physics, and cognitive science are raising serious doubts about the most
fundamental assumptions of materialism. In biology, scientists are discovering
such irreducible complexity in biological systems that the only reasonable
explanation seems to be a non-material designer. In physics, our understanding
of matter is becoming increasingly non-material. In cognitive science, efforts
to reduce mind to the physical processes of the brain have failed repeatedly.
Even in social sciences such as psychology researchers are beginning to
question their materialist assumptions and rebuild their disciplines on
foundations more conducive to human dignity and personal responsibility.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">35
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In other words, for perhaps the first time since the
materialist onslaught we have an opportunity to bring about the collapse
of materialism and to re-found the sciences along the lines envisioned by
C. S. Lewis more than half-a-century ago. For the sake of cultural sanity
--and survival -- let us hope that we succeed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>in the Film &quot;Shadowlands&quot; </CENTER>

<P>It is understandable why the film<I> Shadowlands</I> (now available on
videotape) won rave reviews from almost everybody. The acting is splendid,
the script is literate, and the production design is first-rate. All things
considered, the film is a wonderful piece of cinema and well worth seeing.
For those of us who never had the rare privilege of meeting C. S. Lewis
in person, <I>Shadowlands</I> brings Lewis and his world to life in a new
way.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, despite its beauty and its pathos, <I>Shadowlands</I> is not
without major failings in the realm of accuracy. Unfortunately, many people
seem to take at face value the film's opening claim that &quot;this is a
true story.&quot; The reviewer for <I>Christianity Today</I>, for instance,
wrote that although &quot;the filmmakers have taken some liberties with
facts&#133;and simplified some of Lewis&iacute;s complex musings&#133; the
film is generally true to Lewis's life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As a matter of fact, it isn't. The names of the principal characters are
the same, but much of the plot has been contrived to fit the point of view
of scriptwriter William Nicholson.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not complaining about the numerous small inaccuracies. I expected those.
After all, it doesn't really matter that Joy had two sons instead of one
(though it might matter if you were the son who was left out). Nor does
it really matter that the marriage between Joy and Jack went on a lot longer
than the film indicates (more than three years in reality). Such errors
are minor and certainly fall within the domain of legitimate dramatic license.
<BR>
<BR>
What is more difficult to accept are the two huge errors on which the whole
plot seems to hinge.<BR>
<BR>
The first of these errors is the depiction of Lewis's life before he met
Joy. The film portrays Lewis as leading a cloistered existence in which
he avoided women, children, and --above all-- commitments to any relationship
or situation that offered him the potential for risk or pain. This depiction
of Lewis is a convenient way to set up him up for the film's subsequent
love story. But the portrayal invents a C. S. Lewis who never existed. <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the storyline of the film, Lewis had lived a life that was anything
but cloistered or free from pain or commitment. During World War I, the
supposedly cloistered Lewis served in the trenches in France, where he was
wounded in action. After the war, the supposedly sexless Lewis apparently
became infatuated with Mrs. Moore, a widow old enough to be his mother.
When the affair ended and Lewis became a Christian, Lewis the uncommitted
somehow felt obliged to support Mrs. Moore for the rest of her life, and
she lived with Lewis and his brother until she had to be moved to a rest
home (where he visited her every day). Meanwhile, the Lewis who did not
associate with children had three children come and stay with him during
World War II (they had been sent out of London because of the air raids
(just like Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy in the <I>Lion, the Witch, and
the Wardrobe</I>). Similarly, the Lewis who supposedly avoided women also
developed a close friendship with English poetess Ruth Pitter; he even told
a friend that were he the kind of man to get married, he would marry her!
And the Lewis who walked through life without painful experiences had to
deal with his rejection by Oxford's academic community, which never saw
fit to select this brilliant scholar for a professorship (Cambridge finally
did in the 1950s). <BR>
<BR>
The second huge error of the film is its suggestion that Lewis's faith in
God was undermined by Joy's death. While the film shows grief-torn Lewis
saying (quite tentatively) to his stepson that he still believes in heaven,
there is little indication in the film that Lewis still believes in a loving
God. Indeed, in an outburst before his friends, Lewis is shown railing at
the brutality of a God who acts as cosmic vivisectionist. Although this
scene is invented (Lewis&iacute;s grief was intensely private), the speech
against God that William Nicholson puts in Lewis's mouth is actually inspired
from a passage in Lewis's <I>A Grief Observed.</I> The problem is that Nicholson
is slipshod in the thoughts he chooses to lift from Lewis: He appropriates
Lewis's struggles from <I>A Grief Observed</I> but doesn't bother to give
any sense of the reaffirmation of faith found in the rest of that book --
or in the many other letters, interviews, and articles by Lewis during the
rest of his life. It seems that Mr. Nicholson wasn't interested in portraying
an orthodox Christian who experienced intense grief and yet maintained both
his faith and his intellect. <BR>
<BR>
Here is where the pernicious aspect of <I>Shadowlands</I> becomes evident.
Lewis's writings -- including his intimate confessions in <I>A Grief Observed</I>
--were largely efforts to vindicate God's often unfathomable ways to man.
Lewis sought to remove the obstacles that separate us from a living relationship
with the One who truly loves us. <I>Shadowlands</I> does precisely the opposite
by setting up Lewis's faith as a straw man and then proceeding to knock
it down. <BR>
<BR>
The film repeatedly shows Lewis delivering a simplistic speech about how
God uses painful experiences to make us listen to Him. The facile confidence
with which Lewis delivers the speech is gradually contrasted with personal
hell he goes through during Joy's sickness and eventual death. By the end
of the film, Lewis has presumably recognized that his simplistic theological
dogmas won't wash. He doesn't find God in suffering; he finds a silent void.
Thus is the most cogent defender of Christian orthodoxy of the twentieth
century transformed into a modern champion of anguished doubt.<BR>
<BR>
I tend to think that most people who view <I>Shadowlands</I> will overlook
the underlying contempt the film displays for Lewis's faith because Lewis
is portrayed so sympathetically. And make no mistake: Despite the biographical
inaccuracies mentioned above, Lewis <I>is</I> portrayed sympathetically.
This film is not anti-Lewis. But perhaps that is because the villain in
this story is not Lewis, but God. <BR>
<BR>
The great irony of <I>Shadowlands </I>is that it even as it draws people
closer to Lewis, it may drive them further away from the One in whom Lewis
found the meaning of life. What a tragedy it would be if those who see the
film come away thinking that Lewis's earlier faith was somehow refuted by
reality. Mind you, I am not claiming that this <I>will</I> be the result
of <I>Shadowlands</I>. One can only speculate about the effect of the film
on individual viewers, and this sort of speculation is rather dubious anyway.
I can only suggest that given the film's script that some viewers may conclude
that Lewis's defense of Christianity could not stand the scrutiny of real
life. <BR>
<BR>
There is another possibility, of course: The film may inspire those who
see it to read Lewis's writings for themselves and discover the reality
of the faith to which he pointed. I hope that this second possibility will
turn out to be the reality.

What should  have been a &quot;shakeout&quot; of corporate and regulatory practices  that block the way to genuine competition has turned out to be a <I>shakedown</I>  of potential entrants by government regulators favoring an established  clientele.</P>  <P>Two questions: (1) How is it that a pervasive regulatory process has  become the controlling factor in the most dynamic and potentially most  competitive industry in our economy? And (2), Given Congress's stated purpose  in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to prevent current regulatory constraints  from interfering with the transition to a dynamic and competitive set of  markets how has this increase in regulation happened?</P>  <P>There is a short answer to the second question. As President Ford once  said to me, the worse the regulation, the less likely it will change; and  since this is not only the most pervasive but also the worst regulation,  the answergiven the activities of the Federal Communications Commission  and the 50 state regulatory commissionscould be that the service offerings  of the telecommunication companies are fixed in their current form at their  current prices.</P>  <P>But the &quot;short answer&quot; is unacceptable (because, among other  things, it ends this essay). In order to continue, we need to consider  another answer. Looking further into the experimental aftermath of the  1996 Act will help us see if we can predict an outbreak of new services,  and new revenue-sources, from competitors new and old. To make this step,  we should focus on history and be clear on how we got here. We are here  because of the AT&amp;T divestiture of 1984, the Telecommunications Act  of 1996 and, most recently, the FCC's First Report and Order of August  1996.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>From Divestiture to the FCC's August Ruling</I></B></P>  <P>Until 1984, AT&amp;T enjoyed a monopoly which was franchised and price-regulated  by the federal and state regulatory agencies, in return for which it provided  end-to-end universal service.</P>  <P>The overwhelmingly large share of AT&amp;T's activities were devoted  to providing basic local service, at monthly charges that covered direct  operating costs, while vertical (add-on) services, local toll and interstate  toll were provided at per-call prices sufficiently in excess of direct  costs to develop profit margins high enough to pay for the infrastructure.</P>  <P>Over the previous 12 years, long-distance revenues tripledbut at least  half of this increase was paid contributions to cover the overhead costs  of the entire local and long-distance system. As in numerous other markets,  regulated or unregulated, these rising revenues became an attraction to  other potential long-distance carriersones who were without such &quot;requirements&quot;  to provide for the infrastructure of a lattice of local networks.</P>  <P>At the same time, new transport technologies (such as microwave) enabled  the entry of specialized carriers into lucrative long-distance markets.  AT&amp;T's aggressive responsesincluding delays in providing interconnection,  selective price-cuts, and the promotion of new regulatory barriersprovoked  the antitrust proceeding that resulted in divestiture of the company's  local exchange from its long-distance operations.</P>  <P>The local exchange carriers of AT&amp;T were put together into seven  regional operating companies, each offering local exchange and local tolls  in its region only, under the continuing jurisdiction of the federal and  state commissions for rates and service. But the focus of the new policy  was on long-distance. Here the downsized AT&amp;T would face reduced regulation  and regulation with a new purpose, to operate so as to develop open competition  in these markets. Indeed, the CEO of AT&amp;T and the head of the antitrust  division both promised that the development of competition would lead to  genuine deregulation in long-distance.</P>  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>From 1984 to 1996, we had a full 12-year dose of collective  agency decisions. This policy process has not resulted in long-distance  markets becoming competitive.</B><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>  <P>The policy process for generating such competition in long-distance  was unique. The antitrust court, the Justice Department and the FCC were  to make collective decisions for the long-distance carriers on entry, service-offerings,  and pricing. They were to decide what carriers could offer which specific  services at tariff-certified rates. Entry into long-distance would be open  to all comers, except it was not to be allowed by the FCC to the now-divested  Bell operating companies. Competition ideally would come from new facilities-based  long-distance carriers; but since there were none, it would have to come  from the expansion of MCI and Sprint, along with whichever independents  and resellers come over the transom.</P>  <P>From 1984 to 1996, we had a full 12-year dose of collective agency decisions.  This policy process has not resulted in long-distance markets becoming  competitive.</P>  <P>The tariffing of AT&amp;T's prices, as worked out by the FCC, made it  easy for the other two major carriers to follow the leader, so that, by  the late 1980s, MCI and Sprint were matching but not undercutting AT&amp;T's  prices. As market-concentration in revenue-shares continued to decline,  or particularly as AT&amp;T's share continued to decrease, the price-cost  margins of all three companies increased.</P>  <P>This was most striking in message toll services (MTS) where margins  rose from 50% to 70%, as the HHI concentration index fell by almost that  much <A HREF="footnote.html">(footnote 1</A>). These countertrends were  pervasive in Inbound WATS as well as Outbound WATS . All three carriers  now enjoy price-cost margins exceeding 70% for almost all services <A   HREF="footnote.html">(footnote 2)</A>. This level of marginthe same as  for AT&amp;T before divestitureis the highest in any industry I know of,  despite the fact that AT&amp;T at least continues to yield market-share.</P>  <P>The economic term used to describe such behavior is &quot;tacit collusion  in oligopoly.&quot; In business terms, this results from a strategy that  focuses on earnings, rather than share, in market conditions where a company  can count on the other major suppliers doing the same.</P>  <P>With the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress again attempted to  inject competition into long-distance markets, this time by fostering entry  of an extremely important group of potential new long-distance carriers  left out by the antitrust divestiture. The Act attempts to make a difference,  explicitly, by permitting the local Bell operating companies (previously  excluded from providing long-distance service) to offer those services  now provided for the most part by AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.</P>  <P>But the Act has two provisions that more strictly regulate those potential  entrants. First, it requires them to demonstrate that their own local exchange  markets are competitive before they can enter long-distance. Second, and  perhaps fatally, it places the FCC in charge of the process for certifying  that those local markets have become competitive.</P>  <P>Welcome to the &quot;shakedown&quot; phase, in which the first line  of potential competitors in long-distance must pay &quot;rebate,&quot;  by fostering entry into their own markets.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Competitors, Yes; Competitiveness, No</I></B></P>  <P>To begin to regulate as required by the Telecommunications Act, the  FCC issued its First Report and Order in August 1996. In more than 940  pages, it sets out how local competition will be achieved. The theory is  that competition in local exchange, which has to come first, will result  from new local carriers using parts of the system networks of the incumbent  operating companies. Such &quot;attachment&quot; might not be the permanent  state, but it is at least the initial state of this competitive market  structure.</P>  <P>Note how this breaks new ground in deregulatory experiments. After all,  new airlines, or gas pipelines or railroads, did not &quot;attach&quot;  themselves to existing networks.</P>  <P>To make this possible, the FCC has sought to anticipate every type of  contract agreement on attachment between entrant and incumbent, and to  set &quot;guidelines&quot; on the technical nature as well as prices for  service resulting from attachment at the loop, the switch or the line.  The guidelines are to be used for all attachment agreements between entrant  and incumbent to be approved by state regulatory agencies.</P>  <P>In the event of a breakdown in contract negotiations, the guidelines  themselves are the required terms and conditions that the state agencies  have to use when they write the contracts. In that case, the incumbent  carrier turns itself over to the state agency-to provide to entrants &quot;available  telephone, service-interval information and maintenance histories [so that]  competing carriers [do not] operate at a significant disadvantage.&quot;</P>  <P>One must be in awe of an FCC that states that it will specify the terms  on which any new local carrier attaches to the loop, switch, trunk or tandem  of any incumbent carrier anywhere in the fifty states. The Commission's  confidence that it can replace private decision-making in millions of different  transactions is impressive, particularly when it is intended that the result  be &quot;competition&quot; between attacher and attachee.</P>  <P>Indeed, that the Commission is proceeding this way in order to establish  competition in place of regulation is confounding. The extent of regulation  required to carry out the commission's procedure is far greater than ever  before. Since Adam Smith's time, competition has never been established  by forcing an incumbent supplier to attach potential competitors to its  system. The only way that a market structure so shared can be made stable  is by the regulator setting the terms so that the regulatory system itself  ends up providing financial support for the attachees.</P>  <P>The FCC's First Order in fact does call for abundant subsidies to be  provided to entrants into local exchange. For attachment at the loop, switch,  or trunk, the incumbent is required to set prices determined by its total  element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) for that network element. TELRIC  is a figment of an imaginary scenario in which the <BR>  incumbent operating company theoretically replaces its existing equipment  entirely with new equipment based on the latest technology.</P>  <P>The companies are doing no such thing. Rather, they are more or less  the current product of old and new technologies, with current marginal  operating costs only approaching TELRIC to the limited extent a company  network is made over. But that does not matter, for TELRIC is to be used  as the basis for prices in order to &quot;prevent incumbent local exchange  carriers from exploiting their market power at the expense of their competitors  that are dependent on the incumbent's facilities.&quot; The Commission  believes competitive prices will result.</P>  <P>Yet, given that TELRIC is below current marginal costs for incumbent  carriers, TELRIC prices will be below competitive prices for network parts.  By requiring TELRIC prices, the FCC is indirectly providing a subsidy to  prop up entrants by as much as one-third of competitive price. This cannot  be an accident, given that the FCC comes to the same result in its &quot;guidelines&quot;  for the wholesale prices for bundled services the incumbent must now offer  the entrant.</P>  <P>As entrants, AT&amp;T and MCI can request that the local operating company  provide to them a complete local exchange service, which they will resell  as part of their package of local and long-distance offerings. The price  for that local service is required to be set at the incumbent operating  company's retail price for the same service minus the &quot;avoided costs&quot;  of that part of its retail function foregone at wholesale.</P>  <P>However, what the Commission defines as &quot;avoided&quot; includes  not only the billing and advertising costs associated with retail-only  services, but also indirect, shared costs and even so-called &quot;profits.&quot;  Loading on those overhead costs results in a retail-to-wholesale discount  of 17 to 25%, which is twice too much to reflect the actual costs avoided.  The entrants will enjoy a 50% price-cost margin at retail on resale of  the incumbents' local exchanges.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Two Questions,Two Sets of Stocks</I></B></P>  <P>The FCC's First Report was just the first of three. The Commission plans  to set out two more parts of the regulatory structure in two more 900-page  Orders. They will set the price structure at retail for the Bell operating  companies in their local markets.</P>  <P>These FCC Reports all have to be completed and put into effect before  the FCC authorizes operating-company entry into long-distance. After all,  such entry into long-distance markets is the operating companies' goal.  With current consumer prices three times costs at the margin on long-distance,  that is where the profit opportunity is.</P>  <P>What is the timing of these steps by which entry is to be allowed? It  is only possible after the FCC issues its second and third reports, to  set guidelines for universal service and pricing structures in, again,  local service markets.</P>  <P>But, on October 15, the St. Louis Federal Court of Appeals issued a  stay in the implementation of the First Order, on grounds that there was  cause to believe that the FCC had improperly extended its jurisdiction  to cover that of the state agencies under the 1996 Act. Only after this  appeal is heard, and decided, and appealed to the Supreme Court, will all  three FCC Orders have been completed.</P>  <P>Then the Commission might certify that local service is sufficiently  competitive for local carriers to be allowed to enter long-distance markets.  But even this finding might not be enough, for the FCC also has to be convinced  of a &quot;public interest&quot; in allowing such entry.</P>  <P>Anyone familiar with regulatory agency procedures in the network industries  needs only to know two things to determine the final results for long-distance  markets. The first is: In which company's interests are FCC decisions being  made?</P>  <P>The First Report and Order emasculates the earnings from local services  in unbundled network elements and in wholesale bundles to be provided by  the Bell operating companies to the long-distance carriers. So the answer  has to be the three large long-distance carriers: They will benefit from  too-low local exchange service wholesale prices. Meanwhile those that do  not benefitthe local carriersby protesting, in order to delay having to  offer these prices, are kept out of the lucrative long-distance markets.  This also benefits the long-distance carriers.</P>  <P>Indeed, that the Commission serves the long-distance carriers is the  assessment of those who know best investors in the common shares of the  telecommunications companies. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the  FCC First Report and Order have affected telecommunications stock prices  in ways that indicate just such a reality.</P>  <P>When the Act was signed into law, the common stock of both operating  companies and long-distance carriers generally increased in value. That  was not surprising. Institutional investors optimistically believed that  removing regulatory barriers to entry in all markets would give rise to  a more competitive environment, which would lead to more rapid innovation  and greater revenue growth. On balance, even though competition brings  lower prices, its presence and the absence of regulation would have a positive  effect on earnings in the telecommunications sector generally (as has deregulation  in surface transportation, natural gas, etc.).</P>  <P>On August 1, when the Commission circulated the First Report and Order,  the picture began to change. From that point through mid-October, the share  prices of the Bell operating companies declined by close to 7%, or nearly  $16 billion, as compared to a 6% increase in the S&amp;P 500, and an 8%  gain in the prices of non-U.S. telecommunication stocks.</P>  <P>The operating-company response will likely be to cut back capital spending-spending  that will not be picked up by the large long-distance carriers on local  exchange capacity. Why should they pick it up, as long as they can buy  wholesale services at the TELRIC-based deep-discount prices? As long as  the Commission uses the new interconnection rules to create a profitable  arbitrage opportunity to resellers, investment in network capacity will  be curtailed. A forecast of five years of no change is not disproved by  the first finding.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Innovation Takes The Hit</I></B></P>  <P>The second question to answer then becomes critical: Will advanced network  technologies provide a route around these regulatory obstructions? After  all, Federal Express used computer information and new air traffic network  systems to invent services that could not be regulated by the Interstate  Commerce Commission and Postal Rate Commission; it was not long before  these agencies became substantially irrelevant to the forward development  of surface transportation. Could the same not happen in long-distance?</P>  <P>Unfortunately, it will be different: Advanced network technologies require  large investments that will not be forthcoming from the incumbent local  and long-distance carriers when plain old technologies are available at  prices below current costs of providing their services. This regulatory  agency has found the ultimate strategy for preventing its irrelevance and  ultimate demisenamely, to set prices that are predatory to the advanced  technologies that can work around regulation.</P>  <P>Some competition could still, eventually, break out. We have indications  of that at the current time. Recent initiatives of AT&amp;T and MCI have,  for the first time in this decade, begun to focus on price as the means  to expand total service levels.</P>  <P>Still, it is difficult to projectfrom the new one-price plan of AT&amp;Tany  change in strategy from tacit collusion to low-price dominance. After all,  15 cents per minute is going to change my long-distance bill of $255 by  only $7.53 (according to the AT&amp;T contract telemarketer I talked to  on the phone during a recent dinner hour).</P>  <P>In effect, there are several hypotheses for explaining the new discount-plan  price-reductions. The first is that AT&amp;T felt a loss of control in  these markets due to its evident breakdown in internal management. Second,  that this is a pricing strategy to contain the market-share gains of the  operating companies after they enter long-distance.</P>  <P>But, as arguments, both of these explanations are far-fetched. It is  more likely that AT&amp;T has gone to this one-price strategy to contain  its loss of long-distance share to small facilities-based long-distance  carriers and to its own resellers. Because AT&amp;T was experiencing increasing  margins of profitability in residential Message Toll Service, retail prices  were too high or were out-of-line with WATS (wide-area telephone services)  wholesale and business services. That followed from MTS price-cost margins  rising while margins on contracts to resellers were not increasing as rapidly.  AT&amp;T, in effect, was advancing its earnings margins to benefit itself,  but also, derivatively, was helping resellers in their share gains against  these higher retail margins.</P>  <P>This last explanation is more credible than the argument that a new  strategic focus on pricing is underway, in anticipation of competitive  entry into long-distance by the Bell operating companies. To believe the  latter flies in the face of the fact that the long-distance carriers scored  a singular victory, with the FCC's First Report and Order, in its campaign  to keep the operating companies out of long-distance.</P>  <P>The First Report takes all the profitability out of local exchange before  the local carriers will be certified for entry into long-distance. The  plethora of legal initiatives to reject the First Report in the Federal  Appeals Courts will slow down that process. For the foreseeable future,  the Bell operating companies have trained their strategic direction on  surviving in local exchange, rather than competing in long-distance. Long-distance  entry remains the light at the end of the tunnel, but the train has been  required to go off into a local-exchange sidetrack.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Doing Much Less With Many More </I></B></P>  <P>You may think too much of this sounds like Vice-President Al Gore, and  that I have offered an analysis so enmeshed in legal moves and countermoves  it ignores the good news of an advanced technology industry that itself  is playing a large role in establishing the information-based economy.  (After all, it was the Vice-President who said nine months ago that we  will not achieve key regulatory reforms required to move along the Information  Superhighway if Congress keeps cutting the FCC's budget.)</P>  <P>So perhaps it is time to step back from the FCC machinations and gain  perspective. The history of this industry is indeed dominated by advances  in technology, through microwave and fiber, to a high level of performance  <I>in spite of</I> massive regulatory intrusion into the management decisions  of companies of all sizes and in all markets.</P>  <P>But the regulatory process has reduced industry growth and efficiency,  while seeking to preserve profitability for a few firms. In that tradition,  the FCC's First, Second and Third Orders to implement the 1996 Telecommunications  Act <I>will</I> increase the number of companies in telecommunications,  <I>will </I>halve the profitability of the incumbent local exchange companies,  and <I>will </I>significantly retard the advancement of competition in  long-distance.</P>  <P>To achieve that high level of accomplishment, the FCC and the state  regulatory agencies will have to grow their own organizations by at least  50%. This last statement is the easiest of all to defend.</P>  <P>Consumers and Congress alike are now confronting the grim reality: What  should be a shakeout of corporate and regulatory practices on the way to  an era of dynamic competition has become a shakedown of potential entrants  by regulators favoring an established clientele. The cause of competition  has been betrayed.</P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><CENTER><BR>    <B>Discovery Institute Adjunct Fellow Paul W.

Its premises must be reconsidered before  its practices can be reformed.</P>  <P>The purpose of this <I>Inquiry </I>is to set forth a plan for the reform  of the U.S. civil justice system. I shall argue four main points.</P>  <P>First, our present civil justice system is a product of the Industrial  Age, ill-adapted to the Information Age now upon us. Americans cherish  the rights and protections afforded by the Constitution, and properly view  radical alterations with skepticism and caution. However, it is time to  accept that an increasingly obsolete system now hampers the exercise of  these constitutional protections and the rights and values they protect.</P>  <P>Second, while the current tort reform movement has merit and deserves  support, the movement's proposed reforms are not, by themselves, adequate  to create an effective 21st century system.</P>  <P>Third, an effective 21st century system should exhibit the following  characteristics:</P>  <P>It should be significantly less adversarial than the present system.</P>  <P>Courts, to a large degree, should be organized by subject matter, not  by geography, and should evolve procedures appropriate to their specialties.  Judges and jurors must become more knowledgeable about the complex matters  on which they must rule. This means court-appointed experts and, in some  cases, expert juries and judges.</P>  <P>And fourth, if structural reform is to be effective, <BR>  it must be accompanied by attitudinal and behavioral changes within the  legal profession and the American people, especially business people. Attorneys  need to start thinking of their jobs in terms of creating solutions to  problems, not pushing the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; system to vicious  extremes. This &quot;mind-set&quot; training should begin in law school.  Business people should eschew the lawsuit as a competitive tool, seek out  reasonable resolutions of their disputes, and remember that they, not their  attorneys, have final responsibility for their cases. Conversely, corporations  should stiffen their resolve to oppose frivolous and predatory lawsuits.  Settling dubious claims out-of-court only encourages extortion.</P>  <P>The justice system should be just thata system of justice, which is  neither a lottery nor a gladiatorial spectacle. Fundamental structural  changes, coupled with equally fundamental people changes, can make it happen.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The System andIts Discontents</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Throughout recorded history (and probably before) there have been trials.  But the present American systemin which opposing parties argue their cases  in accordance with rigid rules of procedure and evidence, before a neutral  presiding judge and a passive jury drawn from the general populationis  a relatively recent phenomenon. We think of the present system as virtually  sacrosanct and ahistorical. It is neither. Rather, the present system is  an amalgam of elements, each of which underwent its own complex evolution,  and which were assembled in their present form only about two hundred years  ago.</P>  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>  <B>Over ninety percent of all litigation in this country is concluded,  usually by agreement of the parties, before a final decision in court.</B><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>  <P>The jury, for example, began life as an instrument of the king. Groups  of local notables were called together to rule on cases of which they had  personal knowledge ... and often personal prejudice. It took nearly a millennium  for the jury to evolve into a neutral and passive body, knowing only what  the contending parties and the rules permit it to know. It took just as  long for the judge to evolve from royal officer to neutral presiding authority.  And it took even longer for the current attorney-client relationship to  evolve. For example, under the old &quot;party-witness&quot; rule, defendants  could not testify on their own behalf, since their testimony was presumed  tainted by self-interest. The practical result was that unscrupulous plaintiffs  often made false accusations against wealthy people who could not defend  themselves in court, but could afford to settle before trial. The present  system, whereby defendants can testify, subject to cross-examination, was  intended to correct this abuse.</P>  <P>But the adversary system evolved to do more than protect the law from  royal and popular pressures, and defendants from abuse. It also evolved  to meet changing mores and practical needs. Enlightenment philosophy placed  great value on the power of human reason, unfettered by custom or fear,  to reach correct conclusions. Judges could be both correct and fair; juries  could reason out the facts and make rational decisions. Examination of  witnesses, governed by logical rules, could produce facts that the jury  could grasp. Lawyers, trained in those rules, and owing a dual allegiance  to client and court, could develop cases on their own, reacting only to  the other side's evidence and moves in the hermetically sealed universe  of the rational courtroom.</P>  <P>The adversary system also made practical sense in an industrializing  era. Because it was not inquisitorial, it did not seek the absolute truth  at any cost; its ways were adequate to render predictable justice most  of the time. Because it considered only cases brought before it, the system  was open and flexible. Finally, common law's organic character it develops  following precedent meant that the law could keep up with the demands placed  upon it.</P>  <P>Today, this civil system is failing. Critics regularly offer the following  reasons:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Blame the lawyers</B></P>  <P>This appears to be the most prevalent, perhaps the most popular, theory.  Variations on this theme include:</P>  <UL>    <LI>There are now too many lawyers.    <LI>Lawyers have become too greedy.    <LI>Lawyers are now just business people, not true professionals.    <LI>Lawyers own the legal system.  </UL>  <P>Indeed, it has become common within the legal community itself to speak  of a loss of professionalism, a malaise that partakes of these very images.  Like all stereotypes, these are both too general and too vague to explain  away the failures of the system.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Americans now see lawsuits as lotteries</B></P>  <P>A second perceived cause is that Americans are now more willing to seek,  and juries are more willing to award, damages that far exceed real losses,  especially when the defendants are &quot;deep-pocket&quot; business entities.  Some critics link this to other contemporary social issues, from old-fashioned  populist resentment to the pursuit of victim status, unwillingness to accept  personal responsibility for one's actions, and an exaggerated and absolutist  notion of individual rights. Some so-called consumer activists contend  that only the threat of massive, perhaps ruinous punitive damages (often  inflicted via class-action lawsuits), can keep corporate America from launching  a veritable New Dark Age of shoddiness and criminality. Some frankly view  lawsuits as a means for redistribution of wealth. Thus, a vicious circle  is established, with political and economic agendas intensifying both the  people's willingness to sue and the lawyers' willingness to have at it  for maximum financial gain.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>The courts are too congested</B></P>  <P>The litigation explosion has jammed the courts. But the civil system  is also weakened by the fact that due-process requires that criminal justice  cases receive priority. The result is more lawsuits, lasting longer. Many  drag on interminably and expensively. In some areas the system is breaking  down physically, due to lack of funds for example, to repair courthouses  or hire new judges and court personnel. It is obvious that delayed justice  imposes unfair, unwarranted financial and psychological costs on participants.  The result is bitterly ironic. Hundreds of years ago, defendants could  be forced to settle even the most preposterous suits because they could  not defend themselves in court. Now, in our modern, advanced system, they're  forced to settle out of court because they can't afford to defend themselves.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Deeper Problems</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>These reasons all have some validity. But four deeper problems are mostly  responsible for damaging the system. One is internal. Three derive from  changes in the larger society that the civil justice system must serve.</P>  <P>The first of the deeper problems is that, all too often, procedure has  come to dominate substance. Indeed, procedures originally intended to guarantee  fairness and impartiality have become weapons with which to bludgeon the  opposition into settling out of court. Over ninety percent of all litigation  in this country is concluded, usually by agreement of the parties, before  a final decision in court.</P>  <P>This &quot;adversarializing&quot; of procedure is especially evident  in the use of discovery in order to intimidate and hamstring the opposition.  The Information Revolution now upon us means that, thanks to computers  and copying machines, there is vastly more information to be accessed,  relevant to the case or not. For a few dollars, one party can now browbeat  the other with hundred-page, computer-generated, requests for information.  Between discovery of documents and deposition, a party can waste untold  hours of its own time, and pay thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees.  For major companies, many of which are involved in numerous simultaneous  lawsuits, settling even the most flagrantly predatory lawsuits out of court  is now widely regarded as just one more cost of doing business. Corporate  defendants may seem like endless fountains of wealth. However, in the end,  this is a cost passed on to consumers, shareholders and the economy at  large.</P>  <P>Another aspect of this &quot;adversarializing&quot; of procedure is  that, within the courtroom, rule-bending and manipulationmuch of it accompanied  by undue belligerence and deliberate incivilityhave become far too common.  The most spectacular recent evidence of this occurred in the criminal field,  during the O.J. Simpson trial. Whatever one thinks of the Simpson verdict,  nearly everyone was appalled by the conduct of the trial itself: the studied  rudeness and tactical tantrums, the manipulation of jury selection, the  withholding of evidence, the game-playing and occasionally flagrant disregard  for rules. Far too often, a tendency to such behavior is encouraged, consciously  or unconsciously, by clients who give their attorneys license to savage  the opposition, even when compromise and civility might be more in their  own best interest. The legal profession itself encourages this trend. When  publications such as the <I>National Law Journal</I> and the <I>American  Lawyer</I> rank lawyers on the basis of verdicts won, i.e., by their size  and visibility, an attorney's incentive to win big can easily become his  or her primary consideration. On the surface, this desire would seem to  serve the client's interests as well. But not always, and not automatically.  Whether in a family or a business, for example, one often must maintain  a civil relationship beyond the time of a particular lawsuit. In the long-term,  a system that rewards procedural ruthlessness and incivility is in nobody's  best interest.</P>  <P>The second, deeper problem is the astonishing complexity of even routine  casesa complexity that grows greater year by year. Once, courts had to  deal with only a few kinds of cases, usually based upon limited information  which, presumably, was available to, or at least understandable by, the  average citizen. Once, there were few expert witnesses, no jury consultants,  and few forensic devices beyond Sherlock Holmes' magnifying glass. Once,  a jury of one's peers meant a jury of one's neighbors, chosen (rightly  or wrongly) without regard for racial, ethnic, and gender diversity.</P>  <P>Today, these conditions have changed. Lawyers long ago had to specialize.  The ABA now recognizes over twenty different areas of legal practice. Yet  courts remain generalists. A judge might preside over a relatively simple  tort case one week (or year), then a complex, high-tech, international  case the next. It is no longer reasonable to expect that juries selected  by the old system can cope with the complexityno matter whether that system  yields doctors, business people, and professors, or welfare mothers and  the unemployed. All too often, faced with the baffling complexity and excruciating  duration of modern civil cases, jurors tend to vote their feelings, not  the facts.</P>  <P>The third problem is that geography no longer matters the way it once  did. Today, when information and capital travel the globe in seconds, when  business increasingly is transnational and the legal systems of many countries  may be involved in a single dispute, the old organization of courts by  <BR>  geography no longer makes sense.</P>  <P>The final problem may be the most intractable. Americans have become  so diverse a people that it is increasingly difficult to define a set of  shared values. Today, pressure to conform to a dominant culture has been  replaced by pressure to emphasize and celebrate one's differences. For  many, primary identity and values now come from groups based upon gender,  language, race, sexual orientation, religion, or life-style. It is, of  course, ironic that this age of rapid globalization should also witness  the re-emergence of such powerful centrifugal forces. Still, it is not  surprising that given the stresses of globalization, many should come to  prefer the relative security found in smaller groups and subcultures. Still,  if the law is to be more than a minimal set of procedures for getting along  in an increasingly complex and hostile worldif the law is also to help  tell us who and what we areboth globalization and diversity must be given  their due.</P>  <P>In sum: when a plaintiff can win a million dollar settlement from McDonald's  because its coffee was too hot, when suing and being sued become normal  ways of doing business or pursuing political and social agendas, when procedure  triumphs over substance, distorting justice, when jurors can't even comprehend  the cases they must decide: It's time for fundamental reform to make the  legal system accord with new realities.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>A Proposed Solution</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Many of the reform proposals currently under consideration have merit,  especially those that would streamline pretrial procedures, limit discovery  and deposition, and limit punitive damages. These deserve support. Also  deserving support are <HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>  <B>Today, when information and capital travel the globe in seconds, ...  the old organization of courts by geography no longer makes sense.<HR ALIGN=LEFT>  </B>reform efforts tied to individual products or industries, such as the  manufacturer/labor/consumer alliance that led to the General Aviation Revitalization  Act of 1994, and the securities legislation that the 104th Congress passed  over President Clinton's veto. But these must be interim measures at best.  Only fundamental reform can create a system adequate to the needs of a  21st century economy and society.</P>  <P>I propose that the civil justice system be restructured as an integrated  system of specialized courts, organized according to subject matter. I  will call these &quot;Specialty Courts,&quot; each handling a particular  field, or the area where different fields converge. For example, there  could be specialty courts for the environment, telecommunications, and  intellectual property rights. A computer/telecommunications specialty court  might handle disputes arising out of these converging technologies. Many  arrangements are possible.</P>  <P>The idea is far from unprecedented. There long have been specialty courts  for the military, as well as in areas such as taxation, bankruptcy, juvenile  justice, and family matters. As mentioned, lawyers have had to specialize.  It is time to adopt this form of organization across-the-board, with general  courts perhaps reserved for minor or rare categories. (This reform would  not directly affect the criminal justice system.)</P>  <P>Each specialty court will contain a hierarchy of forums. At the bottom  will be informal and formal alternative dispute resolution services offering  mediation and arbitration. These would be voluntary. Above this level will  be juryless proceedings, trials by small juries or panels of judges, and  above that, full jury trials. Each specialty court would adopt the structure  and procedures most appropriate to its unique subject-matter needs. The  specialty courts would then flow into the appropriate appellate system,  thence to the state-level courts of highest resort and the U.S. Supreme  Court. These and other supervisory institutions would insure that Constitutional  protections would continue to apply.</P>  <P>Specialty courts will not be staffed by generalists, nor will juries  be selected in the old way. Decision makersboth judges and jurieswill have  at least<BR>  some training and expertise in their specialties. Specialty courts also  may have their own expert staffs. This will lead to better decision making,  expediting the process, and lessening dependence upon the contending parties'  hired experts. After all, asking lay people to decide which of two feuding  experts is correct when it involves using evidence that is deemed too technical  for lay people to understand without expert help, makes little sense.</P>  <P>There is, however, an obvious potential drawback. Expertise does not  guarantee impartiality. Court officials and staffs could be populated by  activists intent upon their own agenda. This issue must be addressed in  structuring the specialty courts. There are also obvious dangers inherent  in creating what might look like a corps of professional, or quasi-professional,  jurors. In the new system, it will not be neccesary or desirable to create  a class of professionals. Depending on the subject matter, knowledgeable  participants can be drawn from any number of broad pools. Some baseline  familiarity with the subject matter at hand is the key.</P>  <P>The total number of specialty courts, and their individual organization,  will be determined by the needs of the people. This must be an evolutionary  process. At the start, it might be useful to follow the current structure  of law-practice specialties, as listed by the American Bar Association.  Beyond this, some specialty courts might be organized by industry, some  by product type, others by consumer profiles. The important point is to  maintain the integrity of the subject matter. This can be accomplished  in many ways. And some overlap may be both inevitable and desirable.</P>  <P>Specialty courts will be overseen by governmental bodies, although the  pattern of oversight may, in some cases, be more complex than the current  federal/state/advisory board arrangement. Family courts, for example, would  be overseen by the states; commercial courts would require federal supervision.  Regional oversight may be appropriate in some cases. Courts dealing with  international matters may need to operate in accordance with accepted international  norms, but with the clear understanding that this does not constitute a  form of embryionic &quot;world government.&quot; Perhaps these international  bodies would exercise jurisdiction only when all parties agree, on a case-by-case  basis. Perhaps, at the international end of the specialty court hierarchy,  mediation and arbitration would be more appropriate than the granting of  full jurisdiction.</P>  <P>But even these structural changes, profound as they are, will be ineffective  without corresponding changes in human behavior and attitudes. In today's  global, multicultural environment, the legal profession must move away  from its present winner-take-all, combative mindset, toward creating less  adversarial processes and solutions. Education in this area must begin  in law school. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) training should be  enhanced. Many lawyers now offer ADR services. A way should be found to  grant ADR decisions some sort of precedent status within the common law.</P>  <P>Similar mindset changes must occur outside the profession. Americans  have become to quick to run to the court house to solve their problems.  They need to return to a more creative and positive approach. If they do  get involved in litigation, they, too, must assume a less adversarial mentality.  Typically, litigants tend to forget that their lawyers work for them. Also,  business peopleperhaps led by their trade associationsmust move away from  the notion that lawsuits are a normal part of doing business, seeing them  as either a tool to use on the competition or an inevitable operating cost.  This may entail not only limiting one's propensity to sue, but also stiffening  one's propensity to fight predatory and frivolous suits. The same &quot;deep  pockets&quot; that make it possible to settle out of court can also make  it possible to fight the kind of extended battles that may have a deterrent  effect down the road.</P>  <P>Finally, in recent decades, the civil justice system has come to be  used extensively as a means of advancing a litany of social and political  agendas, at <BR>  least some of which would be better addressed outside the litigation context.  Some of thisthe early civil rights movement comes to mindwas necessary,  given the recalcitrance of the political process. But to the extent that  political issues become routinely judicialized, we diminish both our political  and our legal systems, and the country as a whole suffers. To the extent  that lawsuits become a means of intimidating opponents, the system is rendered  corrupt.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Reforming an institution as complex as the American civil justice system  is an undertaking of no small audacity. It will encounter intense opposition:  some of it self-interested, some of it ideologically-driven, and much,  no doubt the product of prudence. After all, as Thomas Jefferson wrote  in the Declaration of Independence, forms of government are not to be changed  for &quot;light and transient reasons.&quot; But Jefferson also wrote that  &quot;any form of government&quot; can become destructive of the ends for  which governments are established. Today, the American civil justice system  exists somewhere between dysfunction and oppression. It is headed toward  oppression. It's time to call it back.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mrblline.gif" WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></CENTER></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1><font face="Helvetica">Saving Justice, Serving  Justice</FONT></FONT></B> <HR><BR>  Discovery Institute's Saving Jusitice, Serving Justice program will create  and define a movement to reform and reconstruct America's civil justice  system and restore confidence in that system.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Information Society was
formally introduced in June 1994, in Corfu, Greece, with the issuance of
the so-called Bangemann Report, Europe and the Global Information Society,
and its implementing successor, released in July 1994, Europe's Way to the
Information Society, An Action Plan. Since that time, the European Union
has become aggressively involved in the regulation of all aspects of the
information society. The results take Europe in a direction potentially
at odds with North America and the rest of the world, damaging the European
Union's trading partners and -- as <A HREF="ggindex.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow, George Gilder </A>alleges -- Europe itself.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Two themes characterize the European Commission's
position on the information society: federalism and protectionism. The Commission
has taken a broad and in-depth view of its role in the development of the
European information society, and is promulgating laws on the Internet to
govern the 15 independent European Union member states. In fact, the European
Union appears to be utilizing the advent of the information society to facilitate
the exercise -- and some would argue the expansion -- of its federal powers.
It also is utilizing the information society as a means of adopting protectionist
legislation that conflicts with the inherently global nature of the Internet,
and that could threaten to diminish that very integral aspect of the Internet.
Recently-adopted and proposed EC (European Community) legislation in the
area of intellectual property serve as examples of these two characterizing
themes of the EC's approach.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission's launching of its Information
Society initiatives followed closely on the heels of the Clinton administration's
announcement of a U.S. federal focus on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The U.S. approach to the information superhighway, going back to at least
1994, appeared to be directed toward the same stance as that of the European
government's. Vice President Gore announced the Clinton Administration's
willingness to intervene in the Internet if private interests failed to
promote an agenda which conformed to the vision of a widely-accessible,
safe new medium for U.S. citizens to deploy in both philanthropic and commercial
ways. But he also made clear the Administration's preference for private
development and little regulaiton. The U.S. Congress has been even more
inclined to preserve a an open, free-market environment. With certain notable
exceptions (the Clipper Chip, the Communications Decency Act), the U.S.
federal government has intervened in regulation of the Internet to a much
lesser extent than the EC, and when adopting or proposing laws, ihas shown
greater respect for free trade principles.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The EC's federalist and protectionist position,
when compared with the more decentralized, balanced position of the United
States, can be explained by certain economic facts. First, it is undisputed
that the U.S. is the technological leader in software, telecommunications,
and other information society technologies. Widely-reported balance-of-trade
figures support this common understanding. Second, while the U.S. has the
benefit of existing federal laws to govern certain critical aspects of the
Internet, the EC is still--in many respects--in the formative stages of
creating a European nation-state. While a unified European information society
can benefit U.S. interests by providing a single, more integrated European
market, the EC's aggressive investigation into regulation of Internet-related
laws should be carefully monitored by U.S. industry, to ensure that such
&quot;federally&quot; promulgated laws do not unfairly prejudice U.S. information
interests. Moreover, international trade negotiations need to consider whether
creation of globally-fragmented Internet-related laws threaten to devalue
one of the key assets of the Internet -- its inherently free and global
nature.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Courier New">One need only look to current laws being proposed,
investigated and adopted to support the proposition that the EC views the
information society as a key mechanism for promoting a unified Europe. Virtually
all aspects of the information society -- from education and privacy, to
technical standards and intellectual property -- are being reviewed by the
EC. The following is a summary of just a fraction of the European initiatives
which have been promulgated since mid-1994 in regards to the information
society.</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission derives its power from
the European Treaty and has the authority to regulate the laws of the individual
European member states, now numbering 15, to the extent such laws create
disharmony in the European market. In the intellectual property area, it
is the position of the European Court of Justice that, under the European
Treaty, the European government has the power to regulate the exercise of
intellectual property rights, but not the existence of such rights. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, recently-adopted European legislation
indeed appears to legislate even the existence of such rights, in an ever-increasing
expansion of federal power. For example, the recently-effective Directive
on the Term of Protection of Copyrights extended by 20 years the length
of copyright in most member states, and revived certain copyrights that
had expired. Similarly, the recently-adopted EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases creates intellectual property rights in databases where, under
the laws of certain member states, none existed; and the recently-created
Community Trademark, in essence, creates a unified bundle of national trademark
rights, where heretofore recourse to each individual national trademark
authority was required to obtain such rights. These are examples of areas
in which legal rights are being created by the European government which
were historically--and under the European Treaty still are--within the sole
province of the member states' governments.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">This centralized promulgation of laws can, in fact,
be advantageous to U.S. information industries. Brussels is becoming a location
at which Euuropean interest groups can consolidate their lobbying efforts.
Also, unified laws across the 15 European Union countries can result in
lower cost-of-entry barriers to marketing goods and services in Europe.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, these advantages are lost when the centrally-promulgated
laws discriminate against non-EU individuals and entities. Such discriminatory
treatment, at least in the intellectual property area, is growing more common.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">III. Protectionist approach <BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The Internet is widely regarded as potentially
the single most important technological contribution to global human communication,
education and societal relationships since the telephone, the television,
and the computer. As such, laws should be developed globally to benefit
those who wish to participate individually or commercially in such medium.
The Internet is inherently borderless. Technologies are just being developed
to enable more segmented, selective deployment of the Internet; however,
the basic presumption -- and value -- of the Internet is that it is instantaneously
global. Fragmented laws governing the Internet complicate its effectiveness,
and jeopardize its global utility. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission publicly recognizes the
importance of the global nature of the Internet, and even acknowledges the
need for international cooperation in its development. However, recently
promulgated laws indicate that the EC will utilize its federal power, as
well as the new ease with which foreign companies can enter the European
market to promote its own industries and interests. A comparison of recent
parallel intellectual property legislation on both sides of the Atlantic
illustrates the differences in the EU and U.S. approaches to regulating
Internet interests.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The recently-effective EC Directive on the Term
of Copyright Protection explicitly excludes from extended protection works
of authorship which are of non-EU member state origin. By contrast, the
proposed U.S. Copyright Extension Act would extend copyright protection
for all World Trade Organization member individuals and corporate authors.
Where the EC Directive discriminates, the proposed U.S. law does not. The
EC acknowledges this discrimination in its preparatory comments to adoption
of this Directive, indicating that it wishes to encourage non-EU governments
to extend their term of copyright protection. As a trading partner with
vast riches of rather aging intellectual properties -- art, literature,
music -- Europe has obvious interests in extending the term of copyright
protection for such assets, particularly as a result of the expanded use
in the multimedia revolution. Nonetheless, one can ask whether this justifies
adopting legislation which creates a fragmented market -- where copyrights
are protected in some countries (e.g., the EU), and not in others (e.g.,
the U.S.); and where copyrights of certain national origin are given extended
protection, and others are not. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Similarly, the EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases grants added protection for previously unprotected databases,
but only provided the interested party has a registered office in an EU
member state and has an ongoing operational link with an EU member state.
By contrast, the proposed U.S. Database Investment and Intellectual Property
Piracy Act of 1996 would, if adopted, accord increased protection for databases
on a non-discriminatory basis. Again, the result of the EC laws is a fragmentation
of the global market for such products, and, a consequential complication
and, therefore, suppression of the market. Insofar as the present state
of the Internet results in instantaneous and low-cost global distribution,
such fragmented laws conflict with the utilization of this uniquely global
resource. While it can be argued that the EC's discriminatory position was
based on legitimate motivation--encouraging industries to locate and operate
within the European Union--the fragmentation of the market that results
from such discrimination is against the inherent nature of the Internet.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">IV. Conclusion<BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The adoption of protectionist laws is obviously
not new to global politics. If a country can adopt internal laws which create
competitive advantage, its global trade and negotiating strength can be
increased. When a centralized force such as the European Union can use its
federal power to effectuate protectionist laws of 15 countries, the competitive
force of such an exercise of power is multiplied. However, adopting this
protectionist approach when promulgating laws which govern the Internet
results in obstacles to the effective use and development of such a medium.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">One could advocate that the U.S. retaliate by mirroring
such a protectionist stance in its own Internet-related laws. However, this
approach may only result in a further global fragmentation of legal use
of the Internet for global communications and commerce. The solution lies
rather in encouraging global cooperation on laws which directly impact the
use of the Internet, in the interests of all users. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Rather than directing laws -- and technology --
toward a global fragmentation of the Internet, governments should be seeking
ways to preserve this inherently international asset. Rather than view the
information society and its technologies as an opportunity to gain nationalistic
competitive advantage, governments should nurture this resource as a means
of integrating global resources into a single, unified whole.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Postscript:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Courier New">
My Discovery Institute colleague, Senior Fellow George Gilder, adds this
qualifying comment on the argument made here.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">&quot;By submitting the Internet to Eurosclerosis,
the European Union will only assure continued decline of its economies in
the new age of networks. The Internet is inherently global and will route
around the attempts to nationalize, commisionize or parochialize it.&quot;</FONT>

damage Europe more than anyone -- and ultimately must fail.</FONT> <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that Jesus was really born about six B.C., not in the year
0, as you might expect. A sixth century monk named Dionysius Exiguus, who
was given responsibility for settling a dispute over the date of Easter,
miscalculated his account of Jesus' life and placed His birth about six
years late. This scholarly error, which was perpetuated in later calendars,
means that we already are in the 21st century, and, for that matter, in
the Third Millennium. <BR>
<BR>
There is a certain satisfaction in our unexpected arrival in the 21st century
and the new millennium, if only because it has caught the numerologists
off guard. It will be harder now for them to peddle their prognostications
when the merely nominal millennium rolls around. <BR>
<BR>
But the new century, if not the new millennium, already has begun intellectually,
too--and politically and culturally. Just as the fin de si&egrave;cle 100
years ago closed down the 19th century in a burst of fashionable despair
mixed with exciting new ideas about nature, man and society, we are now
witnessing rejection of many of the prevalent ideas of the 20th Century.
And again something new is coming onto the stage of history. <BR>
<BR>
What seems to be happening intellectually and politically is the cumulative
repudiation of the whole grim, pedantic, utopian, hedonistic-yet-moralizing,
centralizing, pyschologizing, determinist, reductionist, relativist, modernist
project of the 20th Century. And I say, good riddance! <BR>
What may replace it is a revitalized version of what used to be called the
liberal tradition of the West, facilitated by new science and new technology.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Case Against the 20th Century </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there was some good to the 20th century, and some necessary change.
For example, we probably did need a civil service to replace the political
spoils system--though we later got carried away and let bureaucracies regulate
away many of our freedoms. We did need civil rights protection through central
government action in order, finally, to right the great wrong of slavery
and to fulfill the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. But the best
intellectual innovations of the 20th century were in the fields of science
and technology--medicine and communications, notably. Most of the others
were of lesser significance or were baneful. <BR>
<BR>
Not only did the 20th century bring us the scourges of fascism and communism,
but, to a lesser degree, it brought us what the Alexis de Tocqueville correctly
foresaw as the &quot;democratic tyrannies&quot; of socialism and the welfare
state. Specialization and expertise flourished, bringing great benefits
in some areas, but also contributing to the depreciation of the liberal
arts. Over-emphasis on expertise also tempted leaders in one field to claim
authority in others, which is always a moral usurpation. Some generalists,
in turn, claimed the label of science for arts and crafts that did not deserve
it. This holds true for several of the &quot;social sciences,&quot; but
especially for something that grandly calls itself &quot;political science.&quot;
Even economics claimed more scientific stature than it deserved, guided
by the late 20th century conceit that the qualitative can always be quantified.
What the experts and pseudo-experts did was separate ordinary people from
their government and culture, robbing their authority and undermining their
morale. <BR>
<BR>
Not only was the authority of representative democracy undermined, but so,
too, was God's. It was the century that popularized the &quot;God is Dead&quot;
movement and--professing &quot;science&quot; again--tried to free us from
what modernists considered the superstition of religion. We actually created
an official culture--not in Russia, but in the United States!--that frowns
on expressions of religious faith in public life. We even self-censor, making
faith a non-subject in leading private as well as public arenas. Most American
youth grow up without any grounding in religious faith, or take a naive
Sunday school faith into combat with sophisticated university debunkers.
<BR>
<BR>
We are a more materialist culture than ever before. But materialism itself
is deadening. It has created a great cyst of loss and sorrow in our collective
soul. <BR>
<BR>
Among elites, few are religious, or even seriously stoic. Instead, they
worship a kind of debonair high style, and, of course, they worship health.
For them, as Jackson Lears says in his history of advertising, salvation
equals peak performance in the bedroom, the bathroom and the boardroom (and,
one might add, the exercise room). <BR>
<BR>
But isn't it odd that this age of materialism has seen such an efflorescence
of real superstitions? They range from New Age channelers to cable channel
psychics charging $4 a minute. <BR>
<BR>
Spiritual demoralization -- the loss of moral bearings and morale -- affects
the way we raise families and conduct our work. The professions today, especiallay
law, medicine and teaching, already are infected by demoralization. So is
journalism, which adopts cynicism as a reflexive attitude. In turn, &quot;all
this cynicism has permeated society,&quot; says Queens University Professor
George Rawlyk in the Vancouver Sun, &quot;and caused people to lose faith
in institutions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Politics is definitely demoralized. Bureaucrats and experts--including that
strange breed, the professional &quot;ethicist&quot;--have trod on the cord
of responsibility that links the elected official to the electorate. More
worrisome, young people know almost nothing of the system of representative
democracy and therefore are bored with it, when they are not disgusted.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The False Promise of &quot;Reform&quot; </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The so-called &quot;reform movement,&quot; once volunteer, but now professionalized,
aims to take the politics out of politics and replace it with juicy personal
scandals or mere titillating innuendo. Whereas the communists said the political
is personal, which made the state's role tyrannous, the present-day reformer
says the personal is political--and transforms the private gossip of politics
into subjects of public litigation. That is distracting, and it, too, can
become tyrannous. <BR>
<BR>
Over-regulating human life -- including public life -- destroys liberty.
When the laws governing politics become so voluminous and complex that no
one even knows whether he is in compliance or not, a candidate or office-holder
is at the mercy of anyone who investigates him. This is always the irony:
the more laws and regulations you have, the more inevitable lawbreaking
becomes. And, because everyone can be found to have broken some law, the
decision as to whom to prosecute becomes--once more--arbitrary. Yet it was
to resist the power of arbitrary authority that the rule of law was established.
<BR>
<BR>
When the current political reform movement gained sway about 25 years ago,
it was with the promise of restoring confidence in government. (I know,
I was a part of it.) But, all surveys show that public confidence actually
has fallen during the very period when reform laws have been enacted. <BR>
<BR>
Reform has become just another political weapon. Our experience is thus
an extreme recapitulation of the earlier reform period, the Progressive
Era, 100 years ago. Also starting with high ideals, a number of the progressives
ultimately descended into false and exaggerated accusations and personal
abuse of power. Theodore Roosevelt, himself a reformer, gave us the term
&quot;muckraker,&quot; borrowed from the low-visioned Man with the Muckrake
in Pilgrim's Progress. He could have been speaking of our own time when,
on another occasion, he remarked, &quot;Whoever said that 'Patriotism is
the last refuge of a scoundrel' had not considered the possibilities of
'reform.'&quot; 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Birth of 20th Century Thinking </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
From where did the past century get such curious reversals of virtue and
vice? Well, much of the force of 20th century modernism, for good and ill
alike, developed from industrial era science and industrial era ideas. Without
succumbing to over-generalization, one can still point to telling patterns,
especially in the work of the great thinkers of the later 19th and early
20th centuries, and of their followers, whose influence still is with us.
Chief among them: Karl Marx, Frederick Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Charles
Darwin and Albert Einstein. <BR>
<BR>
Through such thinkers, science, which really did accomplish great things
in the past century, also was misused to create the materialist culture:
atheistic, relativist, and cynical about personal virtue, yet blithely prepared
to build a New Society. Marx, for example, gave us the term &quot;dialectical
materialism,&quot; the priority of matter over mind. He taught class warfare
as a just pursuit and assailed bourgeois morality. Like most social engineers,
he created a system where everyone was exposed as self- interested, except,
of course, for himself and his favorite abstraction, the workers. <BR>
<BR>
Nietzsche taught us the &quot;will-to-power,&quot; the claims of self-expression
and moral relativism beyond good and evil. On the extreme right he inspired
the Nazis. And yet he also was the progenitor of the New Left and the hippies
in the 1960s. Nietzsche taught that there is no God, but that you can be
a god. From deconstruction in academia to the cynicism of the media, his
effects seem as strong as ever today. <BR>
<BR>
Freud was another brilliant, single-minded simplifier whose perspective
reflected the industrial era in which he lived. To him, a person is like
a steam engine, full of tensions that have to be released--thrusting pistons
and opposing forces. It wasn't just his emphasis on sexuality that was exaggerated,
but also his willingness, and that of his followers, to misapply their gifted
insights into mental disorders to a wide range of other fields, including
religion, war, history, philosophy, art and literature. <BR>
<BR>
So far, Darwin has stood the test of time better. But the uses to which
his ideas have been put are another matter. He never wanted to apply natural
selection to human society, and yet, far right and left both made bold use
of Darwin's ideas to do just that. From Social Darwinism to National Socialism
to the view of man as a soulless animal, Darwinism has been used to justify
complete disregard of the poor, on one hand, and the practice of eugenics
and euthanasia on the other. How instructive it is that the little metal
fish symbols some Christians stick on their autos are now mocked on other
autos by little metal amphibians with &quot;Darwin&quot; written on them!
<BR>
<BR>
Einstein was locked into relativity (which, of course, is not to be confused
with relativism), a theory that explained certain relationships between
time and space, matter and energy. Einstein wanted physical laws that would
hold true anywhere. Most of his discoveries were made before 1906 and he
spent the rest of his life trying to disprove the uncertainty principle
at the foundation of quantum theory-still seeking a mechanistic explanation
for the universe. But he failed. What Heisenberg, Planck and, more recently,
Richard Feynman, revealed is that atoms cannot be deterministically defined,
and that at the heart of every atom are mysterious and infinite waves. In
other words, matter doesn't matter--at least not as much as we thought.
<BR>
<BR>
But if materialism, even in physics, no longer prevails how can it possibly
be used, as Marx and several other industrial-era thinkers (or their followers)
attempted, to define the life of the human mind and the organization of
society? 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Return of Freedom </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is that it cannot, and the good news is that this intellectual
realization is beginning to affect our social and political life. As much
as anything, the technological revolution that is built on the science of
quantum physics and probability theory, makes this clear. The silicon chip,
the computer, software, fiber optics, and wireless telephony are among the
great triumphs of mind over matter. The Industrial Age thus has given way
to the Information Age. The effects are seen not only in communications,
but in the broad economy, where work is being decentralized and personalized
and where intellectual property now competes in value with physical property.
<BR>
<BR>
The information revolution helped topple the Soviet Union, which could not
compete with American high technology and could not tolerate the openness
resulting from computers. Indeed, it could not resist the force of the new
technology in part because communism is a rigid, centralized, industrial-era
system. But the USSR and other command economies and political systems are
not the only ones threatened by the new information freedom model. So are
almost all overly centralized, bureaucratic organizations that operate the
way they did in industrial times. <BR>
<BR>
The revolution is now beginning to shake the earth under the U.S. federal
government. And other levels of government. And great universities. And
even the public school system. It is affecting our thinking about transportation
and the future of cities. <BR>
<BR>
New technologies are &quot;only&quot; tools, of course, but history shows
that once man creates new tools, the new tools tend to reshape the way man
lives. <BR>
<BR>
They surely will overthrow the contemporary version of television, the last
great example of industrial age technology. TV broadcasts from a central
point where all the power resides. It, too, is a top-down power structure.
You take what you get, and what you get is standardized, because it must
appeal to the lowest common denominator of a mass audience. The new technology
that is about to take its place- -including especially what George Gilder
calls the &quot;teleputer&quot;--will be interactive as well as multi-media.
It is a bottom-up power structure, liberated from the center, and free of
the potential for Orwellian propaganda controls found in industrial-era
communications. <BR>
<BR>
Leftists would have you believe it is elitist; it is not. You, as user,
will control it, selecting exactly what you want and when you want it. Videoconferencing,
family gatherings in cyberspace, new ways to learn exactly at the pace suitable
for you or your child, and choices tailored to what is individual and distinctive
about you: All these are designed to serve your own interests and pursuits,
not those prescribed for you. They will connect you to others near and far
who share those interests--say, pre-Columbian art or gardening or learning
a foreign language. Already the Internet is providing alternative sources
of political action and news. Some critics think it threatens to bring us
mass direct democracy, unscreened from temporary passions and runaway enthusiasms.
I believe it is more likely to help restore the authority of representative
democracy. <BR>
<BR>
The new communications technology both reflects the disintegration of materialist
assumptions and contributes to that disintegration, so the process is robust.
Nonetheless, we will long have to deal with the cultural and political detritus
left over from the collapse of the materialist dispensation. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, it is exactly among the educated elites that ideas of materialism
took strongest hold and it is also within those quarters that confusion
and uncertainty-- demoralization--is greatest. But the average citizen,
never having drunk as deep at the well of 20th century ideology as did the
elites, is not as ill-prepared for the 21st century. Ordinary people, surveys
show, still believe in God, still believe in objective right and wrong,
still credit common sense, human nature and a Jeffersonian, rather than
a deconstructionist, understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
They even persist in the benighted, pre-20th century view that art has something
to do with beauty and truth. As the late Christopher Lasch put it, the early
20th century writer and critic Ortega y Gasset's fear has been proven wrong;
the &quot;masses&quot; did not revolt against western civilization, only
the elites did. <BR>
<BR>
And now many people seem to be revolting against the whole soft tyranny
of modernism. This is really the 18th and 19th century liberal tradition
reasserting itself for the 21st century. <BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;liberalism&quot; here, of course, is not the left fork that
political liberalism took in this century, but the older understanding of
a free and civil society--with its institutions of representative democracy,
limited government and freedom from arbitrary rule, belief in progress,
tolerance, emancipation from dogma, and individual rights coupled with personal
responsibility--all tutored by civic virtue. This tradition rebelled against
a state church, but in this country almost always presupposed a divine order.
<BR>
<BR>
This classical liberal tradition was the consensus tradition of the United
States, distinguishing us from the Old World order. As Thomas Jefferson
proclaimed after the bitter election of 1800, &quot;We are all federalists
and we are all republicans.&quot; In the 1950s this point was observed again
by the so-called &quot;consensus school&quot; of historians, including Louis
Hartz and Richard Hofstaedter. It was a point that Francis Fukuyama made
in his essay, &quot;The End of History,&quot; a few years ago. <BR>
<BR>
The old liberal tradition moves forward in harmony with the individualist,
free-market drive of the information revolution. It is in harmony, also,
with government's appropriate functions, so it does not reflexively denigrate
public service. It is the tradition so despised today by campus reactionaries
on the left, steeped as they are in the paradoxically anti-Western influence
of such Western rebels as Marx and Nietzsche. The liberal tradition survives
such assaults precisely because it is open and ready to learn from other
cultures. In this, it looks back to the rich moral and intellectual resources
of the liberal arts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the liberal arts have consisted of language, philosophy,
history, literature, mathematics and abstract science. These subjects help
a man or woman to reflect upon how to live one's life, how to learn and
to interpret change. In the information age, these subjects are more precious
than ever. For now, when one opts out of a liberal education and into mere
professionalism or tradecraft, he is both likely to find himself impoverished
mentally and rendered obsolescent by constantly changing technology. <BR>
<BR>
It is quite possible that we already have hit bottom in the disregard of
the liberal arts and are beginning to look up. A recent report, for example,
shows the study of the classics increasing on college campuses. At 28,000
students, classics enrollment is higher than it has been in almost 30 years.
The classics teach not only the dead languages of Latin and Ancient Greek,
but also the history and philosophy of the Greeks and Romans, and those
works are as vital as ever. Happily, they can betaught today with the aid
of CD- Roms. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, what is called conservatism is the political movement most
congenial to revival and restatement of the liberal tradition for the 21st
century. One sees this in those state capitols where governors are exploring
new ways to hook social and economic policies to human nature rather than
to abstract, welfare-state ideals. One sees it in Congress where House Speaker
Newt Gingrich refuses to adhere to the barbarian caricature of his adversaries
but pursues a coherent and old/new fashioned restatement of the goals of
limited government--and with panache as well as vision. <BR>
<BR>
But, obviously, this great seachange cannot be confined to any one party,
let alone one figure. Many nominally on the political left today are intrigued
by the possibilities that new intellectual understandings and new technologies
can improve public policy in unanticipated ways. Indeed, they are influenced
by today's intellectual currents on the right in the same way, for example,
that the right in earlier times was influenced by the Progressive Era and
the New Deal. <BR>
<BR>
Regardless, much that until recently was unthinkable is now on the table.
We used to describe someone as &quot;so conservative he wants to privatize
the Post Office.&quot; Today, in the age of overnight courier services,
FAX machines and E- mail, privatization is taking place with hardly any
one noticing. Twenty years ago you could not find mention of the word &quot;privatization&quot;
in the lexicon of public policy. Now the loose consensus on the value of
privatizing many government activities stretches from the Republican right
to Chicago's Democratic Mayor Richard Daley. The call for decentralization
comes from governors of both parties. Democratic senators such as Bennett
Johnston (LA) and Wendell Ford (KY) join Slade Gorton (WA) and Dirk Kempthorne
(ID) in calling for the Endangered Species Act to be rewritten. Even President
Clinton indicates support for revisions, if not repudiation, of affirmative
action, and finds a whole host of leading black intellectuals, such as Thomas
Sowell, Shelby Steele, Stephen Carter, and Glenn Loury already there. <BR>
<BR>
When one side of the political spectrum starts to embrace the positions
and policies of the other, something profound is happening, not only to
politics but to the culture. <BR>
<BR>
I suggest that what is beginning to happen is the restoration of a noble
and correct view of the world. When Aristotle wrote his Politics and his
Ethics, he defined a way to determine what is good--the Golden Mean between
&quot;excess&quot; and &quot;defect.&quot; In specific application of those
absolute standards to a particular principle, however, man was to look to
consequences as well as to means, and employ prudence, the virtue of good
judgment. When it came to public philosophy, Jews and Christians found common
ground in such a moral philosophy, and undergirded it with revelation. Indeed,
as C.S. Lewis wrote, you do not requirereligion to find that common ground,
or, as he called it, the Tao. For God gave man reason, and through that
reason, most civilizations apprehend the Tao. 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Untangling the Materialist Mind </H3>
<BR>
It wasn't simply materialism that failed, but utopianism, which is its contradictory
and yet complementary twin. The materialist/relativist tells us that there
are no normative standards; for example, the definition of a &quot;family&quot;
is anything you want it to be. (After all, you have your &quot;values&quot;
and I have mine.) The utopian impulse in the same modernist mind is much
sterner. When it comes to endangered species or product liability or sexual
harassment, it dictates absolute purity of means, as well as purposes. Thus,
on one hand, we have moral vagueness, and, on the other, rigidly moralistic
emphasis on processes. What both of these superficially dissimilar modernist
impulses--which normally co-habit--have in common is that neither looks
very much at consequences. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, for the founders of the liberal tradition, the Greeks, the
object in politics as in life was not the triumph of one interest or one
consideration, but the balance, the harmony, of interests and considerations.
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders also clearly stood in that line. The great goal of
the 21st Century, following the classical liberal tradition, is to recover
that sense of harmony in life--the sacred and the practical, private virtue
and civic virtue, and the personal in balance with the political.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>LIFE AFTER TELEVISION, UPDATED</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>GEORGE GILDER<BR>
<BR>
</I><HR></CENTER>
</H3>
In 1994, four years after I wrote the first edition of Life After Television,
the cornucopian afterlife is indeed at hand. With microchips and fiber optics
eroding the logic of centralized institutions, networks of personal computers
are indeed overthrowing IBM and CBS, NTT and EEC. But as the great pyramids
of the broadcast and industrial eras--the familiar masters of the American
immigration--break apart, new fear and anxieties arise about the future.
If the center cannot hold, what rough beast, shuffling its slow thighs,
slouches toward Hollywood to be born again in gigabytes--and gigadollars--on
the information superhighway?<BR>
<H3><HR>Will life after television mean the dissolution of the American
hearth into a pornucopia of 900-number videos, full-color cold calls from
sultry sisters at Lehman Brothers and real-crime performances in multimedia
by superstar serial killers? Or will the new technologies uplift the culture
and empower the people, as Life After Television predicted?<BR>
<HR></H3>
<BR>
A Hughes Aircraft Corp. rocket's red glare in French Guiana, bombs bursting
in air on 500 channels, give proof through the night that something is going
on out there: 150 choices of DirecTv broadcast satellite images; up to one
billion hertz of cable TV bandwidth; star-spangled malls of infomercials;
CD radio with fidelity beyond the ken of the human ear; high-resolution
wrestlemania; 3,000 films on- demand; interactive personals and impulse
pay-per-view playmates; Yellow Pages blooming into home- shopping bonanzas;
and videogames galore on compact discs and cartridges. All zooming through
the air, blasting through cable and pulsing through fiber at the speed of
light. All to be captured, decrypted, decompressed, rendered and rolled
out from the new set-top boxes, game players and supertheaters in millions
of colors and living rooms.<BR>
<BR>
In such a phantasmagoria, what could be missing? The same thing that is
missing in much of the media coverage of the information superhighway: the
personal computer. What is driving the &quot;telefuture&quot; is not any
convergence of films and TVs, consumer electronics and publishing, computers
and games. What is driving the change is the onrush of computer technology
invading and conquering all these domains. The computer industry is converging
with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged
with the horse, the TV with the nickelodeon, the word processing program
with the typewriter, the computer-aided design program with the drafting
board and digital desktop publishing with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.<BR>
<BR>
The computer industry feeds on the explosive advance of semiconductor and
networking electronics: 1) the law of the microcosm, which shows that microchip
cost-effectiveness rises by the square of the number of transistors crammed
on a single chip, and 2) the law of the telecosm, which shows that computer
cost- effectiveness rises by the square of the number of computers connected
to networks. According to the famous projection of Intel Corp. chairman
Gordon Moore, the number of transistors on a single chip will double every
18 months. According to the record of the last five years, the number of
computers attached to networks is rising too fast to measure. Only by comprehending
the full force of the computer juggernaut can one anticipate the future
of the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Focusing on the technologies alone, however, is not enough, because the
new technologies are often retrofit into failing industries and concepts.
To grasp the telefuture, it is still necessary to see the domonetics of
the technologies--their social and cultural effects and contexts.<BR>
<BR>
The microcosm and telecosm have generated a rich business and domestic culture--a
supporting social fabric of PCs and network users--that not only nurtures,
sustains, applies and expands the technologies but also is enriched and
empowered by them. In positive feedback loops, the customers of the PC culture
are also its creators and protagonists. If you keep your eyes on this culture,
you can anticipate the sources and vectors of growth. If you focus on the
hype of old industries--television and telephony, Hollywood and electronic
games, consumer appliances and other diversionary devices--you will miss
the real action. 
<H3>The Logic Of Technology</H3>
Behind all the changes are the supply-side rhythms of creative destruction.
Radical innovations sweep nearly unnoticed through the economy from obscure
niches such as Woz's garage, Bill Gates' Basic, Bob Metcalfe's ether, Bolt
Beranek &amp;Newman's Internet, Carver Mead's laboratories and Bob Noyce's
workbench. On the heels of these seminal tides come much expensive hype
and hullabaloo from the established industry, which is trying to absorb,
deflect or co-opt the threat. This rhythm of real enterprise and reactive
public relations explains why the telefuture prophesied in Life After Television
rushed in faster than expected, and why the key developments are often downplayed
or misinterpreted today. The publicity is easier to see than the broad tides
of change that have swept through society since 1989.<BR>
<BR>
Take John Malone and Tele-Communications Inc., for example. They are important
not for the new dealmaking spectacles but for decades of enterprise that
have created a new broadband network unique in the world. With links to
63 percent of America's homes--coaxial lines with a capacity some 416,000
times the capacity of telephone twisted-pair wires and easily upgradeable
to two-way communications--the cable industry commands a key resource for
the telefuture.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, as Malone consummated his network, he and TCI were still
discussed by the press chiefly in the idiom of organized crime. Mostly financed
by junk bonds, Cable TV was derived at telecommunications meetings as a
conspiracy of political action committees--&quot;PACs with coax&quot;--foisting
junk services on the American people. Malone and his colleagues appeared
in the pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times chiefly in
exposes of corporate chicanery.<BR>
<BR>
By 1993, though, the &quot;cable czar&quot; had reemerged as Dr. Malone,
the reigning genius of America's broadband future. TCI loomed as the spearhead
of a cable industry that had become a unique American resource, putting
the US as much as a decade ahead of Japan and Europe on the information
superhighway.<BR>
<BR>
Even Malone could not keep up with the pell-mell pace of change. In the
early summer of 1992, on a panel at a NewsCorp Conference, he told me, &quot;There
is no short-term need to accelerate the deployment of fiber optics&quot;
in the cable system. The winners would follow a strategy of &quot;step-by-step,
incremental change,&quot; he told the crowd of news executives and Twentieth
Century Fox movie and broadcasting magnates.<BR>
<BR>
But the logic of the technology soon engulfed him. Less than a year later,
on April 12, 1993, Malone publicly committed his company to a $2 billion
investment in fiber--to connect a non-incremental 90 percent of his customers
over the following four years. On October 13, 1993, he sold out, probably
at the top, to Raymond Smith's Bell Atlantic Corp., once a sleepy-time regional
Bell, now an entrepreneurial dervish on the digital highway. &quot;There's
no time to waste in deploying this infrastructure,&quot; Malone then explained.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the great information companies financed by Michael Milken's junk
bonds were still seen as sleazy corpocracies teetering on towers of debt.
By 1993 TCI, McCaw Cellular, MCI, Turner, NewsCorp, Viacom and Time Warner--collective
beneficiaries of $10 billion of Milken funds--had emerged as the titans
of the new information economy and ruled the business pages of the press
or months on end. Scorned in 1989 as part of a Milken scam or &quot;Ponzi
scheme&quot; by Benjamin Stein in Barrons, James B. Stewart in the Wall
Street Journal, Connie Bruck in the New Yorker and other acclaimed reporters
and analysts, TCI and McCaw together attained in 1993 a total market value
of around $50 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the most weighty wisdom on the future of media was the &quot;Negroponte
switch&quot;--the theory launched by Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media
Lab that what currently goes by air--chiefly broadcast video--would soon
switch to wires (fiber optic and coax), while what currently goes by wires--chiefly
voice telephony--would massively move to the air.<BR>
<BR>
In Life After Television I urgently touted the Negroponte switch. I still
believe it brilliantly captures the key vectors of change. Shortly afterward,
though, I began to have my doubts that the victory of fiber as a delivery
system would be quite so total as I had imagined. After all, the spectrum
of electromagnetic vibrations is essentially infinite, and several companies,
led by Motorola, were offering wireless local area network (LAN) equipment
operating at Ethernet or Token Ring data rates in the 18-gigahertz band--a
frequency previously used chiefly in outer space. Moreover, BIIC, Photonics
and other firms were offering LANs in the infrared bands of the spectrum--up
in the terahertz and beyond--previously used in the air only by low-data-rate
TV remotes (although infrared pulses were the medium of fiber optics).<BR>
<BR>
By 1994 the vision of scarce spectrum behind the Negroponte switch was in
a rout. Qualcomm Corp. of San Diego introduced a cellular technology that
allowed use of the entire spectrum in every cell (rather than permitting
frequency reuse only once every seven cells as in current cellular technology).
By creating smaller cells in larger numbers, it would be possible to multiply
spectrum almost without limit while drastically lowering handset power usage.
Spectrum once too scarce to waste on video was becoming as cheap and abundant
in the air as in wires, where fiber optics had already opened an era of
potential bandwidth abundance. Andrew Grove, CEO of Intel, memorably declared:
&quot;You think computer prices are plummeting. Wait till you see what happens
to bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Still, there remained limits to the use of higher frequencies for communication.
Higher frequencies, it was believed, created prohibitive problems of interference
and power. Rain, for example, would drown out microwave communications.
Pigeons would fry on the antennas. Then Cellular Vision of New York Inc.
overthrew this conventional wisdom. It announced in the fall of 1992 that
it was broadcasting 49 channels of studio-quality video in the 28-gigahertz
band of the electromagnetic spectrum to 500 homes in the Borough of Queens.
The total cost was some $300 per home. Months later, Gigahertz Equipment
of Phoenix was seeking similar licenses in the West.<BR>
<BR>
Although many observers scoffed at these microwave ventures, on August 4,
1993, Bell Atlantic signed up to market the system through the City of New
York and in neighboring suburbs to the north. US West signed up with Gigahertz
to supply service in its own region.<BR>
<BR>
Shaking most of the certainties of 1980s conventional wisdom, such insurgencies
all stemmed from the still deeper forces of the microcosm and telecosm--described
in Life After Television--that are still gaining momentum in 1994 and will
continue to cascade through the technoscapes of the coming decade. 
<H3>The Avalanche Of Bits</H3>
But with Milken banished from financial markets and Malone in harvest mode,
who will ride the next avalanche of bits on the information superhighway--and
who will be buried under it? Widely regarded as likely winners are Edward
McCracken of Silicon Graphics Inc., the aspiring king of the set-top box
and the video server, and Jim Clark, SGI founder and chairman until February
28 (when he will leave to start his own interactive TV software company).
In the form of 3D graphics hardware and software, SGI's technology is central
to the triumph of computers over television and games. Yet the company's
present strategy is to retrofit these digital engines into the television
set-top boxes and Nintendo game machines of the pre-computer culture. Clark
hopes to provide the content.<BR>
<BR>
SGI offers compelling reasons for this strategy: production volumes and
foundries for the Mips 4000 microprocessor family comparable to those of
the Intel X86 standard; a siphon amid the possible floods of software revenues
to be earned by Nintendo using the SGI architecture; and sales of SGI superservers
to the television programming industry. But in harvesting these benefits
over the next five years, SGI and Clark risk dissipating their energies
by serving the industries of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Is Mickey Schulhof of Sony Corp. going to countervail these trends? He is
trying to converge and digitize all the technologies of the past into a
pi$ata of new consumer appliances, musical hits, videogames and movies,
making blockbuster turkeys such as &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and selling
everything but the feathers and the popcorn. Schulhof grandly plans to rule
both ends of the information superhighway, with Hollywood video and musical
content and a panoply of appliances to play them, from high-definition TV
sets to minidiscs, CDs and videotapes, game players and walkmasters. But
Sony may merely be supplying digital cosmetics to two dying industrial establishments:
Hollywood and consumer electronics. Making an array of incompatible and
incommunicable devices, Sony is defying both the law of the microcosm, which
compels the distribution of intelligence, and the law of the telecosm, which
asserts the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
Lest the information superhighway clog up with wrecked hopes and misbegotten
plans, let us look for the false assumptions behind some of the disappointments
of today.<BR>
<BR>
GTE's Cerritos, Calif., project--the first full test of interactive services,
launched in the mid-1980s-- rolled out its cornucopia of on-demand video,
instant banking, shopping, games and other services to an indifferent marketplace.
Although the results are still shrouded in secrecy, news reports suggested
that people just didn't want to take the trouble. US West and TCI are said
to have made similar discoveries in Denver. If the world lusts for interactivity,
why does it spurn the leading interactive market tests?<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;killer app&quot; for these new broadband systems is supposed to
be pay-per-view television. But, says Frank Biondi, president of Viacom,
&quot;there has been no serious take-up for pay-per-view in 20 years. We
are way behind revenue projections on motion picture pay-per-view.&quot;
When Time Warner raised its pay- per-view movie bandwidth from five to 60
channels in the Borough of Queens, monthly revenue is reported to have risen
by only some $4 per home. &quot;If people really hated going down the block
to pick up a movie, video stores would have a thriving delivery business
today,&quot; commented Michael Noll of the University of Southern California
in the software newsletter Release 1.0.<BR>
<BR>
3DO's new super-Cd-ROM multiplayer and graphics processor may someday find
a market outside Wall Street. But judging from the fall of the company's
stock price, from a high of 48-1/4 when the machine was launched into stores
last October to 26 in mid-January, sales have been disappointing. 3DO indicated
that some 50,000 units had been shipped to retailers, compared with earlier
company projections of &quot;fewer than 100,000&quot; and euphoric expectations
of many more. Similarly, after investment of untold hundreds of millions
of dollars, the Philips CD-I players still lag in the marketplace. If the
world is rushing to multimedia, why is it so slow to embrace the leading
new multimedia players? 
<H3>&quot;Like Feeding Vitamins To A Horse&quot;</H3>
Games show magnate Jon Goodson of Mark Goodson Productions declares that
people don't want to interact with game shows. &quot;It changes the game--for
the worse.&quot; A 1993 Dataquest study reported that people really don't
want to interact with sports events. TV Answer, now Eon, and Interactive
Networks both failed to break through with plans to supply interactivity
to current-day televisions over special radio frequencies allocated for
the purpose by the FCC. Hollywood has determined that audiences have no
interest in shaping the outcomes of films; they want to be surprised. If
people don't want to interact with video, how can the world move beyond
television?<BR>
<BR>
The new standard for digital HDTV, though far ahead of the old analog systems,
will not be officially unveiled until 1995, according to Richard Wiley,
chairman of the FCC's Advisory Committee on Advanced Television. The broadcast
companies that are supposed to adopt it are mostly uninterested. &quot;We
see no way any of us will make money out of this thing,&quot; says John
Swanson, vice-president, engineering, at Cox Broadcasting.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb companies have been
disappointments--Raynet and BroadBand Technologies have had difficulty selling
their equipment. A superb passive optical technology has so far failed to
save BroadBand's stock price. It tumbled from a high of 52 early in 1993,
amid the uproar over the information superhighway, to a low in the mid-20s
by the end of January 1994 as revenue projections were lowered by analysts.
Raychem has pumped more than $100 million into Raynet without yet generating
a profit. Meanwhile, the telephone companies have been dallying with a new
system called Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line, which will let them
send full-motion video down a conventional phone line at six megabits per
second (near to the practical rate of an Ethernet computer network). Although
Eli Noam of the Columbia University Telecommunications Center says ADSL
is &quot;like feeding vitamins to a horse rather than buying a truck,&quot;
the phone companies feel that if they have to compete with TV, it is cheaper
to supercharge the old copper nag for the last few hundred yards.<BR>
<BR>
On the content side the picture is equally cloudy. At multimedia conventions,
television executives declare that there is no way they can make money with
the kind of stuff currently available on CD-ROMs and other such platforms.
During intermissions they mutter off the record that the only way to jump-start
this market is through virtual sex. In the late 1980s the entire Japanese
electronics industry was riding high with the harvest of profits from decades
of investment in consumer electronics. Deciding that &quot;content is king,&quot;
Sony and Matsushita each bought major Hollywood studios. As these companies
moved on toward HDTV, Western pundits prophesied that Japan would dominate
all advanced electronic industries, from semiconductors to supercomputers.
Instead, however, the Japanese electronics industry entered a period of
prolonged decline, suffering heavy financial setbacks and even losing its
lead in semiconductors to American firms. 
<H3>Strategists Focused On Wrong Industry</H3>
From Cerritos to Denver and on to Orlando, Omaha and Castro Valley, from
3DO to CD-I and beyond, from BroadBand to Raynet, from Sony to NEC, the
current and impending disappointments spring from one key mistake. With
some notable exceptions, the leading strategists are focusing on the wrong
industry. You can't get beyond television by collaborating with TV companies
in their long slide to obsolescence. You can't create a new information
infrastructure by propping up the old telephone networks with the right
to provide tv-type services.<BR>
<BR>
The new 3DO and Philips CD-I game machines, for example, both link to interlaced
TV screens that display every other line and then fill in the gaps on a
second sweep. Interlaced screens mean cumbersome text and limited graphics.
Interlaced screens doom multimedia to a fringe videotext fuzz. Yet these
new game players shun the personal computer and its installed base of 33
million home units in order to build up a new installed base from scratch,
connecting to visually inadequate televisions.<BR>
<BR>
Interactivity, almost by definition, is a computer function, not a television
function. Making the boob tube into an interactive hive of theater, museum,
classroom, banking system, shopping center, post office and communicator
is contrary to the nature of the box.<BR>
<BR>
Millions of Americans, however, are eager to turn their personal computers
to these pursuits. Therefore, it is natural that nearly all the relevant
activity is in the computer industry rather than in the television industry.
The PC world provides an environment totally alien to the downside dirges
of consumer electronics.<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker has said, an entrepreneur should always heed the upside
surprises. Upside surprises distract business leaders from a deadening focus
on problems and target them on their opportunities. In the information economy,
the best opportunities stem from the exponential rise in the power of computers
and computer networks, microcosm and telecosm. In the computer industry,
all the surprises tend to come on the upside.<BR>
<BR>
For example, early in 1993 the two leading experts in the field, Bill Gates
of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel, both boldly predicted total PC sales
between 35 and 40 million, up from a stupendous 32 million in 1992. In an
outcome first predicted in February by semiconductor analyst Daniel Klesken
of Robertson Stephens, the actual number came in at nearly 50 million, between
25 and 40 percent above the forecasts--during what was widely reported as
a down year for computer companies.<BR>
<BR>
This drastic surprise engendered waves of similar upside surprises through
the industry. Despite a chaos of competing architectures and aspiring standards
that meant any particular CD-ROM would most likely not be playable on your
machine, the sales of multimedia-ready computers rose from a few thousand
high-end devices in 1989 to some three-and-a-half million in 1993, bringing
in some $5 billion in revenues. Despite general disappointment in the quality
of the titles, the sales of CD-ROMs soared from a few hundred thousand in
1989 to nearly five million in 1993. As a harbinger of the future, sales
of encyclopedias in CD-ROM format surpassed those of book copies in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
More important is the explosive rise in networks. Since 1989 the share of
US computers attached to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more
than 60 percent. Some 15 million are now attached to the network of networks--the
Internet--up from a few score thousand in 1989. For several years the Internet
grew at a pace of 15 percent per month.<BR>
<BR>
The fatal flaw of Silicon Graphics, 3DO, AT&amp;T, Raynet, Eon and QVC is
that they are trying to solve the problems of the telephone, TV, videogame
and consumer appliance companies. The problems of these separate industries
are unsolvable in the face of the integrating sweep of the computer networking
industry juggernaut. Television problem solving just distracts computer
firms from their huge and hugely demanding opportunity to usurp phones,
televisions and videogame players entirely with multimedia PCs and networks.
The huge telecom and consumer firms must be enlisted in their true role:
supplying networks, peripherals and programs for the computer industry.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood may still be full of glamour, but the surest sell sign for a technology
company is still a star- struck CEO. It is not altogether reassuring to
hear Terrence Garnett, Oracle's vice-president, multimedia, discussing his
boss' place in the industry. After schmoozing at a party with Hollywood
stars, Garnett confided to a reporter: &quot;I would have a hard time picturing
Lewis Platt [president of Hewlett Packard] sitting at that party. I mean,
you look at Larry Ellison and you could see him in that environment. I couldn't
see Jim Manzi [president of Lotus Development] or Philippe Kahn [president
of Borland] there. They don't look good in Armani.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most Hollywood-savvy executive of Silicon Valley is Jerry Sanders of
Advanced Micro Services. Star-struck at age 20 and bent on becoming a star,
he discovered shortly afterward that actors are mostly fungible functions
and their glamour mostly meretricious. Rather than trying to get rich in
Hollywood, he decided to enjoy Hollywood on his own terms after he got rich
in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
The irony is that technology companies actually hurt the movie business
more than they help it. The central message of Life After Television for
the film industry is that the new technologies are targeted directly at
Hollywood. Today some 70 percent of the costs of a film go to distribution
and advertising. In every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key
impact of the computer networking revolution is to collapse the costs of
distribution and remove the middlemen. The movie business is now mostly
middlemen. In an information industry such as the movie business, distribution
costs will predictably plummet if the movie business embraces networking.
<H3>TVs And Telephones: Change Or Crash</H3>
Anyone with access to the information superhighway will be able to distribute
a film at a tiny fraction of current costs. Moreover, webs of glass and
light will free the producer from the burden of creating a product that
can attract miscellaneous audiences to theaters. Instead, producers will
be able to reach equally large but more specialized audiences dispersed
around the globe. Rather than making lowest- common-denominator appeals
to the masses, film makers will be able to appeal to the special interests,
ambitions and curiosities of individuals anywhere, anytime.<BR>
<BR>
Limiting these opportunities at present are both the bottleneck of telephone
nets and the runaway costs of film making. Personal computers will not only
pulverize the costs of distribution, they will also drastically diminish
the costs of actual film production. Today leading directors can still imagine
that they alone command the capital to deploy the new digital production
and editing tools. But any capability now costing a few hundred thousand
dollars is sure to cost less than $20,000 in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Just as digital desktop publishing equipment unleashed thousands of new
text-publishing companies, so the new digital desktop video-publishing systems
will unleash thousands of new filmmakers. The video business will increasingly
resemble not the current film business, in which output is 100 or so movies
a year, but the book business, in which some 55,000 new hardcover titles
are published annually in the US alone. After all, scores of thousands of
screenplays are already written every year. In the next decade thousands
of screenwriters will be able to make and distribute their own films.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood, meanwhile, will move toward providing enhanced experiences through
virtual reality and other expensive technologies. The current harbinger
is Circus Circus' Luxor resort in Las Vegas, a gigantic pyramid that is
briefly the world's largest hotel. Luxor is not just another Vegas casino:
It serves chiefly as a dormitory for six ride-film theaters on the first
floor. Luxor cost some $375 million to build. The largest expense was the
$40 million invested in the ride-films at the heart of the project. The
individual who made these films was Douglas Trumbull, formerly Hollywood's
leading supplier of special effects and now an enemy of the Hollywood establishment.
He is pioneering the new technologies of theatrical presentation--a field
abandoned by Hollywood in the 1950s when antitrust laws were interpreted
as barring film companies from owning theaters. Trumbull's first ride-film
hit, the incandescent Back to the Future, The Ride, saved the Universal
Theme Park in Orlando and set a new technical standard for the medium.<BR>
<BR>
Life After Television did not merely predict a technical revolution; it
predicted a cultural upheaval. Moving authority from elites and establishments
to creators and customers, the new technologies drastically change the cultural
balance of power. Shifting the optimal target of commercial art from vulgar
taste and sensations to special interests, curiosities, hobbies, ambitions
and artistic aspirations, digital multimedia machines will transform the
marketplace and elevate the culture. Only by addressing the new opportunities
will companies prosper and prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Computer networks are the pivotal technology of the new era. They are the
chief engine of the division of labor--the force of creativity and specialization
that Adam Smith identified as the key driver of economic growth. And they
are the reigning spearhead of the creative destruction that Joseph Schumpeter
saw as the key to all economic progress. The domonetics of computer networks
are active and dynamic rather than passive and diversionary. Unlike games
and movies, computer networks endow people with new powers of self-improvement
and wealth creation. They free individuals from the shackles of corporate
bureaucracy and geography and allow them to collaborate and exchange ideas
with the best colleagues anywhere in the world. Computer networks give every
hacker the creative potential of a factory tycoon of the industrial era
and the communications power of a TV magnate of the broadcasting era.<BR>
<BR>
The accelerating spread of computer networks in the early 1990s explains
the high sense of opportunity and possibility in an economy otherwise in
the doldrums. To prevail all industries will have to adapt to network powers
and constraints. This means telephone and TV companies will have to change
or crash. It also means that to fulfill the promise of the Information Age,
computer companies will have to adapt to the laws of the microcosm and telecosm.
They will have to stop dallying with game machines and set-top boxes, stop
their infatuation with Hollywood and embrace the empowering promise of their
own machines.<BR>
<BR>
Leading any list of companies that grasp this reality are Apple and Intel.
Both have made large strides in the past year toward the overthrow of the
establishments of consumer electronics, telephony and television.<BR>
<BR>
Although Apple suffered sharp setbacks in 1993, the &quot;teleputer&quot;
strategy launched by John Sculley in recent years began to bear fruit that
same year in such pioneering products as the Quicktime multimedia operating
system, the Macintosh TV and the Mac Quadra 840AV.<BR>
<BR>
First came the Mac TV, which boldly subsumed a full cable-ready television
set in a Macintosh computer, together with a stereo CD-ROM drive, all in
one chassis. Connectable to a VCR, camcorder, laserdisc or videogame player,
the Mac TV cost around $2,000 and signals a new epoch.<BR>
<BR>
Moving still closer to the teleputer ideal of the multimedia production
center is the Mac Quadra 840AV. Standing for audio-visual, the AV fulfills
the ultimate promise of the teleputer as a device that can not only display
digital video but also store, edit and transmit it. With input port for
all TV standards--including the European PAL and the American NTSC and studio
modes S-video and composite video--the Quadra AV can convert analog images
to a digital bit stream to be stored, edited and then transmitted. The AV
can also function as a phone and stereo and contains an advanced digital
signal processor that imparts powers of speech recognition and synthesis.
Rivaled as a multimedia machine only by the most costly and powerful Silicon
Graphics Indy workstation, the Quadra AV is unique in its pattern-matching
and voice-recognition features.<BR>
<BR>
In early December 1993 in Tokyo, Apple introduced the latest version of
Quicktime running Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG standard) video at
30 frames per second on a Mac Quadra. Fujitsu Ltd.'s announcement that it
was licensing the technology for its own line of video computers signified
a growing awareness that Quicktime was becoming a worldwide multimedia standard
even before the Kaleida multimedia system and the so-called Power PC emerged
from an Apple-IBM partnership.<BR>
<BR>
Fulfilling Sculley's promise of usurping both phone and television set,
these new computers and their software represent the first generation of
the multimedia era. Already an upside surprise, the Quadra 840AV moved quickly
to the forefront among Apple best-sellers, showing that Apple can still
do best in the marketplace through genuine innovations. These technologies
do not ape the price points and form factors of consumer electronics; they
do not hunker down or twist themselves into pretzels to fit in a set- top
box. These products extend the PC imperium into new territory.<BR>
<BR>
However, in a world with Intel chieftain Andy Grove aboard, Apple cannot
rest on its teleputer laurels. Intel is still more fiercely focused on the
prize. As Grove says: &quot;The PC is it. That sums up Intel's business
plan and rallying cry.&quot; Scorning the obsession with set-top boxes elsewhere
in the industry, he explains: &quot;The PC is already in 30 percent of the
nation's homes. How long will it be before these new set-top boxes are in
30 percent of homes? And what will PCs be doing by then? The PC is not any
one thing. It is a continuing phenomenon, and every couple years its definition
changes. The Intel goal is to make sure that the living organism of the
PC evolves in the right direction to continue as the dominant interactive
appliance in both home and business. The PC is not a fixed product but a
continuum. By contrast, the set-top box is a stationary machine. The set-top
box won't have the volume, the installed base, the software or the adaptability
of the PC. By the time they get all the necessary functions into the set-top
box at the right price point, the PC will be controlling the TV as a mere
peripheral.&quot; Grove's warning is exactly on target. 
<H3>Bandwidth Frees Computers' True Power</H3>
Bruce Ryon, Dataquest's chief multimedia analyst, observes: &quot;If you
talk to the cable set-top box guys, they are all saying that they are not
going to get to the price points they need until three to five years out.&quot;
After three to five more years of Moore's Law, the PC will be a multimedia
machine with some eight times the power and storage capacity at the same
price that brought nearly 50 million unit sales in 1993 and, according to
Robertson Stephens' Klesken, promises to bring some 55 million unit sales
in 1994. At this pace, within four or five years, PC penetration into homes
will pass 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all these PCs will be connected to networks--most of them with
10 megabits per second or more of bandwidth--and most will run internal
buses (linking processors to memory and display) at rates of close to a
billion bits per second, ample for full-motion video.<BR>
<BR>
These new PCs being prepared at Intel and Apple will merge with the new
tools of the information superhighway. Technologies of fiber optics and
wireless communications, glass and air, they are advancing as fast as the
microchip technologies of sand. Together they will consummate the computer
revolution and wreak a new revolution in telecom.<BR>
<BR>
Until endowed with broadband connections, the computer is a cripple that
devotes huge portions of its processing power merely to compressing, decompressing,
coding and decoding its data for the telephone system bottleneck. It is
because of this bottleneck that the true power of the PC remains obscure
to many observers. It is because of this bottleneck that the TV and consumer
electronics industries can imagine themselves a significant rivals to the
PC. But once provided with broadband communications, the PC will come fully
into its exponential harvest from microcosm to telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
As Grove points out: &quot;Infinite processing power will get you only so
far with limited bandwidth. But the coming era of nearly free bandwidth
will liberate the computer to fulfill its powers. Just as the 1980s saw
the demolition of the vertical structure of the computer industry, so the
1990s will see the demolition of the vertical structure of the communications
industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To accelerate the day, at the December 1993 Western Cable TV Show, Intel
announced that it is developing a new computer on-ramp for the information
superhighway. In league with General Instrument and Hybrid Technology, Intel
demonstrated a modem to connect computers to cable TV coax at Ethernet speeds
of 10 megabits per second. One of several firms preparing to release computer
powers onto cable networks, Intel has the manufacturing clout and marketing
power to make cable PC a widespread reality.<BR>
<BR>
To prepare for this new era of broadband teleputing, Intel is introducing
a new bus standard, PCI, that runs at video speeds--around a gigabit per
second. With Apple's recent endorsement, PCI seems likely to become the
prevailing system for personal computer internal communications. At the
same time, Intel announced a full desktop teleconferencing system. Doggedly
pursuing the dual goal of integrating both voice and video with the computer,
Intel is far more ready to exploit the new era than firms panting after
Paramount and Nintendo.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, neither the Intel nor the Apple machines bring nirvana. As
multimedia guru Eric Hoffert of Apple points out, the consummated teleputer
requires 10 key advances. They include an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
interface, fast real-time compression/decompression chips, a full 64-bit
microprocessor, a real-time operating system that can schedule events for
specific times, internal buses that run the gigabits-per-second of raw high-definition
video flows, networked multimedia standard software to sustain new applications,
and improved human interfaces for multimedia communication and access to
media databases. Furthermore, the teleputer will demand huge storage devices
for the many gigabytes of data in ambitious multimedia projects. Finally,
it will entail new ways of encrypting and metering information so that the
creators can be paid for each access rather than requiring customers to
&quot;buy the reservoir,&quot; as Wave Systems chief Peter Sprague puts
it, &quot;every time you want a drink of water.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although these capabilities are available today, their cost remains in the
scores of thousands of dollars. Without these features, even the AV and
the Indy suffer nagging limits in storing, processing, editing and transmitting
the full-motion, full-screen, high-resolution digital video of our dreams.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if this were the television industry, such a machine would remain
a dream for decades to come. But in the entrepreneurial crucible of the
PC industry, all these dreams can come true at the remorseless pace of Moore's
Law. Within the next five years, cheap desktop machines could not only show
digital movies of full quality and resolution, but also create, edit and
transmit them.<BR>
<BR>
With this development at hand, all through Wall Street a warning is whispered:
&quot;The train is leaving the station.&quot; Content is scarce. If you
don't get it now, you will be left behind with the nerds in polyester.<BR>
<BR>
So why didn't Andy Grove join the race with Viacom's Sumner Redstone, QVC's
Barry Diller and all the rest for the grand prize of Paramount? Couldn't
someone at Intel find him an Armani suit? Paramount is worth $10 billion.
Intel is worth around $25 billion. It could easily swallow up the movie
giant and combine the Intel computer and communications tools with Paramount's
creative treasures.<BR>
<BR>
Even more significant, though, if the train is leaving the station, where
is America's sometimes richest man, the world's leading digital software
tycoon? Most of the prerequisites for the multimedia teleputer are software
projects now under way at Microsoft. Why didn't Bill Gates join the Hollywood
rush? He is famously pursuing content, digitizing famous works of art. Like
Grove, Gates commands a company worth close to $25 billion. Gates could
scoop up Paramount into his content venture, Continuum Productions, and
become as famous and fashionable as he is rich.<BR>
<BR>
But Gates is the epitome of PC domonetics. Gates doesn't even own a TV set.
Without mentioning movies or games, he can spiel off dozens of detailed
ideas for applications for the digital highway in the time it takes John
Malone to list his market tests and caveats. Gates invested nearly 10 years
of fatigue and futility, money and energy in the CD-ROM market as an alternative
to TV. Today's triumph of the CD-ROM is a supreme vindication of Gates'
PC strategy. Why should he abandon it now?<BR>
<BR>
Train leaving the station? Gates told Forbes ASAP, &quot;That's a joke.&quot;
Gates has always acted on the assumption that Microsoft--or, more generally,
the PC--is the train and he is driving it. In 1985 he declared: &quot;Television
is passive entertainment. We're betting that people want to interact, choose
different paths and get feedback from the machine about what they have really
learned.&quot; Almost a decade later, in the January 10, 1994, New Yorker,
he was still making the same point. Calling interactive TV &quot;a really
bad name for the in-home device connected to the information highway,&quot;
he stated: &quot;The bottom line is that two-way communication is a very
different beast than one-way communication... A phone that has an unbelievable
directory [and] lets you talk or send messages to lots of people, and works
with text and pictures is a better analogy than TV... Because TV had very
few channels, the value of TV time was very high so only things of very
broad interest could be aired on those few channels. The information highway
will be the opposite of this--more like the Library of Congress but with
an easy way to find things.&quot; Exactly the message of Life After Television.<BR>
<BR>
Gates did not hustle after Hollywood. Barry Diller and Michael Ovitz had
to seek him out in Seattle. Bill Gates has fiercely focused Microsoft on
the PC culture. In the NT operating system, he is pushing a system with
multimedia interfaces, which thrusts Microsoft into the middle of the fray
in computer multiprocessing and computer networking. That is the heart of
the new era. 
<H3>PC's Superior Demographics</H3>
The reason Gates and Grove are not interested in Paramount is no mystery.
They don't need it. They already command a much larger, faster-growing,
more creative and more promising vehicle for their capital. Selling nearly
50 million units in 1993, at an average price some four times higher than
that of a TV, the PC is not only a bigger market than television and movies
put together, it is also a better market in every way. In 1992 the US computer
industry commanded total sales of $161 billion, compared with $104 billion
in total revenues for TV and films. The revenues from computer hardware
sales were more than six times the revenues from TV sales, and home computer
sales were growing 10 times as fast. More important, the demographics of
the PC industry are far superior. Television buyers are median American
couch potatoes who pay some $400 for their machines. PC buyers mostly come
from the upper income quintiles, usually have higher education and pay an
average of some $1,500 for their machines and then put out another $1,500
or so for software and peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
Most crucial of all is the difference in the use of the two devices. While
TV watchers use their machines to lull themselves and their children into
a stupor, PC users exploit their machines to become yet richer and smarter
and more productive--and still better able to exploit future computer advances.
The PC customer is also the creator of new applications and add-on devices.
The TV is a consumption product. The PC is a supply-side investment in the
coming restoration of the home to a central role in the productive dynamics
of capitalism, and the transformation of capitalism into a healing force
in the present crisis of home and family, culture and community.<BR>
<BR>
How can this be when the computer is so often condemned as a divisive and
polarizing force in American life, the tool of an elite of nerds, a weapon
of dehumanizing bureaucracy? These charges were partly valid for the mainframe
computers of old. But as the PC gains communications powers and evolves
into a teleputer, its social, cultural and political impacts change completely.
As it ushers in a life beyond TV, it becomes a powerful force for democracy,
individuality, community and high culture.<BR>
<BR>
The leading-edge computers always go first to the elites who can use them
best and help develop them for others. All new technologies are first purchased
by elites and mastered by them before they reach a larger public. The PC
plays a role in contemporary culture resembling the role of the Model T
automobile in 20th-century industrial culture.<BR>
<BR>
Owners of the Model T could not simply jump in and drive the machine. They
had to learn how to maintain and repair it. Many of them learned how to
take it apart and put it back together. They became an industrial elite
with the mechanical skills that won two world wars and propelled the US
to the forefront of the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the linked PCs of today and the teleputer networks of tomorrow
seem formidable--difficult to get in and drive. At times they appear to
be the tools of a new elite. But teleputers feed on the most rapid learning
curves in the world economy, and in proportion to their powers are the cheapest
technologies in history. Just as the TV, once an exotic tool of elites,
became even more ubiquitous in America than the telephone or the automobile,
the teleputer will end the decade not as a luxury but as an indispensable
appliance.<BR>
<BR>
It is companies that shun the PC of today in order to cater to the TV, consumer
electronics and telephone industries that will end up in luxury backwaters.
They will resemble the companies that catered to the mainframe trade early
in this decade, or those that catered to the horse business early in this
century. They may find exotic or intriguing niches. Yet just as the real
action was not at Churchill Downs or the Peapack Hunt Club but in Detroit,
the real action today--the source of wealth and power--is not at Nintendo
or Sega, Hollywood or QVC. It is in the scores of thousands of computer
and software companies that make up the industrial fabric of the Information
Age--the exhilarating new life after television.<BR>

<BR>
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder's </A>conservative cult classic, <I>Visible
Man</I>, is gaining attention in the midst of intense debates over welfare
reform and racism. Republication of <I>Visible Man</I>  is nothing if not
timely. <BR>
<BR>
In <I>Visible Man</I>, Gilder tells the the true story of Sam, a black youth
of the Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. For Gilder,
Sam is not a victim of racism, but the all-too conspicuous victim of government
policy. As the message of<I>Visible Man</I>  spreads the popularity of the
book seems to pick up momentum. <BR>
<BR>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich's monthly newsletter, &quot;Renewing
American Civilization,&quot; will feature <I>Visible Man </I>as the cover
article in November, and the book has been chosen as a monthly selection
for the newsletter's reader's circle. Gingrich, also has expressed interest
in including <I>Visible Man</I>  in the curriculum for his &quot;Renewing
American Civilization&quot; college course in 1996. Currently Reader's Digest
is considering publication of <I>Visible Man</I>  in a condensed form. In
August, Michael Medved had Gilder as a special guest on the Rush Limbaugh
radio program, which Medved guest-hosted while Limbaugh was on vacation.

Except for the infamous condemnation of Galileo by  the medieval Catholic Church, there wasn't much fuss over Copernicus's  heliocentric theory of the solar system. Or Harvey's theory of the circulation  of the blood, or Newton's theory of gravitation, or Mendel's theory of  biological inheritance, or Einstein's theory of relativity. Only Darwin's  theory has provoked radical and enduring differences of opinion among large  numbers of people. Even now, almost a century and a half after it was first  proposed, it continues to be the focus of heated scientific disagreements,  bitterly contested court cases, and politically charged school board debates.</P>  <P>What is at stake in the creation-evolution controversies, and why do  they generate so much passion? What are the prospects for a resolution?</P>  <P>At the heart of the controversies is the question of our own origin:  Where did we come from, and why are we here? This question is important  because the answer to it affects how we lead our lives. Central to every  culture is an account of origins - and the creation-evolution controversies  represent the collision of two radically different accounts, each competing  for the minds of our children.</P>  <P>One reason the creation-evolution controversies have proven so difficult  to resolve is that they involve a number of very distinct issues, - some  primarily theological and some primarily scientific, - which are often  confused with each other. What follows is an attempt to sort out some of  these issues, place them in their historical context, and evaluate their  relative importance in the debate.</P>  <P>Not only are there many distinct issues, but there are also many parties  to the debate. For example, there are young-earth creationists who believe  that all things were created in approximately their present form a few  thousand years ago; there are other creationists who accept the geological  time scale but reject the notion that all living things are descended by  natural mechanisms from a common ancestor; there are theistic evolutionists  who accept common descent and evolution by natural mechanisms but maintain  that God acted through those mechanisms; there are evolutionists who see  no need for God's involvement but question one or more aspects of Darwin's  theory; and there are other evolutionists who substantially agree with  Darwin's theory and its atheistic implications. Even these five categories  (which, like most categories, are somewhat artificial) do not do justice  to the complexity of the controversies, but they will help to illustrate  it as the issues are laid out below.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>THEOLOGICAL ISSUES</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Chronology</P>  <P>According to Darwin's theory, all plants and animals have gradually  evolved from one or a few primitive life forms by the natural selection  of random variations. This process would require vast periods of time,  - at least hundreds of millions of years. According to Genesis 1, however,  God created the world in only six days; and if one adds up the time allotted  for other events in the Old Testament, one finds only about 4,000 years  between the creation of the world and the birth of Jesus. Clearly, Darwin's  theory conflicts with a literal reading of biblical chronology.</P>  <P>Suprisingly, this conflict played almost no role in the nineteenth-century  debates over evolution. Thirty years before Darwin published <I>The </I>Origin  of Species in 1859, geologists had already found convincing evidence that  the earth was much older than 6,000 years. Most Christians accepted the  evidence and modified their interpretation of scripture accordingly. Some  allowed for a gap of undetermined duration between the six days of creation  and subsequent events, while others interpreted the Genesis days as symbols  of long ages. The gap theory departed less from a literal reading, but  the day-age theory was more consistent with the scientific evidence, and  by 1859 the latter was widely accepted even among conservative Christians.</P>  <P>Even the American fundamentalists of the 1920's, for the most part,  did not insist on a literal interpretation of biblical chronology. In the  Scopes &quot;monkey trial&quot; of 1925, creationist lawyer William Jennings  Bryan announced that he accepted the antiquity of the earth and the day-age  interpretation of Genesis. It was not until the 1960's that biblical chronology  rose to prominence in the creation-evolution controversies, largely through  the influence of engineer Henry Morris and the Institute for Creation Research  in San Diego.</P>  <P>Today, many young-earth creationists feel that the word of God has been  so adulterated by modern criticism that nothing short of defending its  literal truth will suffice. Some of these (such as Morris) consider Genesis  a testable scientific theory, and call themselves &quot;scientific creationists.&quot;  Other young-earth creationists are less concerned with biblical literalism  than with the goodness of creation: if all evils are due to the fall of  Adam and Eve, then the extinctions we see in the fossil record must be  more recent.</P>  <P>A major difficulty for young-earth creationists is that geological chronology  is based on several independent lines of scientific evidence. By observing  the rates at which sediments are presently being deposited and then measuring  the thickness of older sedimentary rocks, geologists can estimate how long  it took for those rocks to form. Also, when geologists find radioactive  elements and their decay products in rocks they can measure their ratios  and estimate probable ages from observed radioactive decay rates.</P>  <P>Young-earth creationists object that such estimates assume that rates  of sedimentation and radioactive decay have remained constant, - assumptions  which are impossible to verify empirically. Evolutionists (and many creationists)  dismiss these objections as unwarranted and implausible, and maintain that  geological chronology is scientifically well-established.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Providence</P>  <P>For Christian theists, God not only created the world but also continues  to sustain it and govern it, - an affirmation known as the doctrine of  providence. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, some  Enlightenment philosophers (known as &quot;deists&quot;) maintained that  after the initial creation God turned the world loose to run by itself,  like a machine.</P>  <P>Deism has profound theological implications. If God is necessary only  to account for the initial creation of the universe, then all subsequent  phenomena, - even the events of human history, - are explicable without  reference to God. Jesus may have been an extraordinary person, but the  incarnation was a myth. Prayer may be psychologically comforting, but otherwise  has no effect. If God has turned the creation loose to run by itself, then  Christianity loses its doctrine of providence, - and much of its religious  content.</P>  <P>But theism has profound scientific implications. If the natural order  is subject to divine control or intervention, then worldly phenomena cannot  be completely explained without reference to God. Most scientists in Darwin's  day were theists; they relied on natural laws to explain ordinary phenomena  and the results of their experiments, but considered some things (such  as human origins and biblical miracles) beyond the reach of naturalistic  explanation. When Darwin proposed that the Creator originally breathed  life into one or a few forms and then left them to evolve by natural processes,  he encountered significant opposition from theistic scientists. Geologist  Charles Lyell, who championed the idea that natural history could be explained  by the uniform operation of natural causes, and biologist Alfred Russel  Wallace, who proposed a theory of evolution similar to Darwin's, both insisted  that the origin of human beings was a special case requiring divine intervention.</P>  <P>Today the majority of biologists are atheists who believe that God does  not exist and that naturalistic explanations are sufficient. Yet a significant  number of biologists still consider themselves theists. Most are not young-earth  creationists, but instead accept geological chronology and either (1) acknowledge  the operation of natural laws in ordinary phenomena but believe that the  history of life included successive creative acts by God, or (2) acknowledge  the uninterrupted operation of natural laws but believe that God somehow  works through those laws. Examples of the first include physicist Alan  Hayward and geologist John Wiester, and examples of the second include  physicist Howard Van Till and biologist Terry Gray. For the sake of discussion,  the first group can be called successive creationists and the second theistic  evolutionists, though not everyone would agree with these labels. Successive  creationists and theistic evolutionists are less likely to be found in  the Institute for Creation Research than in the American Scientific Affiliation,  a large organization of Christians who are also scientists.</P>  <P>Science, as it is now generally understood, is limited to naturalistic  explanations which can be empirically tested. Both successive creationists  and theistic evolutionists acknowledge this &quot;methodological naturalism,&quot;  but disagree over its applicability. Creationists criticize theistic evolutionists  for applying it to all phenomena without reservation, and thus abandoning  the doctrine of providence and being deists in disguise. Theistic evolutionists  reply that they continue to affirm God's providential control of natural  processes, even those which appear to be random. Creationists object that  this affirmation adds nothing to naturalistic explanations, and is thus  meaningless. Theistic evolutionists respond that successive creationists  tie Christian belief to a &quot;God of the gaps&quot; who is constantly  forced to retreat in the face of scientific progress.</P>  <P>Both groups, of course, reject metaphysical naturalism (the philosophical  doctrine that God does not exist and nature is all there is), but creationists  argue that the methodological naturalism of the theistic evolutionists  is practically indistinguishable from metaphysical naturalism. Creationists  thus charge theistic evolutionists with being accommodationists who let  themselves be used by atheists to make Darwinism more palatable to Christians.  Theistic evolutionists, however, see themselves as defending the reasonableness  of Christianity in a culture dominated by science.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Design</P>  <P>One of the most fundamental doctrines in Christianity is that God created  the universe by design, according to a pre-conceived plan. According to  the Bible, God created us in His image. Regardless of whether He was continually  involved in providential history (theism), or left the world to evolve  on its own (deism), God intended from the start to produce human beings  as the final outcome.</P>  <P>As a student Darwin had studied William Paley's <I>Natural Theology</I>  (1802), which argued that someone who finds a watch on the ground can logically  infer that it was made by a watchmaker. Paley's argument from design was  intended to prove the existence of God, but Darwin argued that what seemed  to be design in living organisms was really due to random variations and  survival of the fittest. In Darwin's view all species are contingent, and  as the latest product of an inherently contingent process the human species  is the most contingent of all.</P>  <P>When botanist Asa Gray suggested that God guided evolution by designing  variations, Darwin rejected the idea. In his 1868 <I>Variation of </I>Animals  and Plants Under Domestication, Darwin argued that biological variations  are like the stones which an architect finds at the base of a cliff and  assembles into a house. Although each stone is shaped by natural law, in  regard to the use to which they may be put their shapes are accidental.</P>  <P>Darwin's exclusion of design goes beyond the deistic claim that evolution  is due solely to natural processes. Theistic evolutionists (even if they  are deists on the question of providence, as their creationist critics  allege) affirm as Christians that human beings are designed by God. Therefore,  they either attribute evolution to non-Darwinian mechanisms or they accept  Darwin's theory but reject his anti-teleological interpretation of it.  Just as Darwin argued that features which appear to be designed are actually  contingent, so theistic evolutionists argue (like Asa Gray) that variations  which appear to be random are actually designed.</P>  <P>The most vocal advocates of design in the creation-evolution controversies,  however, are creationists rather than theistic evolutionists. The creationists's  arguments sometimes resemble Paley's; that is, design in living organisms  is used to prove the existence of God. Evolutionists object that such arguments  are unscientific because they invoke the supernatural, and point out that  Paley's teleological proof for God's existence has been discredited on  philosophical and theological grounds.</P>  <P>But there is a deeper issue involved. As John Henry Newman put it, Christians  believe in design because they believe in God, not in a God because they  see design. Christians may believe in God for any number of reasons (such  as faith in the Bible, or personal religious experiences); their belief  in God then leads them to the conclusion that living things are designed.  Darwin's theory denies that conclusion, and thus logically denies God's  existence.</P>  <P>In other words, the issue is not whether one can infer God from design,  but whether one can infer design in living things at all. Accordingly some  design advocates, more sophisticated than Paley, focus on design alone.  They point out that design inferences deal with agency, not with the supernatural,  and thus are not inherently unscientific. For example, a jury is not being  unscientific when it infers design in the commission of a crime. This approach  to design is used in the biology textbook <I>Of Pandas and People </I>(1993),  which has provoked heated controversy in some school districts. Critics  continue to object that design inferences cannot scientifically be applied  to living things, since only a supernatural agent could have designed them;  but design advocates counter that the nature of the designer is a separate  issue.</P>  <P>Meanwhile, evolutionists argue (like Darwin) that one can infer the  absence of design from biological evidence. Paleontologist George Gaylord  Simpson concludes in <I>The Meaning of Evolution</I> (1967) that the facts  of evolution show man to be the result of a purposeless process that did  not have him in mind. The subtitle of zoologist Richard Dawkins's <I>The  Blind </I>Watchmaker (1986) is &quot;Why the evidence of evolution reveals  a universe without design.&quot; Creationists such as law professor Phillip  E. Johnson object that using biological evidence to argue against design  or a designer is no more scientific than arguing for design or a designer,  and charge evolutionists with misusing science as a platform for their  atheistic beliefs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Summary of the Theological Issues</P>  <P>Although biblical chronology is the most publicized theological issue  in the creation-evolution controversies, it is not the most central. Many  creationists and theistic evolutionists criticize young-earthers for their  stand on chronology, arguing that it is theologically unnecessary as well  as empirically untenable. A more important issue is whether God continues  to be providentially involved in the creation, or has turned it loose to  run by itself. Creationists insist that providence implies God's intervention  in natural events, while theistic evolutionists maintain that God's providence  underlies the natural causes which account for all pheneomena.</P>  <P>Even more important than providence is the issue of design. Christians  believe that the world was purposefully created, and that human beings  are the culmination of God's purpose. Creationists and theistic evolutionists  may disagree on other issues, but they are united in rejecting the Darwinian  claim that human beings are undesigned. By far the most important theological  question in the creation-evolution controversies is whether we are the  accidental by-product of purposeless mechanisms which did not have us in  mind, or the designed result of God's plan for creation.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>SCIENTIFIC ISSUES</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Genetics</P>  <P>Darwin observed that members of the same species differ from each other  in slight but sometimes significant ways. A breeder makes good use of these  differences by mating only those individuals with desirable characteristics.  After several generations such selection can produce dramatically different  breeds, and Darwin reasoned that if the process were extended indefinitely  it could produce separate species.</P>  <P>Darwin's theory required that the desired traits be heritable by the  offspring of the selected individuals. But he lacked a theory of heredity  to explain how this could happen, so his theory initially encountered opposition  from other scientists. Even after the re-discovery of Mendelian genetics  in 1900 Darwin's theory languished, since genetic mutations then seemed  to render natural selection unnecessary. Only in the 1920's and 1930's  did biologists successfully combine Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution,  and by the 1940's Darwin's theory re-emerged in the form of a &quot;modern  synthesis.&quot;</P>  <P>According to the modern synthesis: (1) organisms are composed of genetically  determined traits; (2) if a trait confers an advantage in the competition  for survival its gene is more likely than others to be transmitted to the  next generation; therefore (3) over the course of many generations the  advantageous gene (and its corresponding trait) will be found in a higher  proportion of individuals. In other words, evolution is explained as a  change in gene frequencies due to differential survival (i.e., natural  selection). The discovery of the structure and function of DNA in the 1950's  bolstered the modern synthesis by providing a molecular explanation for  how genes could determine traits, be inherited, and mutate to produce new  variations. Given its elegant simplicity and capacity to integrate evidence  from several fields, the modern synthesis continues to be widely accepted.</P>  <P>Nevertheless, a significant number of biologists find it inadequate.  In the 1970's geneticist Richard Lewontin reported that molecular analyses  of gene products in closely related species of fruit flies revealed no  correlation between gene frequencies and morphological differences. As  a result, some biologists (including Lewontin) are convinced that evolution  cannot be explained simply by changes in gene frequencies.</P>  <P>Some critics of the modern synthesis point out that artificial selection  reaches a limit beyond which no further change can be effected; even after  many generations of breeding, a dog is still a dog. Even if the theory  can explain small-scale &quot;microevolution&quot; within a single species  or between closely related species, some biologists doubt whether it can  explain large-scale &quot;macroevolution&quot; such as the emergence of  new body plans (e.g., vertebrates and invertebrates) or structural novelties  (e.g., eyes and wings). In the 1950's geneticist Richard Goldschmidt argued  that macroevolution could not be due to the gradual accumulation of small  changes but had to be the result of macromutations which produce large  changes in a single generation. Goldschmidt's ideas were not well received  at the time, but are now popular among some biologists (such as Stephen  Jay Gould) who doubt that the modern synthesis can explain macroevolution.  Other critics of Darwinian macroevolution (such as embryologist Brian Goodwin)  see complexity theory as a promising alternative.</P>  <P>The distinction between microevolution and macroevolution is important  in the creation-evolution controversies. According to the Bible, God created  the major types of living things (such as grass, trees, birds, whales,  cattle and people), but left open the possibility of diversification within  those major types. Therefore, most creationists have little or no problem  with microevolution, even when it is attributed to selective changes in  gene frequencies. The most celebrated example of Darwinian microevolution,  diversification of finch beaks on the Galapagos Islands, poses a challenge  only to those young-earth creationists who dispute the amount of time involved.  The second most celebrated example of microevolution, a change in the proportion  of light- and dark-colored moths due to industrial pollution in England,  doesn't even pose this challenge, since it occurred within our lifetime.</P>  <P>Major theological problems arise only when microevolution is extrapolated  to macroevolution. If all aspects of living things are due to changes in  gene frequencies resulting from differential survival, then features which  creationists attribute to design are reduced to products of natural mechanisms  which exclude design. But as creationists are quick to point out, the extrapolation  of Darwinian microevolution to macroevolution is rejected even by many  non-theistic biologists.</P>  <P>Such biologists, however, usually object to having their views cited  in defense of creationist arguments. They protest that although they may  doubt a particular theory of the process of macroevolution they do not  doubt the overall pattern of macroevolution. In their view the best alternative  to the modern synthesis is not creationism, but some form of non-Darwinian  evolution. According to theistic as well as non-theistic evolutionists,  the integrity of the scientific enterprise requires biologists to exclude  creationist explanations and persevere in their search for natural mechanisms.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Fossils</P>  <P>One important source of evidence for the pattern of macroevolution is  the fossil record, which shows clearly that the earth was once populated  by organisms different from those now living. According to Darwin, the  history of life is like a branching tree, with one or a few primitive forms  at its base and extant forms at the tips of its branches. Darwin's theory  implies that there are numerous transitional forms linking the various  stages in the history of life, but nineteenth-century scientists objected  that fossils of those transitional forms had not been found. Darwin anticipated  this objection, and attributed the absence of transitional forms to the  widely acknowledged imperfection of the fossil record. Many forms may not  have been preserved in the first place, and many which were preserved may  have been destroyed by subsequent erosion.</P>  <P>Subsequent fossil-collecting has turned up some species with features  intermediate between previously-known fossils or living organisms (e.g.,  birds with reptile-like teeth), and many evolutionary biologists are convinced  that the fossil record has confirmed Darwin's theory. Other biologists,  however, have come to the opposite conclusion: they are convinced that  the fossil record shows Darwin's model of gradual transitions to be largely  incorrect. According to paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge,  the fossil record exhibits a pattern of &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot;  - fossils appear suddenly, persist unchanged for a time, then disappear.  The most dramatic example is the sudden appearance of most major categories  of living things in the early Cambrian (the first rocks in which abundant  fossils occur), but the same phenomenon occurs even on a smaller scale.</P>  <P>The theory of punctuated equilibria has convinced some biologists that  non-Darwinian mechanisms must be responsible for most fossil patterns.  Darwinian evolutionists maintain, however, that the absence of transitional  forms can still be explained by the imperfecton of the fossil record. Furthermore,  they argue, it would be theoretically possible for a new species to arise  fairly quickly through changes in gene frequencies if small numbers of  organisms became geographically isolated from the rest of the population;  upon returning to the original habitat, this new species would then seem  to appear suddenly in the fossil record. In other words, it is possible  to accept punctuated equilibria without abandoning Darwin's theory.</P>  <P>Creationists frequently cite punctuated equilibria in their arguments  against Darwinian evolution; some go so far as to claim that the fossil  evidence supports a creation model over Darwin's branching-tree model.  Like biologists who reject Darwinian macroevolution, however, biologists  who accept punctuated equilibria do not like to be used in support of creationist  arguments. They point out that they still agree on the fact of common descent,  which is the essential point of Darwin's branching tree model. Creationists  counter that the issue is not whether evolutionists agree on common descent,  but whether the evidence supports it. Evolutionists (theistic as well as  non-theistic) reply that common descent is the only scientific alternative  to divine intervention, and argue that it has been empirically established  on other grounds.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Homology</P>  <P>Biologists systematically classify organisms on the basis of their similarities  and dissimilarities. One has to be careful in choosing which similarities  to use, however; bats and butterflies use wings to fly through the air,  and whales and lobsters use horizontal tail flippers to propel themselves  through water, but classifying bats with butterflies and whales with lobsters  would overlook anatomical and physiological features which biologists consider  more important.</P>  <P>In the decades before Darwin's <I>Origin of Species</I>, biologists  used &quot;homology&quot; to refer to features which are structurally similar  even though they may perform dissimilar functions in different organisms  (such as the forelimbs of bats and whales), and &quot;analogy&quot; to  refer to features which perform similar functions in different organisms  but are structurally dissimilar (such as the wings of bats and butterflies).  Homologies justified similar classification, while analogies did not. The  resulting classification scheme was interpreted as a reflection of God's  plan for creation.</P>  <P>In Darwin's theory, however, the same classification scheme was re-interpreted  as the result of descent with modification. According to Darwin, the forelimbs  of bats and whales are similar not because they are created according to  a common plan but because they are inherited from a common ancestor. He  acknowledged that this did not resolve all cases of disputed classification,  but proposed that when in doubt the best guide is embryology; he considered  the common ancestry of the vertebrates, for example, to be demonstrated  by the striking similarity of their embryos at an early stage of development.</P>  <P>After 1859 homology was re-defined to mean similarity by common descent,  and many biologists turned from mere classification to the reconstruction  of &quot;phylogenies,&quot; or evolutionary histories of related organisms.  With the advent of molecular biology in the mid-twentieth century, DNA  sequences were added to the list of features which biologists could analyze  for homologies. Although (with rare and fragmentary exceptions) DNA is  available only from living organisms, it has become an important tool in  studying evolutionary patterns.</P>  <P>Some biologists, however, criticize the whole enterprise of inferring  ancestor-descendant relationships from similarities and dissimilarities.  In the 1960's some evolutionists (later dubbed &quot;cladists&quot;) argued  that according to Darwin's theory significant evolutionary changes occur  only when two lineages branch off from each other. Application of this  approach eventually led a few cladists to conclude that similarities and  differences among organisms can tell us nothing at all about ancestor-descendant  relationships. These &quot;transformed cladists&quot; (such as zoologist  Colin Patterson) are now critical of all attempts to reconstruct phylogenies  on the basis of homology.</P>  <P>Other biologists (mostly embryologists such as Brian K. Hall) criticize  the concept of homology itself. They point out that there are now at least  three definitions of the word: morphological homology (based on structural  similarity), phylogenetic homology (based on common descent), and embryological  homology (based on similarity of developmental pathways). Often, features  which are homologous by one definition are not homologous by the other  two. For example, octopus eyes and human eyes are structurally similar  but they are not derived from a common ancestral eye and their developmental  pathways are different, so they are morphologically homologous but phylogenetically  and embryologically non-homologous. Vertebrate forelimbs exhibit similar  skeletal patterns which are presumed to be inherited from a common ancestor,  yet their detailed developmental pathways are different, making them morphologically  and phylogenetically homologous but embryologically non-homologous.</P>  <P>Since phylogenetic homology presupposes common descent and thus cannot  be used to prove it, and since morphological and embryological homology  so often fail to coincide, inferring ancestor-descendant relationships  from homology is fraught with difficulties. Some creationists point to  these difficulties to demonstrate that the evidence for common descent  is disputed. Evolutionists respond that they remain convinced of common  descent, and challenge creationists to come up with a scientific alternative  which does not invoke divine creation. Creationists counter that this begs  the question, since the issue is whether naturalistic explanations are  adequate or need to be supplemented by explanations based on design and  creation. Evolutionists (theistic as well as non-theistic) reply that acts  of God have no place in science.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Summary of the Scientific Issues</P>  <P>According to the modern synthesis, evolution is caused by a change in  gene frequencies due to natural selection. Some biologists consider this  sufficient to account for all aspects of evolution, while others consider  it inadequate, especially as an account of large-scale macroevolution.  Despite this dispute over the process of evolution most biologists consider  the pattern of evolution to be well-established, primarily by evidence  from the fossil record and homology. Nevertheless, some biologists question  whether the pattern in the fossil record conforms to Darwin's gradualist  model of the history of life, while others question the use of homologies  to reconstruct ancestor-descendant relationships. Even these critics of  evolutionary theory, however, generally agree that living things are descended  from a common ancestor by natural mechanisms.</P>  <P>Creationists often cite disagreements among biologists to show that  Darwinian evolution is untrue, or at least unproved; some go so far as  to claim that the evidence demonstrates divine creation instead. Most biologists,  however, object to being used in support of creationist arguments, pointing  out that they all agree on common descent by natural mechanisms. Furthermore,  they argue, the integrity of the scientific enterprise requires them to  exclude divine intervention and rely on natural mechanisms to explain the  history of life.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>PROSPECTS FOR RESOLUTION</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Various polls have shown that only about 10% of the American people  accept Darwinian evolution; the remaining 90% are almost evenly divided  between young-earth creationists and those who believe that God was the  guiding force in the history of life. In other words, the vast majority  of Americans believe that we are the designed result of God's creative  activity, and that we should conduct our lives accordingly. Yet the only  view of human origins that can legally be taught in public schools is that  we are accidental by-products of purposeless natural processes, with survival  being the main criterion for how we conduct our lives. The ensuing controversies  are not only about creation and evolution, but also about who gets to teach  what to our children.</P>  <P>How can the controversies be resolved? Scientific creationists think  they can resolve them by requiring that Genesis be taught alongside Darwinian  evolution as a scientific theory. But this is unlikely to work, not only  because the courts prohibit it as an establishment of religion, but also  because it flies in the face of the available evidence and the way a great  many Christians interpret scripture. Some Darwinians think they can resolve  the controversies by calling evolution a fact. But this is unlikely to  carry the day, because except for the facts that (1) living things today  are different from those in the past and (2) it is possible to modify a  species by selection, virtually all of the evidence is interpreted in conflicting  ways among biologists themselves. Any reasonably neutral observer can see  that Darwinian macroevolution is a disputed theory, not an empirical fact.</P>  <P>When evolutionists say they agree on the &quot;fact&quot; of evolution,  they generally mean they agree on common descent and evolution by natural  mechanisms. Their conflicting interpretations of the evidence, however,  show that this agreement is at the level of philosophical commitment rather  than empirical inference. Like all scientists they share a commitment to  methodological naturalism: scientific explanations must exclude supernatural  causes and rely entirely on natural mechanisms. But unlike most pre-Darwinian  scientists, evolutionists believe that naturalistic explanations can account  for all phenomena in the history of life (even though we may not yet have  those explanations in hand).</P>  <P>Theistic evolutionists hope to resolve the controversies by affirming  this extension of methodological naturalism without surrendering belief  in God. But this is unlikely to work, because once they grant naturalistic  explanations such unlimited scope most of their non-theistic colleagues  regard their theistic beliefs as harmless and irrelevant, while most of  their creationist colleagues regard them as deists and accommodationists.</P>  <P>So although theistic evolutionists see themselves as mediators, they  do not occupy the common ground which could, potentially, resolve the creation-evolution  controversies.</P>  <P>What is that common ground? One feature of it must be, certainly, the  non-establishment of religion. Fortunately, all parties to the controversies  acknowledge the value of this. Even scientific creationists, who are regarded  by evolutionists as attempting to establish Christian fundamentalism, are  primarily rebelling against the establishment of atheism. As evolution  is currently taught in public schools, it frequently includes the claim  that we are accidental by-products of purposeless processes that did not  have us in mind. By any standard this claim has religious content, yet  the opposite viewpoint is systematically excluded from the classroom on  the grounds that it is religious rather than scientific. But evolutionists  who want to argue against divine purpose while claiming constitutional  immunity from counterarguments are like tennis players who won't let their  opponents hit the ball; eventually, the spectators and referees are going  to throw them off the court. If they want to continue teaching evolutionary  biology without creationist interference, then they would do well to avoid  theology.</P>  <P>Another feature of the common ground is limited methodological naturalism.  All parties to the creation-evolution controversies acknowledge the value  of explanations based on natural mechanisms; not even scientific creationists  expect biologists to attribute experimental results to divine intervention.  Methodological naturalism does not generate controversy, - only its axiomatic  extension to all phenomena, past as well as present. Students must be taught  that science is the search for naturalistic explanations, - it would be  a serious disservice to teach them otherwise, - but does that mean they  must be taught that science is omnipotent? Perhaps it would be wiser to  rear them to be like the great scientists of the past, who cultivated a  profound respect for the limits of their discipline and the limitless mystery  of the cosmos.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="46" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image51.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="59" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

One of these is a conflict over design.  According to the received view, the root of the conflict is that Darwinism  undermines the argument that God's existence can be proved from design  in living things.</P>  <P>It seems to me that there is a basic conflict between Christianity and  Darwinism on the issue of design. In my view, however, the source of the  conflict is not the argument that God's existence can be proved from design,  but something far more serious. The purpose of this essay is to analyze  the logical function of design in the controversy between Christianity  and Darwinism.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Christianity</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As used in the following discussion, &quot;Christianity&quot; refers  to the mainstream theological traditions of the Eastern Orthodox, Roman  Catholic, and Protestant branches of Christianity. To make the discussion  manageable, I have chosen two representative theologians from each branch:  Athanasius and Maximus from Orthodoxy; Augustine and Aquinas from Catholicism;  and Luther and Calvin from Protestantism. The only issue of interest here  is design: how does design function in the thought of these representative  theologians?</P>  <P>The first noteworthy observation is that arguments for the existence  of God from design in the creation are almost completely absent. Aquinas,  to be sure, referred in his <I>Summa Theologiae</I> to the tendency of  natural bodies to act for ends, as a way to prove the existence of God;  and he referred in his <I>Summa Contra Gentiles</I> to the argument that  God's existence can be proved from the general order of the world.1 In  the context of Aquinas' work as a whole, however, these references are  isolated and almost insignificant. Indeed, it has been argued that Aquinas  did not advocate a natural theology at all, but was merely cataloging arguments  used by others.2 Likewise, although Calvin wrote that God &quot;daily discloses  himself in the whole workmanship of creation,&quot; he considered the disclosure  to be &quot;in vain&quot; (because of the fall) without the &quot;spectacles&quot;  of scripture.3</P>  <P>In fact, the argument for God's existence from design in the creation  was something of an aberration in the history of Christian theology, its  prominence being limited to Anglo-American thought from the end of the  seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century. References  to design are prominent in the history of Christian theology, but not as  premises in proofs for the existence of God. Instead, design consistently  functions as a conclusion which follows from the nature of God. God's existence  thus implies design, rather then vice versa.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>For example, Athanasius affirmed, in opposition to Arianism, that the  full divinity of the Logos is the basic starting point for all Christian  theology. This means that the generation of the Logos must not have been  an act of God's will, as though God could have chosen to be without the  Logos or as though there could have been a time when the Logos did not  exist. To be fully divine, the Logos must have been generated not by will  but by nature: &quot;A man by counsel builds a house, but by nature he  begets a son; and what is in building began to come into beginning at will,  and is external to the maker; but the son is proper offspring of the father's  essence, and is not external to him.&quot; Therefore, the fundamental difference  between the Logos and the creation is that the former is eternally generated  by nature, from God's own substance; while the latter is produced by an  act of God's will, and has a beginning in time.4</P>  <P>The creation, then, unlike the Logos, is the result of divine counsel  or deliberation. Athanasius emphatically rejected the notion that &quot;things  have come into being of themselves, and in chance fashion,&quot; or that  things have originated independently of purpose. On the contrary, &quot;counselling  goes before things which once were not, as in the case of all creatures,&quot;  and the Son &quot;is Himself the Living Counsel of the Father, by which  all things have come to be.&quot; The Son, however, like the Father, is  &quot;unalterable and unchangeable&quot;; so the divine counsel is eternal,  and God's will and purpose were with God &quot;before the world.&quot;  Whatever exists is thus preceded by &quot;its pattern in God.&quot;5</P>  <P>Athanasius maintained that God's creatorship, like God's providence,  extended to small details: &quot;If then it be not unworthy of God to exercise  His Providence, even down to things so small, a hair of the head, and a  sparrow, and the grass of the field, also it was not unworthy of Him to  make them. For what things are the subjects of His Providence, of those  He is Maker through his proper Word.&quot;6 Since God's providence and  creatorship extend &quot; even down to things so small,&quot; they extend  <I>a fortiori</I> to the human species. God not only &quot;fashioned the  race of men&quot; in &quot;His own image,&quot; but also foresaw the fall  and provided for redemption: just as a wise architect would make provisions  for repairing a house &quot;should it any time become dilapidated,&quot;  so &quot;in the same way prior to us is the repair of our salvation founded  in Christ.&quot;</P>  <P>In other words, the incarnation of the Logos in a human body was predestined  from eternity. Christ's body, which &quot;is of no different sort from  ours,&quot;was thus made, at the proper time, according to God's eternal  plan.7</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Maximus the Confessor, in opposition to Origen's implicit claim that  God creates by necessity, relied on the Athanasian distinction between  nature and will to reaffirm God's freedom. According to Maximus, the<I>  logoi</I>, or patterns, of all creatures exist eternally in the mind of  God, but they are the products of God's will rather than God's nature.  At the appropriate time, God creates substantial realities according to  their pre-existent <I>logoi</I>, which are thus the bases for diversity  and movement in the corporeal universe. Therefore, all things are the intended  products of God's creative act. This does not mean that every detail of  every being conforms perfectly to its pe-existent <I>logos</I>. Maximus  allowed for some variation due to the <I>tropos</I>, or mode of existence,  which affects the extent to which a being actualizes its eternal and unchanging  <I>logos</I>. Nevertheless, by affirming that God's will is the origin  not only of all created beings, but also of their pre-existent patterns,  Maximus safeguarded God's sovereignty and purposefulness.8</P>  <P>Human beings, in particular, are created according to the will of God.  Whereas Origen had taught that human bodies were the result of the fall  of pre-existent souls, Maximus held that God creates body and soul together.  Though body and soul are distinguishable, they are inseparable, and only  together do they form a complete species. The one constitutive factor for  both is the will of God, whose divinity is reflected in the psycho-physical  unity of the whole human being, and not just the soul.9 According to Maximus,  the human being is designed to be a microcosm in which the mental, spiritual,  and physical aspects of creation are united. Furthermore, this microcosm  is intended to unite with, and partake of, the divine nature, thereby uniting  the world with its creator. This cosmic union, which is finally achieved  in the incarnation of the Logos in Christ, is the fulfillment of God's  original purpose for creating the universe. The incarnation was thus foreordained,  independently of the fall, from eternity.10</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Augustine, opposing the cosmogonic dualism of the Manicheans, affirmed  that the creator of all that exists is God: &quot;Whatever is, since it  is, and in whatever degree it is, has its existence from the one God.&quot;  In defense of God's sovereignty, Augustine insisted that all created beings  have their forms or <I>rationes aeternae</I> in &quot;the very mind of  the Creator.&quot; All things are thus made according to God's eternal  and unchanging plan: &quot;Because therefore the Word of God is One, by  which all things were made, which is the unchangeable truth, all things  are simultaneously therein, potentially and unchangeably; not only those  things which are now in this whole creation, but also those which have  been and those which shall be.&quot; In other words, &quot;the Wisdom of  God, by which all things have been made contains everything according to  design before it is made.&quot;11</P>  <P>According to Augustine, God's creatorship extends to all forms of existence:  &quot;even the lowest form is of God. And the same may be said of species.&quot;  The &quot;lowliest and the smallest creatures are obviously fashioned by  such a remarkable plan that a moment's serious attention to them fills  the beholder with inexpressible awe and wonder&quot;; and if they appear  to us to be tiny and contemptible, it may only be that &quot;on account  of our pride, God appointed that tiny and contemptible creature to torment  us.&quot; But if God's design extends even to the lowest forms of life,  it extends <I>a fortiori</I> to human beings, who were &quot;certainly&quot;  created in the form which God foreordained &quot;before the ages.&quot;12</P>  <P>Although it is not completely clear whether Augustine believed that  foreordination extends to the precise form of every individual, it is clear  that Augustine considered human beings and every other kind of creature  to be designed by God: &quot;all things are created on a rational plan,  and man not by the same rational plan as horses, for it is absurd to think  this. Therefore individual things are created in accord with <I>rationes</I>  unique to them.&quot;13</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Aquinas endeavored to synthesize Christian theology with Aristotelian  philosophy. Since Augustine's notion of the <I>rationes aeternae</I> was  borrowed from the Neoplatonists (though unlike Plato or the Neoplatonists,  Augustine placed the ideas in the mind of the supreme deity), and since  Aristotle had rejected the Platonic doctrine of ideas, it might be expected  that Aquinas would reject the Augustinian doctrine of ideas. Quite to the  contrary, however, Aquinas considered it &quot;necessary to suppose ideas  in the divine mind,&quot; just as &quot;the likeness of a house pre-exists  in the mind of the builder.&quot; According to Aquinas, things receive  their determinate forms because &quot;in the divine wisdom are the types  of all things, which types we have called ideas, i.e., exemplar forms existing  in the divine mind.&quot;14</P>  <P>The fact that Aquinas' view of the divine ideas resembles Augustine's,  however, does not mean that Aquinas merely incorporated the doctrine in  his theology out of respect for authority. Although the language may be  borrowed from Augustine, the concept follows directly from central aspects  of Aquinas' doctine of God. First, it follows from God's intelligent, purposeful,  and free creatorship. Since &quot;the world was not made by chance, but  by God acting by His intellect,&quot; therefore &quot;there must exist  in the divine mind a form to the likeness of which the world was made.  And in this the notion of idea consists.&quot; The doctrine safeguards  God's intelligent purposefulness, since it necessarily implies previous  planning in the production of creatures, and &quot;those who say that all  things happen by chance cannot admit the existence of ideas.&quot; It also  safeguards God's freedom, in opposition to the notion that the world emanates  by necessity from God's nature. Creatures pre-exist in God's nature only  &quot;after the mode of intellect,&quot; but they &quot;proceed from Him  after the mode of will.&quot; Since &quot;a form considered by the intellect  does not move or cause anything except through the will,&quot; it is God's  free will and not God's nature which determines what is actually created.15</P>  <P>Second, the doctrine of ideas is implied in the doctrine of the trinity,  since &quot;in the Word is implied the operative idea of what God makes.&quot;  Just as there &quot;pre-exists in the mind of a craftsman a certain image  of his external work,&quot; so also does there &quot;pre-exist in the mind  of one who pronounces an exterior word a certain archetype of it.&quot;  This archetype, or &quot;interior word,&quot; is the word of God; and the  ideas of things to be made are thus metaphorically called the word of God.  Aquinas interpreted the prologue to the Gospel of John accordingly: &quot;In  the beginning was the Word&quot; means the things originate from God's  intellect and purpose, &quot;and not from chance.&quot;16</P>  <P>In particular, the human species was delibrately designed by God. Although  it is possible that some species distinctions do not have their source  in the divine ideas, Aquinas maintains that the human soul is &quot;made  to the image of God,&quot; and that &quot;God fashioned the human body&quot;  in order to &quot;make it suitably proportioned to the soul.&quot;17</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Luther considered the essential teaching of the Old and New Testaments  to be our total dependence on God in Christ. Our total dependence on God,  in turn, presupposes that we owe our very existence to God as our creator.18  For God to be the creator means, for Luther, that &quot;the creation is  not fortuitous but the exclusive work of divine forsight.&quot; From all  eternity, God &quot;has a Word, a speech, a thought, or a conversation  with Himself in His divine heart&quot;; and from this conversation, &quot;heaven  and earth, all creatures, both the visible and the invisible, come into  being.&quot; Therefore, &quot;all His works are some words of God, created  by the uncreated Word.&quot; Since God creates out of nothing, which means  without the need for any instrumentality or pre-existing material, Luther  considers creation to be &quot;a kind of birth.&quot; This birth, however,  takes place &quot;at the command of God,&quot; as a product of God's will  rather than as a pantheistic emanation from God's nature. But Luther is  less concerned with issues such as this than he is with the immediate significance  of the doctrine of creation for the faith of the believer: we should know,  for example, that even &quot; great sea animals&quot; are created by God,  &quot;lest we be frightened;&quot; then &quot;we may more readily believe  that God can preserve us too, even though we are far smaller beings.&quot;  Similarly, according to Luther, God tells us in Isaiah 40:28, &quot;I have  made all these things, they are my creatures, they are under My control,  they cannot touch the least hair of your head. Do not be afraid.&quot;  God's creatorship, then, means that &quot;we must take note of God's power  that we may be completely without doubt about the things which God promises  in His word.&quot;19</P>  <P>It is not merely the initial creation of the universe which demonstrates  God's power. Luther explained that God is not like a carpenter who &quot;turns  over the house to its owner&quot; when he finishes constructing it; instead,  God &quot;continues to preserve His creation through the Word.&quot; In  fact, &quot;if the Creator, who continues to work forever and ever, and  His Co-worker were to interrupt Their work, all would go to wrack and ruin  in a twinkling.&quot; Luther draws from this the lesson that &quot;as we  human beings did not create ourselves, so we can do nothing at all to keep  ourselves alive for a single moment by our own power. The fact that I grow  and develop is God's work alone,&quot; and Luther meant this in the strongest  possible sense. He even interpreted Isaiah 44:24 as being equivalent to  a statement by God that &quot;whatever is done, I alone have done it.&quot;20  Modern commentators point out that, for Luther, God is thus the only true  agent. God does absolutely everything, and whatever happens is a direct  result of God's activity. Therefore, created beings are what Luther calls  <I>larva dei</I>, or visible masks of the invisible God, testifying to  God's omnipresent power, and encouraging us to &quot;fear and trust only  in God.&quot;21</P>  <P>Given Luther's belief that God does all and creatures can do nothing,  it is unlikely that he would attribute even the smallest detail of creation  to anything other than God's purposeful activity. Among the forms of life  that he specifically attributes to God's design are &quot;herbs and trees,&quot;  which were created &quot;for our sustenance.&quot; He also considers the  mouse to be &quot;created by the Word of God with a definite plan in view,&quot;  so that &quot;here, too, we admire God's creation and workmanship.&quot;  Furthermore, &quot;the same thing can be said about flies.&quot; Above  all, however, man and woman were &quot;created by the special plan and  providence of God,&quot; specifically &quot;for the knowledge and worship  of God.&quot;22</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Calvin considered the creation a &quot;theater of the divine glory,&quot;  but because of the fall &quot;we have not the eyes to see this unless they  be illumined by the inner revelation of God through faith.&quot; Once we  have been given the &quot;spectacles&quot; of scripture, however, &quot;the  most perfect way of seeking God&quot; is &quot;to contemplate him in his  works.&quot; Through the eyes of faith the believer sees design in the  creation, which then nourishes that faith in return. Thus &quot;although  it is not the chief evidence for faith, yet it is the first evidence in  the order of nature, to be mindful that wherever we cast our eyes, all  things they meet are works of God, and at the same time to ponder with  pious meditation to what end God created them.&quot;23</P>  <P>Of all God's works, the &quot;most excellent example&quot; is humankind.  Calvin interprets the &quot;let us make man&quot; of Genesis 1:26 as God's  way of &quot;commending to our attention the dignity of our natures,&quot;  since God made all other creatures by command, but &quot;enters into consult-ation&quot;  before making us. Furthermore, human beings are created in the divine image,  the &quot;chief seat&quot; of which is in the mind and heart, though some  &quot;scintillations&quot; shine in every part, including the body. Human  beings are especially created &quot;to seek God&quot; and &quot;to behold  the works of God,&quot; and they are endowed with reason and under-standing  &quot;that they might acknowledge their Creator.&quot; The rest of the  universe, in turn, was &quot;established especially for the sake of mankind.&quot;  According to Calvin, &quot;the world was originally created for this end,  that every part of it should tend to the happiness of man.&quot; God &quot;filled  the earth, waters, and air with living things, and brought forth an abundance  of fruits,&quot; and thereby &quot;shows his wonderful goodness toward  us.&quot;24</P>  <P>Calvin emphasized that God not only created but also preserves and governs  the world. In fact, according to Calvin, God completely controls all events.  Without denying the existence of secondary causes, Calvin nevertheless  insisted that &quot;nothing happens except what is knowingly and willingly  decreed&quot; by God. Calvin specifically objected not only to those who  would &quot;substitute nature for God&quot; by making nature &quot;the  artificer of all things,&quot; but also to those who would attribute anything  less than absolute control to God. Included in this latter category are  people who &quot;in place of God's providence sub-stitute bare permission  - as if God sat in a watchtower awaiting chance events,&quot; as well as  people who attribute to God a providence which merely &quot;by a general  motion revolves and drives the system of the universe&quot; but which &quot;does  not specifically direct the action of in-dividual creatures.&quot; For  Calvin, God &quot;so regulates all things that nothing takes place without  his deliberation,&quot; and &quot;not one drop of rain falls without God's  sure command.&quot; What may appear to be a chance occurrence is &quot;only  that of which the reason and cause are secret,&quot; and the secret cause  is God's foreordination. Though &quot;for us they are fortuitous,&quot;  such events are &quot;governed by God's incom-prehensible plans.&quot;25  Since there is no such thing as chance, accord-ing to Calvin, God must  have designed every detail of every living thing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>This survey of representative theologians demonstrates that design was  important to all of them. It was not important, however, as a reason for  believing in God; instead, it followed as a logical conse-quence from their  understanding of God's nature. In a sense, they used, not an argument <I>from</I>  design, but an argument <I>to</I> design. Although they differed in their  notions of what creatures, exactly, were designed by God, they all agreed  that human beings were designed, and that this claim is central to Christian  belief.</P>  <P>In Christian theology, then, two fundamentally different design arguments  can be distinguished:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Argument <I>From</I> Design</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If human beings are designed, then God exists.</P>  <P>Human beings are designed.</P>  <P>Therefore, God exists.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Argument <I>To</I> Design</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If God exists, then human beings are designed.</P>  <P>God exists.</P>  <P>Therefore, human beings are designed.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In a discussion of Darwinism, it is important to note that the logical  consequences of <I>denying </I>design differ radically in the case of these  two arguments. It would be illogical, for example, to conclude from a denial  of design, via the argument <I>from</I> design, that God does not exist:  this would be the fallacy of denying the antecedent. On the other hand,  it follows necessarily (by <I>modus tollens) </I>that a denial of design,  in the argument <I>to</I> design, is tantamount to a denial of God's existence.  Since the argument <I>to</I> design is prominent in the mainstream theological  traditions of Christianity, any theory which denies that human beings are  designed would amount, for those traditions, to an affirmation of atheism.  (This was the reasoning used by Princeton theologian Charles Hodge in his  1874 book, <I>What Is </I>Darwinism?)26</P>  <P>The question, then, is: does Darwinism claim that human beings are not  designed?</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Darwinism</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>It is well known that Charles Darwin did not originate the notion of  evolution. Etymologically, &quot;evolution&quot; means &quot;unrolling,&quot;  and it was first used in biology about two centuries ago to refer to the  development of an embryo. As used in modern biology, however, evolution  refers in its most general sense to the origin and diversifica-tion of  living organisms, in which later stages are somehow descended or derived  from earlier ones. Although Darwin contributed to the wide acceptance of  biological evolution by adducing a large amount of evidence for it, his  principal contribution was to propose a theory about its mechanism. Since  the general phenomenon of evolution is distinct from any particular theory  about its mechanism, one may be an evolutionist without being a Darwinist  (as, for example, Lamarck was an evolutionist before Darwin.)</P>  <P>As used in the following discussion, Darwinism refers to the theory  set forth by Charles Darwin himself in the various editions of <I>The Origin  of </I>Species, The Descent of Man, The Variation of Plants and Animals  Under <I>Domestication</I>, and in his correspondence. Darwin's theory  ascribes evolution to the natural selection of small variations which occur  among the individuals in any given species. According to the theory, those  variations are random with respect to the fitness of the in-dividual or  to the direction of evolution (i.e., they do not arise in response to the  needs of an organism or in accordance with any plan), and any given environment  &quot;selects&quot; (in a manner analogous to a breeder of plants or livestock)  those individuals whose variations render them more likely to survive (i.e.,  natural selection is survival of the fittest).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Harvard botanist Asa Gray, Darwin's most influential ally in nineteenth-century  America, defended every aspect of Darwin's <I>Origin of </I>Species except  its apparent exclusion of design. Gray believed that naturalists are justified  in seeing design in the variations which give rise to species, and he advised  Darwin to assume &quot;that variation has been led along certain beneficial  lines. Streams flowing over a sloping plain by gravitation (here the counterpart  of natural selec-tion) may have worn their actual channels as they flowed;  yet their particular courses may have been assigned.&quot; Gray also compared  variations to raindrops: those which fall into the ocean &quot;are as much  without a final cause as the incipient varieties which come to nothing!  Does it therefore follow that the rains which are bestowed upon the soil  with such rule and average regularity were not designed to support vegetable  and animal life?&quot; Gray did not insist, however, that all variations  must be designed: &quot;the accidental element may play its part in Nature  without negativing design in the theist's view.&quot; Indeed, the accidental  element in Darwin's theory is the basis of its advantage in explaining  useless or harmful adaptations. But Gray was convinced that useful adaptations  testify to design: since natural selection merely picks out variations  which are independently presented to it, the presence of design in the  result indicates that at least some variations are designed.27</P>  <P>Darwin disagreed. He wrote to Gray that he was &quot;charmed&quot; with  the stream metaphor, but he concluded his next book, <I>The Variation of  Plants </I>and Animals Under Domestication, with a lengthy refutation of  Gray's position.28 Using the metaphor of a house built by an architect  utilizing uncut fragments of stone, Darwin explained that &quot;the frag-ments  of stone, though indispensable to the architect, bear to the edifice built  by him the same relation which the fluctuating variations of each organic  being bear to the varied and admirable structures ultimately acquired by  its modified descendants.&quot; The shape of each fragment &quot;may be  called accidental, but this is not strictly correct; for the shape of each  depends on a long sequence of events, all obeying natural laws.&quot; Nevertheless,  &quot;in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put, their shape  may be strictly said to be accidental.&quot; In Darwin's metaphor, of course,  the architect is natural selection.29 Darwin continued:</P>  <P>Can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator intentionally ordered,  if we use the words in any ordinary sense, that certain fragments of rock  should assume certain shapes so that the builder might erect his edifice?  If the various laws which have determined the shape of each fragment were  not predeter-mined for the builder's sake, can it with any greater probability  be maintained that He specially ordained for the sake of the breeder each  of the innumerable variations in our domestic animals and plants; - many  of these variations being of no service to man, and not beneficial, far  more often injurious, to the creatures themselves? Did He ordain that the  crop and tail-feathers of the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier  might make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He cause the frame  and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be  formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the bull for  man's brutal sport? But if we give up the principle in one case - if we  do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog were intentionally  guided in order that the greyhound, for instance, that perfect image of  symmetry and vigor, might be formed - no shadow of reason can be assigned  for the belief that variations, alike in nature and the result of the same  general laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection  of the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world, man  included, were intentionally and specially guided.30</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In his correspondence, Darwin elaborated on his claim that varia-tions  could not be designed. His reasoning can be divided into three -categories:  scientific, philosophical, and theological. The first category includes  the observation that the vast majority of variations are useless or harmful  rather than beneficial. It thus makes no sense to Darwin to say that variations  are designed: if someone says &quot;God ordained that at some time and  place a dozen slight variations should arise, and that one of them alone  should be preserved in the struggle for life and the other eleven should  perish in the first or first few generations, then the saying seems to  me mere verbiage. It comes to merely saying that everything that is, is  ordained.&quot; The second category of reasons includes the philosophical  assumption that naturalistic science is competent to investigate and explain  the origin of species. The idea that &quot;each variation has been providentially  arranged seems to me to make Natural Selection entirely superfluous, and  indeed takes the whole case of the appearance of new species out of the  range of science.&quot; The third category includes Darwin's conviction  that designing each slight variation would be beneath God's dignity and  contrary to God's benevolence. Referring once again to the breeding of  domestic pigeons, Darwin notes that &quot;it seems preposterous that a  maker of the universe should care about the crop of a pigeon solely to  please man's silly fancies.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;I cannot persuade  myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created  the <I>Ichneumonidae</I> with the express intention of their feeding within  the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.  Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly  designed.&quot;31</P>  <P>Darwin reasons that unless all variations are designed, none of them  are. If the &quot;interposition of the Deity&quot; is uncalled for in the  case of domestic variations, he could &quot;see no reason whatever for  believing in such interpositions in the case of natural beings.&quot; Or  &quot;if anything is designed, certainly man must be,&quot; but Darwin  &quot;cannot admit that man's rudimentary mammae...were designed,&quot;  therefore (by implica-tion) man is not designed. Such all-or-nothing reasoning  seems to be based primarily on Darwin's commitment to naturalistic explanation:  either the origin of species can be explained in exclusively naturalistic  terms, or it cannot really be explained at all. Darwin writes that he &quot;would  give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural Selection, if it requires  miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.&quot; To a lesser extent,  his reasoning may have been based on his understanding of the idea of God:  if the deity were going to pre-ordain <I>any</I> details, then an omnipotent  and omniscient deity would presumably pre-ordain<I> all</I>; but a wise  and benevolent deity would not ordain many of the details which are actually  observed; therefore (by implication), <I>no</I> details are pre-ordained.  Whatever the basis, Darwin's reasoning leads him to conclude that<I> all</I>  variations are undesigned.32</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Darwin also denies that natural selection, the second major ele-ment  in his theory, could lead to designed results. Although he compares natural  selection to an architect, he repeatedly denies that he intends to attribute  conscious agency to it. He repudiates the anthropomorphic connotations  which many of his contemporaries associate with the selection metaphor,  insisting that he uses it only &quot;as a geologist does the word denudation  - for an agent, expressing the result of several combined actions.&quot;  Since natural selection is power-less without variations, which arise independently  of it, he sometimes wishes he had used the term &quot;natural preservation&quot;;  but by the time the confusion became obvious, the former term was &quot;so  largely used abroad and at home that I doubt whether it could be given  up.&quot; In addition to this negative reason for retaining the term, Darwin  has positive reasons as well: natural selection is analogous to artificial  selection not only in its dependence on variations, but also in the impressiveness  of its results. Natural selection solves the problem of how organisms become  adapted to the conditions of life, &quot;as artifical selection solves  the adaptation of domestic races for man's use.&quot; Furthermore, the  former is more efficient than the latter: a domestic breeder &quot;scarcely  selects except external and visible characters, and secondly, he selects  for his own good; whereas under nature, charac-ters of all kinds are selected  exclusively for each creature's own good.&quot; Darwin can thus see &quot;no  limit to the perfection of the coadaptations which could be effected by  Natural Selection.&quot; It is still the case, however, that &quot;natural  selection means only the preservation of varia-tions which independently  arise.&quot;33</P>  <P>In what senses, then, could natural selection be said to produce designed  results? One twentieth-century study of Darwin's own views on the subject  concludes that there are at least three such senses: natural selection  (1) will always produce adaptation of the organism to its environment,  (2) will never produce in an organism structures that are harmful to it,  and (3) will never produce structures in one organism solely for the benefit  of another. Since these can legitimate-ly be regarded as &quot;purposes,&quot;  it would be incorrect to say that Darwin considers natural selection totally  purposeless. On the other hand, natural selection <I>does </I>seem to exclude  the claim that specific organs or organic forms are designed. According  to Darwin, not even organs of sight or the order of primates, much less  the human eye or the human species, could be considered designed results  of natural selection.34</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Therefore, Darwin concluded that &quot;there seems to be no more design  in the variability of organic beings, and in the action of natural selection,  than in the course which the winds blow.&quot;35 This does not mean, however,  that Darwin is willing to attribute every aspect of evolution to chance.  He repeatedly affirmed his &quot;inward conviction&quot; that &quot;the  Universe is not the result of chance.&quot; Although he distrusted this  conviction, since he believed that the human mind is descended from the  minds of lower animals, he appeared to be genuinely persuaded of &quot;the  extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of con-ceiving this immense  and wonderful universe&quot; as &quot;the result of blind chance or necessity.&quot;  This put him in &quot;a simple muddle; I cannot look at the universe as  the result of blind chance, yet I can see no evidence of beneficent design,  or indeed of design of any kind, in the details.&quot; Although he feared  that the issue may ultimately be incomprehen-sible, he is &quot;inclined  to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details,  whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.&quot;36</P>  <P>This last statement is probably the best summary of Darwin's mature  position on design. Although it is likely that he never resolved the question  of ultimate purpose to his own satisfaction, he at least believed that  his theory does not exclude all design: someone could embrace Darwinism  and yet consistently maintain that natural laws, including the laws of  variation and natural selection, are designed. According to Darwin's own  understanding of the theory, however, specific details are due to chance,  not merely in the sense that their causes are unknown but in the sense  that they are really accidental. Neither of the two major elements in the  theory can be plausibly interpreted as directed: not variation, because  it is predominantly useless or harmful; and not natural selection, because  its only func-tion is to insure that the few survivors of the struggle  for life will be better able to withstand the next round. If evolution  is really due to these two factors, then the particular forms taken by  organisms, species, genera, and orders are accidental. Therefore, Darwin's  ver-sion of Darwinism excludes the possibility that any specific form of  life is designed. In particular, it implies that human beings, as the latest  products of an inherently directionless process, must be regarded as undesigned.</P>  <P>Note that this issue here is not methodological agnosticism with regard  to design, but a complete exclusion of designed results. The former, it  seems, is a necessary characteristic of all scientific theories, and in  that sense such theories might be called &quot;ateleological.&quot; Darwin's  theory, however, (at least according to his interpretation of it) takes  a further step and might properly be called &quot;anti-teleologi-cal.&quot;  To illustrate: Newton's laws of motion ignore the issue of design, but  they may be used to produce designed results; given a complete knowledge  of initial conditions, the result can be predicted. Darwin's theory, however,  precludes any determinate outcome of evolution. In particular, Darwinism  excludes design in human beings.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Thus there is a fundamental conflict between Darwin's theory and the  Christian theological tradition. The conflict is not between Christianity  and evolution, and has nothing to do with natural theology. For the Christian  theologians surveyed here, a basic consequence of Christian belief in God  is the belief that the human species was designed by God. Darwin denies  the latter, and thus logically denies the former as well.</P>  <P>There are, of course, people who disagree, and who regard Chris-tianity  and Darwinism as perfectly compatible with each other. The two cannot be  regarded as compatible, however, unless the former is taken to mean something  other than what the mainstream theological tradition through the Protestant  Reformation has meant by Chris-tianity, or the latter is taken to mean  something other than what Charles Darwin meant by Darwinism.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER><B>REFERENCES</B></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>1.

<H4>Michael J. Behe is Associate Professor of Chemistry at Lehigh University
in Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University
of Pennsylvania in 1978. His current research, which is being funded by
the Natiuonal Institute of Health, focuses on the structure of nucleic acids
and the properties of histone proteins. In addition to publishing over 35
articles in refereed biochemical journals, he has just published a book
titled <I><A HREF="pearcyreview.html">Darwin's Black Box</A></I> (The Free
Press, 1996) that discusses the implications for evolutionary theory of
what he calls &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; biochemical systems. He has
already presented some of his findings on this topic at the State University
of New York, Stony Brook and Cambridge University.</H4>

Welcome to Town Hall's INFOTAINMENT.  I'm your host, Ann Klucsarits.  Each week I'll be bringing you some informative yet entertaining (get it? info-tainment) game or activity that will highlight the lighter side of conservatism.  Sometimes you'll be amused, other times challenged, but I  promise you that you'll always be entertained.<p>

This week's special is a <a href="/townhall/infotain/th_tour/door.html">tour of our very own Town Hall.</a>  Meet the faces behind the e-mail addresses and learn just a little bit about how we all work together to bring you the best sources of ideas and information in the conservative movement.<p>

In the weeks ahead, you can come to INFOTAINMENT to participate in polls, contests, and other games, and get a bird's eye view of Town Hall's kick-off event with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.<p>

We'd love to have your feedback and suggestions, so send any one of us an e-mail while you're on the tour!<p>

Hall</h2>
This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading in 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

The skyrocketing increase in the use of illegal drugs has been accompanied by a softening of attitudes toward drug abuse.  A clear, moral appeal to "Just Say No" has been replaced with mixed messages of tolerance and moral ambivalence toward drug use.  This ambivalence can be seen in both the White House and the schoolhouse:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>  Teen attitudes towards drug use have softened significantly since 1992.
<LI>  The non-partisan Partnership for a Drug-Free America concluded, "Todays teens are less likely to consider drug use harmful and risky, more likely to believe that drug use is widespread and tolerated, and feel more pressure to try illegal drugs than they did just tow years ago."
</UL></blockquote></td>
<td col width=400 valign=top><blockquote>
<UL>
<LI>  Despite the surge in drug use, little has been said by the national government about the dangers of drug use.  Studies show that during the first nine months of 1995, out of more than 1000 interviews, statements, remarks and proclamations, the President mentioned drugs only 18 times.  As a recent <I>Newsweek</I> article reported:  "It is simply beyond argument that Bill clinton has failed to use the power of his office to lead the war on drugs."
</UL><P>
With the abdication of leadership in the war on drugs, public resolve has been eroded.  Conflicting messages about the acceptability of drug use have left American children more open and more vulnerable to drug use than ever before.</blockquote></td></tr>

</I><A HREF="twonation.html">[Go to Cascadia Tourism Conference -- June
6-7, 1996]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
These are heady times for entrepreneurs, high tech whizzes and international
traders. But many people are left out of the boom, including bank tellers
and telephone operators, middle managers and others whose jobs are being
rendered obsolete by new technologies, corporate down-sizing and international
competition. They can get jobs in this economy, but often not at levels
commensurate with their backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
In the short term, there is no easy answer to such people's underemployment,
but there is one field that offers substantial opportunity for workers of
all kinds, from the minimally skilled to the highly educated. That field
is tourism. Paying an average of 10 percent more than other employment,
today's tourism industry is a source of good jobs as well as more jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Tourism matters to Washington State because the region is an increasingly
popular visitor destination, but also because Seattle is headquarters for
such top travel companies as Westin Hotels, Alaska Airlines, Holland America
cruise lines and, of course, Boeing. Unfortunately, state and local governments
have put relatively little emphasis on exploiting this strength. At 15.2
percent, Seattle has the second highest hotel room tax in the country--surpassed
only by Columbus, Ohio, hardly a tourist magnet. Yet, Washington State ranks
47th among states investing such dollars in development of the tourism industry.<BR>
<BR>
What's our problem? Perhaps we still think of tourism as a frill, or as
an industry with a real future only in sunnier climes. Or we fret that the
tourists who visit from Japan or Scandinavia will go home, quit their jobs
and move in on us. Neither statistics nor experience back up those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
How underrated is tourism? Well, how many of us realize that it is now the
number one industry in the world? The stunning fact is that tourism business
generated $3.4 trillion last year, even surpassing conventional manufacturing
categories like steel or autos. Seattle and King County stand to gain greatly
from this global development; our own annual tourism business has grown
from $900 million to $2.7 billion in the past decade. The number of foreign
visitors--480,000 last year--also has doubled in that period, not even counting
two million Canadians. But we can do much better.<BR>
<BR>
The foreign market, indeed, is one of the most promising. This is especially
so in Asia, where the middle class is doubling its massive size in this
generation--from 200 million to 400 million in India, for example. Worldwide,
women are becoming a bigger share of travelers now--already up to 33 percent.
Another trend: leisure visitors, rather than business travelers, will soon
account for 80 percent of air travelers.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have found that these new international tourists are very cost
conscious--just at the point in history when the United States finally has
become more affordable. Moreover, 75 percent of current foreign visitors
to the US have been here before, so there is fresh curiosity about destinations
other than standard gateway cities like New York and Los Angeles. Seattle,
for instance: close to Asia, up-to-date, well-priced, and also friendly
and safe. <BR>
<BR>
Juergen Bartels, the new chairman and CEO of Westin Hotels, a company that
began in Seattle 65 years ago and today is a leading hotelier in 80 locations
around the world, was asked recently why Westin decided to remain here.
His response was that &quot;Seattle is not in the middle of the country,
but it is in the middle of the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lest that sound like mere boosterism, the German-born Bartels is quick to
point out that the &quot;world&quot; Westin has identified as leading the
travel boom is the Pacific Rim, and especially Asia. Seattle is a good location
from which to launch an ambitious hotel expansion scheme like Westin's,
which aims to open 60 new hotels in the next five years, an average of one
a month.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle's position in international travel is improved further by our new
status as U.S. home to APEC (the Asian Pacific Economic Council) and the
prestige of the Henry M. Jackson School at the University of Washington,
whose international program is particularly strong in Asian studies. The
Port of Seattle's new International Conference Center that opens next summer
and the coming expansion of the Washington State Convention Center will
help establish Seattle as an especially well-endowed meeting location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing so far, however, is a well-orchestrated, high priority effort
to build on this area's international tourism potential. We cannot and should
not count on the federal government to lead; its whole tourism budget is
only about the size of Luxembourg's, and nothing like, say, Canada's. In
Olympia, Governor Lowry and a couple of state legislators intend next month
to propose a doubling of the state budget for tourism--but that still will
amount to only $4.6 million, far less than the programs of neighboring states,
let alone, British Columbia. It's time for state and local governments to
see the full scope of the opportunity and to collaborate in meeting it.<BR>
<BR>
The best strategy is, first, to increase spending in tourism development
by tapping into the huge tax revenue provided by the tourist industry itself
in the form of the hotel tax. Judicious use of that source should not alarm
the general taxpayer and will return its investment manifold. When a modest
public and private promotional budget was deployed by the Seattle area in
Great Britain recently, it resulted in a doubling of British tourist visits
here. <BR>
<BR>
Pooling existing funds of government and private sector alike, as in the
British promotional case, should be the second emphasis of an international
tourism strategy. A common promotional campaign will go much farther than
many divergent ones. Indeed, we should solidify the tentative efforts now
underway to link the overseas tourism programs of the Northwest states with
the more advanced foreign visitors campaign of British Columbia and build
up the international appeal of the whole Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, isn't it time that we stopped looking the gift horse of tourism
in the mouth?

    <TITLE>Curbin America's Appetite for Lawsuits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>From the Friday, December 8, 1995, <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</I></B>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
It's time to curb America's appetite for lawsuits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="katz.html">[Read Roberta Katz's remarks on reform of the adversarial
legal system]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>A woman at McDonald's spills hot coffee in her lap and a jury awards
her $2.7 million. Another jury awards a man $4 million from BMW because
he wasn't told that his new car had received a minor paint touch-up before
he bought it. Yet another man is awarded $12.3 million, most of it in &quot;punitive&quot;
damages,&quot; because he fractured his neck on a Slip 'n Slide lawn toy
whose wrapper, he charges, did not warn him adequately that adults could
get hurt playing with such a thing. (It just shows that we must keep toys
out of the hands of grown ups.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Winning the lawsuit sweepstakes in today's America is a lot easier than
winning the lottery, and while news of enormous legal awards arouse amazement
and anger in most of us, it evidently incites a drooling appetite to sue
in the rest. No wonder we now have 14 million lawsuits a year, one for every
17 Americans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The western district of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than all of Japan.
California as a whole is definitely a Golden State for trial lawyers; 99
of 100 auto accidents, including fender benders, result in lawsuits. Overall,
Americans' chance of being in a suit is now three times that of Canadians.
And it isn't just big businesses that gets hit, but also mom and pop stores,
charitable groups and local governments--anyone, however remotely connected
to a problem, with &quot;deep pockets&quot; that can be invaded when the
real source of a grievance is poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When lawsuits hit the jackpot, who do you think benefits almost as much
as the alleged victim (who gets an average of 43 percent of awards)? That's
right, the lawyers get about 33 percent, and the rest goes to administrative
and other costs. Top corporate lawyers in America do very well in life,
but the top trial lawyers eclipse them, some raking in $15-$90 million a
year, a recent review inForbes magazine shows. Especially well-rewarded
are those who figure out how to get a parade of new clients to sue the same
company for the same problem over and over and to get &quot;punitive damages&quot;
each time in order to &quot;send a message&quot;--a message that sometimes
reads &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; Juries are not allowed to learn about this
tactic, or they would rebel more often.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And who, in addition to the manufacturer or store owner, pays? Right again:
you do--in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices and lowered
stock values in your personal or pension portfolio. Even though some of
the most outrageous suits are later reduced by judges, the whole litigious
system in this country, according to a study by the management consulting
firm of Tillinghast/ Perrin Towers, is freighting our economy with a burden
$140 billion annually. That is money that otherwise could create new jobs,
raise pay and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the trial attorneys and the professional &quot;consumer advocates&quot;
they so often support race to their word processors to protest my bias (or
maybe start a class action suit!) let it readily be acknowledged that businesses
and ordinary citizens do sometimes commit terrible blunders that harm others,
and that &quot;tort law&quot; is an entirely proper corrective. Lawsuits
often have forced negligent companies, doctors and other entities and individuals
to accept proper financial responsibilities and to improve safety standards.
Even the &quot;contingency fee&quot; arrangement that assures a plaintiff
that he will not pay the lawyer unless he wins the case can be defended
on the basis that it allows poor people access to justice in a system that
favors wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, however, is that the system has slowly gone nearly out of control
and has become counterproductive. Trial attorneys' jaundiced eyes and wily
ways may have motivated some otherwise indifferent firms to act more responsibly,
but at least as often the fear of legal action reaches a point where companies
are driven out of business by ruthless legal speculators. Doctors stop entering
certain fields that have become overly attractive to lawsuits. In some states,
people who might otherwise be good Samaritans when confronted by a person
in distress, instead refuse to help because of a wholly rational fear of
being sued. Another example of the chilling effect of over-litigation is
the growing trend among employers to avoid giving objective references for
former employee because they know that certain trial attorneys' latest speculative
field is &quot;wrongful termination&quot; (cases doubled between 1991 and
1994). The result is that many employers are wary of new hiring altogether.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognition of these consequences of over-litigation has finally created
a backlash. This year alone some 20 states have passed tort reforms. A study
by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows considerable stimulus
of economic growth in those states where tort reforms have been enacted,
and a drag on the economies of states where lawsuits hobble enterprise,
and that kind of study will fuel still more reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, trial attorneys are used to calling the shots in Washington,
D.C. , perhaps because they are generous campaign contributors, last year,
for example, donating $14 million. But they are conspicuously apprehensive
that Congress might pass serious tort reform legislation in this session;
indeed, in the next few weeks. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives,
led by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, passed a fairly broad bill, including
caps on punitive damages and much-needed malpractice limitations. But the
Senate, where floor-leader Slade Gorton of Washington feared that too narrow
a victory would invite a Presidential veto, came up with a much more limited
reform bill that mainly covers product liability. (Another bill to limit
frivolous class action suits by supposedly aggrieved stockholders disappointed
at the failure of managers to anticipate stock price fluctuations seems
to be coasting to a surprisingly easy victory and Presidential signature.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, while the trial attorney lobby believed that House-Senate differences
were too great to allow any bill to pass this year, the two houses' &quot;Conference
Committee&quot; suddenly appears close to a resolution. Reform-minded senators
now think that their present veto-proof majority might be willing to accept
certain obviously reasonable aspects of the House bill--for example, a financial
limit on civil actions that don't involve physical injury or suffering,
and a limit on actions taken against non-profit organizations and local
governments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If Congress passes any tort reform bill this session, the cause of major
reform will not be drained of energy, as some reformers fear, but reinvigorated.
A public appetite for suing one another took us down the present path, and
an appetite for restoration of a more civil society can now be stimulated
through the steady introduction of successive and successful steps toward
the thorough overhaul our system really needs. Legal utopianism paradoxically
diminishes the very justice it claims to seek. We have another, better tradition,
and that is common sense. It has a much better record of achieving justice
in this all too imperfect world.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Happy Conservative Pit-Bull Turns Ten <BR>
by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
Polls show that the public primarily blame Republicans in Congress, rather
than President Clinton, for the recent (and future?) government shutdown.
Those who blame both sides equally think that the battle is merely &quot;political&quot;
in the worst sense. At the state level, Referendum 48, the property rights
initiative, was soundly defeated earlier this month by a margin of 60-40.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is the conservative revolution running out of steam? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No--not to hear John Carlson tell it on his KVI radio afternoon talk show.
Indeed, the jovial Carlson, who infuriates liberals, is even more gleeful
than usual these days as he urges Seattle area listeners to deluge the President
with ball point pens to encourage him to sign a balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, there are good reasons for conservatives to smile. Though politically
at sea for years, they finally can smell dry land. History, their onetime
foe, seems to be on their side now. Significantly, while conservatives are
keeping their promises, the opposition is accepting their premises. The
issue in Washington, D.C., for example, no longer is whether to seek a balanced
budget, but how to achieve it, and how soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get the issues defined your way, it is possible to stop fighting
rear-guard actions and go for a clear cut victory. When you really reduce
spending growth to below the rate of inflation and commit in fact, not fancy,
to a balanced budget, you can expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates. In anticipation of that, markets already have rallied. If you go
on to reduce taxes on families and capital gains, economic expansion becomes
sturdier, and philanthropic giving grows. If you genuinely constrain government
over-regulation and decentralize government functions, personal liberty
is enlarged. Seeing that all this really is possible, the voters want more.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, conservatives may lose some day-to-day propaganda struggles, but the
long term &quot;fundamentals&quot; of their position (as economists might
say) are sound. In about two more elections they may emerge not only as
the normal governing majority in politics, but also the major force in intellectual
life--the status that liberals have occupied since the Depression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The liberals' ideas came out of academia, starting with the first self-conscious
&quot;political scientists&quot; at Princeton and Johns Hopkins at the turn
of the century. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created
the huge federal civil service, and it, too, generated ideas. The media,
which was mostly conservative or neutral until 40 years ago, swung to the
left in the 1950s, with a few notable exceptions, and gave liberalism an
aura of moral superiority and political inevitability. Even big business
was leery of wandering outside of the supposed liberal &quot;consensus.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of conservative renaissance, however, were planted during the
very heyday of the liberal intellectuals by a philosopher named Russell
Kirk and a small magazine edited by young Bill Buckley, <I>National Review</I>.
But it has prospered thanks largely to an institution created in the present
generation: the think tank. Some think tanks--or public policy institutes--are
liberal, but most are not, and as you look at the pages of national and
local magazines and newspapers, or listen to TV discussions and radio talk-shows,
you are bombarded by the news and views of &quot;fellows&quot; in &quot;institutes.&quot;
That's new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In national affairs, it happened first in Washington, D.C. with creation
of the American Enterprise Institute (eclectic conservative), the Heritage
Foundation (&quot;movement&quot; conservative, with a $28 million budget),
and Cato Institute (libertarian), among others. But then a second phase
occurred--explosively--at the state level, and, at last count, there are
now some 60 think tanks around the country specializing in local and regional
issues. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Portland, there is the Cascade Institute and in Olympia, the Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, led by former state legislator Bob Williams. But the
oldest public policy group in the Northwest is the Washington Institute,
founded by John Carlson, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am prejudiced, I admit it. I have enjoyed John's company ever since he
was a delightfully irreverent college student at the University of Washington,
assaulting the choleric dogmas of The UW Daily . He is still irreverent,
and whether you find that delightful or not probably depends on your politics.
He's also smart and constructive. By founding the Washington Institute in
1985 and helping it to survive this long, he has given state and local government
a whole new source of political ideas and initiative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John has now graduated to a perch as institute &quot;chairman&quot; so that
he can devote more of his time to harrying the left from his talk show,
a weekly column and regular appearances on two TV discussion programs. Stomping
around on the grapes of liberal wrath, he still lands hard on the toes of
antagonists, but his writing and wit have matured like a vintage Merlot.
Visiting dignitaries pay him court, and one of these days he is going to
wake up and find that he is part of the Establishment. But, happily, not
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, an energetic former insurance executive, Bill Baldwin, runs the
institute's show out of donated offices in a West Seattle building with
the biggest American flag you ever saw. From there issue papers decrying
state regulatory and budgetary excesses, calls for stronger defense of property
rights and a tough line on crime. A couple of years ago the institute helped
conceptualize the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; legislation that
now wins nods even from The White House. Institute arguments were used by
state legislators who rolled back Gov. Lowry's health care plan. At the
moment, high priority is attached to increasing privatization of many state
government functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of this policy agenda, Washington Institute also publishes
Counterpoint, a newsletter that assigns itself the role of watchdog on the
watchdogs of the media, usually biting at their heels, but also making &quot;good
dog&quot; awards. Overall, critiquing the press is not exactly a winning
strategy for assuring coverage of your other programs, but it does keep
many readers amused and gratified, and maybe it does some good in reminding
members of the Fourth Estate that they, too, are human. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For all of this, the state's watchdogs of the right are grinning as they
nip away. Every dog must have its day, and, after 10 years, the sun does
not seem at all ready to set on the Washington Institute. <BR>

    <TITLE>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday November 3, 1995 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism is Not Unique to Quebec </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by <BR>
Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>What do you follow in politics, economics or your heart? The moral discipline
of the market or the lure of memory? Your future as an individual or the
passions of your group? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Quebec was asked such questions this week, it split almost neatly in
two. And so might many of us. Indeed, what Canada faced, and will face,
is not dissimilar to what America faces and much of the world faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By a victory margin of only one percent, the decent, muddle-through confederation
of Canada--engaging affection not because of its pride, but because of its
humility--managed to hold on to just enough of the French-speaking community
to give it a reprieve from permanent division. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We now see, moreover, that what was averted may have been worse than even
the loss of a major province; namely, a complete breakup. When it seemed
that the &quot;sovereignist&quot; side might prevail in Quebec, large crowds
nationwide rallied 'round the Maple Leaf; and in that sense, Canada at last
found its patriotic voice. But at the same time, some commentators began
to re-investigate old arguments for an independent British Columbia, Alberta
or Ontario. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Gibson of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, whose <I>Thirty Million
Musketeers: One Canada for All Canadians</I> , has just been published,
warned that a &quot;majority-plus-one 'yes' vote&quot; in Quebec very quickly
might result in several nation-states emerging across the broad pink map
that now represents Canada. But Quebec, voting a majority-plus-one percent
&quot;no,&quot; did not secede, for the moment, though another attempt will
be made in a few years. In the long run, however, economics, the moral discipline
of the market and individualism--rather than ethnic nationalism--will prevail.
And, they should prevail. Je me souviens (&quot;I remember&quot;) is a bitter-sweet
ethnic sentiment, not a principle for just governance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the battered federalist victors in Monday's vote have another
chance to revise political Canada. One way to try to prevent dissolution
is devolution. Not just heavily subsidized Quebec, but also the relatively
well-off provinces of Ontario, B.C. and Alberta, want more power to make
policies on pensions, labor training and economic development. Driven by
the brutal demands of Canada's federal debt--roughly $400 billion U.S. dollars--and
huge provincial debts, too, the governing Liberal Party in Ottawa may well
agree. Otherwise, as Gordon Gibson notes, the twin to the danger of losing
Quebec will be losing Canada's sovereignty to foreign credit markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the way, as federal power is devolved to the provinces, the level
of federal funding will be cut. Taxes probably will not go up, however,
and eventually must come down, for political as well as economic reasons;
Canadians are punished by high taxation and are showing interest in the
supply-side economics of the relatively new Reform Party. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If cutting spending and devolution sound like an echo of the policies of
the Republican Congress elected last year in the United States, that is
because these trends are, in fact, widespread. Pruning back years of government
growth, privatizing and decentralizing are logical responses to increasing
global economic competition. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The frugality medicine is hard enough to swallow in the United States, but
Canada is likely to gag on it. But, one of the reasons for the strong separatist
vote in Quebec is the poor state of the Canadian economy, and the main reason
for the poor economy--high unemployment, high interest rates, sagging dollar--is
government's refusal until now to take the medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The moral discipline of the market does lead to economic--and social--health,
that is the good news. You can see the results in the recent improvements
in such far-flung countries as Chile, New Zealand, the Czech Republic and
Estonia. The government of President Meri of Estonia, who visited Seattle
this week, cut taxes and eliminated tariffs and reports a sustained six
percent growth rate, in contrast to dawdling, centralist Russia, next door.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estonians also have the second highest per capita Internet use in Eastern
Europe (after Finland). High technology, indeed, is another force for decentralization
and greater economic freedom world wide. The Internet is almost an emblem
of what is happening to communication and commerce today. It ignores national
borders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But does this free and open world, with its economy driven by high technology,
sound a bit frightening? If you feel that way, you have company in more
places than Quebec. In Eastern Europe, for example, the collapse of communism
caused even more fear than pain and often stimulated an escape to the seemingly
warm hearth of ethnic nationalism. Chechnya, Bosnia and the peaceful but
foolish secession of Slovakia from its Czech partner show the devastating
consequences of that illusion. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our own country, we only have to get over two generations' growth of
the welfare state, not totalitarian socialism. But the appeal of ethnic
nationalism is strong here, too, as witness the black separatist ambitions
(though now ambiguous) of Louis Farrakhan. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you are, if you are hurting and fearful, it is tempting to nourish
your resentments and to imagine that you are stronger in a group-- racial,
ethnic, religious, geographic, gender, or whatever. The group, you find,
derives its justification in grievances against some other group. If only
you can remember past wrongs to the group and elevate the group identity
to your all-purpose answer, you can forget the moral discipline of the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders and the classical liberal economists had a different
vision: of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The Canadians have
their own version of the same understanding. Because it respects all individuals
as equal before God and the law, this vision benefits society as a whole.
It tries, at least, to see you for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For people have souls as well as hearts, and souls do not go to heaven in
groups, but one by one.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>For Canada breaking up is hard <BR>
-- and wrong -- thing to do</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Canada is a country where something terrible is always just about to happen,
but never does. The terrible thing is usually the secession of Quebec. The
mere possibility of a province seceding reminds a citizen of the United
States of what stability was bequeathed to our country by the Civil War.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other respects, Canada's political scene is usually so calm that Americans
pay it no attention. We tend to see our northern neighbor as simply that
big happy vacation land that produces great comedians and Hollywood movie
locations that look more like American cities than our own do. &quot;Politics
in Canada&quot; sounds like the title of a boring book.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But hardly anything disturbs the political calm like breaking up one's country.
And in Canada that seems to be a constant and real threat. For nearly three
decades Canada, like Sisyphus, has been condemned to roll the rock of Quebec
up the hill of federalism, only to have it roll back down again, over and
over. Worse, federalist forces have to win every election held on on the
issue of separation, while secessionists need only win once. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably. In Canada, elections often settle even less than they do here,
especially since Canadians are masters of the art of Awkward Compromise
that leaves everybody somewhat satisfied, but also a little grumpy. If Quebeckers
next Monday vote for &quot;sovereignty&quot; and empowerment of provincial
leaders to negotiate a new relationship with the rest of Canada, it is still
unclear what that will mean in concrete terms. Prime Minister Jean Chretien
says it means separation, clear and simple. No more Canadian passports.
A division of the national debt, and no special favors. On the other side,
the Bloc Quebecois, led by Lucien Bouchard, argues that Quebec will be an
independent &quot;nation&quot; if the &quot;yes&quot; vote prevails, but
nationhood in this instance apparebtly is conceived as something between
the existence of a strong province and a truly foreign state. Both sides
claim the other is insincere and unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going into the final week of the campaign, the &quot;yes&quot; vote on sovereignty
was pulling ahead. If the final returns run along those lines, there will
be a political earthquake of long duration in Canada. Already, in dreadful
anticipation, the Canadian dollar and stock prices have been falling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best hope for federalism, acording to a former Liberal Party cabinet
minister, Gordon Gibson, who is now a fellow of the free-market Fraser Institute
in Vancouver, is &quot;ballot box chill.&quot; As seems to have happened
in 1980, Quebec voters may celebrate independence over the weekend, then
soberly vote their economic interests--which surely lie with federalism--the
next day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, Quebec sovereignty is a deep cultural aspiration for many of the
francophone citizens of la belle province, and to the extent that economic
motives operate beyond that aspiration, popular disatisfaction over the
currently stagnant economy seems to make &quot;change&quot; the ally of
separation rather than of continued federalism. Sadly, Quebec is no different
than the rest of Canada in its bad fiscal management in recent years. Government
deficits at both national and provincial levels are so high that America's
appear mild in comparison and elsewhere even the dominant Liberal Party
has been forced to economy measures, many Quebeckers have not got the word.
Though they are, on balance, subsidized by the federal government, they
think their economic difficulties come from unfair treatment at the hands
of &quot;TROC&quot;--the rest of Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That makes TROC as angry as reserved Canadians allow themselves to get.
Annoyance is especially strong in the West, and nobably across our border
in British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That raises the obvious question, how would a &quot;yes&quot; vote in Quebec
affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Americans, especially those living close to the border, the obvious
question is, how will this affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is complex. However annoyed English (or better, non-French) Canada
may be with Quebec, the prospect of disunion would be a real blow to national
morale. Worldwide, Canadian prestige would be hurt. Despite the high cost
of keeping Quebec in the style to which &quot;le Belle Province&quot; is
accustomed, the loss of Quebec and the literal division of the country,
would damage Canada economically. Even more than the US, Canada needs budgetary
belt-tightening combined with sound growth if it is to avoid economic decline.
Yet, as the breakup of the USSR has shown, it is difficult to reform oneself
economically while the whole map is being redrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Canada in not a basket case like some of the former Soviet states.
Unfortunately, Americans tend to think of Canada mainly as a place that
produces great comedians, shares our baseball games (where we fly their
flag upside down and get their national anthem wrong), and looks more &quot;American&quot;
in Hollywood movie productions than many locations in the United States.
It's our little brother that we alternately ignore or enjoy teasing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, in reality, Canada is a big, independent, powerful country. If it seems
less sometimes that is only because Canada is next door to, well, us. It
wins awards as the most &quot;livable&quot; country in the world. It is
democratic. In their quiet way, Canadians are passionate about freedom.
When times are tough, as when our diplomats were taken hostage by Iran,
or on any number of ocassions at the UN, when a confidential friend or honest
broker has been needed, Canada has taken on the job. In trouble spots around
the world or in a natural disaster, Canada is almost always at our side,
or there before us. Canada is our NATO ally. And our biggest trading partner.
Canada's well-being and its self-confidence matters--to us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, a vote for disunion may, once more, be avoided. Quebec's voters
may have their separatist victory party Saturday night and then sober up
the next day and again vote &quot;non.&quot; Alternatively, disunion for
a diminished Canada, if it happens could prove endurable, or even beneficial
for Canada. Like the Czech Republic without Slovakia or Slovenia without
the rest of Yugoslavia, a smaller Canada might actually prosper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, meanwhile, we in the Pacific Northwest have especially strong reasons
to be concerned about the Quebec vote. Our commercial and cultural ties
with British Columbia are growing stronger all the time. Regardless of the
Quebec vote, we have cause to persevere with our concept of &quot;Cascadia&quot;
as a cooperative region of US states--particularly Washington and Oregon--with
Western Canada--particularly B.C. We have great opportunities to promote
both sides of the border in this distinct and fortunate geographic region,
whether the collaboration is expressed in expanding tourism from overseas,
conducting ocassional joint trade missions, reducing border delays, improving
bi-national transportation, forming education partnerships among our universities,
boosting regional sports teams and arts activities, and just learning from
one another. Cross-border Cascadians have much in common, including a bright
future. Let us also make it plain that we have never wanted political union,
just friendship and cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The genuine crisis a Quebec separatist vote would cause Canada, and the
chronic frustration the issue will continue to cause in Canadian politics
even if the federalists prevail by a narrow margin, can evoke only one legitimate
response down here. Regret. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing we can do after Sunday's vote is to emphasize how much we
in the Northwest value the close ties we have with our provincial neighbors
in &quot;Cascadia,&quot; as well as with the rest of Canada.

<P>Ross Perot may have walked into a trap of his own devising. By deciding
to set up an official political party instead of merely running for President
as an independent candidate, Perot will be subject to all the legal difficulties
that beset the two major parties. It will be harder now for him to play
the reformist outsider. And the state versions of his new party are almost
sure to cause problems. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What will he have gained? Practically nothing. Organizing a new political
party in these times is like starting a typewriter company; you're investing
in a declining market. Political parties historically had four main roles:
control of nominations, financing candidates, filling patronage jobs and
creating a cohesive caucus in the Congress and state legislatures. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All but the last role have been reduced in the past thirty years, thanks
to one &quot;reform&quot; after another. Primary voters, not party regulars,
pick most nominees; candidates' organizations, not parties, raise most campaign
funds; and patronage--after a century of civil service reform--is down to
token numbers, and those few are hired by office-holders without much consultation
with their party. And the last role--forming legislative caucuses--is not
one that will benefit Perot's Independence Party, since it is unlikely to
elect many local candidates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we assume that Perot will be able to get his party legally recognized
in all 50 states, and that is a big assumption, there still are enormous
obstacles to operating the party successfully. Laws governing parties differ
widely from state to state. For example, the latitude for a party to give
financial support to particular candidates is far greater in a state like
Ohio than it is in a state like California. Separate legal teams, and legal
procedures, will be needed for each state. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With 50 new state Independence parties will come a certain amount of &quot;independence&quot;
for those parties internally. The publisher of the daily political Hotline
in Washington, D.C., Douglas Bailey, predicts that &quot;Once Perot creates
all these state parties, there is nothing to stop them from running local
candidates with their own ideas and their own personal baggage. Then Perot
loses control.&quot; New York's Independence Party, which suggested to Perot
that he use its name, already plans to slate up to a thousand candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot also may lose some of his self-styled reformer image. In the past,
he has wanted us to believe that the two major parties get into trouble
so often because their candidates are morally weak and lack his wonderous
&quot;common sense.&quot; Only Perot, standing above the fray, was pure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In reality, most election scandals are the result of some petty infraction
or wrong assumption about the nation's increasingly dense weave of campaign
laws. Never before, including the Progressive Era, have so many ethics laws
been put on the books. Even with relatively experienced personnel, the Republicans
and Democrats cannot help making the kind of petty bookkeeping and judgment
errors that, taken out of context and exaggerated by a hostile opponent
or the media, can be made to look serious and intentional. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot's United We Stand, America is legally a mere non-profit organization
and, for example, does not have to follow financial disclosure laws. But
Perot's new and official party will be held to the same strict standards
as the Republicans and Democrats. His organization will find the reporting
of contributions alone to be a tricky challenge. Then will come the scrutiny
by the media and political foes. Did anyone contribute more than the permitted
$1000 per person? Was any of the money from a source that someone, somewhere
deems disreputable? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, when something goes wrong, the blame will tend to fall directly
on Perot himself, for his party will still be identified as more of a one-man
show than any since 1968, when the American Independence Party was organized
by and for Alabama Governor George Wallace. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if Perot is the Independence Party presidential candidate, one of
the &quot;reforms&quot; most likely to develop wide public interest in 1996
will be ending the advantage allowed for rich individuals like him to buy
advertising and organizing talent that other parties must obtain through
broad solicitations. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Perot may persuade Colin Powell to run at the head of the new
party, which surely would increase the flow of individual contributions
and expand the party's showing at the polls. What opinion surveys indicate
so far is that the Independence Party would do its best with Powell as its
nominee. But the ticket still would not win. In contrast, the surveys suggest
that Powell as a Republican would win. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This raises another question. Other than Perot's o'ervaulting ambition,
what substantive reason is there for the Independence Party? Is there some
novel insight it brings to a deficient political system--as the new Republican
Party did with its clear anti-slavery message in the 1850s, which helped
it replace the badly divided Whigs? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No. Except for his anti-free trade position, Perot's main themes, including
budget cutting, echo the Republicans. The difference is that they are in
office, and he is not. They take the heat; he carps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the head of a national party, that stand-offish role will change. Ross
Perot running as an outsider, as in 1992, might make enough of an impression
on the electorate to defeat the Republicans' presidential nominee again,
and help re-elect President Clinton. But as the head of an official political
party? <BR>
<I><BR>
Wal, I don't have to tell you people, that great sucking sound is jest Ross
sinking down to the level of the rest of 'em! <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Public needn't fear budgetary 'train wreck' rhetoric </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
The noise you hear coming from Washington, D.C. is not the screeching prelude
to a budgetary &quot;train wreck.&quot; It's only the noise of a rhetoric
wreck. There is nothing at all unusual about the failure of Congress and
the President to reach agreement on a budget by the formal deadline, October
1 (this Sunday). And the &quot;crisis&quot; over the debt ceiling that is
slated to follow later on this fall is only slightly more worrisome. We
have gone through such &quot;crises&quot; many times since the 1970's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On one occasion, when Budget Director Jim Miller warned Ronald Reagan that
refusal to reach a compromise with the Democratic Congress could bring government
operations to a halt, the President replied, &quot;Jim, Jim, settle down.
Let's close the place down and see if anybody notices.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody did. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In similar stalemates now Congress almost routinely adopts a &quot;continuing
resolution&quot; that allows spending on essential services (such as defense)
and entitlements (such as Social Security) to carry on, and for other programs
to operate at a maintenance level. Such a resolution is available this weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The situation will not be much different around mid-November if Congress,
on another issue, tries to force financial discipline on the Administration
by refusing to raise the federal debt limit. Mr. Clinton and his allies
already are warning that Republican &quot;blackmail&quot; will spook the
markets. Air traffic will be grounded. Federal contractors will be stiffed.
Children will starve. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps these horror tales are meant to frighten us out of that national
&quot;funk&quot; that concerns the President. Or perhaps the Democrats are
just getting an early start on Halloween. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, all the whoops of distress have but one purpose, which is to deflect
the majority in Congress from doing what they promised: to cut the budget
now in order to balance it by 2002. The people whose careers are built on
an ever-expanding government sector--people who believe that downsizing
is only for the private sector--are going to try to make you believe that
the world is coming to an end. But it's only their political assumptions
that are ending. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get me wrong. Many proposed budget cuts are difficult to accept. Some
reductions don't make sense when considered by themselves. And almost all
of us are for government spending when it favors a cause close to our own
hearts. I can see the desirability of eliminating the national service program,
&quot;Americorps,&quot; but a student benefiting from its payments probably
does not. Consumers in Seattle and New York might cheer the overdue effort
to end farm subsidies, but it's a hard sell in Louisiana cotton country
or Wisconsin dairlyand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the truth is that relatively little of the budget savings needed
will be achieved just by cutting &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; or
even by tackling special interest spending. At some point, you have to go
into broadly popular programs. That Republicans are doing so, though gingerly,
and that these reductions are being presented before television cameras
as the mad slashing of mean-spirited conservatives, accounts for the sagging
public approval ratings of Congress. Yet, with a national debt equal to
$71,860 per family of four, we just can't afford all the good things government
intends to do for us. Spending growth needs to slacken. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, taxes do need to go down. The reason is not to make the rich richer,
but to raise our savings rate, spark the investments that create jobs and
to help working families make ends meet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question for voters is, do you really want to stay on the track to long
term economic growth, or do you want to derail the train at the first signs
of difficulty? For the Republican majority in Congress, the question is
almost identical. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most Democrats, as in the '80's, have already given their
answer: Real cuts are for budgetary &quot;outyears,&quot; Washington, D.C.'s
equivalent of the sweet-by-and-by. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 80's, when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats
controlled Congress, the tactical advantage is now with the GOP. If Congress
wants to spend, a President has few ways to prevent it. If--as now--Congress
does not want to spend, the President has even fewer ways to force it to
do so. In a contest of wills, Congress probably can stand the pressure better
than the President. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That means they also may not be deterred by short term drops in the polls.
Perhaps the left has forgotten a pertinent lesson from the past, but it
has not been forgotten by the GOP elephant. In 1990, when President George
Bush tried to force budgetary restraint on a Democratic Congress, the artificial
heat generated in the ensuing &quot;crisis&quot; was especially intense.
Bush finally cracked and backed down. In return for limited future spending
controls, he agreed to break his pledge on taxes (Remember &quot;Read my
lips&quot;?). He was a hero to the media at the time, a real statesman.
And the voters didn't seem to care much--until they trounced him soundly
in the next election. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 the Republicans ran on a Contract with America. They told the voters
exactly what they wanted to do: cut spending, cut taxes and revive America's
economic growth. And they won a history-making victory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
They are now trying to do what they promised. Boogeymen are being thrown
up to scare them off track, including Mr. Clinton's holograph of a government
&quot;train wreck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the ghost of George Bush scares them a lot more. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tithing tax break offers better reform <BR>
than block-grant push </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Wailing critics in Washington, D.C. would like you to believe that America's
poor are about to be devastated by plans to block grant welfare funds and
send them to the states. The House of Representative's desire to add specific
mandates to that approach simply raises the wailing to a higher pitch. <BR>
<BR>
But the truth is that 70 of the 80 major federal and state welfare-related
programs are not affected by the reform bills, while those that are affected
will go through a slower rate of growth, not real reductions. Adopting &quot;workfare&quot;
or allowing the states to experiment with other structural changes does
not automatically assure more innovative use of the money, let alone savings.
<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of whether the Senate bill or the House bill emerges from the
conference committee set up to reconcile their differences, and regardless
of the President's relative enthusiasm,&quot;welfare as we know it&quot;
is not really going to end. But, maybe it should. <BR>
<BR>
Why must we always turn to government--at whatever level--for welfare solutions?
Since the 1960's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; spending on cash and in-kind
transfers (cash, food, housing, energy, medical aid, etc.) has increased
640 percent in real, inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet most social problems--such
as out-of-wedlock birth rates--are far worse today. Perhaps welfare reformers
are not being &quot;radical&quot; enough. &quot;Radical,&quot; after all,
means getting at the roots, and when it comes to helping the poor, we need
to recognize that the private sectors of society--including churches and
other non-profit organizations, as well as the job-creating profit sector--tend
to do a better job than government. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to find ways to enable the non-government sectors gradually
to take on greater responsibility, while government's role is reduced. The
idea is not to leave the poor without friends, but to find them truer friends.
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana proposes to stimulate private giving with an
increase in the tax deductibility of charitable donations, from 100 to 120
percent. Reps. Joe Knollenberg of Michigan and Jim Kolbe of Arizona would
give a $100 tax credit for gifts to community groups that work with the
poor. Sen. Coats of Indiana would increase that to $500. <BR>
<BR>
In Seattle, philanthropist and former businessman Mark Bloome asserts that
society would be spiritually improved overall and the poor allowed to advance
more surely, if the old Judeo-Christian ideal of the &quot;tithe&quot; could
be reinvigorated. He does not necessarily connect his idea with welfare
reform, but welfare reform certainly would benefit from being connected
with his idea. Tithing, the gift of 10 percent of one's income to the church
or other charity, is rare today, a victim mainly of high taxes. The answer,
Bloome believes, is to provide a federal tax credit for those charitable
contributions a person makes beyond five percent of his income (which are
tax deductible) and up to ten percent (the tithe). In contrast to a mere
deduction, the tithe would encourage people to give beyond the five percent
threshold, which is already a sacrifice, while the ten percent ceiling would
prevent tax-credited benevolence from bankrupting the federal treasury.
<BR>
<BR>
Tax reform advocates, as well as welfare reformers, would do well to consider
the wisdom of ideas like Bloome's. Experience in the 80's--when marginal
tax rates were lower and charitable giving was higher--and the 90's--when
tax rates went up and charitable giving stagnated--supports the common sense
expectation that people will give more when they have more to give. Thus,
lower and flatter tax rates probably will increase charitable giving even
as they boost the overall economy and personal income growth. <BR>
<BR>
What tax reformers tend to overlook is the political, if the not the moral,
desirability of linking a more productive tax system to one that assuredly
serves the poor directly. The tithing idea would do it. <BR>
<BR>
Private charity is intrinsic to the American character. It is more personal
and voluntary, and hence more moral, than government distributed tax funds.
And it tends to be more effective. Perhaps private charity cannot supplant
all government welfare, but it can redress the present imbalance. It offers
citizens of many political persuasions a potentially better choice than
either the present welfare mess or any of the conventional political proposals
for reform. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to get radical.

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Endless campaign a poor way to choose a president&quot;
</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>By Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>

<BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
In the recent dog days of summer, over a hundred people showed up at Seattle's
Washington Institute to meet one of the superficially more improbable candidates
for President in 1996, the articulate black Republican, Alan Keyes. <BR>
<BR>
A former Reagan Administration official, Keyes believes that the decline
of the family is the central problem in society, around which almost all
other problems revolve. His message went over well. He said he'll be back
soon. <BR>
<BR>
For so many citizens to appear at such events a full year before the 1996
national nominating conventions and fifteen months before the final election
might seem remarkable. But, decision time for activists is not next spring;
it's now. <BR>
<BR>
Presidential campaigns are being organized and financed earlier than ever
before. Competition to attract attention from candidates and the media has
encouraged states to set their primaries earlier and earlier on the calendar.
As a result, the first primaries next year will come in February. Only seven
weeks later, in April, over 80 percent of all public votes for delegates
will be over. <BR>
<BR>
If candidates waited to enter the race until the primary season was nearly
underway, as Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952, they would be too late to qualify
legally, let alone to assemble a team. (Attention, Gen. Colin Powell.) A
strategy like President Franklin Roosevelt's in 1940--when he did not declare
his candidacy until the eve of the Democratic convention--is unimaginable
in our time. <BR>
<BR>
Since Washington State recently moved its own presidential primary forward
to March 26, we, too, are suddenly part of the scramble. That and fundraising
opportunities are the reasons that candidates already are showing up. Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have all flown in.
Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, who still thinks a coherent foreign policy is
important, apparently has decided that Washington could be a breakthrough
state for his candidacy and is planning several visits. Malcom S. (&quot;Steve&quot;)
Forbes, Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine (&quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;),
may visit Seattle soon after a likely declaration of candidacy this month.
Now that our primary falls on the same date as nearby California's, even
the frontrunning Sen. Bob Dole is increasing his interest in Washington
State, according to his national political consultant, Don Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Washington is a must-win state for the Democrats in the final
election, so don't be surprised to see lots of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore. <BR>
<BR>
In the month of March in past presidential election years, we were all watching
the first primary. But next March, Washington State will be taking part
in one of the last of the important ones. Thereafter, the identity of the
two presidential nominees may well be known--and then we will fall into
the rut of a six month long final election drive. Spring's excitement will
be brief, the frustrations that follow interminable. <BR>
<BR>
If you believe that democracy benefits from some relatively quiet time between
spasms of political extravagance, this is not the way to organize our national
elections. Neither a sitting president nor his opponent is likely to behave
like a statesman when a campaign atmosphere dominates. Leadership suffers
when a presidency is preoccupied with the next election for a full two years
out of a four year term of office. <BR>
<BR>
When you consider that the first six months or so of a president's term
are absorbed in putting an administration together--another process elongated
in recent times--the normal tasks of governing actually are getting only
about a year and a half of our Chief Executive's undivided attention. And
the same is true for most of his would-be opponents. <BR>
<BR>
Americans don't hate these politicians. They just get very tired of them.
But, no immediate change is possible. Party rules and presidential primary
dates are already locked into place for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
The only cure for the coming epidemic of politics-fatigue is for citizens
in this election cycle to demand that the two major parties and Congress
push the primaries back to something like their old schedule for the year
2000. Parties, for example, should pass rules precluding the seating of
convention delegates that are chosen before, say, April of an election year.
And Congress should refuse to provide candidates with federal matching funds
until roughly the same period. <BR>
<BR>
In an era of instantaneous and ubiquitous communications, why should our
political system require five times as long to choose a president as it
did in the days of Grover Cleveland?

Forward Thrust or Bust? </CENTER>

<P>The danger in next month's capital improvements election--with the Seattle
Commons, neighborhood ball parks and a big outdoor ballpark for the Mariners
on the ballot--is not that voters of Seattle and King County will lack the
facts upon which to make a sound judgment. There will be plenty of healthy
debate. The real danger, especially for young voters and newcomers, is that
the choices may take place in an historical vacuum. <BR>
<BR>
The best argument for the bond issues is that, unlike so many federal, state
and even government promises, voters in this case can be fairly sure of
what they are getting for their money. They will be able to see the results.
But if they are skeptical, they might want to review what happened with
some other great decisions in Seattle history, including most recently,
&quot;Forward Thrust.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even people who experienced it may have forgotten what that former citizens'
crusade did to make Seattle a better place to live. Indeed, our area today
is at a crucial point not unlike that of 27 years ago. The economic boom
back then had left many people worried, for the first time, that the area's
&quot;livability&quot; was threatened. Yet, voters may have been more optimistic
then, if only because family income was growing faster than it is now. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, that optimism was somewhat unwarranted. Within a couple
of years after the first and determinative Forward Thrust election of 1968,
Seattle suffered the famous &quot;Boeing recession.&quot; In the subsequent,
less hopeful atmosphere of 1970, the remaining Forward Thrust proposals
that were put on that year's ballot were defeated. <BR>
<BR>
But then a wonderful thing happened--several wonderful things, really. The
Forward Thrust projects that King County residents had approved in the palmy
days of 1968 began development in the early 70's at just the right time
to help revive the economy. A spectacular series of civic improvements ensued,
including new parks, recreation and professional sports facilities, sanitation,
fire stations, a youth service center, and community centers. It was largely
due to the major Forward Thrust projects, and the many smaller projects
inspired by them, that Seattle started winning &quot;Most Livable City&quot;
awards over the following decade. A successful 1972 vote for a metropolitican
bus system (the often-forgotten third ballot vote of the Forward Thrust
series), and the state legislature's adoption of Forward Thrust measures
to modernize SeaTac Airport and our seaport added to the momentum. <BR>
<BR>
I was newly on the City Council then and delighted with the opportunities
Forward Thrust offered Seattle. Many of them were serendipitous and unanticipated.
For example, historic preservation had not been considered when the Forward
Thrust parks proposal was planned, but by 1972 we were able to use historic
preservation techniques to find new uses for old Seattle landmarks and to
save money on building some of the &quot;new&quot; facilities Forward Thrust
had promised. <BR>
<BR>
As for the parks themselves, Forward Thrust allowed Seattle area governments
to pick up properties for what we can now see were bargain prices. For example,
the land for Mercer Island's Luther Burbank Park, presently valued at $70
million, was acquired for all of $l.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
Though capital funds were relatively plentiful in the '70's, thanks to Forward
Thrust, maintenance funds were not. But Forward Thrust inspired City Hall
to find creative ways to close much of the gap. One way was to combine projects
in order to reduce overhead expenses. Merging the new aquarium with the
Waterfront Park is an example. <BR>
<BR>
We also found we could get some of the new parks actually to generate revenue
to offset their maintenance costs, as was the case again at Waterfront Park.
Re-using the existing old piers as part of the park design was entirely
in keeping with the park's theme, and it also permitted us to expand visitor
interest with shops and restaurants. And, ever since, these private concessions
have provided the city with rent and sales tax revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the inspiration of the father of the Forward Thrust movement, Jim
Ellis, the city and county also learned how to leverage bond moneys to attract
public grants, private investments and gifts. These ranged from highway
funds and a new private building that helped make Freeway Park possible
to private flower garden donations for the park's operations. Thus, the
citizens of Seattle and King County actually got far more than they voted
for. How often does that happen with government? <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the total bond moneys of $330 million were nearly doubled by federal
and state public grants, along with private investments and gifts ($240
million), plus interest on the bonds ($55 million). Throw in the increased
property values of recent decades, and Forward Thrust turns out to have
been the best bargain for Seattleites since we built the City Light hydroelectric
dams at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
People over 40 often ask what happened to the kind of enlightened and inventive
civic leadership that gave us Forward Thrust. Part of the answer is that
while contemporary Americans demand leadership, we denigrate leaders. We
are particularly cynical about motives now, even with citizen volunteers.
And then there is the problem of time. Back in the '60's, Jim Ellis expected
to spend less than two years on Forward Thrust and wound up devoting seven.
Today's extensive approval processes and other hurdles make public projects
exhausting for citizen leaders. <BR>
<BR>
But the rest of the answer to the leadership question is more heartening.
The truth is that both the Seattle Commons idea and the proposal to build
a new outdoor stadium initially arose from outside of government and have
elicited almost exactly the same quality of citizen spirit that gave us
Forward Thrust-or, earlier, the Century 21 World's Fair that left us the
Seattle Center. <BR>
<BR>
Over several years more than 2500 citizens from all walks of life have donated
personal time, financial contributions and talent to the Commons idea. At
first, there was not even any great interest from the organized business
community or from government. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hidden agenda. The uncommon Commons vision is persuasive because
it has just the right mix of boldness and prudence, like Forward Thrust.
The vision is to create 18,000 good new jobs, anchor a good share of the
city's new, multi-income housing growth at the south end of Lake Union,
with a landmark central park that everyone can use, and in the process help
reduce urban sprawl and traffic congestion. It will be a model of a more
sensible urban envirornment. <BR>
<BR>
As with Forward Thrust, the citizens who have thrown themselves into the
Commons effort have figured out how to blend many aims to produce a package
with wide appeal. The neighborhood ballparks are needed, though they are
not urgent. But the plan to use the Commons project as a means to solve
the near-legendary Mercer Street traffic mess is an excellent case of sound
multi-purpose planning. <BR>
<BR>
The Commons, if adopted, probably will excel Forward Thrust in attracting
private investments and and already has done so with philanthropic gifts
and loans. The Commons group also has figured out how to attract money from
outside the area. As an immediate consequence of approval of the Commons'
bonds, $18 million of bond funds will be used to secure matching state and
federal highway grants to widen the Mercer corridor and put it underground.
<BR>
<BR>
When you think of it, the Forward Thrust spirit is also alive in the unfairly-maligned
plan to build a Mariners ballpark. It, too, will be multi-purpose, not just
the place for a baseball fan to enjoy a soft summer night, but a place for
any of us, and our children, to enjoy a wide range of civic events and celebrations.
And thanks to an ingenious retractable roof, it will work regardless of
the weather. <BR>
<BR>
The ballpark proposal bespeaks the all too-unusual civic dedication of the
wealthy individuals who risked their own money--starting with the Japanese
owner of Nintendo who effectively gifted us with $50 million--to save the
local professional baseball team. That is what we now have on the line.
<BR>
<BR>
You don't put your money into a baseball team in Seattle to get rich (or
richer) these days, whatever you may tell your spouse. And you don't go
to endless Commons meetings to advance your career. Maybe you step forward
because you are nostalgic for your youth, or for the dreams you had of the
city you'd like to see, or maybe you are that old fashioned type of person
who believes in the concept of civic virtue. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its source, we can't buy that kind of civic spirit at any price.
Like the citizens of the ancient Roman republic--or Seattle at the high
points of its history--we can only try to call it forth. <BR>
<BR>
This town has lots of other needs and opportunities beyond those on the
current ballot. But that is not a reason for discouragement. We also have
better prospects than we have ever enjoyed. Surely we would like to see
more of the newly wealthy Seattleites step up to the challenge of philanthropy
and to endow our next genereation with new civic advantages--in schools,
city beautification, housing, camps, museums, public gardens, transportation
amenities, music, medical care, and job opportunities. But, how do we entice
our new millionaires to play this role unless we honor those who do? <BR>
<BR>
This town, as part of its heritage, also probably has more than its fair
share of talented potential citizen leaders, regardless of financial resources,
good people of a new generation whose imagination, know-how and drive we
would like to enlist for our community's benefit. They will do the volunteer
chores others shirk. But what do we have to entice those individuals--other
than the respect we pay them by taking their efforts seriously? <BR>
<BR>
Is ours going to be the era of Forward Bust? Or are we headed for another
Forward Thrust, with all the good it can bring us? The September ballot
will not finally answer that question. But it can become an important sign
that civic confidence--and the calling forth of public service--is once
again ignited. It can light our way. <BR>
<BR>
If you doubt what such measures can do for a city, drive around. Many of
the best features of contemporary Seattle sprang from the public spirited
efforts of earlier citizens, including the Progressive Era generation at
the turn of the century who built our first comprehensive boulevard and
parks systems, the ship canals and locks, our exemplary water reservoirs
and power dams and the Denny Regrade. Those folks are all gone. <BR>
<BR>
But the Forward Thrust generation, most of them, are still here. From our
clean water to a vibrant cultural life, you also can see their works. The
point is that Seattle did not become the envy of the nation by accident.
Seattle citizens--with remarkable frequency--have made wise choices at the
right time. <BR>
<BR>
Just look around you.

<BR>
The message of this book cuts to the heart of a new revolution sweeping
across America.</B> The message addresses a concern you probably feel in
your gut as intensely as I do-a helplessness and insecurity about our nation's
future. It's a sentiment many of us are trying to communicate to our friends,
family members and politicians. Americans are worried about their country's
direction, and their political opinions are volatile. <BR>
<BR>
<B>For proof, we need only examine the results of recent national elections.</B>
We simply don't like the way things are going. We are looking for new answers,
and we are prepared to sweep out old ways for those that work. We desperately
want to believe that our actions make a difference. We want to know that
we still control our own destiny. When we believe we have job security,
the ability to get ahead, and that the safety and educational opportunities
of our children are assured, Americans feel their country is on the right
track. But these issues are among our most serious concerns today. We are
fed up, with the direction in which our government is leading us. We are
angry and very distrustful of our politicians. Americans in both parties-liberals
and conservatives-have the same concern: We are paying too much in taxes,
getting too little in return, and recklessly mortgaging our future. People
simply don't trust government solutions or our political leaders. Thus,
a new revolution is underway-redefining the role of government as it affects
people's lives and pocketbooks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><CENTER>Millions of Americans Are Angry and Frustrated</CENTER>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Many of us are afraid that future opportunity is diminishing.</B>
When I interviewed people for this book, I asked, &quot;Will your children
have a higher standard of living and greater opportunities than you?&quot;
Eight out of ten immediately responded no- indicating they strongly believed
their children would have a lowerstandard of living and less opportunity.
This runs contrary to traditional American optimism. We pride ourselves
in working hard, and passing expanded opportunities on to our children.
America historically sees itself as a land of progress and dreams. But,
a majority of Americans today feel we are on a treadmill. We are angry.
And we are ready for change.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>A Series of Eyes</H3>
<BR>
How do we see? In the 19th century the anatomy of the eye was known in great
detail, and its sophisticated features astounded everyone who was familiar
with them. Scientists of the time correctly observed that if a person were
so unfortunate as to be missing one of the eye's many integrated features,
such as the lens, or iris, or ocular muscles, the inevitable result would
be a severe loss of vision or outright blindness. So it was concludedthat
the eye could only function if it were nearly intact<BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin knew about the eye too. In the Origin of Species, Darwin
dealt with many objections to his theory of evolution by natural selection.
He discussed the problem of the eye in a section of the book appropriately
entitled &quot;Organs of extreme perfection and complication.&quot; Somehow,
for evolution to be believable, Darwin had to convince the public that complex
organs could be formed gradually, in a step-by-step process. 
<H3><HR><IMG SRC="greenfinger.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="LEFT" 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><A HREF="dissent.html">The Dissent of Man</A><I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> review of Discovery Fellow Michael Behe's book <I>Darwin's
Black Box</I><BR>
<HR></H3>
<BR>
He succeeded brilliantly. Cleverly, Darwin didn't try to discover a real
pathway that evolution might have used to make the eye. Instead, he pointed
to modern animals with different kinds of eyes, ranging from the simple
to the complex, and suggested that the evolution of the human eye might
have involved similar organs as intermediates.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a paraphrase of Darwin's argument. Although humans have complex
camera-type eyes, many animals get by with less. Some tiny creatures have
just a simple group of pigmented cells, or not much more than a light sensitive
spot. That simple arrangement can hardly be said to confer vision,but it
can sense light and dark, and so it meets the creature's needs. The light-sensing
organ of some starfishes is somewhat more sophisticated. Their eye is located
in a depressed region. This allows the animal to sense which direction the
light is coming from, since the curvature of the depression blocks off light
from some directions. If the curvature becomes more pronounced, the directional
sense of the eye improves. But more curvature lessens the amount of light
that enters the eye, decreasing its sensitivity.The sensitivity can be increased
by placement of gelatinous material in the cavity to act as a lens. Some
modern animals have eyes with such crude lenses. Gradual improvements in
the lens could then provide an image of increasing sharpness, as the requirements
of the animal's environment dictated.<BR>
<BR>
Using reasoning like this, Darwin convinced many of his readers that an
evolutionary pathway leads from the simplest light sensitive spot to the
sophisticated camera-eye of man. But the question remains, how did vision
begin? Darwin persuaded much of the world that a modern eye evolved gradually
from a simpler structure, but he did not even try to explain where his starting
point for the simple light sensitive spot came from. On the contrary, Darwin
dismissed the question of the eye's ultimate origin:<BR>
<BR>
How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than
how life itself originated. He had an excellent reason for declining the
question: it was completely beyond nineteenth century science. How the eye
works; that is, what happenswhen a photon of light first hits the retina
simply could not be answered at that time. As a matter of fact, no question
about the underlying mechanisms of life could be answered. How did animal
muscles cause movement? How did photosynthesis work? How was energy extracted
from food? How did the body fight infection? No one knew. <BR>
<BR>
To Darwin vision was a black box, but today, after the hard,cumulative work
of many biochemists, we are approaching answers to the question of sight.
Here is a brief overview of the biochemistry of vision.When light first
strikes the retina, a photon interacts with a molecule called 11-cis-retinal,
which rearranges within picoseconds to trans-retinal. The change in the
shape of retinal forces a change in the shape of the protein,rhodopsin,
to which the retinal is tightly bound. The protein's metamorphosis alters
its behavior, making it stick to another protein called transducin.Before
bumping into activated rhodopsin, transducin had tightly bound a small molecule
called GDP. But when transducin interacts with activated rhodopsin,the GDP
falls off and a molecule called GTP binds to transducin. (GTP is closely
related to, but critically different from, GDP.)<BR>
<BR>
GTP-transducin-activated rhodopsin now binds to a protein called phosphodiesterase,
located in the inner membrane of the cell. When attached to activated rhodopsin
and its entourage, the phosphodiesterase acquires the ability to chemically
cut a molecule called cGMP (a chemical relative of both GDP and GTP). Initially
there are a lot of cGMP molecules in the cell, but the phosphodiesterase
lowers its concentration, like a pulled plug lowers thewater level in a
bathtub.<BR>
<BR>
Another membrane protein that binds cGMP is called an ion channel. It acts
as a gateway that regulates the number of sodium ions in the cell. Normally
the ion channel allows sodium ions to flow into the cell, while a separate
protein actively pumps them out again. The dual action of the ion channel
and pump keeps the level of sodium ions in the cell within a narrow range.
When the amount of cGMP is reduced because of cleavage by the phosphodiesterase,
the ion channel closes, causing the cellular concentration of positively
charged sodium ions to be reduced. This causes an imbalance of charge across
the cell membrane which, finally, causes a current to be transmitted down
the optic nerve to the brain. The result, when interpretedby the brain,
is vision.<BR>
<BR>
My explanation is just a sketchy overview of the biochemistry of vision.
Ultimately, though, this is what it means to &quot;explain&quot; vision.
This is the level of explanation for which biological science must aim.
In order to truly understand a function, one must understand in detail every
relevant step in the process. The relevant steps in biological processes
occur ultimately at the molecular level, so a satisfactory explanation of
a biological phenomenon such as vision, or digestion, or immunity must include
its molecular explanation.<BR>
<BR>
Now that the black box of vision has been opened it is no longer enough
for an &quot;evolutionary explanation&quot; of that power to consider only
the anatomical structures of whole eyes, as Darwin did in the nineteenth
century,and as popularizers of evolution continue to do today. Each of the
anatomical steps and structures that Darwin thought were so simple actually
involves staggeringly complicated biochemical processes that cannot be papered
over with rhetoric. Darwin's simple steps are now revealed to be huge leaps
between carefully tailored machines. Thus biochemistry offers a Lilliputian
challenge to Darwin. Now the black box of the cell has been opened and a
Lilliputian world of staggering complexity stands revealed. It must be explained.Irreducible
Complexity<BR>
<BR>
How can we decide if Darwin's theory can account for the complexity of molecular
life? It turns out that Darwin himself set the standard. He acknowledged
that:<BR>
<BR>
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not
possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications,
my theory would absolutely break down.But what type of biological system
could not be formed by &quot;numerous,successive, slight modifications&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Well, for starters, a system that is irreducibly complex. Irreducible complexity
is just a fancy phrase I use to mean a single system which is composed of
several interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts
causes the system to cease functioning. <BR>
<BR>
Let's consider an everyday example of irreducible complexity: the humble
mousetrap. The mousetraps that my family uses consist of a number of parts.
There are: 1) a flat wooden platform to act as a base; 2) a metal hammer,
which does the actual job of crushing the little mouse; 3) a springwith
extended ends to press against the platform and the hammer when the trap
is charged; 4) a sensitive catch which releases when slight pressure is
applied, and 5) a metal bar which connects to the catch and holds the hammer
back when the trap is charged. Now you can't catch a few mice with just
a platform, add a spring and catch a few more mice, add a holding bar and
catch a few more. All the pieces of the mousetrap have to be in place before
you catch any mice. Therefore the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.<BR>
<BR>
An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by numerous, successive,
slight modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an
irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.
An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would
be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection
can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system
cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit,
in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstration that a system is irreducibly complex is not a proof that there
is absolutely no gradual route to its production. Although an irreducibly
complex system can't be produced directly, one can't definitively rule out
the possibility of an indirect, circuitous route. However, as the complexity
of an interacting system increases, the likelihood of such an indirect route
drops precipitously. And as the number of unexplained,irreducibly complex
biological systems increases, our confidence that Darwin's criterion of
failure has been met skyrockets toward the maximum that science allows.The
cilium<BR>
<BR>
Now, are any biochemical systems irreducibly complex? Yes, it turns out
that many are. A good example is the cilium. Cilia are hairlike structures
on the surfaces of many animal and lower plant cells that can move fluid
over the cell's surface or &quot;row&quot; single cells through a fluid.
Inhumans, for example, cells lining the respiratory tract each have about
200 cilia that beat in synchrony to sweep mucus towards the throat forelimination.
What is the structure of a cilium? A cilium consists of a bundle of fibers
called an axoneme. An axoneme contains a ring of 9 double&quot;microtubules&quot;
surrounding two central single microtubules. Each outer doublet consists
of a ring of 13 filaments (subfiber A) fused to an assembly of 10 filaments
(subfiber B). The filaments of the microtubules are composedof two proteins
called alpha and beta tubulin. The 11 microtubules forming an axoneme are
held together by three types of connectors: subfibers A are joined to the
central microtubules by radial spokes; adjacent outer doublets are joined
by linkers of a highly elastic protein called nexin; and the central microtubules
are joined by a connecting bridge. Finally, every subfiber A bears two arms,
an inner arm and an outer arm, both containing a protein called dynein.<BR>
<BR>
But how does a cilium work? Experiments have shown that ciliary motion results
from the chemically-powered &quot;walking&quot; of the dynein arms on one
microtubule up a second microtubule so that the two microtubules slide past
each other. The protein cross-links between microtubules in a cilium prevent
neighboring microtubules from sliding past each other by more than a short
distance. These cross-links, therefore, convert the dynein-induced sliding
motion to a bending motion of the entire axoneme.<BR>
<BR>
Now, let us consider what this implies. What components are neededfor a
cilium to work? Ciliary motion certainly requires microtubules;otherwise,
there would be no strands to slide. Additionally we require a motor, or
else the microtubules of the cilium would lie stiff and motionless.Furthermore,
we require linkers to tug on neighboring strands, converting the sliding
motion into a bending motion, and preventing the structure from falling
apart. All of these parts are required to perform one function:ciliary motion.
Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are
present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules,
connectors, and motors. Therefore, we can concludethat the cilium is irreducibly
complex;an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian
evolution.Blood Clotting <BR>
<BR>
Now let's talk about a different biochemical system of blood clotting.Amusingly,
the way in which the blood clotting system works is reminiscent of a Rube
Goldberg machine.<BR>
<BR>
The name of Rube Goldberg; the great cartoonist who entertainedAmerica with
his silly machines,lives on in our culture, but the man himself has pretty
much faded from view. Here's a typical example of his humor. In this cartoon
Goldberg imagined a system where water from a drain-pipe fills a flask,
causing a cork with attached needle to rise and puncture a paper cup containing
beer, which sprinkles on a bird. The intoxicated bird falls onto a spring,
bounces up to a platform, and pulls a string thinking it's a worm.The string
triggers a cannon which frightens a dog. The dog flips over, and his rapid
breathing raises and lowers a scratcher over a mosquito bite,causing no
embarrassment while talking to a lady. <BR>
<BR>
When you think about it for a moment you realize that the RubeGoldberg machine
is irreducibly complex. It is a single system which is composed of several
interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes
the system to break down. If the dog is missing the machine doesn't work;
if the needle hasn't been put on the cork, the whole system is useless.
<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that we all have Rube Goldberg in our blood. Here's a picture
of a cell trapped in a clot. The meshwork is formed from a protein called
fibrin. But what controls blood clotting? Why does blood clot when you cut
yourself, but not at other times when a clot would cause a stroke or heart
attack? Here's a diagram of what's called the blood clotting cascade.Let's
go through just some of the reactions of clotting.<BR>
<BR>
When an animal is cut a protein called Hageman factor sticks to the surface
of cells near the wound. Bound Hageman factor is then cleaved by a protein
called HMK to yield activated Hageman factor. Immediately the activated
Hageman factor converts another protein, called prekallikrein, to its active
form, kallikrein. Kallikrein helps HMK speed up the conversion of more Hageman
factor to its active form. Activated Hageman factor and HMK then together
transform another protein, called PTA, to its active form. Activated PTA
in turn, together with the activated form of another protein (discussed
below) called convertin, switch a protein called Christmas factor to its
active form. Activated Christmas factor, together with antihemophilic factor
(which is itself activated by thrombin in a manner similar to that of proaccelerin)
changes Stuart factor to its active form. Stuart factor,working with accelerin,
converts prothrombin to thrombin. Finally thrombin cuts fibrinogen to give
fibrin, which aggregates with other fibrin molecules to form the meshwork
clot you saw in the last picture.<BR>
<BR>
Blood clotting requires extreme precision. When a pressurized bloodcirculation
system is punctured, a clot must form quickly or the animal will bleed to
death. On the other hand, if blood congeals at the wrong time or place,
then the clot may block circulation as it does in heart attacks andstrokes.
Furthermore, a clot has to stop bleeding all along the length of the cut,
sealing it completely. Yet blood clotting must be confined to the cut or
the entire blood system of the animal might solidify, killing it.Consequently,
clotting requires this enormously complex system so that the clot forms
only when and only where it is required. Blood clotting is the ultimate
Rube Goldberg machine. 
<H3>The Professional Literature</H3>
<BR>
Other examples of irreducible complexity abound in the cell,including aspects
of protein transport, the bacterial flagellum, electron transport, telomeres,
photosynthesis, transcription regulation, and much more. Examples of irreducible
complexity can be found on virtually every page of a biochemistry textbook.
But if these things cannot be explained by Darwinian evolution, how has
the scientific community regarded these phenomena of the past forty years?
A good place to look for an answer to that question is in the Journal of
Molecular Evolution. JME is a journal that was begun specifically to deal
with the topic of how evolution occurs on the molecular level. It has high
scientific standards, and is edited by prominent figures in the field. In
a recent issue of JME there were published eleven articles; of these, all
eleven were concerned simply with the comparison of protein or DNA sequences.
A sequence comparison is an amino acid-by-amino acid comparison of two different
proteins, or a nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison of two different pieces
of DNA, noting the positions at which they are identical or similar, and
the places where they are not. Although useful for determining possible
lines of descent, which is an interesting questionin its own right, comparing
sequences cannot show how a complex biochemical system achieved its function;
the question that most concerns us here. By way of analogy, the instruction
manuals for two different models of computer putout by the same company
might have many identical words, sentences, and even paragraphs, suggesting
a common ancestry (perhaps the same author wrote both manuals), but comparing
the sequences of letters in the instruction manuals will never tell us if
a computer can be produced step by step starting from a typewriter.<BR>
<BR>
None of the papers discussed detailed models for intermediates in the development
of complex biomolecular structures. In the past ten years JME has published
over a thousand papers. Of these, about one hundred discussed the chemical
synthesis of molecules thought to be necessary for the origin of life, about
50 proposed mathematical models to improve sequence analysis, and about
800 were analyses of sequences. There were ZERO papers discussing detailed
models for intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular structures.
This is not a peculiarity of JME. No papers are to be found that discuss
detailed models for intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular
structures in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Nature,
Science, the Journal of Molecular Biology or, to my knowledge, any science
journal whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Publish or perish&quot; is a proverb that academicians take seriously.
If you do not publish your work for the rest of the community to evaluate,
then you have no business in academia and, if you don't already have tenure,
you will be banished. But the saying can be applied to theories as well.
If a theory claims to be able to explain some phenomenon but does not generate
even an attempt at an explanation, then it should be banished. Despite comparing
sequences, molecular evolution has never addressed the question of how complex
structures came to be. In effect, the theory of Darwinian molecular evolution
has not published, and so it should perish. 
<H3>Detection of Design</H3>
<BR>
What's going on? Imagine a room in which a body lies crushed, flat as a
pancake. A dozen detectives crawl around, examining the floor with magnifying
glasses for any clue to the identity of the perpetrator. In the middle of
the room next to the body stands a large, gray elephant. The detectives
carefully avoid bumping into the pachyderm's legs as they crawl,and never
even glance at it. Over time the detectives get frustrated with their lack
of progress but resolutely press on, looking even more closely at the floor.
You see, textbooks say detectives must &quot;get their man,&quot; so they
never consider elephants.<BR>
<BR>
There is an elephant in the roomful of scientists who are trying to explain
the development of life. The elephant is labeled &quot;intelligent design.&quot;
To a person who does not feel obliged to restrict his search to unintelligent
causes, the straightforward conclusion is that many biochemical systems
were designed. They were designed not by the laws of nature, not by chance
and necessity. Rather, they were planned. The designer knew what the systems
would look like when they were completed; the designer took steps to bring
the systems about. Life on earth at its most fundamental level, in its most
critical components, is the product of intelligent activity.<BR>
<BR>
The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself,
not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. Inferring that biochemical systems
were designed by an intelligent agent is a humdrum process that requires
no new principles of logic or science. It comes simply from the hard work
that biochemistry has done over the past forty years, combined with consideration
of the way in which we reach conclusions of design every day. <BR>
<BR>
What is &quot;design&quot;? Design is simply the purposeful arrangement
of parts. The scientific question is how we detect design. This can be done
invarious ways, but design can most easily be inferred for mechanical objects.
While walking through a junkyard you might observe separated bolts and screwsand
bits of plastic and glass, most scattered, some piled on top of each other,
some wedged together. Suppose you saw a pile that seemed particularly compact,
and when you picked up a bar sticking out of the pile, the whole pile came
along with it. When you pushed on the bar it slid smoothly to one side of
the pile and pulled an attached chain along with it. The chain inturn yanked
a gear which turned three other gears which turned a red-and-white striped
rod, spinning it like a barber pole. You quickly conclude that the pile
was not a chance accumulation of junk, but was designed, was put together
in that order by an intelligent agent, because you see that the components
of the system interact with great specificity to do something.<BR>
<BR>
It is not only artificial mechanical systems for which design caneasily
be concluded. Systems made entirely from natural components can also evince
design. For example, suppose you are walking with a friend in the woods.
All of a sudden your friend is pulled high in the air and left dangling
by his foot from a vine attached to a tree branch. After cutting himdown
you reconstruct the trap. You see that the vine was wrapped around the tree
branch, and the end pulled tightly down to the ground. It was securely anchored
to the ground by a forked branch. The branch was attached to another vine,
hidden by leaves so that, when the trigger-vine was disturbed, it would
pull down the forked stick, releasing the spring-vine. The end of the vine
formed a loop with a slipknot to grab an appendage and snap it up into the
air. Even though the trap was made completely of natural materials you would
quickly conclude that it was the product of intelligent design. 
<H3>A Complicated World</H3>
<BR>
A word of caution; intelligent design theory has to be seen in context:
it does not try to explain everything. We live in a complex worldwhere lots
of different things can happen. When deciding how various rocks came to
be shaped the way they are a geologist might consider a whole range of factors:
rain, wind, the movement of glaciers, the activity of moss and lichens,
volcanic action, nuclear explosions, asteroid impact, or the hand of a sculptor.
The shape of one rock might have been determined primarily by one mechanism,
the shape of another rock by another mechanism. The possibility of a meteor's
impact does not mean that volcanos can be ignored; the existence of sculptors
does not mean that many rocks are not shaped by weather.Similarly, evolutionary
biologists have recognized that a number of factors might have affected
the development of life: common descent, natural selection, migration, population
size, founder effects (effects that may be due to the limited number of
organisms that begin a new species), genetic drift (spread of neutral, nonselective
mutations), gene flow (theincorporation of genes into a population from
a separate population), linkage (occurrence of two genes on the same chromosome),
meiotic drive (the preferential selection during sex cell production of
one of the two copies of a gene inherited from an organism's parents), transposition
(the transfer of a gene between widely separated species by non-sexual means),
and much more.The fact that some biochemical systems were designed by an
intelligent agent does not mean that any of the other factors are not operative,
common, or important. 
<H3>Curiouser and Curiouser</H3>
<BR>
So as this talk concludes we are left with what many people feel tobe a
strange conclusion: that life was designed by an intelligent agent. In a
way, though, all of the progress of science over the last several hundred
years has been a steady march toward the strange. People up until the middle
ages lived in a natural world. The stable earth was at the center of things;
the sun, moon, and stars circled endlessly to give light by day and night;
the same plants and animals had been known since antiquity. Surprises were
few.<BR>
<BR>
Then it was proposed, absurdly, that the earth itself moved, spinning while
it circled the sun. No one could feel the earth spinning; no one could see
it. But spin it did. From our modern vantage it's hard to realize what an
assault on the senses was perpetrated by Copernicus and Galileo; they said
in effect that people could no longer rely on even the evidence of their
eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Things got steadily worse over the years. With the discovery of fossils
it became apparent that the familiar animals of field and forest had not
always been on earth; the world had once been inhabited by huge, alien creatures
who were now gone. Sometime later Darwin shook the world by arguing that
the familiar biota was derived from the bizarre, vanished life over lengths
of time incomprehensible to human minds. Einstein told us that space is
curved and time is relative. Modern physics says that solid objects are
mostly space, that sub atomic particles have no definite position, that
the universe had a beginning.<BR>
<BR>
Now it's the turn of the fundamental science of life, modern biochemistry,
to disturb. The simplicity that was once expected to be the foundation of
life has proven to be a phantom. Instead, systems of horrendous,irreducible
complexity inhabit the cell. The resulting realization that lifewas designed
by an intelligence is a shock to us in the twentieth century who have gotten
used to thinking of life as the result of simple natural laws.But other
centuries have had their shocks and there is no reason to suppose that we
should escape them. Humanity has endured as the center of the heavens moved
from the earth to beyond the sun, as the history of life expanded to encompass
long-dead reptiles, as the eternal universe proved mortal. We will endure
the opening of Darwin's black box.

For them, however, the debate  is<BR>  merely over details of the standard model. The truly brazen challenges  to<BR>  Darwinian thought come from creationists--mostly religious believers who  read<BR>  Genesis literally and believe all species to have been created one-by-one  and<BR>  for a purpose. But creationism, too, has internal rivals.<BR>  <BR>  The fanciest version of creationism does not contest the brute facts<BR>  of geology and organic evolution' it concedes the immense age of the planet<BR>  and allows that evolution happens, at least within species. But it rejects  the<BR>  mechanisms--one of which is Darwin's natural selection--by which scientists<BR>  generally say evolutionary change occurs. This form of creationism--called<BR>  Intelligent Design Theory--argues that mere &quot;chance&quot; couldn't  make anything so<BR>  obviously &quot;designed&quot; as the human eye, let alone life. If life  is designed,<BR>  there must be a designer, no?<BR>  <BR>  The argument isn't new. Design is a common theme in medieval proofs of<BR>  the existence of God. William Paley's Divine Watchmaker--the Creator--was<BR>  believed throughout the 19th century (even by some Darwinists) to be required<BR>  by the complexity of life. But for scientists concerned with the study  of<BR>  evolution, &quot;<A HREF="bydesign.html">intelligent design</A>&quot; ceased  to be taken seriously about 100 years<BR>  ago.<BR>  <BR>  <A HREF="/Fellows/behe.html">Michael J. Behe</A>, associate professor of  biochemistry at Lehigh<BR>  University, thinks he has rehabilitated the argument. In &quot;Darwin's  Black Box&quot;<BR>  (Free Press, 307 pages, $25), he claims to refute not simply old-fashioned<BR>  Darwinism but the 20th-century synthesis of paleontology, anatomy, embryology<BR>  and molecular genetics--what might be called Neo-Darwinism. According to<BR>  Neo-Darwinism, the diversity of life results from the survival of hereditary<BR>  variations that arise by chance at the level of genes--that is, at the  level<BR>  of chemistry.<BR>  <BR>  Mr. Behe tries hard to avoid the theistic platitudes of &quot;creation<BR>  science.&quot; he insists that &quot;inferences to design do not require  that we have a<BR>  candidate for the role of designer.&quot; He will not force God on his<BR>  readers--just a designer. So &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; includes a  popular tour of<BR>  some molecular processes at the cellular level of life. That much is<BR>  unexceptionable and well-written.<BR>  <BR>  But there is a key argument: The &quot;black box&quot; of the cell has  now been<BR>  opened by science (true enough). It is not simple (also true). The complexity<BR>  of whole organisms SEEMS modest compared with the complexity of their cellular<BR>  chemistry. So, he asks, could that complexity have happened step-by-step,<BR>  gradually, as Darwin proposed? No way, he answers; not unless the molecular<BR>  designs were already built in! The chemistry of life is just too complex  to<BR>  have come about &quot;by chance.&quot; In his own words: &quot;As the number  of required<BR>  parts increases, the difficulty of gradual putting the system together<BR>  skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets. Darwin looks<BR>  more and more forlorn.&quot;<BR>  <BR>  But no more now than before is this convincing. Natural selection does<BR>  not operate &quot;by chance&quot; in any ordinary sense. Changes in the  genes do arise<BR>  randomly: This has been documented as well as anything in science. But  there<BR>  is nothing chancy about what happens next, which is the survival and increase<BR>  of what WORKS. Nor is it true that as the number of required parts increases<BR>  &quot;the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets.&quot;  In fact,<BR>  complex systems--think of modern cities--CAN and DO assemble gradually  rather<BR>  than all at once. Darwinism does not require complexity to arise willy-nilly<BR>  from simple parts. It requires only an adequate pool of variations in existing<BR>  parts, a changing environment and time for particular variations to increase<BR>  or die out in the population.<BR>  <BR>  Of late, the most notorious example of this process is the newly<BR>  drug-resistant bacteria and viruses that take over in an antibiotic-rich<BR>  environment. These are life-forms with novel chemistries, &quot;selected&quot;  from<BR>  continuous random changes in the genes: These genes make altered proteins,<BR>  which cause changes in chemistry and eventually a new form of life. With<BR>  viruses, this happens with alarming speed. Old kinds go extinct and new  kinds<BR>  take over within days. In higher, multicellular species, although the time<BR>  frame may be longer, the sources of molecular variations are the same or  even<BR>  more abundant and environmental pressures are just as severe if not more  so.<BR>  In sum: The evidence for old chemistry modifying to serve new purposes  in<BR>  systems of increasing complexity is overwhelming.<BR>  <BR>  Unfortunately, Mr. Behe patronizes or ignores the successes of<BR>  molecular evolution and pounces on a few puzzles as though each spelled  the<BR>  death of Darwinism. He does not attend seriously to the developmental<BR>  consequences of small genetic changes, which create whole new body-plans.  Thus<BR>  &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; is not the refutation of Darwinism that  creationists long<BR>  for. Science cannot yet explain, among other things, the origin of life  on<BR>  this planet a few billion years ago. But whatever happened then, there  is no<BR>  trace--at least in the findings of science so far--of an intelligent designer<BR>  intervening thereafter.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H4><I>Mr. Gross is university professor of life sciences, emeritus, at  the<BR>  University of Virginia.</I></H4></BLOCKQUOTE><H4><CENTER><A HREF="aboutcrsc.html"><INPUT SRC="aboutcrsc.gif" WIDTH="71"HEIGHT="35" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" TYPE="image"></A><AHREF="crscfellows.html"><INPUT SRC="felcrsc.gif" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="35"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" TYPE="image"></A><A HREF="crscarts.html"><INPUT SRC="image68.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="35" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" TYPE="image"></A></CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><A HREF="behereviews.html"><B><BR>More reviews of <I>Darwin's Black Box</I></B></A></CENTER></FORM></BODY></HTML>

international conference center</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<P>SEATTLE-Tourism industry leaders from throughout Cascadia will converge
on Seattle's new convention center June 6-7 to focus efforts on highlighting
the regions attractions worldwide. The Cascadia &quot;mainstreet&quot; region
includes Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tourism is one of the most important regional industries for Cascadia,&quot;
said Cascadia Project Director Bruce Agnew. &quot;By bringing everyone to
one place, to work together on how to promote the region and eliminate cross-border
barriers, this conference will be the key to focusing international attention
on Cascadia as a vacation destination and boosting annual tourism revenues.&quot;<BR>
As the world's tenth largest economy this vast Pacific Northwest region
- which also includes the states of Idaho, Montana, and Alaska as well as
the province of Alberta and the Yukon Territory - boasts tourism revenues
of nearly $20 billion (US$) and more than 100 million people annually visiting
the five states and two provinces and territory that make up Cascadia.<BR>
<BR>
This two day tourism conference, organized with the help of the Cascadia
Tourism Working Group led by the Port of Seattle, will bring together industry
leaders to strategize a regional outline of cooperative efforts, focusing
on off-peak season, to help benefit all of Cascadia. It will feature workshops
and seminars on resort destinations within Cascadia-such as Whistler B.C.
Ecotourism, adventure vacationing and regional sports issues like the Mariners,
Grizzlies, Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Olympic bid will also be among
the topics.<BR>
<BR>
Adam Leipzig, whose company Interscope Communications produced the hit films
Mr. Holland's Opus, Dead Poet's Society, and Good Morning Vietnam, will
talk about marketing the region to the television and movie industry to
increase the use of Cascadia for on-location filming.<BR>
<BR>
Ralph Munro Washington State Secretary of State, Rod Harris British Columbia
Asst. Dep. Minister of Tourism, Julie Courtis of the Oregon Tourism Commission
and Dick West President of Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West will be on hand
to moderate and facilitate discussion on Cascadia tourism and advertising
the region's appeal worldwide. The evening of June 6 will include Tourism
Vancouver's entertainment season program highlighting productions such as
Showboat, as well as the Grizzlies and Canucks.<BR>
<BR>

<H4><CENTER>&quot;This book will help frame the debate for the 1996 presidential
campaign.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William Kristol, The Weekly Standard</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...if we do not plan for the future, entitlement spending promises
will exceed financial resources in the next century. The current spending
trend is clearly unsustainable. In this creative book, Sam Beard lucidly
identifies some <BR>
of the problems in our Social Security system and proposes <BR>
innovative ways to solve them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (D) Bob Kerry </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard's call for a national grassroots debate on these issues
is so vitally important for the future of the Social Security program. Beard
offers Americans a fresh, outside-the-beltway approach which deserves our
most serious and conscientious consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (R) Alan K. Simpson</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard has devised the unassailable substitute for the Social Security
system, which even the AARP would approve of. Why didn't we think of it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William F. Buckley, Jr.</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard offers a creative plan to remodel Social Security for the
21st century while upholding that contract with today's seniors. ... His
plan not only protects seniors and ensures retirement security for future
generations, but promises economic growth and keeps the American Dream alive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Sandra L. Butler, President United Senior Association</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As Social Security hurdles towards insolvency, Sam Beard offers an
innovative approach that might enable America to stave off entitlement collapse
and provide future generations with a vibrant retirement system. His recommendations
deserve serious analysis and consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Richard Thau, Jonathon Karl, Douglas Kennedy, Third Millennium</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Restoring Hope in America brings the looming Social Security crisis
to our attention - and presents a unique and thoughtful solution worth discussing!
... Everyone should read Restoring Hope in America and get involved in the
debate about Social Security.&quot;<BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Internet Law Symposium</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><H3><I>From Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3><H3><CENTER>Click here for information on Internet Law Symposium 95 spekaers,sponsors, program, and how you can order a video of this groundbreakinglegal conference.</CENTER></H3><H1><CENTER><BR>Discovery Welcomes <BR>Internet Law Symposium 95 </CENTER></H1><BR>From Capitol Hill to the streets of Seattle, the Internet is the hottestthing in high technology - and Internet law is suddenly the hottest topicin the legal field. Questions about laws and the Internet are arising asthe new medium begins to realize its potential to transcend terrestrialboundaries. <BR><BR>Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95, October 30-31 in Seattle,Washington is bringing together legal experts from around the world, includingElectronic Frontier Foundation co-founder, John Perry Barlow, and high techanalyst and best-selling author, George Gilder. The Internet Law Symposiumwill pioneer the public policy side of a communications development thatseems destined to transform societies world-wide. <BR><BR><B>Sponsors for the Discovery conference include Perkins Coie, Microsoft,I.B.M., Netscape Communications, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, Forbes ASAP,Dun &amp; Bradstreet, GTE, US West, Corporate Computer, Northwest Nexusand Internet Group, Inc. </B><BR><BR>A key result of the gathering is expected to be formation of a permanentInternet Law Task Force to assess the legal dimensions of issues raisedby the Internet, from intellectual property rights to privacy. <BR><BR>Joining Gilder and Barlow in wrestling with international legal issues willbe Peter Harter, originator of the Internet Law Task Force, Albert Gidari,Discovery Institute Fellow and an attorney at Perkins Coie Seattle law firm,Chuck Marson, legal counsel for Nestcape Communications, Jeffrey Ritter,United Nations Rapporteur and over 25 other legal and Internet experts fromaround the world. By video conference from Washington, D.C., Senator SladeGorton and Rep. Rick White, both of Washington State, will describe thestate of debate in the U.S. capitol. <BR><BR>Evidence of the growing importance of Internet law abounds in scores ofnews reports of online gambling, conflicts on commerical rights, pornography,battles over free speech and civil liberties, and intriguing disagreementsabout intellectual property rights. Every e-mail, every website, every transactionmade over the Internet touches upon some aspect of the law, and in manycases brings forth new questions about the legalities of being online. <BR><BR>Perhaps the most intriguing question now is whether existing laws adequatelymeet the needs of the Internet. Or, is it time that a whole new sector oflaw be created? Internet Law Symposium 95 is the first conference wherethese questions will be addressed on both a domestic and international level,with active involvement from the participants and attendees. <BR><BR>&quot;One of the many problems,&quot; explains keynote speaker, John PerryBarlow, &quot;is that even if new laws need to be written, which they probablydo, it is not clear whether any of the world's governments have clear legalauthority to either write them or enforce them. It appears that most existinglaws, derived as they are for a very different social and commercial environment,may not serve us well as we try to assure order there.&quot;<BR><BR>Government involvement in regulating the Internet is currently one of themost controversial aspects of Internet law. In order to support self-regulationof the Internet, the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) will be officially launchedduring the Symposium. <BR><BR>The ILTF will be the legal policy and norms forum for the Internet, accordingto Peter Harter, Executive Director of the National Public TelecomputingNetwork. Modeled after the highly successful Internet Engineering Task Force,the ILTF will be instrumental in developing a legal framework for the Internet.It will work closely with existing organizations that already have focusedon aspects of Internet law and legislation, and will branch out into newareas that have yet to be examined, Harter explained. <BR><BR>Both the Internet Law Symposium and the ILTF will be working to lay thefoundation necessary for the future of Internet law. By bringing togetherso many legal and technical experts, the Internet Law Symposium is ableto offer interested parties the chance to influence the shape of Internetlaw. Such input will be crucial to companies that seek to sieze the businessadvantages that the Internet can offer. <BR><BR>&quot;Business activity on the Internet is increasing daily,&quot; saidRobert Cumbow, an associate at Perkins Coie and a scheduled speaker at theInternet Law Symposium. &quot;And now is the time the Internet is explodingand people are beginning to explore its possibilities as a means of commerceand transaction. There are a lot of unanswered questions of what one canand cannot do on the Internet, and what kind of liability will apply.&quot;<BR><BR>Even as they rush to establish themselves on the Internet, individuals andcorporations alike are ignorant of the legal ramifications of this new frontier.Now, Continuing Legal Education (CLE) conferences, such as the InternetLaw Symposium 95, that offer professional credit to attorney's who attend,are providing the means for educating Internet users about Internet law.<BR><BR>&quot;There have been a lot of seminars about the Internet for lawyers,&quot;said Cumbow, &quot;but most concentrate on how to use it. The legal communityneeds information on how to advise their clients about Internet issues andproblems, and that is what the Internet Law Symposium proposes to do. Lawyerswho are going to be making the law in this area need to educate themselves,so they can give advice to their clients.&quot;<BR><BR>Discovery plans to keep abreast of Internet law issues after the symposiumand to keep its members informed.

Moreover, owning the principal, you could leave agenerous sum to your heirs, allowing wealth to accumulate generation bygeneration, even in families with relatively low-income wage earners. Hugesums of investment money would be available to help the economy grow andthe number of &quot;capitalists&quot; in society would expand to includenearly everybody. <BR><BR>This is not a dream, but the careful proposal worked out by Sam Beard, headof the National Development Council and a Fellow of Discovery Institute.The ICS Press in San Francisco not only is publishing Sam's book -the workingtitle is 100 Million Millionaires-but is helping to raise funds to promoteits idea. <BR><BR>William Kristol, now of <I>The Weekly Standard</I>, has predicted that Beard'splan will &quot;ground..the 'third rail' of American politics.

The result is a death watch as species decline and geneticvariability diminishes. ... (S)pecies should be placed on the threatenedlist early enough to allow time to manage them before they become endangered.By focusing conservation on threatened species, the severe regulatory constraintsof the Endangered Species Act can be largely removed. Only when a speciesis approaching the point where management options become limited are regulatorycontrols necessary for species conservation.&quot;</B> </DL>It's actually from a working draft of the Endangered Species ManagementAct, sponsored by Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho), subcommittee chairmanof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But the sentimentis totally in the spirit of Noah's Choice, by Discovery Senior Fellow MarkL. Plummer and Charles C. Mann (Knopf, 1995). We don't write legislationat Discovery, but we are delighted when those who do use our ideas! <BR><BR>With his co-author &quot;Cam&quot; Mann, Plummer recently also attractedwhat was described as the largest audience of legislators to show up atthe Caucus (about 100). Democratic as well as Republican members said theyare reading <I>Noah's Choice</I>. On the same visit, Plummer and Mann met,at his invitation, with Rep.

<H1><CENTER><TT>What the experts are saying about George Gilder </TT></CENTER>
</H1>
<H3>Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> is always a
subject of conversation due to his role as a contributing editor to Forbes
ASAP. In recent letter's to Forbes ASAP here's what some of the telecommunications
industry leaders are saying about Gilder's revolutionary ideas about the
future of telecommunications, telecomputing and the Internet. </H3>
<HR>
<DL>
<DD>&quot;I'd like to compliment George Gilder for so eloquently articulating
Sun's nearly decade- old credo: `The network is the computer.' I believe
in Gilder's thesis that we are, indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed,
disposable software.&quot;<B>-Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems </B>
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring
percipience, perspiration, and perspective. Gilder has done it.&quot;-<B>Larry
Tesler, Vice-President, Apple Computer </B>
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will
become subordinate to the network: that the network will, in effect, beAcome
enverything an the only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution
and impact of the Internet and the resultant focus on content.&quot;-<B>Bert
C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman and CEO, MCI Communications</B> 
<DD><BR>
<DD>&quot;Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past
and future of the Net is on the digital dime.&quot; <B>-Nicholas Negroponte,
Director, MIT Media Lab</B> <BR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3><I>From the Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER>Lynne Cheney tells Seattle the Truth </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
&quot;The idea that truth is something to be invented rather than pursued,&quot;
Lynne Cheney writes in her new book <I>Telling the Truth</I>, &quot;has
passed beyond narrow academic circles to influence many fields of endeavor&quot;
including: education, historical writing, journalism, psychology and even
politics. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney, former Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will
speak about the importance of truth and what we can do restore it, at a
Seattle luncheon sponsored by CityClub and Discovery Institute. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney's book, subtitled <I>Why Our Culture and Our Country Have Stopped
Making Sense-and What We Can Do About It</I>, is elevating the level of
debate about truth and society all over the nation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of us think of Lynne Cheney as a highly decorated veteran-many
ribbons for heroic service, and some purple hearts-of the culture wars,&quot;
said columnist George Will. &quot;This book is a vivid report from the war's
many fronts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If you'd like to hear Cheney's thoughts on Telling the Truth, call (206)
682-7395 for information and to reserve your seat. The luncheon is Thursday,
November 16, 12 noon - 1:30 p.m. at the downtown Seattle Sheraton Hotel
and the cost is $25. <BR>

The next debate will focus onproperty rights and Referendum 48. <BR><BR>Discovery's theory, says President Bruce Chapman, the debate moderator,is that &quot;America doesn't lack for free speech or available information.What we lack is the context of debate.

According to University Pressof Kansas: &quot;Precisely because West's historical research is so solidin this book, it has much to offer for those who debate religious- politicalconnections in the late twentieth century.&quot; The Politics of Revelationand Reason: Religion and Civic Life in the New Nation will be publishednext Spring. ..... John West also led a symposium Discovery Institute organizedfor <B>Liberty Fund of Indianapolis</B> this past August.

<h2><center>
Final Floor Address<br>
U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop<br> 
(Senate - December 01, 1994)</center></h2>
<right> 
</right>
<P>
<b>U.S. Senator Mr. WALLOP</b>. Mr. President, 18 years ago, and again 12, and again 6 years ago, the people of
Wyoming sent me to Washington to reaffirm their vision of America--to protect the America they
know and love against all enemies foreign and domestic. In each of my campaigns, I made no bones
about who those enemies were, and what we should do about them. Today, as I choose to end my
years in the Senate, I am delighted that our main foreign enemies have collapsed, happy to have
been among the staunchest opponents of communism and the Soviet Union, and thrilled to have
played a major part in leaving our country a splendid new weapon against new enemies who might
arise. But I regret that the domestic enemies against whom I campaigned--big government and the
culture of statism--are a greater threat than ever to the American way of life. The only encouraging
sign on this front is that illusions about the benevolence of government have well-nigh vanished
among ordinary Americans. Perhaps politicians will get the message.
<P>
Far be it from me to claim credit on behalf of conservatives for the fall of communism. I thank God
alone for the fact that the bloody hammer and sickle was hauled down the Kremlin's flagpole on
Christmas Day 1991. And I recognize that the Communist system, corrupt in every way, would still
be aiming missiles at us except for the total, comical incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev. It is both
presumptuous and futile to speculate what effect, if any, foreigners had on the minds of the Soviet
officials who made decisions that inadvertently destroyed the Soviet Union. Their intramural
discussions at the time contained nothing either about the hardness or the softness of American
policy. Nor for that matter are they about economics. The evidence points to Gorbachev, his friends,
and his antagonists being motivated by the pettiest politics. Moreover, living in the house that Stalin
built, they had lost the will to rule by mass murder, as Stalin had.
But we can be precisely certain of what Americans were trying to do with regard to the Soviet
Union. There can be no doubt about some of us. I told anyone who would listen, every chance I got,
that the Soviet Union and its empire were our mortal enemy, that we ought to do everything in our
power to throw it on the scrap heap of history, and that we ought to prepare to fight, survive, and
win a war against it. President Reagan felt this passion but there is little doubt how ridiculed this point
of view was in high places. Just look up the countless declarations of the Secretaries of State about
how brilliant Gorbachev was, and how dedicated we should be to a United States-Soviet
partnership. Or look up theirs and the prestige press' disdain for the view that communism was
something to be destroyed, not compromised with. These same sophisticates opposed providing the
key weapons to the Afghans who defeated the Soviet invasion of their country. As chairman of the
Budget Subcommittee of the Intelligence Committee, I doubled the budget for our Afghan
operations every time it came before me, and put in provisions for Stinger missiles. I also fought
these same officials to put weapons into the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras who defeated a
Soviet-Cuban takeover of their country that could have put Mexico onto a path far worse than the
excellent one that it is now treading. When these officials, never mind liberal Senators, put their faith
in arms control and in the Soviet Union's observance of treaties, I preferred to trust in American
defensive weapons. The Soviet Foreign Minister acknowledged that the American officials and
Senators felt no inclination to apologize to those whom they had maligned for being right. But that
was not surprising. A press that had joined them in maligning us was not about to insist upon
contrition.
<P>
Most of all I am proud of the role I played between 1978 and 1983 in starting many of the Defense
Department programs that would later be labeled SDI.
<P>
Let me emphasize the difference: The programs I helped to start did not aim at research. Nor did
they aim at abstract, grand schemes: They aimed to produce actual, individual weapons and sensors
to kill missiles that could kill Americans. Then President Reagan put the SDI Program into the hands
of people who, sad to say, wanted to use it for every imaginable purpose--except to build real
weapons. And so, in the name of SDI, hucksters spent billions of dollars for never-never projects,
while arms controllers handicapped real weapons programs diluting, delaying, and usually dooming
them.
<P>
But, I am happy to say, one anti-missile program managed to survive SDI better than might have
been expected. This is the chemical-power space based laser, the very weapon that first raised
interest in serious missile defense 15 years ago. No program was so maligned as this. Everybody
from Edward Teller to Sidney Drell said this laser weapon couldn't be built,
and--paradoxically--said it would be dangerous to try to build it. None was so politically incorrect.
But in a nutshell, by adhering to the guidelines I laid out for it 15 years ago, this program has
produced all the pieces of a weapon that could destroy any missile ever built or designed within 2
seconds, at distances greater than 3,000 miles. If
this country and this Congress want protection against the missiles that Saddam Husseim, Kim
Jong-Il, or anybody else might send against us or our allies, they have only to say so, and this
defensive weapon can be put together. It is there. Now.
<P>
Sure, the arms controllers in the U.S. Government made certain that no program would produce any
component of a weapon. But the good guys can play with definitions as well as the bad guys--and
sometimes the good guys win. The Space-Based Laser Program was broken up into any number of
pieces. But the people running the pieces remembered: Don't build laboratory devices. Build only
things that can be mass-produced. If you must scale down a piece of equipment, do it by using a
fraction of other parts you would use in the real McCoy. Thus the laser you can see at the TRW
facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA develops about 2 megawatts of power. But it has only one-third
of the pieces that an 8-megawatt missile killing device would have. And what is there is laid out in a
frame designed from the outset to accept the remainder of other pieces. So it is with the rest of the
weapon.
<P>
The credit goes to the marvelous American engineers who did it. I hope that the incoming Congress
takes the opportunity to spend some of the money that the American people mistakenly believe is
spent on our mutual protection to buy this device, which could save millions of American lives. If this
happens, I will be glad I had something to do with making it possible.
<P>
But why continue to worry about foreign enemies now that communism is gone? In short, because as
Charles de Gaulle used to say, `The future lasts a long time.' During the past half century we have
been involved in only two major wars, and the parts of the world that are most important to us have
been relatively peaceful because the United States of America has been militarily strong. But in
recent years, under Presidents of both parties, we have been living under the assumption that history
has ended. Nothing could be further from the truth. No assumption could be more dangerous.
American military power--and nothing but American military power--has kept a Pax Americana
over Europe and the Northern Pacific Rim. Now that American power is withdrawing, we see
NATO humiliated on its doorstep, and Japan and South Korea cowering before North Korea's
budding nuclear arsenal. We risk losing the world that our grandfathers won for us in World War II,
and we risk the birth of a world disorder that may require a lot more from our children than the
post-war world has required of us.
<P>
Our country needs better defense policy. Reversing the shrinkage and de-nuclearization of our
Armed Forces, as well as providing a serious anti-missile defense, would be good places to begin.
More important, we need a more serious national discussion of foreign and defense policy. I am
leaving the Senate, but will take part in that discussion.
<P>
The people of Wyoming first sent me to Washington in 1976 in part because I articulated their
frustration with Federal occupational safety and health regulations. Who could be against health and
safety on the job? Who could be against clean air and water? Certainly not the good people of
Wyoming. Certainly not me. Our beef--if you will pardon the expression--is with a government that
uses these and other lofty purposes as a means of exercising arbitrary bureaucratic power.
Government at all levels taxes, spends, and regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It
touches every aspect of our lives, and harms just about everything it touches. It will fine you for not
wearing a seatbelt, but will not protect your life from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your
children, but cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York from having a
school district--who knows what politically incorrect things their kids might learn from reading the
bible--and it forces the culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial equality, the
Government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race. Once upon a time, our Government was
a bulwark against domestic enemies. Now big Government has become our chief domestic enemy.
<P>
In 1980 the American people voted for the Republic Party, hoping that the Republicans would
shrink the Government and make it switch sides in the great cultural conflict that is raging among us.
But the Republicans put on their tuxes and spent their time trying to make the system work. And so
taxes rose, regulations multiplied, officials became more arrogant, courts took over more of other
people's powers, and society continued to become less recognizably American. In 1992 the
American people threw out a Republican President who, obviously was on the side of the
Government rather than of the people. Now the electorate has put its hopes in a Republican
Congress, but the American people have made clear that they do not trust Republicans very far.
Almost three out of five Americans say they would like to see a new political party--and most of
those who say so usually vote Republican. To me, this means that the Republican Party has one
more chance to be on the side of the America's people and against their Government. If it muffs this
chance, it will be abandoned--deservedly so. The electorate asked republican politicians to do
something very unnatural to any politician--yield back power. Restore the people's dominion over
turf you have now occupied from democratic plantation managers.
<P>
What should the Republican Party do? Nothing less than to pursue a vision of America radically
opposed to that of contemporary sophisticates--the America our Founding Fathers established, our
fathers fought for, and the America we grew up in. Our Founders--Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln--set this country on the path to greatness by making sure that our Government would be
small and frugal, that it would be on the side of the virtues necessary to preserve the system. Lincoln,
for example, argued that accepting slavery as an alternative source of labor would undermine respect
for all labor, and that it would foster the habit of living off one another. Lincoln taught that fear of
God, respect for human life, freedom and property, would allow generations of Americans who had
no blood ties to the Founders to become `flesh of the flesh and blood of the blood' with them. The
Government established by the Founders did not make us moral. But it took pains to be on the right
side of the great moral questions.
<P>
This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were patrolled by Government agents,
but because citizens enforced high standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and
protected their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to the demands of
local citizens. The police knew the difference between the decent citizens whom they served, and the
deviants against whom they worked.
<P>
This country was wealthy not because of its natural resources--the Indians had lived in violent
semi-starvation--or because Government gave us this or that, nor because Government forced
wages up nor because it granted privileges to favorite companies. Americans created more wealth
than the world had ever known because Government in America taxed less, regulated less, and gave
fewer privileges than any other government in history.
<P>
This country became a world power not because there are so many of us--the Chinese are six times
as numerous--or because we are so rich--the European Union has a bigger economy--or because
we have so many weapons--Russia has more. Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became
military power because the American people are more patriotic, and more apt to think that we have
a duty to do what is right and reasonable than any other people in the world. And we became
powerful because until recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and manliness,
and because they themselves served in the Armed Forces.
<P>
With each passing year, however, our America resembles less and less what the Founders left us
and looks more and more like the countries our immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is
happening in large part because the people who are running this country want it to happen and have
used the enormous powers of the U.S. Government to make it happen.
<P>
But Why? It is all too plain that the people who are running this country deeply dislike the America
of the Founders. If the people who run our Government, our universities, our media, the
entertainment industry, the arts, and the so forth had their way, you and I would be placed in
re-education camps--financed by us, of course--to learn new ways.
<P>
What do the elites of this country have against us? They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at
best, and chauvinistic at worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and
anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought that we were on the wrong
side in the Vietnam war. Two-thirds of our Congressmen have never served in the Armed Fores.
Military service is the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say about putting
Americans in harm's way. Many in power say that America is nothing special, and that our troops
ought to do the bidding of the United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they
abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.
<P>
Often as not American political elites dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the stated policy
of the U.S. Government that the American people consume too much of the world's energy and
natural resources, that our appetite for automobiles, for meat and comfortable houses, is a drag on
the planet and contributes to poverty in the Third World. So, those who run this country want to tax
us to support the United Nations, and they want us to make cars and industry more expensive. They
think that America suffers from public poverty amidst private luxury, so they want to tax more and to
regulate more, to shift power and wealth to people like themselves. Whether the excuse is
environmentalism, or poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: Take money away from
independent working Americans and give it to the favorites of the governing class. It transfers only
power--not solutions, only dependency, not liberty.
<P>
Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. I would remind the Senate that nowhere in the
writings of the Founding Fathers is there anything about managing the economy. Our Founders
wanted to promote prosperity. So they set about ensuring that Government would be small, frugal,
impartial, and moral. We became a wealth country because Government, in Jefferson's words,
would not `take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned.' If we abandon the Founders'
mores, no economic policy can keep us out of the poorhouse.
<P>
Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local control of crime with brutality and 
racism. Local zoning is racism. Local control of
schools is racist. We are all racists--except they. The have turned laws that prohibit racial
discrimination into mandates for racial preferences in everything from school admissions to
congressional districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, and contracting, and insurance, and
lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American form of apartheid. If you want
your town or business to stay out of trouble nowadays, you need highly paid and well-connected
human relations specialists. Within the U.S. Government, in schools and businesses, there are
mandatory counseling sessions--not unlike under communism.
<P>
Of course this sows racial hatred amongst us. It emboldens young blacks to demand menacingly,
and creates new classes of victims among young whites, Hispanics, Asians and politically
unconnected people in general. But in the end, this has nothing to do with race, and everything to do
with leftist politics. The people who run these programs are white men, who are not about to give up
their own privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price of racial harmony, they
are increasing their own power to privilege their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to
diminish competition for themselves.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care about public safety, having made it very difficult for
States and localities to police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect
themselves as best they can. They are now trying to take our guns away. In fact they blame us and
our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake. The don't want safety for
us. The want to strike at our culture.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care that our children are being diseducated or that schools
are becoming factories of ignorance and decay. Every proposal regarding education that has come
out of the establishment has called for more money. Over the past 30 years we have tripled the
amount of money that we pay to the public schools per pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not
only has educational performance dropped everywhere, but it dropped worst where we spent most.
The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where test scores are highest, are out in the
sticks--in places like Utah, Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully
to implement its model of big, bureaucratically controlled districts that give out condoms, banish
prayer, teach self-esteem, and bash all American history prior to the 1960's, maybe we hicks aren't
so stupid after all. But the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control, and
keeps looking down on us.
<P>
Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity for the culture on which
it rests. What must be the moral priorities of those who run the Democratic National Committee,
who declared that the Christian pro-family movement is the most serious threat to America today?
What vision of America must be in their minds that they are frightened by the prospect of more
moms, dads, and children going to church? Clearly their's is a vision very different from George
Washington's and Abe Lincoln's. And are Republican leaders so different? The tell us we are zealots
if we talk about social issues and about the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is worth
talking about? They say: concentrate on the economy. But prosperity comes from the morality and
sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from small government. It comes from the
culture, not from recipes dreamed up in Government offices or think tanks.
<p>
So how do we safeguard, how do we promote the culture that made us prosperous? Do we do it by
celebrating people who terminate their responsibility to the child they have conceived by killing him
or her and at the same time use Medicaid to provide fertility medicines? Do we say, as Stephen
Douglas said about slavery, that we `don't care' one way or the other? I think Lincoln would warn us 
against expecting that any sort
of prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of responsibility and human life.
Again, can education turn out competent workers, never mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress
condoms over continence and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy
economically--never mind in other ways--if our establishment keeps on talking and spending as if
alternative families and alternative lifestyles were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the
kids? Not a chance.
<P>
The sum of all this is that our Government is run by people who are using the powers vested in them
by the Constitution, and the powers that come from spending $1.5 trillion per year of our money to
undo what remains of the culture, the habits, the freedoms that made this country unique. There is a
struggle about what kind of country we will be. Government and its allies in the media, education,
and big business are on the wrong side.
<P>
It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U.S. Government is providing incentives to break up
families, to put generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work, to
dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own interest, for businesses to court
regulators, to seek protection, and the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying,
to discuss remedies for all these phenomena.
<P>
We can and should end welfare--not `as we know it.' Just end it, period. Charity for those who
deserve it is something with a long and honorable history. But the short history of welfare tells us that
as a Federal program it does no good, only harm.
<P>
We can and should eliminate Social Security. Just as certainly people who are already retired or
about to retire should get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny deducted
from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We could all look forward to a lot more
money, and the Government would have a lot less to spend from day to day.
<P>
For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid we can and should substitute individual medical savings
accounts, backed up by vouchers.
<P>
We can be rid of the ponderous educational establishment by giving parents vouchers for whatever
amount any level of government taxes them to educate their children.
<P>
We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by cutting all direct aid to higher
education and substituting tuition scholarships to individual students which they must repay. Where
this scheme has been tried, students deserted rotten professors in droves.
<P>
We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing deductions for children.
Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to raise their own children again.
<P>
We can be rid of the terrible bureaucracy of the IRS, and of all the distortive inequities of the system
just by instituting a flat tax.
<P>
We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the Federal courts to review the acts of
State courts and the enactments of State legislatures.
<P>
The objective of these and many other provisions would be to shrink Government and to stop it
from doing further harm.
<P>
The good news is that all these things are double. Sure, the American people are sick enough of big
government and have learned to distrust the establishment so much that a reform program of this
kind stands a chance. The bad news is that no set of legislation or even constitutional amendments is
going to sweep away the entrenched interests and bad habits built up over a generation. Our moral
fiber has been damaged. We are no longer quite the virtuous people for whom the Founding Fathers
wrote the Constitution, the people who fought at Gettysburg and at Omaha Beach. That is why to
set us back on the Founders' path we need moral leadership. By this I mean that we must
understand every change we make above all as a means of restoring the character that made
Americans unique.
<P>
We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money in our pockets, but
principally because it will put the means of freedom in our hands. We want to cut the Government's
power to grant privilege not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because we
don't want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear our guns not because we
want to shoot somebody, but because we have an irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral 
leadership, today as in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces anyone to go to 
church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and deed he leads the country in giving unto God the 
things that are God's. Today according to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln's proclamation of 
Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew better, and that recent Supreme 
Court decisions on religion are unconstitutional.
<P>
It is impossible to lay out all the instances in which political leaders can exercise moral leadership
precisely because every act of Government influences our habits in some way. Let us not forget that
the Greek philosophers taught that we are the sum of our habits, and that the Greek word for habits
is `Ethics.' If we want to live like Americans, we had better shun the ethics of the people who are
tearing down this country, and strive for the ethics of those who built it.
<P>
Let me conclude by noting that I have not mentioned the name `Clinton,' and that I mentioned both
the Republican and Democratic Parties as part of the problem. America faces a choice between two
radically opposed views of itself and of the good life. On one side is the view you and I grew up
with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this country. On the other is the
view you can read in the pages of Time magazine, the New York Times, and the Prestige Press.
This is the view that animates the U.S. Government. The great question of our time is whether
Government will continue to work against the original American way of life, or will switch and
support it as it once did. The only possible way of enabling Government to make this switch, I think,
is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It
is an issue that, most likely, will cause a realignment of Parties, or even the death of one or both of
our current parties and the birth of a new one. The more secular we have become the more we pray
to Government for that which we once prayed to God. Nothing happens anymore. Everything is
caused and is therefore to someone's credit or blame. This is nonsense and is unsustainable policy.
Decency yields no more credit than indecency. How can we sustain families on this notion?
<P>
All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the American people and the
American way of life be defended against their enemies, and that they be defended worthily.
<P>
In all my public life, nothing has cheered and sustained me as much as the constantly recurring
evidence of the good sense and virtue of the American people. And nothing has angered and
dispirited me more than politicians' and other so called elites' disdain for the average American.
<P>
I recall that during the first half of the Vietnam war, the wise men of foreign policy, from McGeorge
Bundy to George Ball, were belittling the American people's demand, echoed by Barry Goldwater,
that we win the war or get out. No, they said. This insistence on victory is simplistic, unsophisticated,
outdated, and lacking in maturity. In our modern age, victory is impossible but involvement is
inevitable. Knowledgeable professionals, namely themselves, were going to adjust the conflict to a
mutually acceptable solution, if only the children of lesser Americans--not their own--would continue
to get themselves shot. Then in the second half of the war, as well as after the war, these same
people told us that our militarism had pushed us in, that we had gotten the lesson we deserved, but
that now we, the American people, had become incapable of supporting a meaningful foreign policy,
namely one led by them.
<P>
This was Henry Kissinger's constant theme in the 1970's. Remember the tones of Spenglerian gloom
with which he justified renouncing the United States' right to protect itself against ballistic missiles?
The weakness of the American people made him do it. By the same token, during the 1980s, from
Strobe Talbott in Time magazine as well as from Harvard and Stanford, we heard how dangerously
stupid the American people were to harken to Ronald Reagan's call to defend this country and to
relegate the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history. The elites knew better--or thought they did. Now
the same people decry as neo-isolationism the elites' call to send the children of average
Americans--surely not their own--to so-called peace-keeping and nation-building missions.
Meanwhile they strip this country's military while their bungling diplomacy stores up future troubles.
And they wonder why the American people think foreign policy is a mess?
<P>
Well, the American people lack neither wisdom nor the capacity for generous sacrifice. The same
year the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington, the country also elected Jimmy Carter. Carter
had campaigned for `A government as good as its people.' He had seemed to reject the
establishment's prescriptions for America's managed decline, most eloquently expressed by Henry
Kissinger. Sadly, he brought in a wing of the establishment that was even further out of sympathy
with America. Almost the same can be said of the
American people's choice of Bill Clinton my point is this: the American people always vote for the
Presidential candidate who seems to embody the old American virtues, the traditional, common
sense view of America in the world. More often than not, alas, politicians have not been worthy of
the people's trust. They have drawn on the well of the American people's generous patriotism, but
have done nothing to refill it. Thank God that well is deep.
<P>
Today it is fashionable among Republican as well as Democratic elites to ascribe the ills of big
government to the American people's supposedly insatiable appetite for government checks and
privileges, combined with their miserly unwillingness to pay for them. According to what one can
hear from practically every talking head in the mainstream media, pork and corruption are
demand-side problems. The politicians and their bureaucratic allies are innocent, just following
orders.
<P>
This is nonsense. The social programs that have done so much harm to this country have been sold
to the American people with false pretenses. Sometimes the very names of the programs are
Orwellian reversals of reality--none more so than `aid to families with dependent children.' Who
would have voted for Social Security if it had been presented as what it is, a chain letter, a ponzi
scheme, that spends the workers money the moment it comes in, and that cannot return it unless
each generation is taxed more heavily than the previous one? Who would have voted for Medicare if
it had been made clear that this would bureaucratize and render much more expensive all health care
in America? And who the heck voted for the Supreme Court decisions that ended America's
tradition of local self-government, and made pornography, abortion, and vagrancy into basic rights
while pushing religion out of public life? Who ever voted to institute a system of racial classification in
this country? Certainly not the American people. All of these things are anathema to the average
American.
<P>
But now comes the crucial questions: How long can any people, no matter how virtuous, remain
uncorrupted when governed by laws and elites that tend to corrupt? This week's New York Times
carries an account of widespread tax evasion in Germany. In Germany? That most order-loving of
countries? Buy why? Simply because it seems that tax burden has grown so great that the people
think it unreasonable. There is no doubt that our own laws and administration, fiscal and otherwise,
have become so burdensome and unreasonable that our own tradition of law-abiding is fading.
<P>
There is no doubt that entitlements and privileges corrupt those who give and those who receive
them, whether they are rich or poor. This list of threats to the American people's virtue is long. No
one can say how long the character and habits bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers will last
and whether they will vanquish the threats or be overcome by them.
<P>
The size our continent, its fabulous wealth, its indescribable beauty, the ships, tanks, and airplanes in
our arsenal, are no treasure compared to the moral character of the American people. I pray to God
that he will graciously help us preserve and improve it.

<h2>Spaceship Earth</h2>
<b>More Information</b><p>

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.


<P>
<a name="enter"></a>
The original environmentalists turned to government, especially the national
government, to achieve their objectives.  The government, in turn, applied
its bureaucratic regulatory model to environmental challenges.  To protect
and enhance the environment, government issued thousands of pages of
regulations; dedicated billions of tax dollars; and required others, state
and local government as well as private citizens, to redirect billions of
dollars more to environmental protection.

<P>
While this bureaucratic, regulatory model of government coincided with many
environmental successes, it has also failed (sometimes spectacularly) to
achieve its goals (e.g. Superfund).  Even in the areas where real progress
has been made, it has often been purchased only at the price of imposing
unnecessary burdens on economic growth.  

<P>

Perhaps most damaging, the regulatory approach has hampered technological
innovation, slowing the development and introduction of new approaches that
are essential to the next generation of environmental progress.  The
regulatory approach has "frozen" the environmental agenda in the increasingly
obsolete technologies of the 1970s.  Today, the environmental movement is
mired in a static model which is fundamentally flawed for practical,
scientific and cultural reasons.  

<P>
In practical terms, the static model, imposed through innovation-hostile
regulatory bureaucracies, has dramatically slowed the introduction of
environmentally-friendly technologies that are essential to the next
generation of environmental progress.  

<P>
In scientific terms, the model is flawed because it assumes that "spaceship
earth" is a static system -- that the environment is or ought to be
unchanging -- when it is in fact highly dynamic.  The earth has changed and
evolved dramatically, even during the relatively short course of human
history.  Oceans rise and fall, species come and go, temperatures fluctuate.
El Nino -- the massive air disturbance that has fundamentally changed the
global climate during this century -- is a dramatic current example of
environmental dynamism on spaceship earth.

<P>
In cultural terms, the static model is flawed because the idea of progress --
the belief that mankind has improved in the past, is improving today, and
will continue to improve into the foreseeable future -- is inextricably woven
into the American idea itself.  For Americans, it has never been enough to
"maintain" or "sustain;" our goal has always been to improve and make better.
A culturally sustainable environmentalism is therefore not one that equates
"stewardship" with "stasis."  Instead, it must recognize the dynamic nature
of the global environment, and it must seek to channel that dynamism in a
positive direction.  American environmentalism, in short, must be about
progress.

<P>
The static approach to environmentalism is, of course, not simply a result of
a regulatory approach.  The idea of "stasis" is deeply embedded in the
political philosophy of the environmental movement.  The idea is to "protect
and preserve," to prevent "significant deterioration," to advance
"sustainable" approaches to development.

<P>
It is not enough to "protect the environment from further damage."  Within
the framework of continuous environmental change, we must seek to enhance our
air, water and other natural resources.

<P>
Having recognized environmental dynamism, we cannot help but also recognize
that the regulatory approach adopted more than a generation ago must be
replaced by an approach that releases the dynamic energies of personal and
economic freedom.  Unlike the current approach, new environmental policies
must enhance market mechanisms, property rights, local initiative and,
perhaps most important, the development and use of environmentally friendly
technologies.  Not least among these is the advancement of  progress toward
an information-age economy, which is, by its nature, dramatically less
environmentally damaging than the "smokestack" economy of the industrial age.

<P>
It is time to develop the next generation of environmental thought and
policy.   What is needed is not so much a better way of regulation but a
better way of cleaning up toxic waste dumps.  It is not enough in the eyes of
the public to abolish the old system without offering a replacement vision.

<P>
Replacing more than 20 years of environmental doctrine, dogma, ideology,
politics and policy is, of course, a massive undertaking -- and may well be
expected to take a decade or more to complete.  But the work must begin
somewhere, and while completion is many years away, we must develop a new
framework that recognizes the scientific fact of environmental dynamism,
encourages the practical dynamism of environmentally friendly technological
innovation and embraces the cultural principle of positive environmental
dynamism  -- i.e. of environmental progress.<p>

<h2>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy</h2>
<b>By Bruce Yandle</b>
<p>

<p>
Since around 1970, the United States and most of the industrialized world
have been engaged in a massive effort to improve and guard environmental
quality.  It is a gross understatement to say that the struggles along the
way are well documented.  Indeed, anyone who has attempted to stay abreast of
the topic has built a veritable library of hearings, books, journals and
special reports. 
<P>

What have we learned?  How can we improve?  Can we identify a better path
than the one we have traveled?  Some call for a revolution in policy.  Others
expect to see evolutionary change.  One thing is certain: there will be
change.  The reasons?  Our current command-and-control-based policy is
obsolete.  It is time to replace the 1970 centralized model that emerged when
information was costly with something that fits a world calling for
flexibility, decentralization and improved environmental protection. 

<P>
I hope for metamorphic change:  A new butterfly to replace the old
caterpillar.  I hope to see policy based on results, not inputs.  It is my
hope that our measure of success will be environmental improvement, not
technologies, suits and number of enforcement actions. First I will address
broad principles, and then use those principles to consider some flowers that
have emerged in the concrete of control.  By examining these exceptions to
the rule, we may find ideas that form some elements for a revised
environmental policy agenda.<p>

<H3><center>
Two Broad Options:  Systems and Process
</H3></center>
<P>
There are two very broad options that can be selected when a community of
people seeks to regulate collective behavior.  I refer to one option as a
systems approach.  The other, a process approach.  

<P>
The systems approach involves detailed study of key features of the
particular problem being addressed (i.e., air pollution).  Those directing
the approach seek to understand minute features of the problem, to develop
detailed rules of behavior and then to enforce those rules.  The focus is on
inputs, behavior, technology; it is what we all call command-and-control
regulation.  

<P>
Command-and-control assumes that if inputs are right, outcomes will take care
of themselves.  Monitoring is not necessary. It is a rigid, rule-filled
approach to the problem that works pretty well for static situations and
homogeneous polluters, where most important features of the problem do not
change and the pollutants being controlled do not interact with or form other
pollutants. The systems approach believes that well specified pollution
problems can be solved so long as the incentives faced by human agents have
little bearing on the outcome. Unfortunately, there are not many situations
like this in today's world.  The methods used to control automobile emissions
provide a pertinent example of the systems approach.  

<P>
In contrast, the process approach develops constraints and linkages to them
that cause individual decision makers to account for their actions.  It
focuses on broader environmental outcomes, not inputs.  Monitoring is
crucial, and community participants have an incentive to help monitor.  

<P>
The process approach is better geared for dynamic, multiple pollution
situations, where the decision makers and conditions are heterogeneous and
the cost of continuously gaining highly technical information and
implementing it is very large.  The constraints may be rules of property and
liability that give rise to costs and rewards to all who are a part of the
process.  For example, simple common law rules say polluters -- air, water,
odor, solid waste -- have no right to impose uninvited costs on their
neighbors, but that the neighbors and polluters can negotiate solutions.
  
<P>
River basin associations and multi-state compacts, which are enlarged common
law approaches, embody rules of property and law that yield incentives to
reduce the cost of meeting a community's environmental quality constraint.
River basin managers monitor outcomes.  The responsibility of paying for
damages disciplines polluters; the ability of lovers of environmental quality
to purchase more environmental quality provides some flexibility.  Outcomes
-- the river -- not inputs, are what matter in the process approach.  Indeed,
no one really cares very much about inputs other than those who sell and
service them.  
<br>
<P>
After 25 years of experience, we know that systems approaches worked
relatively well for some things in some settings.  We also know that taking a
systems approach to process problems or applying a process approach to
certain systems problems encourages frustration and generates unneeded costs.
 Sadly, it seems, the systems approach diverts attention from the goal being
sought.  Environmental outcomes are often relegated to the back seat, while
regulators drive toward input compliance.  
<P>

<H3><center>
Experience with Systems and Exceptions
</H3></center>

<P>
By and large, the United States has taken a systems approach.  Consider a few
capsules of highly stylized results:  Air quality regulators cannot readily
focus on related water pollution problems.  Hazardous waste regulators are
not allowed to make comparative assessments of priority sites and to vary
their allocation of efforts.  Property rights are bruised in an effort to
protect wetlands, which themselves are not well defined.  Command-and-control
causes endangered species to become liabilities instead of assets.  In short,
we have learned that the "one-suit-fits-all approach" works well for a static
population of identical actors, but not so well for a diverse and rapidly
changing economy.

<P>
The high cost of uniform input management has led to some creativity and
alteration of rules.  Cracks develop in the command-and-control concrete, as
individual actors try to custom tailor the regulatory suits that do not fit
so well.  At some point, after all, people become concerned about the
environment and what is happening to it.  By looking closely at what goes on
in the cracks, we may discover a positive agenda for revised environmental
policy.

<P>
Let me quickly list some evolving approaches to the goal of environmental
protection that I believe help to identify elements of a future agenda.

<P>
<ul>
<li> Facility focus with complete flexibility in achieving goals.  The Amoco
Yorktown story informs us of a remarkable experiment where EPA and Amoco
formed a partnership and did a top-to-bottom assessment of the Yorktown
refinery.  Putting command-and-control to one side, the two parties for the
first time assessed the environment.  They found that some things were far
better than expected; other things that previously received little or no
regulatory attention offered low cost opportunities for environmental
improvement.  By focusing on goals and allowing flexibility, everyone won --
the community, EPA and Amoco.  

<P>
<li> Third-party audits and open doors.  The world chemical industry has
embarked on a program called "responsible care."  The program encourages
chemical firms to form partnerships with communities, to invite third-party
audits, to show what firms are doing, how they are controlling pollution and
to illustrate how more can be accomplished if flexibility is allowed.  To
reduce the understandable fear of using third-party audits, the State of
South Carolina is considering legislation that would prevent the use of such
findings from incriminating firms and individuals where violations are
voluntarily discovered and corrected.

<P>
<li> River basin associations.  North Carolina's Tar-Pamlico River Basin
Association is North America's only operating association that brings
together point and nonpoint sources of pollution in a combined trading effort
to reduce nitrogen and phosphorous loadings in a river.  I should point out
that this approach is common place elsewhere.  Property rights and contracts
provide the vehicle.  Command-and-control simply could not do the job in
North Carolina.  EPA wiped away the systems approach, focused on the process
and allowed complete flexibility in achieving a water quality goal.  This
could not have been accomplished without the vital support of the
Environmental Defense Fund.  Again, everyone won -- the community, the
polluters, the regulators and the river.  

<P>
<li> ISO 14000 and the State of Pennsylvania.  Global markets are pushing
environmental goals with forces that sometimes surpass those of national
regulators.  The International Standards Organization, a nongovernmental
organization, assists and audits firms that seek to be ISO certified, a
contractual requirement in many cases for selling goods in world markets.
The State of Pennsylvania now accepts ISO 14000 certification as a
substitute for evidence that firms located there meet Pennsylvania standards.
The market has replaced the regulator.

<P>
<li> Superfund and the Dutch System.  The Dutch system for dealing with
abandoned hazardous waste sites has been adopted generally across all of
Europe, which has far more abandoned sites than the U.S.  The triage system
allows for some sites to be contained, not mitigated, some to be returned to
full use because of low risk, and some to be mitigated, often at public
expense.  The mitigated sites must be cleaned to the level of customary use
for the land in question.  The result:  There is no celebration of
litigation.  Sites are being cleaned.  Property rights tend to be protected
and costs, contained.<p>
</ul>

<H3><center>
Elements of an Agenda for Change
</H3></center>

<P>What does this say about an agenda?  Let me suggest the following:

<P>
<ul>
<li> Goal orientation.  Future environmental policy should place a premium on
measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental quality.  Progress
toward specific goals, as set by communities, should be the measure of
success, not the number of suits, enforcement actions or installation of
technology.

<P>
<li> Flexibility.  Performance goals with complete flexibility for attaining
them should be the general foundation for all environmental policy, with
command-and-control occupying the default position. Innovation should be
rewarded, not penalized.  Valuable knowledge must be conserved. 
 
<P>
<li> Biological envelopes.  The larger environmental envelope that surrounds a
community of environmental users should form the zone of control.
River-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations, as well as multi-state
compacts, should be encouraged and given flexibility in accomplishing goals.
Again, the monitoring function is crucial.

<P>
<li> Community common sense.  Decision making for environmental protection
should be located where outcomes and costs matter the most -- at the level of
the environmental user.  People in communities can be trusted to protect
themselves from harm.  Those facing the problems have the greatest incentive
to find the least-cost way of dealing with the problems.  Local communities
should rise to the top of the regulatory hierarchy.

<P>
<li> Common law.  Steps should be taken to salvage common law protection of
private environmental rights.  Statutory shields against common law remedies
should be eliminated, provided the community has participated in determining
environmental goals and solutions.  

<P>
<li> Property rights.  Property rights should be respected.  When private
parties are asked to provide public benefits by altering the use of privately
held rights, they should be paid.
</ul>

<H3><center>
Final Thoughts
</center></H3>

As we consider elements for a new environmental policy, we do so recognizing
that we live in a world that faces many other compelling demands.  We hear
about health care, safety, retirement security, education and emerging
communities elsewhere that grapple with even more primitive wants and needs.
Global competition is mentioned endlessly, and it is real.  

<P>
The basic blueprints for the nation's environmental policy are now 25 years
old.  Not many things that old have survived into today's dynamic world.  We
no longer have a smokestack economy.  But we still have countless smokestack
regulations that stand in the way of effective environmental improvement.  In
prehistoric times, we are told sharks and dinosaurs lived in the same
periods.  The dinosaur, full of bones, and not very flexible, did not adjust
and adapt.  The shark, which does not have a bone in its body, only
cartilage, made it to modern times.  Our new environmental policy should be
shark, not a dinosaur.

<P>
The mood was euphoric. The tone one of bravado. &quot;We're looking
for horror stories. We're going to change the way things are done
around here!&quot; Thus spoke one Congressman shortly after the
November 1994 election. The targets? The Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, all environmental regulations,
and especially the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<BR>

<P>
By 1996, the mood was sober; the tone confused. Congressional
reformers of the 104th Congress had failed to institute hoped-for
changes in environmental regulations. &quot;The stumbling block
to reform,&quot; admitted a Congressional staffer at a January
1996 retreat, &quot;is the vision thing&quot; - how reformers
define and understand basic environmental policy challenges.<BR>

<P>
What is needed is an environmental vision that combines an appreciation
of the general environmental psyche of the nation with a respect
for the diverse values people hold. This means finding approaches
to environmental problems that economize on the need for consensus
- that limit instances in which non-voluntary collective decisions
are sought - while reinforcing incentives for personal environmental
stewardship. <BR>

<P>
Reformers also need a plausible picture of how the world works
- how one identifies environmental problems, assembles information
relevant to minimizing these problems and maintains incentives
- within firms and among individuals - to apply that information.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="vision"></a><B>The &quot;Vision Thing&quot;<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The &quot;old vision&quot; that shaped the past quarter-century
of environmental policies offered lofty images of Mother Nature
and a better world. Its language of poetry - and sometimes fear
- captivated the imagination of the American public. And, translated
into public policies, the old vision produced some successes.
<BR>

<P>
But, as Horatio warned Hamlet, &quot;All is not well.&quot; The
record of environmental gains tells only part of the environmental
story. The rest of the story - high costs and growing conflict
- are the driving forces behind appeals for environmental policy
reform. Three features of the old vision made high conflict and
high costs a likely outcome.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="values"></a><B>Values<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
First is the matter of values. The old environmental vision often
implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, portrayed environmental
values as absolute - as somehow more important than other values.
The result has been an endorsement of &quot;zero emission&quot;
goals and remediation standards in which little consideration
is given to costs. &quot;If Mother Nature didn't put it in,&quot;
one California regulator recently told me, &quot;you had to take
it out - everything - that was the goal. This drove us to rigid,
grossly exuberant attempts at clean up.&quot;<BR>

<P>
But this view that environmental values are absolute cannot be
right. Environmental values, while important, are situated among
a cluster of values that constitute quality-of-life. People seek
health, safety, nourishment, shelter, learning, companionship,
aesthetic enrichment and personal accomplishment, along with environmental
protections. And it is often difficult for outsiders - or even
individuals themselves - to know in advance how they would prefer
to trade off among different wants.<BR>

<P>
Most people want all good things, including environmental protection.
Year after year, opinion polls demonstrate (at least in the abstract)
a commitment to environmental values. Any successful reform effort
must appreciate this commitment.<BR>

<P>
But general societal trends do not erase particular differences
among individuals. Environmental values are more important for
some people than for others. And, for any particular individual,
some environmental values are more important than others. A new
environmental vision must depart from the old way of thinking
by recognizing the need to find ways in which individuals and
particular communities can undertake their own balancing among
these many values.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problem-solving is about making choices. The challenge,
however, is not simply one of deciding what's to be done. The
challenge is also one of determining &quot;who should decide&quot;
and &quot;how.&quot; Recognizing that people have diverse values
establishes one constraint in thinking about &quot;who shall decide.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="knowledge"></a><B>The Knowledge Problem<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A second constraint is what Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek called the
&quot;knowledge problem&quot; - how societies create and access
information relevant to making decisions about the allocation
of time and resources. <BR>

<P>
The old vision viewed the information challenge as one of identifying
general environmental problems and then specifying uniform remedies
to those problems. Information relevant to environmental problem-solving
was perceived to be the sort that could be collected and centralized
within an agency of experts, then translated into a series of
one-size-fits-all regulations that prescribed acceptable technologies,
clean-up methods and single-purpose wilderness management plans.
The result was often an attitude that &quot;bureaucrats know best.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
This old vision was partly right about &quot;knowledge.&quot;
Many environmental problems do involve matters of &quot;general
knowledge&quot; - scientific understanding of facts that are constant
across time and space. Sometimes this scientific knowledge is
a matter of settled understanding: the boiling point of water,
for instance, or the bonding patterns of chemicals. EPA uses this
kind of knowledge to develop ways of detecting chemical concentrations
in polluted soils. <BR>

<P>
In other instances, scientific knowledge is a matter of ongoing
research and scientific contention: What, for example, are the
health hazards of various substances or the effects of carbon
dioxide on climate? Or is concentration of a chemical in the soil
a useful indicator of risk to humans and ecosystems? Much environmental
debate takes place over issues of general knowledge, and these
questions are important. But they are not the whole story.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problems and problem-solving also often involve
what Hayek called &quot;specific knowledge&quot; - the knowledge
of time, place and experience. This information varies by circumstance
and location and may change over time. Specific knowledge is decentralized
- it resides on the factory floor, on a specific farm and at a
particular Superfund site.<BR>

<P>
The impacts of a landfill in the desert will differ from those
near the Florida Everglades. Whether incorporating recycled content
into a package optimizes resource efficiency will depend on the
material, the availability of alternative materials, particular
production processes and other product-specific details. Using
two coats of oil-based paint will have different impacts than
using just one coat.<BR>

<P>
These kinds of details do not reside in the minds of bureaucrats
in Washington - or even within state agencies. Yet this is the
kind of knowledge that is often most relevant to understanding
specific environmental problems and the merits of different remedies.
<BR>

<P>
The narrow framing of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot; captured
in the regulatory reform bills proposed in the early part of the
104th Congress did not address this problem of dynamic and decentralized
information. The first prong of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot;
- how to better incorporate available general knowledge into public
policy - dominated that debate. Proponents of the 1995 regulatory
reform bills viewed the essential problem as one of irrationality.
They called for more professionalism and better planners. The
Big Fix, they argued, would come from the twin icons of rationalism:
hard science and good economics.<BR>

<P>
This emphasis on costs and the denunciation of regulations directed
at trivial risks is common sense stuff. An effort to introduce
better science and economic analysis into environmental decision-making
may yield more efficient and sensible policies.<BR>

<P>
But matters of high cost and poorly chosen goals are really derivative
problems. They are a predictable (and lamentable) product of a
mismatch between top-down, micromanaging decision processes and
the world as it is: complex, dynamic and full of particulars rather
than generalities.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda that simply superimposes cost-benefit decision
constraints on regulators does not get at the kinds of information
problems inherent in a complex, dynamic world full of location-specific
details. Attending to the knowledge problem means, instead, thinking
about what institutions and decision-making processes will create
information feedback loops and facilitate access to relevant knowledge
of time, place, and experience.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="firm"></a><B>The Individual, the Firm and the Marketplace<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This challenge brings us to the third feature of the old environmental
vision - its perception of the individual, the firm and the marketplace.
The old vision viewed industry and economic dynamism as a central
cause of environmental degradation. Pollution was not just a problem;
it was evil. And the motives of participants in this economic
growth dynamo were suspect. <BR>

<P>
This view is a recipe for emphasizing sticks, not carrots. It
is also a recipe for emphasizing fines and punishment rather than
problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
As journalist Gregg Easterbrook shows in <B>A Moment on Earth</B>,
his 1,000-plus pages tome on environmental progress, our air and
water are cleaner; wolves again prowl in once-abandoned forests;
and, ospreys fish in once-polluted waters. Easterbrook implicitly
attributes most of these reported gains to three decades of regulation.
Forgotten by Easterbrook and most other chroniclers of environmental
gains is the role that marketplace ingenuity, market prices and
private stewardship have played in environmental progress. This
myopia means the reform agenda has been mostly about fine-tuning
regulations, not rethinking the nation's basic approach to environmentalism.
<BR>

<P>
Yet the incentives promoted by a competitive marketplace have
yielded phenomenal improvements in how efficiently we use resources.
In an essay on technology and environment, Jesse Ausubel reports
that the telecommunications industry now consumes 65 pounds of
silica to create a cable that can carry 1,000 times more messages
than cable made from one ton of copper. A handful of sand versus
a ton of copper represents an environmental triumph of a competitive
marketplace that nudges manufacturers to use less stuff.<BR>

<P>
These trends have occurred in things both great and small. On
the one hand are construction-industry gains, where technology
improvements mean builders can use one-third the materials once
needed to build a high-rise building. At the other end of the
spectrum is the diminutive soda can. In the 1960s, producers required
164 pounds of metal to produce 1,000 soda cans; today they use
around 33 pounds of metal.<BR>

<P>
These gains result not only in &quot;doing more with less.&quot;
They also reduce the &quot;environmental footprint&quot; - the
pollution and waste - associated with producing a given product.
<BR>

<P>
This picture of progress is, of course, imperfect. Two decades
of economic literature have described the &quot;tragedy of the
commons,&quot; in which resources are &quot;owned&quot; by everyone
and thus are essentially owned by no one, since they can be used
indiscriminately by everyone. Under these circumstances, each
person has an incentive to consume as much as possible, as fast
as possible, rather than preserve and protect resources for future
use.<BR>

<P>
This &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; applies to unowned lands;
it also applies to air basins, oceans and many other water bodies.
<BR>

<P>
Sometimes, the resolution to these commons problems lies in clarifying
rights and strengthening markets, as some environmental economists
have argued for twenty years - occasionally successfully. Environmental
writer Tom Wolf describes a &quot;Ranching for Wildlife&quot;
program in Colorado that borrows from the ideas of these environmental
economists. In the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, elk on public and
private lands compete with cattle for forage. The challenge, suggests
Wolf, is &quot;to figure out how ranchers can capture value from
the elk.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Hunters will pay as much as $8,000 for a license to hunt trophy
elk. But until Colorado passed its Ranching for Wildlife law,
landowners were unable to take part in potential revenues from
the sale of hunting licenses. Under Ranching for Wildlife, the
state still &quot;owns&quot; the wildlife, but owners of large
ranches can auction off a designated number of hunting licenses
that guarantee trophy elk. The program, in effect, has partially
privatized elk-hunting rights. Participating ranch owners now
manage their lands to provide suitable habitat for elk. They also
vigilantly guard against poaching of young bull elk.<BR>

<P>
But some problems - and many air pollution problems fall into
this category - are not easily divisible into private &quot;spheres
of stewardship.&quot; And one person's choices directly affect
others. These problems involve situations in which defining and
enforcing individual rights are costly. These high &quot;transactions
costs,&quot; as economist Ronald Coase called them, inhibit the
emergence of contractual arrangements in which all affected parties
voluntarily work out an allocation of rights and responsibilities.
<BR>

<P>
Thinking about the problems of indivisibility and transaction
costs introduces a central challenge for environmental reform.
Fully private, individual decisions are not always possible. Regulatory
decisions are often undesirable, since they suppress localized
information and impose a single-value hierarchy. And reliance
on courts to resolve all disputes about pollution and other social
&quot;nuisances&quot; can be divisive and costly. Needed is a
way of sorting out which collective decision-making arrangements,
under which circumstances, enhance expression of environmental
values at least cost. <BR>

<P>
The old environmental vision fostered passage of command-and-control
laws that gave scant attention to costs and regulated large and
small problems indiscriminately. That vision nurtured laws that
stirred up adversarial relationships between regulators and the
regulated. It formed the basis for a blueprint destined to divide
communities.<BR>

<P>
A new environmental vision must be compatible with a complex,
dynamic world in which quality-of-life comprises many values,
but time and resources, at any given moment, are not infinite.
Under this vision, environmental values are viewed as part of
an array of wants people hold. This vision also appreciates the
importance of decentralized information - information of time,
place and experience - and recognizes that marketplace institutions
(clearly defined rights, competition and market prices) help foster
incentives for stewardship and efficient resource use. But this
vision also recognizes that all environmental problems are not
alike. Some problems are amenable to some form of &quot;privatized&quot;
solution; others require collective - though not necessarily government
- action.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="reform"></a><B>Principles of Reform<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
How might the vision outlined here reshape U.S. environmental
policy? The &quot;vision thing&quot; in itself is not enough to
provide direction to an environmental reform agenda. From that
vision, reformers need to outline some simple policy principles.
Five policy principles are consistent with the vision outlined
here. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Decentralization</I>. For three decades, we have
thrust many environmental decisions into the Federal arena. But
for some problems, impacts are strictly local and narrowly circumscribed.
Other environmental problems may impose regional, or even global
impacts. The locus of impact of a problem should help determine
where decision-making authority ought to reside.<BR>

<P>
If most knowledge relevant to understanding specific environmental
problems is location-specific and dynamic, decisions about &quot;how
clean is clean&quot; and what remedies to use should take place
closest to where the problem occurs. For air-emission problems,
that might mean a local air basin. For decisions about cleaning
up an industrial site, that might mean creating processes that
foster bargaining between landowners adjacent to the site and
the site owner. <BR>

<P>
Decentralized bargaining approaches bring to bear relevant local
information. These approaches may also be less likely to drive
decisions toward &quot;zero risk&quot; than centralized decision
processes. In decentralized bargaining situations, citizens face
<I>both</I> the risks associated with a facility and enjoy directly
the benefits - in the form of lower clean-up costs and more job-creation,
for example - associated with a particular remedy. Bargaining
thus serves as a discovery process, revealing more accurate information
about risks and benefits.<BR>

<P>
Unbounded fears may, in fact, be more likely to drive decisions
toward &quot;zero risk&quot; in centralized decision processes.
There, the costs of decisions are spread over an entire population,
but benefits from pursuing pristine clean-ups are enjoyed by those
few near a particular site. The few then have an incentive to
lobby for those benefits, while the many have little incentive
to lobby at all - with obvious results.<BR>

<P>
The contrast between costly Superfund site clean-ups, which have
occurred in a top-down, regulatory framework directed by the EPA,
and more recent local remediation of abandoned industrial sites
through negotiated settlements offers testament to this point.
The locally negotiated clean-ups have, in general, been accomplished
at a fraction of the cost for Superfund sites.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Flexibility</I>. Complexity and change characterize
nature and human interaction with it. Traditional regulations
that prescribe technologies or mandate particular clean-up remedies
ignore location-specific and ever-changing information critical
to all production and consumption decisions. To take advantage
of the knowledge residing within a particular plant, or at a specific
hazardous waste site, or on an individual farm, environmental
policies need to foster flexibility, often through the market
process. Performance standards, in contrast to command-and-control
regulations, allow individuals and firms to figure out how best
to achieve the stated standards (to lower overall air pollution
to a certain level, for instance).<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Problem-solving</I>. The old environmental vision
tended to cast business against environmentalists, the private-sector
against the public sector, regulators against the regulated. The
result was an emphasis on crimes and punishment. According to
EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in fiscal year 1994 the EPA collected
$165.2 million in monetary penalties and $747.5 million in injunctive
relief. The agency pursued 2,246 enforcement actions in a single
year - and these efforts do not include state and local government
enforcement activities.<BR>

<P>
Enforcement efforts, per se, are not unwarranted. But an emphasis
on enforcement that leads to prosecutions of sometimes trivial
procedural violations is costly - and such efforts may inhibit
rather than foster actual environmental improvements. An emphasis
on criminal enforcement even when there is no intent to violate
the law or no gross negligence simply expends scarce dollars on
prosecutions rather than problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda needs to foster information exchanges and technology
development, and bolster incentives of individuals - acting alone
and within public and private institutions - to find ways of mitigating
environmental problems.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Balancing.</I> Enhancing quality-of-life requires
optimizing among the many values that people hold. All production
and consumption activities produce residuals. For every residual
generated, some corresponding benefit (from the perspective of
individual consumers) is produced. And all production and consumption
activities involve a series of trade-offs. A dollar spent on pollution
prevention technologies or clean-up is a dollar not available
to invest in other productivity-enhancing endeavors.<BR>

<P>
Trade-offs are not merely between environmental and economic goals.
Many trade-offs are between one set of risks and other risks.
For example, pesticide run-off may contaminate waters, but pesticides
help reduce food spoilage in the field. And less food spoilage
means less food needs to be planted to meet the same consumption
requirements. <BR>

<P>
The September 1995 issue of <I>Risk in Perspective</I>, published
by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, reported that &quot;chlorination
of drinking water is considered one of the most dramatic success
stories in the field of public health.&quot; Chlorination has
helped prevent a whole range of waterborne diseases from chronic
diarrhea to typhoid fever. On the other hand, the Harvard newsletter
cautions that &quot;chlorination is not free of counterveiling
risks....the possibility that these compounds could cause long-term,
chronic effects, including cancer, is now a subject of intensive
research by toxicologists and epidemiologists.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Balancing these risks is not a trivial matter. In Peru, a decision
to reduce the chlorination of public drinking water may have been
responsible for an outbreak of cholera that killed thousands of
people.<BR>

<P>
This problem of trade-offs - and how to get the biggest bang for
the environmental buck - lay at the heart of 1995 Congressional
proposals to institute cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment.
Reform proposals need to incorporate &quot;balancing mechanisms&quot;
- decision processes that foster a balancing of costs against
benefits and establish means for setting priorities. But balancing
may be better achieved through bargaining processes than through
top-down rules that impose detailed analytical requirements on
regulators. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Accountability and Stewardship</I>. Economists
Richard Stroup and John Baden conclude that institutions, not
perverse people, are the genesis of environmental problems. Policies
that more closely link the choices that individuals make with
outcomes for those choices strengthen incentives for stewardship
and efficiency. Paying to use resources, for example, establishes
incentives to conserve the same resources.<BR>

<P>
But this linkage applies to public decisions as well. Current
policies that require individuals or firms to set aside land for
wildlife, wilderness and wetlands protection in effect ask these
people to provide a public amenity at no cost to the public. Compensating
private individuals (or firms) in those instances in which they
are asked to provide a public amenity is not merely a matter of
fairness. It also gives property owners a financial self-interest
in protecting habitat and preserving endangered species. And it
gives regulators an incentive to prioritize their efforts.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="do"></a><B>What Can Policymakers Do</B>?<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
An environmental vision must precede policy reform because it
shapes the principles of progress. It provides a basis for developing
principles against which to construct and evaluate different policy
reform tools. It establishes some notion of what reformers value,
and it offers, as Walter Lippman wrote in his 1965 book, <B>Public
Opinion</B>, a &quot;map of the universe&quot; - a sense of the
nature of knowledge and how people create and tap into relevant
knowledge to make decisions.<BR>

<P>
But a vision, and the principles that flow from that vision, are
necessarily abstract. Policy reformers, however, must deal in
specifics. What might an agenda for reform look like?<BR>

<P>
Former EPA chief William Ruckelshaus correctly concluded in his
fall 1995 speech at the Environmental Law Institute's annual awards
dinner in Washington, D.C. that, &quot;despite the current rhetoric
in this city, there is no simple fix, no silver bullet.&quot;
Aligning environmental policies with a new vision that highlights
problem-solving rather than punishment, dynamic use of decentralized
information, and a balancing among many values will require an
overhaul of many current statutes. And it will need to be an evolutionary
process. Three kinds of statutes might start that process.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Devolution Statute</I>. The first step would
include passage of a general statute to devolve responsibilities
and authority for many environmental programs to states. Several
ideas for such a statute have been outlined by the Washington,
D.C.-based National Environmental Policy Institute and other groups.
These ideas serve as a useful starting point. An Environmental
Devolution Statute, focused on most air, water and hazardous waste
regulations, should:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Devolve to the states authority, responsibility and accountability
for setting environmental goals, implementing policy and monitoring
success. Where airsheds or watersheds cross state boundaries,
states would have primary authority for working out acceptable
standards, and the national role would be one of mediator. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create sunset provisions to phase out existing legislation
<I>as revised environmental laws</I> are introduced. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create a performance-based system in which the emphasis is
on setting ambient environmental standards, not on the use of
specific technologies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Establish mechanisms for development of multi-media, facility-wide,
or even community-wide, ambient standards and permitting that
would allow for emission trading among facilities, among different
emission sources within a single plant and even possibly among
different pollution sources. Permits could take the form of contracts
or covenants rather than the more traditional regulatory permits.

</UL>

<P>
The primary purpose of such a statute would be to create procedures
for decentralizing decision-making and developing flexible conditions
in which success is measured by real-world accomplishments, not
by prospective EPA approvals based on modeled predictions of how
EPA thinks different technologies and programs might affect environmental
quality.<BR>

<P>
<I>Civic Environmentalism Act</I>. The second step for environmental
reform would include a Civic Environmentalism Act passed by Congress.
Designed to shift emphasis away from primarily punitive approaches
to policies that promote problem-solving, bargaining and technical
information and information exchange, this act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Reform environmental enforcement by clarifying which actions
are subject to criminal penalties and which are subject to civil
and administrative proceedings; tie criminal penalties primarily
to situations in which intent to harm is present; revise sentencing
guidelines so that environmental sentences conform more closely
with guidelines for other, comparable crimes; and, limit dual
prosecutions for the same violation by different agencies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create an environmental extension program patterned after
agricultural extension programs in which information and technical
assistance are provided to farmers and businesses to achieve emission
reductions as a substitute for enforcement actions in situations
where neither &quot;intent to harm&quot; nor &quot;gross negligence&quot;
exists. Such programs need not require new expenditures but could
involve a shifting of current expenditures away from punitive
approaches, or they could use proceeds from pollution charges,
or such programs could use private funding. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Facilitate the establishment of local, market-like bargaining
and negotiating processes through which those directly affected
by particular pollution and other environmental harms can negotiate
with the individuals, firms or governments responsible for those
harms concerning appropriate clean-up levels and ambient standards.
Models for these programs already exist within some states, for
some kinds of projects. 
</UL>

<P>
A Civic Environmentalism Act would represent a major departure
from the regulatory approaches established over the past thirty
years. The goal of such an act would be to begin the process of
&quot;privatizing&quot; decision-making regarding some environmental
problems, and creating bargaining approaches for problems such
as Superfund site clean-ups, brownfields redevelopment, Federal
facilities clean-ups, toxic emission standard-setting and other
problems with primarily local impacts.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Amenities Act</I>. The third step in environmental
reform would be an Environmental Amenities Act patterned in part
after the 1995 House proposals for takings compensation to property
owners who lose some (or all) use of their property to provide
public environmental amenities such as wilderness, wildlife and
wetlands protection. The overall purpose of an Environmental Amenities
Act would be to replace the regulatory and punitive approaches
of the current Endangered Species Act and wetlands regulations
developed under the Clean Water Act with market approaches that
create incentives for environmental stewardship and relieve individual
property owners or firms from shouldering the burdens of providing
public amenities at private rather than taxpayer expense. An Environmental
Amenities Act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Create requirements for takings compensation in situations
where private landowners are required to provide public amenities;
such provisions <I>do not</I> include compensation against regulations
regarding pollution reduction or mitigation. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Empower states to &quot;privatize&quot; benefits of wildlife
and habitat protection by encouraging use of bounties, competitive
contracts for private entities to provide habitat and wildlife
protection, and other measures that allow private individuals,
firms, ranchers and forest owners to &quot;capture value&quot;
by producing environmental goods. 
</UL>

<P>
The purpose of an Environmental Amenities Act would be to strengthen
accountability - both in the private and public sectors.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="better"></a><B>A Better Future<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
All environmental decisions involve a tug-of-war among competing
values. This includes a tug-of-war among substantive values -
my sphere of values versus my neighbor's and one value versus
another.<BR>

<P>
The tug-of-war also includes juggling among what I call decision-process
values. All decision-making processes experience, to varying degrees
along a continuum, a tension between predictability and flexibility;
uniformity and diversity; certainty and dynamism; anticipation
of all harms and resilience - the ability to respond effectively
when problems arise.<BR>

<P>
For thirty years, however, legislators have opted for environmental
policies that have emphasized predictability, centralization,
certainty and uniformity. These decision characteristics are ill-suited
to a dynamic world in which people hold diverse values and problems
are complex and often location-specific. Such a world requires
decision processes that enhance autonomy, personal stewardship,
flexibility, decentralization, adaptation and resilience.
