<P>
The object of the trainee assignment is to publish information
on the GEM project via a World-Wide-Web site. GEM is an ongoing
European project engaged in the standardised integration of engineering
analysis software. It is the intention that the Web site is accessible
to anyone who has access to the Internet and has the right browser
software installed.
<P>
First, a brief outline will be given of the history of the Internet
and of the World-Wide-Web (WWW). For example, it will be explained
how the Web pages can be made. To this end, the language (HTML)
and the development tools and everything further related to them
will be discussed.
<P>
This is followed by a brief description of the GEM project.
<P>
Subsequently, it will be explained step by step how the GEM site
has come about and how it is possible to visit the GEM site on
the Web.
<P>
In conclusion an overview of future developments will be outlined
on the WWW in general and the GEM WWW site in particular.
<P>
<B>Acknowledgements</B>

<P>
The Internet was originally conceived by the U.S. military as
a means of ensuring a workable communication system in the event
of a strike by enemy missiles forces. It was the sixties, after
all, at the height of the Cold War, when the fear of Soviet attack
guided all kinds of military projects. If one central communication
location was bombed out of existence, the military wanted to make
sure that surviving locations could still talk to one another,
and that no communication would be lost.
<P>
Because the original network was developed by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. military, it was given the
name ARPAnet. Eventually, however, as increasing numbers of research
institutes and research universities connected themselves to the
network, MILnet, looked after military communications. In the
1980s, the National Science Foundation established NSFnet, linking
a half-dozen supercomputers at an extremely high speed that has
been made higher still. NSFnet, and in 1991 the U.S. High Performance
Computing Act established the basis for the National Research
and Education Network (NREN). NREN's goals are to establish and
maintain high-speed, high-capacity research and education networks,
while helping to develop commercial presence on the Internet as
well. This last point is immensely important for the World Wide
Web, which is rapidly being adopted as a medium of choice for
businesses in North America and, increasingly, around the globe.
During the Internet's early years, commercial activity was several
constrained by the NSF's 'Acceptable Use Policy' (AUP), which
directly disallowed any for-profit activities. The AUP has changed
somewhat, but more importantly the Internet has taken on different
forms and different policies. Although it's not actually stated
anywhere, commercial activity is now very much accepted on the
Net. Whether or not General Motors will being still begin to sell
its vehicles over the World Wide Web remains to be seen, but already
the Web is being used for product ordering and product support-
and by very sizeable corporations, too.
<P>
The Internet has changed so much, in fact, that during the first
half of 1994 the number of domain names for commercial organisations
(the 'com' domain) overtook those for educational institutions
( the 'edu' domain). In the month ending June 25, over 1300 new
commercial (com) names where registered with the Internet, and
the following month saw an additional 1700. That's a 30 percent
jump in just one month! And these business aren't just moving
onto the Net to do research for e-mail, either; they're there
because the Internet offers enormous commercial potential. To
be sure, the Internet is still primarily a research and academic
network, at least from the standpoints of creative use and extent
of use. There's an enormous amount of activity happening in the
educational field as well (with the K-12 area burgeoning), and
a great deal involving community and non-profit issues in addition.
That's almost certain to change, however, over the second half
of the 1990s. The only question now is whether or not governmental
legislation will stop the Internet's amazing growth, and the jury's
still very much out on that one.

<P>
FTP is both a protocol and a program. As a protocol, it's been
around almost as long as UNIX itself, and its function is to ensure
a common standard for moving files from one computer to another
across a network. As a program, FTP accomplishes these transfers.
It enables you to enter file directories on remote machines and
retrieve files from those machines or place files in those directories.
A full FTP implementation offers a suite of file utilities such
as creating directories and renaming and deleting files. Although
you can access FTP sites by having an account with a password,
the most widely used FTP type for casual users is called 'anonymous
FTP'; FTP software can be set to allow access to users who offer
the word 'anonymous' as a login name and their e-mail address
as a password. The World- Wide-Web makes extensive use of FTP.
First, some sites do not have HTTP software in place, so to make
their information accessible across the Web they place their HTML
documents on FTP servers instead. Second, Web clients such as
Cello, Mosaic and Netscape make FTP connections and perform FTP
downloads of files- but not uploads.
<P>
In the case of sites containing graphics, sound, or video files,
many are currently available via FTP only, either through anonymous
FTP directly or through Gopher FTP access. FTP access is so common
on the Web that you're unlikely to spend more than a few minutes
cruising before you encounter an FTP transaction.

<P>
Gopher is a well known interface for the Internet. Developed by
the University of Minnesota, Gopher is in fact very much like
the World-Wide-Web, offering a friendly face on such difficult
tools as FTP, telnet, Archie, WAIS, Veronica and others. The main
difference is that Gopher is not a hypertext environment. The
most common gopher client programs present information in numbered
lists instead of a hyper-linked documents, with different indicators
for different kinds of files (text, sound, search dialogues, etc.).
Gopher software for graphical user environment such as X Window,
the Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows typically offers the same
lists with icons replacing the numbers. The icons offer information
as to the type of file or directory you're accessing.
<P>
Gophers are directly accessible through the World-Wide-Web. Often
this access is presented in the link itself, but you can use your
browsers to move to a particular gopher by specifying the 'gopher://'
prefix when you enter a URL address (for example, gopher://cscns.com).
This yields the gopher directory, each item representing a selectable
Web link.

<P>
It's hard to be on the Internet and not know about electronic
mail, but it's easy to overlook the fact the World-Wide-Web is
mail-enabled to a certain extent. You're not going to find a rich,
full-featured e-mail package on the Web, at least not yet, but
e-mail plays an important role in the Web's design. Through the
use of HTML forms, you can have the readers of your pages submit
mail to your address, and users of some browsers can mail directly
from within that browser. (Mosaic and Netscape are examples.)
Undoubtedly, the use of e-mail in the design of Web pages will
increase in both usefulness and frequency. There is one main reason
for this: The Web itself is primarily a public medium, while e-mail
is primarily a private medium. In order to make full use of the
Web even now, you often have to boot up your e-mail program and
fire off messages to addresses you discover while browsing Web
pages. At some point, a Web browser will probably need to include
a strong e-mail feature if it is to be considered complete.

<P>
There are two groups active on the network. They are the servers
offering the information on the one hand and the clients acquiring
the information on the other.
<P>
<B>Servers </B>The servers offer information through server software.
The information offered depends on the server's objective. The
objectives may range from scientific or commercial objects to
pure entertainment.
<P>
<B>Clients </B>The client acquires the information offered by
the server. In this respect, the client can choose for him/herself
the software which he/she downloads. In a network within a company,
this will often be the software which he/she needs to be able
to do the work (word processor, spreadsheet, etc.). On the Internet,
information may vary from information on certain scientific projects
to information on a particular football-club. To be able to download
the information from the Internet, the client needs specific software.
This software is called browsers. There are already many different
types of browsers available. Two will be discussed here, i.e.
Mosaic and Netscape.

<P>
Mosaic translates HTML pages on the Net into pages which are easy
to read for the user. By typing a URL address at the top, you
go to a particular page. If the server is accessible, the page
is downloaded. As the number of images increases, downloading
will take longer. Links to other pages are made clearly visible.
In the picture below, the links are shown by the blue text. Simply
clicking on the links switches you to another page. It is possible
to configure different types of viewers for the pertinent MIME
types and extensions (see also elsewhere in this report). When
Mosaic is downloading a page, it is indicated by a globe at top
right on the screen and a mosaic bar at bottom right on the screen.
Here is a picture of the program including the Mosaic home page.

<P>
The viewers are an important part of a browser. Much information
available via the WWW cannot be shown directly by the browser
on the screen. This mainly relates to graphical and moving images
as well as sound fragments. These files require special viewers
to show the information. In principle, the browser can tell from
the MIME type and the extension of the file which is the associated
viewer.
<P>
Most files found on the World Wide Web have a MIME (Multiple Internet
Mail Extension) type. A MIME type defines the type of file. For
example, plain text, image files, movie files, audio files, etc.
<P>
The extension also indicates which type of file it is.
<P>
Below is a short overview of the extensions and associated viewers:
<UL>
<LI>wav soundrecorder/mediaplayer
<LI>avi mediaplayer
<LI>mpg mpegplayer
<LI>au audioplayer
<LI>gif coreldraw/thumbs
</UL>

<P>
It is important that the browser is configured properly, i.e.
that the browser 'knows' which file is to be played with which
viewer. If the browser does not know what to do with a particular
file, the browser usually asks whether the file is to be saved
or whether a viewer is to be selected for the file. In the latter
case, it is still possible to configure a viewer.

<P>
SGML (Standard Generalised Mark-up Language) is a standard for
describing mark-up languages. DTD (Document Type Definition) is
a specific mark-up language, written using SGML. Hyper Text Mark-up
Language is a SGML DTD. In practical terms, HTML is a collection
of styles (indicated by mark-up tags) that define the various
components of a World-Wide-Web document.
<P>
HTML documents are in ASCII text format and can be created using
any text editor. You can preview a document in progress with a
Web browser. Open it with the Open Local command under the File
menu. After you edit the source HTML file, save the changes. Return
to the browser and reload the document. The changes are reflected
in the on screen display.
<P>
Here is a example of a minimal HTML document:
<P>
&lt;TITLE&gt; The simplest HTML example &lt;/TITLE&gt;
<P>
&lt;H1&gt; This is a level-one heading &lt;/H1&gt;
<P>
Welcome to the world of HTML.
<P>
This is one paragraph. &lt;P&gt;
<P>
And this is a second. &lt;P&gt;
<P>
HTML uses mark-up tags to tell the Web browser how to display
the text. The above examples uses:
<P>
The &lt;TITLE&gt; tag (and corresponding &lt;/TITLE&gt;tag), which
specifies the title of the document.
<P>
The &lt;H1&gt; header tag (and corresponding &lt;/H1&gt;)
<P>
The &lt;P&gt; paragraph-separator tag
<P>
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (&lt;), (a 'less than'
symbol to mathematicians), followed by name of the tag and closed
by a right angular bracket (&gt;). Tags are usually paired, e.g.
&lt;H1&gt; and &lt;/H1&gt;. The ending tag looks just like the
starting tag except a slash (/) precedes the text within the brackets.
In the example, &lt;H1&gt; tells the Web browser to start formatting
a level-one heading; &lt;/H1&gt; tells the browser that the heading
is complete.
<P>
The primary exception to the pairing rule is the &lt;P&gt; tag.
There is no such thing as &lt;/P&gt;.
<P>
HTML is not case sensitive. &lt;title&gt; is equivalent to &lt;TITLE&gt;
or &lt;TiTle&gt;.

</A><A NAME="bmt"></A>4.2 Basic Mark-up Tags</H2>

<P>
<B>Title</B>
<P>
Every HTML document should have a title. A title is generally
displayed separately from the document and is used primarily for
document identification in other contexts (e.g., a WAIS search).
Choose about half a dozen words that describe the document's purpose.
<P>
<B>Headings</B>
<P>
HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1
being most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or
bolder fonts than normal body text. The first heading in each
document should be tagged &lt;H1&gt;. The syntax of the heading
is:
<P>
&lt;Hy&gt; Text of heading &lt;/Hy&gt;
<P>
(Where y is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level of the
heading.)
<P>
<B>Title versus heading</B>
<P>
In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title.
For multi-part documents, the text of the first heading should
be suitable for a reader who is already browsing related information
(e.g., a chapter title), while the title tag should identify the
document in a wider context (e.g., include both the book title
and the chapter title, although this can sometimes become overly
long).
<P>
<B>Paragraphs</B>
<P>
Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in
HTML files aren't significant. Word wrapping can occur at any
point in your source file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into
a single space. ( There are couple of exceptions; space following
a &lt;P&gt; or &lt;Hy&gt; tag, for example, is ignored.)

</A><A NAME="ltod"></A>4.3 Linking to Other Documents</H2>

<P>
The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link regions
of text (and also images) to another document. The browser highlights
these regions (usually with colour and/or underlines) to indicate
that they are hypertext links (often shortened to hyperlinks or
simply links).
<P>
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is &lt;A&gt;, with stands
for anchor. To include an anchor in your document:
<OL>
<LI>Start the anchor with &lt;A. (There's a space after A.)
<LI>Specify the document that's being pointed to by entering the
parameter HREF='filename' followed by a closing right angle bracket:&gt;
<LI>Enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the
current document.
<LI>Enter the ending anchor tag:&lt;/A&gt;
</OL>

<P>
Here is an sample hypertext reference:
<P>
&lt;A HREF='MainStats.html'&gt;Main&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
This entry makes the word 'Main' the hyperlink to the document
MainStats.html, which is in the same directory as the first document.
You can link to documents in other directories by specifying the
relative path from the current document to the linked document.
For example, a link to a file NJStats.html located in the sub-directory
AtlanticStates would be:
<P>
&lt;A HREF='AtlanticStates/NJStats.html'&gt;New Jersey&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
These are calls relative links. You can also use the absolute
path name of the file if you wish. Path names use the standard
UNIX syntax.
<P>
<B>Relative Links Versus Absolute Path names</B>
<P>
In general, you should use relative links, because
<OL>
<LI>You have less to type.
<LI>It's easier to move a group of documents to another location,
because the relative path names will still be valid.
</OL>

<P>
However, use absolute path names when linking to documents that
are not directly related. For example, consider a group of documents
that compromise a user manual. Links within this group should
be relative links. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference
to related software) should be use full path names. This way,
if you move the user manual to a different directory, none of
the links would have to be updated.
<P>
<B>Uniform Resource Locator</B>
<P>
The World-Wide-Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify
the location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type
of resource being accessed (e.g., gopher, WAIS), the address of
the server, and the location of the file. The syntax is:
<P>
scheme://host.domain[.port]/path/filename
<P>
where scheme is one of
<P>
file
<P>
a file on your local system, or a file on an anonymous FTP server
<P>
http
<P>
a file on a World-Wide-Web server
<P>
gopher
<P>
a file on a gopher server
<P>
WAIS
<P>
a file on a WAIS server
<P>
news
<P>
an Usenet news group
<P>
telnet
<P>
a connection to a Telnet-based service
<P>
The port number can generally be omitted. (That means unless someone
tells you otherwise, leave it out.)
<P>
<B>Links to Specific Sections in Other Documents</B>
<P>
Anchors can also be used to move to a particular section in a
document. Suppose you wish to set a link from document A and a
specific section in document B. (Call this file documentB.html)
First you need to set up a named anchor in document B. For example,
to set up an anchor named 'Jabberwocky' to document B, enter
<P>
Here's &lt;A NAME = 'Jabberwocky'&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;
<P>
Now when you create the link in document A, include not only the
filename, but also the named anchor, separated by a hash mark(#).
<P>
This is my &lt;A HREF = 'documentB.html#Jabberwocky'&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;
to document B.
<P>
Now clicking on the word 'link' in document A sends the reader
directly to the words 'some text' in document B.
<P>
<B>Links to Specific Sections within the Current Document</B>
<P>
The technique is exactly the same except the filename is omitted.
<P>
For example, to link to the Jabberwocky anchor from within the
same file (Document B), use
<P>
This is &lt;A HREF = '#Jabberwocky'&gt;Jabberwocky link&lt;/A&gt;
from within Document.
<P>
<B>Links to Specific Sections Within the Current Document</B>
<P>
The technique is exactly the same except the filename is omitted.
<P>
For example, to link to the Jabberwocky anchor from within the
same file (Document B), use
<P>
This is &lt;A HREF = '#Jabberwocky'&gt;Jabberwocky link&lt;/A&gt;
from within Document

<P>
The preceding is sufficient to produce simple HTML documents.
For more complex documents, HTML has tags for several type of
lists, pre-formatted sections, extended quotations, character
formatting, and other items.
<P>
<B>Lists</B>
<P>
HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists.
<P>
<B>Unnumbered Lists</B>
<P>
To make an unnumbered list,
<P>
1. Start with an opening list &lt;UL&gt; tag.
<P>
2. Enter the &lt;LI&gt; tag followed by the individual item. (No
closing &lt;/LI&gt; tag is needed.)
<P>
3. End with a closing list &lt;/UL&gt; tag.
<P>
Below an example two-item list:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; apples
<P>
&lt;LI&gt;
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
The output is
<P>
apples
<P>
bananas
<P>
the &lt;LI&gt; items can contain multiple paragraphs. Just separate
the paragraphs with the &lt;P&gt; paragraph tags.
<P>
<B>Numbered Lists</B>
<P>
A numbered list (also called an ordered list, from which the tag
name derives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses
&lt;OL&gt; instead of &lt;UL&gt;. The items are tagged using the
same &lt;LI&gt; tag. The following HTML code
<P>
&lt;OL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; oranges
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; peaches
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; grapes
<P>
&lt;/OL&gt;
<P>
produces this formatted output:
<P>
1 oranges
<P>
2 peaches
<P>
3 grapes
<P>
<B>Definition Lists</B>
<P>
A definition list usually consists of alternating a term (abbreviated
as DT) and a definition (abbreviated as DD). Web browsers generally
format the definition on a new line.
<P>
the following is an example of a definition list:
<P>
&lt;DL&gt;
<P>
&lt;DT&gt; NCSA
<P>
&lt;DD&gt; NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
is located on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
NCSA is one of the participant in the National MetaCenter for
Computational Science and Engineering.
<P>
&lt;DT&gt; Cornell Theory Center
<P>
&lt;DD&gt; CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University
in Ithaca, New York. CTC is another participant in the National
Metacenter for Computational Science and Engineering.
<P>
&lt;/DL&gt;
<P>
The output looks like:
<P>
NCSA
<P>
NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, is
located on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
NCSA is one of the participant in the National MetaCenter for
Computational Science and Engineering.
<P>
Cornell Theory Center
<P>
CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca,
New York. CTC is another participant in the National Metacenter
for Computational Science and Engineering.
<P>
the &lt;DT&gt; and &lt;DD&gt; entries can contain multiple paragraphs
(separated by &lt;P&gt; paragraph tags), lists, or other definition
information.
<P>
<B>Nested Lists</B>
<P>
Lists can be arbitrarily nested, although in practice you probably
should limit the nesting to three levels. You can also have number
of paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single item.
<P>
An example nested list:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; A few New England states:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; Vermont
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; New Hampshire
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; One Midwestern state:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt; Michigan
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
The nested list is displayed as
<P>
A few New England states:
<P>
Vermont
<P>
New Hampshire
<P>
One Midwestern state:
<P>
Michigan
<P>
<B>Pre-formatted Text</B>
<P>
Use the &lt;PRE&gt; tag (which stands for 'pre-formatted') to
generate text in a fixed-width font and cause, new lines, and
tabs to be significant. (That is, multiple spaces are displayed
as multiple spaces, and lines break in the same locations as in
the source HTML file.). This is useful for program listings. For
example, the following lines
<P>
&lt;PRE&gt;
<P>
#! /bin/csh
<P>
cd $SCR
<P>
cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
<P>
cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile
<P>
fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f
<P>
mya.out
<P>
cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile
<P>
rm *
<P>
&lt;/PRE&gt;
<P>
display as
<P>
#! /bin/csh
<P>
cd $SCR
<P>
cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
<P>
cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile
<P>
fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f
<P>
mya.out
<P>
cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile
<P>
rm *
<P>
Hyperlinks can be used within &lt;PRE&gt; sections. You should
avoid using other HTML tags within &lt;PRE&gt; sections, however.
<P>
Note that because &lt;,&gt; and &amp; have special meaning in
HTML, you have to use their escape sequences (&amp;lt, &amp;gt
and &amp;amp, respectively) to enter these characters. See the
section Special Characters for more information.
<P>
<B>Extended Quotations</B>
<P>
Use the &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; tag to include quotations in a separate
block on the screen. Most browsers generally indent to separate
it from surrounding text.
<P>
An example:
<P>
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
<P>
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American
dream. &lt;P&gt;
<P>
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be
self-evident that all men are created equal. &lt;P&gt;
<P>
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
<P>
The result is:
<P>
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American
dream.
<P>
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed.
<P>
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created
equal.
<P>
<B>Addresses</B>
<P>
The &lt;ADDRESS&gt; tag is generally used to specify the author
of a document and a means of containing the author (e.g., an e-mail
address). This is usually the last item in a file.
<P>
For example, the last line of the on-line version of a guide is
<P>
&lt;ADDRESS&gt;
<P>
A beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu
<P>
&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
<P>
The result is
<P>
A beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu

</A><A NAME="cf"></A>4.5 Character Formatting</H2>

<P>
You can code individual words or sentences with special styles.
There are two types of styles: logical and physical. Logical styles
tag text according to its meaning, while physical styles specify
the specific appearance of a section. For example, in the preceding
sentence, the words 'logical styles' was tagged as a 'definition'.
The same effect (formatting those words in italics), could have
been achieved via a different tag that specifies merely 'put these
words in italics. '
<P>
<B>Physical Versus Logical: Use Logical Styles When Possible</B>
<P>
If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the
screen, why are there both? We devolve, for a couple of paragraphs,
into the philosophy of SGML, which can be assumed in a Zen-like
mantra: 'Trust your browser.'
<P>
In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation.
Thus SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but
does not specify that the level-one heading should be, for instance,
24-point bold times centred on the top a page. The advantage of
this approach (it's similar in concept to style sheets in many
word processors) is that if you decide to change level-one headings
to be 20-point left-justified Helvetica, all you have to do is
change the definition of the level-one heading in the presentation
device (i.e., your World-Wide-Web browser).
<P>
The other advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce
consistency in your documents. It's easier to tag something as
&lt;H1&gt; than to remember that level-one headings are 24-point
bold Times or whatever. the name is true for characters styles.
For example, consider the &lt;STRONG&gt; tag. Most browsers render
it in bold text. However, it is possible that a reader would prefer
that these sections be displayed in red instead. Logical styles
offer this flexibility.
<P>
<B>Logical Styles</B>
<P>
&lt;DFN&gt;
<P>
For a word being defined. Typically displayed in italics.
<P>
&lt;EM&gt;
<P>
For emphasis. Typically displayed in italics.
<P>
&lt;CITE&gt;
<P>
For titles of books, films, etc. Typically displayed in italics.
<P>
&lt;CODE&gt;
<P>
For snippets of computer code. Displayed in a fixed-with font.
<P>
&lt;KBD&gt;
<P>
For user keyboard entry. Should be displayed in a bold fixed-width
font, but many browsers render it in the plain fixed-width font.
<P>
&lt;SAMP&gt;
<P>
For computer status messages. Displayed in a fixed-width font.
<P>
&lt;STRONG&gt;
<P>
For strong emphasis. Typically displayed in bold.
<P>
&lt;VAR&gt;
<P>
For a 'meta-syntactic' variable, where the user is to replace
the variable width a specific instance.
<P>
<B>Physical Styles</B>
<P>
&lt;B&gt;
<P>
bold text
<P>
&lt;I&gt;
<P>
italic text
<P>
&lt;TT&gt;
<P>
typewriter text, e.g. fixed-width font.
<P>
<B>Special Characters</B>
<P>
<U>Escape Sequences</U>
<P>
Four characters of the ASCII character set have special meaning
within HTML and therefore cannot be used 'as is' in text.
<P>
To use one of these characters in an HTML document, you must enter
its escape sequence instead:
<P>
&amp;lt; the escape sequence for &lt;
<P>
&amp;gt; the escape sequence for &gt;
<P>
&amp;amp; the escape sequence for &amp;
<P>
&amp;quot; the escape sequence for '
<P>
Additional escape sequences support accented characters. A full
list of supported characters can be found at CERN.
<P>
<U>Forced Line Breaks</U>
<P>
The &lt;BR&gt; tag forces a line break with no extra spaces between
lines. (By contrast, most browsers format the &lt;P&gt; paragraph
tag with an additional blank line to more clearly indicate the
beginning of a new paragraph). One use of &lt;BR&gt; is in formatting
addresses:
<P>
TNO&lt;BR&gt;
<P>
Lange Kleiweg 5&lt;BR&gt;
<P>
Rijswijk&lt;BR&gt;
<P>
The Netherlands&lt;BR&gt;
<P>
<U>Horizontal Rules</U>
<P>
The &lt;HR&gt; tag produces a horizontal line the width of the
browser window.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc328985153"></A><A NAME="_Toc328985320"></A><A NAME="_Toc328985362">
</A><A NAME="_Toc328985483"></A><A NAME="_Toc328989798"></A><A NAME="_Toc328991259">

</A><A NAME="images"></A>4.6 Images</H2>

<P>
<B>In-line Images</B>
<P>
Most Web browsers can display in-line images (that is, images
next to text) that are in X Bit-Map (XBM) or GIF format. Each
image takes time to process and slows down the initial display
of the document, so generally you should not include too many
or overly large images.
<P>
To include an in-line image, use
<P>
&lt;IMG SRC-image_URL&gt;
<P>
Where image_URL is the URL of the image file. The syntax for IMG
SRC URLs is identical to that used in an anchor HREF. If the image
file is a GIF file, then the filename part of image_URL<B> </B>must
end with .gif. Filenames of X Bit-Map images must end with .xbm.
<P>
With align the position can be given.
<P>
&lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC=image_URL&gt;
<P>
<B>Alternate Text for Browsers That Can't Display Images</B>
<P>
Some WWW browsers, primarily that run on VT100 terminals, cannot
display images. The ALT option allows you to specify text to be
displayed when an image cannot be. For example:
<P>
&lt;IMG SRC = 'UpArrow.gif' ALT = 'Up' &gt;
<P>
Where UpArrow.gif is the picture of an upward pointing arrow.
With NCSA MOSAIC and other graphics-capable viewers, the user
sees the up arrow graphic. With a VT100 browser, such as lynx,
the user sees the word 'UP.'
<P>
<B>External Images, Sounds and Animations</B>
<P>
You may want to have an image open as a separate document when
a user activates a link on either a word or a smaller, in-line
version of the image included in your document. This is considered
an external image and is useful if you do not wish to slow down
the loading of the main document with large in-line images.
<P>
To include a reference to an external image, use
<P>
&lt;A HREF = image_URL&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
Use the same syntax is for links to external animations and sounds.
The only difference is the file extension of the linked file.
For example,
<P>
&lt;A HREF='QuickTimeMovie.mov'&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types
and there extension are:
<P>
File type Extension
<P>
plain text (ASCII) .txt
<P>
HTML document .HTML
<P>
Gif image .gif
<P>
TIFF image .tiff
<P>
XBM bit-map image .xbm
<P>

<P>
AU sound .au
<P>

<P>
<B>Avoid Overlapping Tags</B>
<P>
Consider this snippet of HTML:
<P>
&lt;B&gt; This is an example of &lt;DFN&gt; overlapping &lt;/B&gt;
HTML tags. &lt;/DFN&gt;
<P>
The word 'overlapping' is contained within both the &lt;B&gt;
and &lt;DFN&gt; tags. How does the browser format it? you won't
know until you look, and different browsers will likely react
differently. In general, avoid overlapping tags.
<P>
<B>Embed Anchors and Character Tags, But Nothing Else</B>
<P>
It is acceptable to embed anchors within another HTML element:
<P>
&lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF = 'Destination.html'&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;
<P>
do not embed a heading or another HTML element within an anchor:
<P>
&lt;A HREF = 'Destination.html'&gt;
<P>
&lt;H1&gt; My heading &lt;/H1&gt;
<P>
&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
Although most browsers currently handle this example, it is forbidden
by the official HTML and HTML+ specifications, and will not work
with future browsers.
<P>
Character tags modify the appearance of other tags:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt;
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/LI&gt;
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
However, avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For
example, it is tempting to embed a heading within a list, in order
to make the font size larger:
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading &lt;/H1&gt;
<P>
&lt;UL&gt;
<P>
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt;
<P>
&lt;/UL&gt;
<P>
Although some browsers, such as NCSA Mosaic, format this construct
quite nicely, it is unpredictable (because it is undefined) what
other browsers will do. For compatibility with other browsers,
avoid these kinds of constructs.
<P>
What's the difference between embedding a &lt;B&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt;
tag as opposed to embedding a &lt;H1&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt;?
This is again a question of SGML. The semantic of &lt;H1&gt; is
that it's main heading of a document and that it should be followed
by the content of the document. Thus it doesn't make sense to
find a &lt;H1&gt; within a list.
<P>
Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. You
might expect that
<P>
&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
<P>
would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other
browsers interpret only the innermost tag (here, the italics).
<P>
<B>Check Your Links</B>
<P>
When an &lt;IMG&gt; tag points at an image that does not exist,
a dummy image is substituted. When this happens, make sure that
the referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has
the correct information in the URL, and that the file permission
is set appropriately (world-readable).

</A><A NAME="ia"></A>4.8 MS Internet Assistant</H2>

<P>
MS Internet assistant (IA) is an important tool in creating HTML
pages. The package is integrated with their word processor Word.
As the package is still being developed, work is done with a 16-bit
b&egrave;ta version. It is a drawback, however, that it is necessary
to use also a 16-bit version of Word and not a 32-bit version.
<P>
In order to gain a good impression of the package, the important
features of the package will be explained. Not too many details
will be given. In fact, with this package, it is no longer necessary
for users to learn the HTML format. It is very easy to generate
hyperlinks and HTML designations.
<P>
IA contains information for the most popular Internet protocols
(HTTP, FTP, Gopher). When editing an HTML document within Word,
it is very easy to shift to browsing within Internet.
<P>
When using IA, you will use styles, as usual. After you are finished
with the document, these styles are converted to HTML format.
<P>
Documents created with IA are fully supported by browsers on the
World-Wide-Web which support version 2.0 of HTML.
<P>
When creating hyperlinks, there are 3 types of links:
<UL>
<LI>Hyperlinks to URL.
</UL>

<P>
Make a link between your own document and another document on
the WEB.
<UL>
<LI>Relative links.
</UL>

<P>
Make a link between different documents for which you yourself
have authorised publication as a set on the Web.
<UL>
<LI>Links in a local Web.
</UL>

<P>
This is used when you authorise a set of documents for use on
a local network. So, this is some kind of 'local Web'.
<P>
IA uses its own templates. When switching between editing and
browsing, IA loads automatically another template. While you are
browsing, IA fixes the WEBVIEW template to any document you jump
to. You <B>cannot</B> edit the document that is fixed to WEBVIEW.
However, if it is a special form, you can fill it out.
<P>
To be able to modify a Web document, you must switch out of the
Web Browse view. After finishing modifying the document and before
saving it, you link it to HTML.DOT (to make a document suitable
for posting to the Web) or you make a link again to the WEBVIEW.DOT
template (to use a Word document in the Web Browse view, for example
DEFAULT.DOC).
<P>
You cannot modify a Web document and then link it again to the
Web server, unless you yourself are the Web master of the server.
In order to save changes you have made to a Web document, you
must save it on the local drive.
<P>
When switching to the HTML edit, IA links the HTML template. This
template simplifies the generation of HTML documents and facilitates
the general HTML tasks such as inserting hyperlinks.
<P>
At moments when you need all possibilities of Word or perhaps
your own macros, you can choose templates from the file menu or
select NORMAL.DOT. Your normal working environment (menu items,
tool bars, etc.) will be restored. Be sure, however, that you
link the document to the HTML or WEBVIEW document prior to saving
it. Be also aware that any formatting you would do to an HTML
document, will be lost when the file has been reloaded within
Word.
<P>
The following things will be lost when converting a Word document
to HTML:
<UL>
<LI>annotations
<LI>borders
<LI>character formatting (e.g. subscript, dropped caps, etc.)
<LI>drawing layer elements
<LI>embedded graphics
<LI>foot-notes and end-notes
<LI>header and footer
<LI>indented paragraphs
<LI>index entries
<LI>OLE objects
<LI>revision marks
<LI>shading
<LI>tabs
<LI>TOC entries
</UL>

<P>
If you want to see the HTML source of a Web document, take the
following steps:-
<OL>
<LI>If the document has been loaded in the Web Browse view, choose
save from the file menu. Be sure that the HTML converter has been
selected in the Safe File As Type box.
<LI>In the filename box, type the name you want to assign. Choose
OK.
<LI>From the menu, choose close.
<LI>From the menu, choose open. Select the Confirm Conversion
check box.
<LI>In the Convert File dialogue box, choose Text Only and then
choose OK.
</OL>

<P>
To explain the goal of GEM we will first explain what Engineering-analysis
stands for, defining in fact the context for GEM. Each industrial
product is assumed to go through some life cycle, consisting of
different life cycle phases. These phases are relevant for all
kind of product types. The following main phases are often distinguished:-
<UL>
<LI>Planning
<LI>Engineering
<LI>Process Planning
<LI>Production
<LI>Utilisation &amp; Maintenance
</UL>

<P>
When down-scoping to Engineering, we see that this is in general
a highly iterative process involving Design &amp; Analysis activities.
In the GEM project we concentrate on the Analysis activities,
in this context referred to as Engineering_analysis.
<P>
Engineering_analysis is further decomposed into the following
sub-processes:-
<UL>
<LI>Analysis-modelling
</UL>

<P>
The design information is taken and a suitable product definition
or representation is derived for Engineering_analysis. Usually
only a part of the total shape is selected, details are deleted
and extra information like load cases are added or derived from
the design data. Example: The 'dead weight' load of an asphalt
layer on a viaduct deck will be derived from its geometry and
material property information.
<UL>
<LI>Mesh Generation
</UL>

<P>
The analysis model is discretized in some way (i.e. using finite
elements), to prepare for the actual analysis. This discretization
is, of course, very much dependent of the product data, its environment
and the planned analysis type.
<UL>
<LI>Analysis
</UL>

<P>
Now, the actual analysis takes place. This can be any linear or
non-linear type of analysis like elasticity, plasticity, heat
transfer, thermal radiation etc. time-dependent (transient) or
not (static or steady-state).
<UL>
<LI>Post-processing
</UL>

<P>
The amount of resulting raw analysis results is often enormous.
In post-processing the results are transformed in such a way that
they become useful for human interpretation (i.e. via visualisation)
or feedback to earlier phases in the process.
<P>
The aim of GEM is to integrate all the software applications relevant
in the different phases in Engineering-analysis by exchange of
results in an open and standardised way (involving the ISO STEP
standard). This will improve both efficiency and quality of the
analysis activities and thereby of the outcomes of these activities.
<P>
Not one software vendor can provide an industrial end-user the
optimal solution for all their engineering problems. This effect
will be strengthened by the trend of specialisation where vendors
are more and more concentrating on their core-business. Multi-vendor
solutions, integrated via open standards like ISO STEP are therefor
the next step. For developers it means that open inter-operability
via STEP-compatibility is one of the critical success factors
in the near future.
<P>
The final goal of GEM is to provide the European Industry with
the right methods, tools and models to attain this inter-operability
and to take advantage of the benefits of this approach as early
as possible.
<P>
The aim of the GEM project is to improve the efficiency of European
industry by enabling engineering analysis methods such as FEA
or CFD to be used more effectively within the design process throughout
a product's life. To achieve this aim, the following objectives
have been set:-
<UL>
<LI>To develop a Generic Engineering Analysis Model which can
be used for the exchange, data sharing and archival of engineering
analysis models. The GEM will be general enough to support a range
of industrial applications, a variety of design and analysis methodologies,
and facilitate the use of analysis results in the design model.
</UL>

<P>

<IMG SRC="BUILDING.GIF" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
Example of a computer model
<UL>
<LI>To demonstrate the use of GEM in the solution of industrial
problems.
<LI>To contribute towards the development of international standards
in the definition and transfer of engineering analysis models.
<LI>To make use of existing tools and standards such as STEP,
identifying their limitations in the context of supporting the
concept of GEM.
<LI>To disseminate the project results, enabling European Industry
to achieve a lead in the exploitation of these techniques.
</UL>

<P>
GEM will allow engineering-analysis data such as loading and materials
properties to be associated to the geometry model, independent
of the analysis discretisation. It will also allow reuse of results
from one analysis by associating them with the geometry model.
<P>
Work carried out within the project will include:-
<UL>
<LI>A review of data Model requirements, modelling methodologies,
geometric model types and implementation techniques.
<LI>Definition of relevant demonstration examples from industry.
<LI>Specification of the Generic Engineering analysis data Model
by first classifying the data types which can be employed in the
analysis process and then defining the way which results of analysis
can be in a general manner for reuse as input to other processes.
<LI>Implementation of GEM into a range of CAD, analysis and modelling
software.
<LI>Demonstrations of GEM applied to industrial problems.
<LI>Dissemination of results of the work, providing a guide for
end-users of the GEM model and awareness seminars to provide insight
into the potential of this development.

<IMG SRC="ORGANI.GIF" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
This is the general 'ESPRIT' project organisation.
<P>
GEM has five Work Packages each with their own specific tasks.
In the first four work packages the actual work is performed.
The fifth Work package deals with Project Management. We will
now give a short overview of each Work Package.
<P>
<B>Work Package 1 ( Manager - Principia)</B>
<P>
The review and description of basic knowledge and common tools
will lead to a general software environment and knowledge framework.
The identification of the global process and data within GEM,
in combination with the definition of the demonstration examples,
will set the scope for the following work packages.
<UL>
<LI>Task 1100. Review Data Model Requirements ( Leader - Principia)
<LI>Task 1200. Review Modelling Methodologies ( Leader - TNO)
<LI>Task 1300. Review Geometric Model ( Leader - LMR)
<LI>Task 1400. Review of Implementation Techniques ( Leader -
FEGS)
<LI>Task 1500. Definition of Demonstration Examples ( Leader -
Dornier)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Work Package 2 ( Manager - Femsys)</B>
<P>
The goal of this work package is to develop the Generic Engineering
Analysis data Model (GEM). To achieve this the work has been divided
into 4 tasks. Although tasks 2200 and 2300 are dependent on task
2100 they are all scheduled to start together. Regular workshops
will be held to ensure the work being done will lead to a consistent
model. It is important to have strong interaction between tasks
2200 and 2300 so that the mathematical representation of results
developed conform with the representation of loading so that the
reuse of results can be done effectively.
<UL>
<LI>Task 2100. Abstraction of Technical Data (Leader - Framasoft+CSI)
<LI>Task 2200. Classification of Technical Data ( Leader - CISIGRAPH)
<LI>Task 2300. Representation for reuse of results (Leader - Femsys)
<LI>Task 2400. Definition of the GEM. (Leader - Caesar Systems)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Work Package 3 ( Manager - TNO)</B>
<P>
In this work package the GEM will be implemented to provide a
test bed and validation for the defined model and thus give feedback
to work package 2, and to highlight the advantages of GEM application
in CAE by at least two demonstration examples. A common tool kit
for the actual implementation of GEM will be specified and built
in tasks 3100 and 3200. The tool-kit will consist of selected
components available outside the project (reviewed in task 1400)
and from required additional components, developed in task 3200.
<P>
The implementation itself must be enable easy and efficient exchange,
elaboration, addition and retrieval of GEM data by different software
components in CAE. These software components include CAD, pre-processing,
analysis and post-processing. Each connection between two of these
components is covered by a separate task. Task 3300 will connect
CAD and pre-processing, task 3400 will connect pre-processing
and analysis and task 3500 will support reuse of analysis results.
During implementation the interaction and co-operation between
participants is regulated by clustering them around specific tasks
and examples.
<P>
The implementation of the prototype will have large interaction
with the model definition in work package 2. Therefore the implementation
will evolve partly concurrent with task 2400. The demonstration
in task 3600 are based on the definitions in task 1500 and will
validate and demonstrate the practical use of GEM for user-defined
examples.
<P>
The demonstration will interact with the implementation by implicit
checking its completeness, robustness, efficiency, flexibility
and user-friendliness.
<UL>
<LI>Task 3100. Implementation Requirements ( Leader FEGS)
<LI>Task 3200. Common Tools Implementation ( Leader FEGS)
<LI>Task 3300. Implementation of software to define GEM ( Leader
CISIGRAPH)
<LI>Task 3400. Implementation of GEM to analysis (Leader TNO)
<LI>Task 3500. Implementation of s/w for reuse of results (Leader
FEMSYS)
<LI>Task 3600. User specified problem ( Leader Centro Ricerche
Fiat)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Work Package 4 ( Manager - GfS)</B>
<P>
This work package provides the communication between the project
and the outer world. It uses results from work packages 1,2 and
3. Dissemination must go both to people who are potential users
of the results of the project and to the standardisation process.
Rather than wait to the end of the project, information on the
Generic Engineering Analysis Model is disseminated throughout
the project. A plan of awareness exercise is to be defined. This
will also pay regard to the STEP activities going on in parallel,
both in ISO and in other EU projects, and take advantage of their
dissemination activities.
<P>
While each work package is carried out a dissemination plan takes
care of the awareness of the projects in the technical community.
Both software developers and industrial users throughout the EU
shall be
<P>
given the opportunity to learn what the project is doing and producing.
<P>
Press releases, demonstrations, seminars and workshops are integrated
in the project and related to the work packages. At the end of
the project a final report will be issued reviewing the activities
and results of the work package.
<UL>
<LI>Task 4100. Guide for end users ( Leader GfS)
<LI>Task 4200. Awareness seminar development ( Leader NAFEMS)
<LI>Task 4300. Presentation of seminars ( Leader NAFEMS)
<LI>Task 4400. Co-ordination with standardisation process ( Leader
GfS)
</UL>

<P>
The WWW-site development described in this deliverable is also
one of the outcomes of task 4100.
<P>
<B>Work Package 5 (Manager - NAFEMS)</B>
<P>
'Work Package' and 'Project Task' describe activities carried
out jointly by partners and are as described in the Project proposal
and subsequent technical annexe. 'Task' also refers to an individual
partner's activity within the context of a Project Task. Each
partner will define a set of Tasks necessary to carry out his
contribution to the project tasks in which he is involved. A manager
for each work package (WPM) has been agreed at a Partner's meeting
together with leaders for each project task (TL). A project manager
(PM) has been agreed. Each partner will appoint a representative
to sit on the project management board (PMB) which will be shared
by the PM. A technical steering committee (TSC) will be formed
from WPMs and amplified by TLs of tasks which are active at the
time of their meetings. The TSC chairman will be appointed for
a fixed time by the PMB from individuals with the appropriate
experience to oversee the activities current at the time.

</A><A NAME="tnogem"></A>5.5 The Role of TNO in GEM</H2>

<P>
In WP1, TNO is responsible for the ISO STEP-based methodology
to integrate engineering- analysis applications. This methodology
is based on years of experience in the area of integration, in
particular to 'product modelling', in many projects and large
(European) research programs. This methodology will be followed
by the other work packages in the execution of their activities.
<P>
In WP2 (GEM specification)TNO will contribute too GEM in the area
of Finite Element Analysis and review of other contributions.
They will also model their DIANA software modules to be integrated
for the 'Dornier Demonstration'. This model, the Application Type
Model (ATM) will form the basis for the development of a translator
and converter to communicate to the GEM model and share information
with the other applications via this model.
<P>
In WP3, TNO will analyse the implementation requirements for GEM
resulting in a GEM Architecture. Based on this Architecture and
STEP Tool-kit evaluation results, a STEP Tool-kit will be recommended
for use within GEM. Once the tool-kit is chosen, the initial WP2
GEM specifications will be implemented and the demonstration examples
for the industrial end-users Dornier and FIAT will be further
elaborated. Based on the integration strategies for the different
applications involved, translators and converters will be developed
(specified and implemented).
<P>
Finally, in WP4 TNO will contribute to the planned seminars and
other GEM promotion activities like the development of brochures
and, of course, the development of this GEM WWW-site.

</A>5.6 The Role of GEM in TNO</H2>

<P>
The main reason for TNO to be involved in the project is clear:
In the near future their software package 'DIANA' should be ISO-STEP
compatible. This means that it should be possible for DIANA to
communicate via the standard GEM model with other design and analysis
applications. For TNO, the GEM project will result in a DIANA
import/export module to read and write data according to the syntax
and semantics specified by the international STEP standard. This
module will, in future, replace many existing direct interfaces,
saving a lot of development and maintenance effort and providing
'plug-and-play' functionality to DIANA end-users.

<P>
<B>Target Audiences</B>
<P>
The site serves two target groups. In general, the information
for the first target group is intended for interested companies
and is to provide, among other things, an introduction to the
GEM project, so that the companies will be able to get a clear
and unambiguous picture of the GEM project. The information for
the second target group is intended for the partners participating
in the project, so that they may have the latest information available
to them.
<P>
<B>Types of Relevant Information</B>
<P>
The information for the interested companies should be of a general
nature. For this, the following items will become available:-
<P>
Introduction to GEM. There must be provided an introduction to
GEM, containing a clear description of the objective of GEM.
<P>
Introduction of the partners. There must be provided an introduction
of the partners participating in the GEM project.
<P>
Current results. The information for GEM partners will be the
same as that for the interested companies, with one important
addition, i.e. the results of the GEM project. This relates to
up-to-date results in the form of tables and documents. Since
this information will sometimes be of a confidential nature and
be intended only for partners participating in the GEM project,
such information must be protected by some security device. This
protection must be provided in such a manner that an authorized
person can download the information from <U>any</U> Internet 
<U>computer</U> with a WWW browser.
<P>
Order forms. If companies or individuals prove to be interested
and wish to be kept informed via leaflets, they can become a member
of a so-called GEM interest group by completing an order form.
Thus, they can gain more information about the GEM project i.a.
via leaflets sent to the companies.
<P>
Relevant links page. There will also be included an HTML page
containing links of WWW sites which are relevant to the GEM project.
<P>
<B>Accessibility</B>
<P>
The information has to be such that it can be downloaded from
any computer connected to the Internet and having the right browsers.
This should also apply to the protected information.
<P>
<B>The GEM WWW site in relation to the rest of the WWW sites.
</B>
<P>
In the field of activity of GEM there are many overlapping areas.
Among those overlapping areas, there will obviously also be WWW
sites. There will be an HTML page, in which it is possible to
jump via links to the most important links relevant to GEM.

</A><A NAME="design"></A>6.2 The GEM-Web Design</H2>

<P>
<B>Structure</B>
<P>
Each HTML page has its own directory. The GEM Home page is found
in the highest directory. There is question of a tree structure,
which means that if you go from the home page to an underlying
page, you move automatically to the lower directory.
<P>
The document files, GIF images, WAV files and AVI files being
used are as much as possible in the directory of the page in which
they are called. GIF images occurring on several pages are located
in a common directory. This directory is directly contained in
the home directory.
<P>
<B>Clickable map</B>
<P>
The home page consists of a clickable map in the form of the GEM
logo. The logo contains text blocks which are connected to a link.
Clicking on the texts makes the connection with the link.
<P>
Problems with the directory pointer.
<P>
It is important that the paths given in the MAP file start with
an http address. If instead of the http address, the absolute
path is given, this will give portability problems later on because
the directory pointer will then remain in the location where the
image map program is started. This means therefore that the relative
paths in the subsequent HTML pages cease to function because these
relative paths are based on the directory containing the HTML
pages. If, however, instead of an absolute address, the http address
is given, the server 'thinks' that another machine is jumped to,
in which case the directory pointer must change as well. If so,
the directory pointer will point to the location of the HTML page,
resulting in properly functioning relative paths.
<P>
At the bottom of the clickable map, the links are also shown by
normal text for browsers which have not yet been set graphically.
<P>
At the very bottom of the page, the version number, the counter,
the editor (+ photo), the company and the e-mail address of the
editor are given, respectively.
<P>
<B>Security</B>
<P>
The information can be protected in two ways. The first method
is to perform a check on the name of the machine from which the
user logs in. This method is not considered because the person
logging in would be machine-dependent. In the second method the
person wanting to log in, is given a watchword. This has the advantage
that the user is not dependent on the machine where he logs in,
but will be able to log in from any machine. So, clearly, the
latter method has been chosen. The security used does not provide
100% watertight protection, but it affords reasonable protection
from this point of view.
<P>
<B>Order form</B>
<P>
The companies logging in can, if they like, fill out an order
form with all details on the company concerned. These data will
be stored in a central file. After processing these data, for
instance a leaflet containing additional information on the GEM
project can be sent to the companies.
<P>
<B>The writing of a script file</B>
<P>
The action to be taken after completing an order form has been
programmed in a script file. A script file is a kind of batch
file that carries out all sorts of actions using the data entered.
Script files may have various objectives. For instance, it is
possible that the data filled out on the order form are transmitted
via E-mail to the right person. It is also possible to write the
data directly to a file. This file will contain all data provided
via order forms.
<P>
Here, the latter case applies, i.e. storing all data in a central
file. To this end, a CGI script file has been downloaded that
has been programmed in Perl. After a few adjustments, it also
worked for the GEM site.
<P>
<B>Page structure</B>
<P>
Each page has a header with under it a thin blue marble-like line.
Under the line, there is usually a text block or a link to an
underlying page. Links can also refer to WAV or AVI files. There
are links that jump to text blocks further on the page. All links
referring to another page contain a GIF image of a button with
the exception of the relevant links that refer to another site.
Clicking on the button or the text connects the page. The partner
information pages all have the same structure. Missing information
is not mentioned (e.g. e-mail address).
<P>
<B>Logos</B>
<P>
At the very top of some pages there is a small logo. For the home
page, a small EU logo has been chosen to emphasize the fact that
GEM is a European project. For partners whose logo was available,
it appears at the top of the information pages of the GEM partners.
It is the intention that all partners will bear a logo.

<B>Three Implementation Platforms Involved</B>
<P>
The choice was made to develop the site on a local server and
to move it later to the TNO WWW Server. Therefor the GEM Web site
we have to distinguish between a local (PC) Development Platform,
an intermediate remote Development Platform (UNIX) and one target
end-user platform, the TNO WWW Server (also UNIX).
<P>
The local Development Platform is used for the actual development
of the site. In this stage the pages are visible only by the TNO
community. This platform is a 'TNO Bouw' PC running Windows NT
3.51. The server software selected is HTTPS of the university
of Edinburgh.
<P>
The intermediate remote platform was used for development and
testing of less standardised WWW-features like clickable maps,
order forms and security measures on a UNIX-platform (to anticipate
the implementation on the final platform which is also UNIX-based).
This server also only accessible within TNO. It was initially
considered to test the site directly on the ATLAS machine, but
that would be too cumbersome. First, there is no software package
that can copy an entire directory structure with the underlying
directories of a Windows NT environment to a UNIX environment.
This means that each directory would have to be moved individually.
This problem could conceivably be solved by 'tarring'. In tarring,
the whole directory structure is packed with the existing files
into one file and subsequently unpacked again. This seemed a reasonable
solution.
<P>
However, there will still be the problem that when changing one
file, this is always to be copied to the ATLAS machine before
the change can be tested. So, this turns out to be quite cumbersome
and entails a lot of work. For this reason, the choice ultimately
made was to make the local PC a server , so that all sorts of
things can be tested directly without having to resort to all
kinds of complicated tricks.
<P>
The TNO WWW Server, is used and maintained by the TNO Head Office
and will be used for the world-wide publishing of the information
for all Internet users including the partners that participate
in the GEM project.

<P>
<B>Going from local PC server to intermediate UNIX server</B>
<P>
Since there are certain things that are different on this server
from those on the ATLAS machine, there are a number of things
to be taken into account when moving from the local PC server
to the ATLAS machine:-
<UL>
<LI>Clickable map
</UL>

<P>
The references in the imagemap.conf must be adapted by the system
manager because he is the only one to have access to this file.
<UL>
<LI>Order forms
</UL>

<P>
It is necessary to write a script file which is subsequently to
be put into the system directory by the system manager.
<UL>
<LI>Security
</UL>

<P>
Certain directories are to be protected by a password. It is the
intention that only GEM partners will be given the password so
that they will be the only ones to have access to this information.
<UL>
<LI>Relative paths
</UL>

<P>
Since, when moving, the absolute paths are different, everything
is to be stated in relative paths, for otherwise moving will take
too much time.
<UL>
<LI>Paths and filenames must be written in capitals
</UL>

<P>
To make HTML documents, Internet assistant of ms was used. This
version was still 16 bits, however, and the 32-bit version was
not yet available. Since IA has been integrated with WORD, a 16-bit
word version was required as well. However, it saved all filenames
in NT in capitals. This (small/capital letters) does not make
any difference to an NT environment. It does make a difference,
however, to a UNIX environment. For this reason capitals were
chosen.
<UL>
<LI>Extension of 4 characters
</UL>

<P>
This also relates to the foregoing. 16-bit word saved everything
with 8 filename letters and an extension of 3 letters. However,
NT and UNIX use 4 characters for the extension. So, this will
be subsequently renamed to extensions with 4 characters.
<P>
The remainder (.gif., .wav, etc.) can just be 3-character extensions.
<P>
<B>Going from intermediate UNIX server to TNO server</B>
<P>
If the test phase on the ATLAS machine proceeds well, the site
can be moved to the UTOPIA.
<UL>
<LI>clickable map.
</UL>

<P>
See Moving from local PC server to ATLAS server.
<UL>
<LI>order forms.
</UL>

<P>
In contrast to the ATLAS server, there is a script directory with
free access, so that this is not a task for the system manager.
<UL>
<LI>security
</UL>

<P>
See Moving from local PC server to ATLAS server.
<P>
Since this is the step from a local server accessible within TNO
only to a server accessible world-wide, it should be taken into
account whether the information it will contain is public. A further
consideration is the fact that it is common knowledge that the
security of the HTML pages is not 100% watertight. Consequently,
highly secret information is not allowed to appear on the UTOPIA.
Less sensitive information (like GEM information classified as
'restricted') may, of course, appear on the UTOPIA.
<UL>
<LI>relative paths.
</UL>

<P>
See Moving from local PC server to ATLAS server.
<UL>
<LI>paths and filenames must be written in capitals.
</UL>

<P>
Only the home page plus the address to the home page are written
in small letters because this is customary on the WWW.
<UL>
<LI>extension of 4 characters
</UL>

<P>
See Moving from local PC server to ATLAS server.
<P>
<B>Agreements</B>
<P>
The HTML editor chosen is Internet assistant of Microsoft because
this was the most stable platform. However, it is a 16-bit version,
which ultimately created the problem that all files were automatically
saved in capitals. As everything will have to be moved to a UNIX-based
system which differentiates between small letters and capitals,
it was agreed to type all paths and filenames in <U>capitals</U>.
Since it is the intention to move everything later to the WWW
server, efforts were made to keep the move to this machine as
simple as possible. In this connection, the following things are
very important.
<P>
1. All paths are given to be <U>relative</U>.
<P>
This is necessary because absolute paths are valid only on the
individual machine and so are worthless at the moment of moving
to the other machine. So, it would take too much time to adapt
the absolute paths. This is why relative paths have been chosen.
<P>
2. The extension of the HTML page should be <U>4 characters</U>.
<P>
It is customary during 'browsing' with, for instance, Netscape
or mosaic to enter 4 characters for the extension of the HTML
page (viz.: .HTML). Since both windows NT and UNIX can handle
4 characters, this does not cause any problems to speak of. The
extension for the gif images and other files have been kept at
a length of <U>3 characters</U>.
<P>
<B>Other problems when moving to another server</B>
<P>
During the transfer from the individual local machine to the WWW
server, it should be taken into account that the clickable map
and the order forms must be adapted. The reason is that the structure
is slightly different for the various servers.
<P>
<B>Keeping data up to date</B>
<P>
It is very important that the data shown are up to date. For,
the GEM partners must be able to work with the latest information.
Consequently, proper accessibility of the server is absolutely
essential to the managers of the GEM site.
<P>
<B>Feedback</B>
<P>
There can be created 3 forms of feedback to check whether the
target groups are satisfied with the information offered, viz.:
<P>
The order forms will contain a box for comments which can be used
to write any comments you may have on the GEM site.
<P>
The home page will contain at the bottom an e-mail address where
companies can sent their reactions.
<P>
It is possible to ascertain how often exactly each page is being
accessed. Action can then be taken on the basis of such information.
If, for example, a particular page is being accessed not often
enough in relation to the other pages, more attention could be
directed to that page by increasing the number of references to
it.

</H2>

<P>
The GEM site is part of the TNO Bouw server. The TNO Bouw server
in its turn is part of the TNO server. So, to visit the GEM site,
it is in principle necessary to first make contact with the TNO
server. Thereupon, from here, you can access the TNO-Bouw server.
By then clicking on interesting projects, you will arrive at the
various projects of TNO Building and Construction Research. By
clicking on the link Esprit Generic Engineering Model Project,
you will get an introduction to the GEM project. At the bottom
of this introduction, there is a link to the GEM site itself.
So, by clicking on this link, you will contact the GEM site.
<P>
In short:
<P>
http://www.tno.nl
<P>
First click on : Institutes
<P>
Then click on : TNO Building and Construction Research
<P>
Then click on : Interesting Projects
<P>
Then click on : Esprit Generic Engineering Model Project
<P>
Finally click on : Website of the GEM Project !
<P>
It is also possible to type the complete URL address of the GEM
site in one operation. You will then get directly to the GEM site:

</A>7. Future Developments</H1>

<P>
<B>Functionality</B>
<P>
The HTML standard and associated tools (client/server software)
is constantly updated and extended. One of the potential extensions
is VRML (Virtual Reality Mark-up Language) which will extend current
multi-media capabilities enabling the definition of virtual 3D
worlds resembling the real world making it easier for people to
find their way in the massive amounts of information on-line.
<P>
Another promising extension is the possibility to attach Behaviour
to the multi-media objects. This object-oriented evolution of
the web will make it possible to also publish and (re-)use software
via the web. There are many applications of this extension. This
technology can i.e. be utilised to make current web sites more
interactive: all object can receive messages from the client and
act upon them in a way prescribed by the server.
<P>
Currently, this technology is promoted by SUN Microsystems by
providing a programming language based on C++: Java, and an associated
client software tool Hot-Java. Because of its portability this
language makes a great combination with the traditionally data-oriented
WWW. Java code can be compiled into intermediate platform-independent
code which is then interpreted by a component of the client software
(which itself is ported to many platforms). This component is
therefore in fact a kind of 'software-viewer'. This way a good
compromise is found between flexibility and portability without
having a software developer to publish any confidential source
code. Developments like Java could drastically influence future
software development enabling distributed development and execution
of object-oriented software over a world-wide heterogeneous multi-platform
network.
<P>
<B>Access</B>
<P>
At the time of writing of this deliverable Cable Television providers
in the Netherlands are starting to provide Internet (and thereby
WWW) access at home. Not only will this result in many more people
accessing the Web but also in a drastic performance improvement.
The Information Highway finally becomes the much talked about
'Information <U>Super</U> Highway' at last !
<P>
<B>Security</B>
<P>
Another 'boost' of the Internet is expected to arise from commercial
exploitation involving also money transactions. Companies like
Microsoft are working hard to improve current infrastructures
which can handle transactions in a more secure way for application
areas such as 'Pay-TV', 'Interactive Television', 'Electronic
Shopping, Banking, Working....' and not to forget Entertainment.
<P>
All these enhancements in Internet/WWW functionality, access and
security will enable more and more companies and/or projects to
exploit Cyberspace by global exchange, sharing and offering of
resources and services. Currently, however without all mentioned
future developments, the WWW has already has proved to be an excellent
medium for people, like i.e. the partners participating in the
GEM project, to share information and work in a more effective
and efficient way together.

Isn't this typical?  Now I work with the stuff, and my own homepage is
still pathetic as ever.  Not that my provider allows CGI scripts or
anything, so I'll have to find one that does, or do it all in Java or
Javascript.  Someday soon.  Real soon, actually, if things don't pan out as
I expect, soon.

</H2>
For an example of what amazing stuff can be done in Java, (nothing to do with me, believe me!) check out <A HREF="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl/java/3dblox/">3D-Blox</A>
<HR>
<H3>
Eventually, there will be more meaningful stuff, but for now it acts more like
built-in bookmarks to what I want to access.  And even those are months and more behind...  Depressing.  Feel free to follow a few.

<font size=3>Keiji Hukushi is a 34 year old guy from Queens, NY. 
He has had many aliases over the years, but these days most people in realtime
refer to him as 'Ken' Hukushi...
<BR>To those people that inhabit the global informatin matrix electronic landscape, he is
simply known as 'HUK' <BR>
Hukushi is working in Manhattan as a graphic artist and designer of floorcovering 
products, mainly carpets and area rugs. Huk also does System Administration
and Programming on the Unix puter at the company where he is employed.<BR>
He was originally born in Osaka, Japan, but has been living in the 
United States for the past 26 years.  <BR><BR>
  
Being a jack of all trades and master of none, Huk has many interests,
hobbies and other elaborate methods of killing time, 
which he refers to collectively as 'chronocide'.
These include playing the Guitar, composing MIDI music, 
Ray Tracing and computer graphics, Comix and cartooning,
art of all kinds and building his own intercontinental ballistic missile.

   <h4>Well here are some stuff i did...Some were done by hand, some
   were done using 3D-Studio Release 3 & 4 for the computer generated
   scenes and VRML objects, and some were done using Adobe Photoshop
   Release 3 & 4 like this web page buttons and backgrounds...<br>
   <br>
   Soon i hope to add in more stuff...maybe using new tools like
   Extreme 3D, 3D-Studio MAX, VistaPro, and more animated GIFs...<br>
   <br>
   So...go ahead and take a look...they may not be as good looking as
   the ones you may have seen, but i am still learning how to use these
   utilities...<br><br>

      Here is the game i like most...so far. A strategy game that involves thinking,
      planning, patience, and tactics in attacking, counter-attacking, defending,
      managing logistics...<br>
      <br>
      This is a game you can get easily be addicted to,...and lose track of time...
      Expect your motor skills and coordination to be significantly affected...if you
      kept on playing like i did... So for those of you who are having trouble passing
      a level...here are some cheat codes i've found over the net...<br>
      <br><a href="files/rarules2.zip">Rules.INI</a> is just a simple text file that once
      it's put in the game directory and editing it, you would be able to manipulate
      almost every feature in the game: weapons, armor, payload, time limit,
      credits/money, range, speed, etc...but try beating the game first without the
      cheats...there is more fun that way! <a href=rapage.html>[MORE INFO]</a>

      Here's another great game that also involves tactics and strategy but less of the other

      machines and the better pilots who controls them decides the outcome of a confrontation.<br>

      Included in the game are various missions: garrison duty, escort, detection and investigation,
      enemy supression, hostage rescue, convoy, search and confiscate, trials by combat,
      search and destroy...Well, anyway,...here's the <a href="files/mw2.txt">cheat

What does your heart say?<P>
Looking outward on the bay...<P>
Wishing of moments<P>
That we have spent together<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Tears of Memories<P>
Of what once was<P>
Only to find the drops are dry<P>
And no more could come out<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
No longer are there heartaches<P>
Of pain and hardships<P>
Only to love you more<P>
Could no longer hold<P>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
<br>
<ul>
Once that was<P>
Is no longer there<P>
Feelings of love<P>
Torn by heartaches<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Loving is full of sorrow<P>
Life continues on...<P>
With thoughts of "what ifs"<P>
Pain only sustain<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<UL>
What is left?<P>
Sorrow and pain<P>
Torn by your fake love<P>
No longer true<P>
</ul>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
You told me those words<P>
Only to abuse the usuage<P>
If it was not meant to be said<P>
Keep it in your heart<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Til there is only pure meaning<P>
Hold it inside<P>
Only to know for yourself<P>
Who is true?<P>
</UL>

True love is what is true<P>
Nothing is worth any meaning<P>

<UL>
The thoughts of you<P>
Still lingers the blues<P>
Trying to understand the truth<P>
As slowly as each rain drop on a roof<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Drop after drop<P>
Like a dying crop<P>
Life is a cycle<P>
Can I always hold up a knuckle?<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
The pain of my heart<P>
Like a tennis ball from court to court<P>
Continues to bleed<P>
Can you see?<P>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
<br>
<ul>
No longer do I hold on<P>
For the feelings are slowly gone<P>
Season after season<P>
Understanding no more reasons<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Traveling on the road<P>
Feeling lonely and cold<P>
Linger of confusion<P>
Without any reason<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<UL>
Every moment together<P>
Is going like a rainy weather<P>
Silence of the voices<P>
Confusion of the sources<P>
</ul>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
The love of once had<P>
Forgetting all that was said<P>
No more "I love you"<P>
Only has the blues<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Rain to shine<P>
Hopes in the shrine<P>
Bareless trees<P>
Just a gentle breeze<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Hopes of tomorrows<P>
To bring me out the sorrow<P>
Clear blue skies<P>
To disappear the good byes<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
The rapid wind whooshing by<P>
No more sighs<P>
Heartaches of old pain<P>
No more person to claim<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Once that drove me insane<P>
Keeps my mind remain with anyone to blame<P>
The love that you've given<P>
Is beyond believing<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
No longer anything<P>
For you have nothing to bring<P>
Life is like seasons<P>
Goes on without reasons<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Loving another<P>
No more want to bother<P>
Bare autumn trees<P>
Is all that I see<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Scenes flies by<P>
As I think of the good byes<P>
Love is blind<P>
Like no agreements signs<P>

<TITLE>The Road Not Taken</TITLE>
<CENTER><H2>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</H2></CENTER>
<ul>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<p>
And sorry I could not travel both<p>
And be one traveler, long I stood<p>
And looked down one as far as I could<p>
To where it bent in the undergrow;<p>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<p>
And having perhaps the better claim,<p>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<p>
Though as for that the passing there<p>
Had worn them really about the same,<p>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
And both that morning equally lay<p>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<p>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<p>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<p>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<p>
Somehowhere ages and ages hence:<p>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --<p>
I took the one less traveled by,<p>
And that has mad all the difference.<p>
</ul>

<UL>
You told me that you love me<P>
Why can't you see...<P>
Love is no longer in your eyes<P>
But only to say good bye<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Had I love you more<P>
Would have made you sore<P>
Why must you be so harsh<P>
To only feel the pains and hushs<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
The love that you have give<P>
No longer needs to be proven<P>
For you have thrown it all away<P>
With no more to say...<P>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
<br>
<ul>
The sorrow and pain<P>
Is only thoughts of insane<P>
The numbness of hurt<P>
Cries out to be sort<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Memories of happiness<P>
And all the gentle caressness<P>
Of the heart<P>
Is all just an act of art<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<UL>
Frozen by the thoughts<P>
Of many sadness and hurt<P>
Nothing more to say<P>
Just me along day after day<P>
</ul>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Quietness and loneliness of my mind<P>
Causing me to stay blind<P>
With other's caring<P>
Is no longer baring<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
Why must love be gone<P>
For whatever is done is done<P>
The love that I've given<P>
Will never be seen<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
No more love<P>
Flewn away the white dove<P>
Left with only me alone<P>
Crying to myself to the song<P>
</UL>
</P>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
The song of once love<P>
Is now thrown away like an used glove<P>
Never will I allow myself<P>
But for selfish of yourself<P>

<ul>
Fate or faith that brought us together?<P>
My love for you will be always forever.<P>
Doubt never came through my mind.<P>
I am not blind.
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
All I can think of is the sorrow<P>
And pain of my heart that no one can burrow.<P>
Cries of day and night<P>
Will never make me doubt that you are the only knight.<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Blaming yourself will only make you further apart.<P>
Just listen to your heart...<P>
Follow what you think is right<P>
And do not take it light.<P>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
<br>
<ul>
Only you know what is in our future<P>
Just look at the big picture.<P>
Dreaming cannot make it true<P>
Just the willingness of the heart will take you out of the blues.<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<P>
<ul>
Future is what you make out of it<P>
Don't just think of the "ifs"<P>
If you do....<P>
You will always think of the blues...<P>
</ul>
</P>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
Action speaks louder than words<P>
If you do not do anymore,<P>
It may be too late.... <P>
*sigh* is all that I can say...<P>

United States Patent[19] [11] Patent Number: 4,749,869 Fournier [45] Date
of Patent Jun.7 1988 ______________________________________________________________________________________

<p>[54] PROCESS FOR THE IRRADIATING TOPAZ AND THE PRODUCT RESULTING THERE
FROM</p>

<p>[75] Inventor : Richard Fournier,Placentia,Calif</p>

<p>[73] Assignee : Anil Dholikia,New York,N.Y.;a part interest</p>

<p>[21] Appl:No 863,083</p>

<p>[22] Filed : May 14,1986</p>

<p>[57] ABSTRACT</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A process for the irradiation
of topaz and the product resulting therefrom is descriced whereby the colorless
or pale-colored topaz is immersed in a high energy neutron environment
at an exposure level sufficient to bring some color to the topaz gemstone,then
irradiating the topaz gemstone with electrons at an exposure level in the
range of approximately 1,000 to 10,000 megarads to produce a remarkable
and enhanced &quot;American blue color&quot; The purpose of such a process
is to enhance the value of the preferred relatively &quot;normal&quot;
sky-blue topaz gemstone by moderately deepening the blueness of the color
of the topaz gemstone to:a relatively &quot;rare&quot; or &quot;Super Sky
Blue&quot; A further step of heating the topaz to about a temperature in
the range of from 250 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit for periods of from about
one to six hours may also be used to further enhance the color of the topaz
following electron bombardment.</p>

<p>PROCESS FOR IRRADIATING TOPAZ AND THE PRODUCT RESULTING THEREFROM</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This invention relates
to a method for processing topaz by the combined use of high energy neutron
radiation and electron bombardment to produce a novel and superier product
and to the novel product so produced by this unique processing method.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More particularly,this
invention relates to the processing of colorless or pale colored topaz
to produce a new product of a different color particularly of the moderately
deeper blue which I describe as &quot;American Blue&quot; which color is
of better qualityand greater value than the original topaz gemstone.A slightly
modified method may be used to produce a lighter blue color than the &quot;American
Blue&quot; which I describe as &quot;Super Sky Blue&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is well known
to those skilled in the nuclear art that the bombardment of various gems,glasses,and
plastics by sub-atomic particles often produces changes in color as well
as in other properties of these materials,neither the reason nor the mechanism
of the process are comprehensively understood.Except in a few well known
cases,the results of such subatomic particle bombardment are neither predictable
nor obvious for any given material or type of radiation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example,it is known in the prior art that ordinary glass loses it's transparency
when subjected to gamma radiation,Pyrex a type of glass,becomes amber and
quartz becomes purple.Without special treatment these colors gradually
dissappear if the glass is allowed to stand for a prolonged period or is
subject to the action of intense light rays.This particular property has
been used to detect radiation by noting the darkening of specailly treated
glass when exposed to further radiations as described by McAlpine and Rinehart
in U.S. Patent No.2,782,319.On the other hand,various types of glasses
have been developed also which resist the color changing effect of radiation
such as disclosed in U.S. Pat.No 7,747,105 which was issued to Fitzgerald,et
al........... Likewise,the color and transparency of plastics have been
known to be effected by Nuclear irradiation as detailed in U.S. Pat.No
2,855,517 issued to Rainer,et al
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phenomenon
is frequently described as being caused by the displacement of electrons
from one part of the material to another resulting in the entrapment of
some of the electrons in the color or &quot;F&quot; center of the materialthereby
changing it's isotropy and consequently it's color. (Stephenson &quot;Introduction
to Nuclear Enginering&quot; pp.222,256 and 350.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant invention,I
have discovered that by taking topaz gemstones which are volorless of certain
given colors and by properly subjecting them to the combined two steps
action of neutron bombardment ofn then by electron bombardment,that I am
able to permantly and eompletely change the color without impairing their
other qualities
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further,I have discovered
also that by taking topaz gemstones which are colorless or of certain given
colors and subjecting them first to high energy neutron bombardment and
then bombarding them with high energy electrons I can produce topaz gtemstones
of a highly desirable,predictable , and permanent color
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is well known,Topaz
is a natural aluminum fluoisilicate which can be written in the formula
[Al2F2SiO4]It commonly occurs in high temperature veins probably formed
in igneous sntrusions in the presence of fluoride and water vapor.As a
result some of the fluoide is usually replaced by hydroxyl,giving it the
variable composition [Al2(F,OH)2SiO4]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topaz occurs naturally in
a wide range of colors(blue,yellow,green,orange,violet,pink and the highly
desirable gold to sherry),but it is most commonly colorless
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crystaline structure of topaz
was determined independently by Pauling(1928) and by Alston and West(1928).It
was described as belonging to the orthrhombic centrosymmetric space group
pbnm and in that space group(Ribbe and Gibbs,1971)An important optical
property or,,more generally many gemstones including topaz is that known
as dichroism or pleochroism.A stone possessing this property,when observed
in different directions will show different colors or shades of color which
may resemble each other more or less closely,or may differ considerably.The
pleochroism of natural topaz is distinct but not strong
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The production of blue topaz from colorless
stones by irradiation was first reported by P.H. Pough in 1957 as one of
a large number of color changes observed in a variety of materials subjected
to radiation treatment.The process was rediscovered and reported by Nassau
in 1974 and by Nassau and Prescott in 1975
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people in the gemstone business
believed the reporting of irradiation treatmnent to produce blue topaz
provided an explanation for the large increase in the quantity of blue
topaz available at that time.During the last ten years,more than a million
carats of blue topaz have entered the world market
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several types of irradiation can
be used to alter the color of topaz including X and gamma rays,high energy
charged particles,and neutrons.To dare,however,the only generally useful
forms of ionizing radiation including gamma rays from C0-60,high energy
electrons from accererators,and neutrons from nuclear reactors
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the principle qualities
which determines the commercial value of a topaz stone is it's color.Naturally
occurring blue topaz stones are pale in color and their value in the market
is therefore limited
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a small percentage
of the topaz stones which have been irradiated by electrons will be a sufficiently
intense blue color to be marketable.Therefore,the cost of producing the
stones that will eventually be sold is increased by the cost for producing
stones that are not saleable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When colorless or pale colored
topaz stones are irradiated with neutrons,the pleochroism which results
in different colors being seen when looking along different axis frequently
results in an undesirable gray or &quot;inky&quot; appearance to many of
the stones.The value of these stones is much less than the top quality
blue gemstones
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When colorless or pale colored
topaz is exposed to gamma rays,several colors of the yellow to reddish-brown
to brown tones develop in some stones,depending on hte nature of the particular
stone.If these particular stones are subsequently heat treated,a blue color
can be brought out in the stone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When by the nature of some stones
an intense blue color is produced,it is generally a gray or &quot;steely&quot;
blue. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for electrons
to penetrate a significant thickness of topaz,energies in the range of
10-20 million electronvolts are required.To obtain these energies,it is
necessary to accelerate the electrons in any one of a variety of machines
including Linier accelerators,Van de Graf generatores,and betatrons.A significant
advantage in the use of electrons accelerators is that the dose rates available
are much higher that with Gamma ray sources enabl sufficient exposures
to be given to the stones which possess the needed natural property to
turn blue,a very clear &quot;sky&quot; blue color is produced.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutrons can be produced by a variety of means,but
the most practical method to gerate the neutron intensities required to
color meaningful quantities of topaz in a reasonable time is to use a nuclear
reactor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general,all colorless or pale colored topaz will
turn a blue color if given sufficient exposure to ahigh energy neutrons.The
color can be made darker than most intense color from either gamma rays
or electrons.The pleochroism of topaz is very evident in neutron irradiated
stones with the color axis appearing dark blue,light blue,and gray.This
property results in a wide range of colors depending on the orientation
of the crystalline axis with respect to the stone snd the type of cutting
used relative to the particular stone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This invention relates to a process for
enhancing the color of colorless and pale-colored topaz crystals by novel
techniques and to the superior products so produced
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally,the present invention
relates to a process for the irradiation of topaz and the product resulting
thereform a process is described qhereby teh colorless or pale colored
topaz is irradiated in a neutron environment at an exposure level sufficient
to bring the color of the topaz gemstone to a dark blue color,than subsequently
irradiating said topaz gemstone with electrons at an exposure level in
the range of approximately 1,000 to 10,000 megarads to produce a remarkable
and enhanced &quot;American&quot; blue color.Occasionally some the the
topaz may require subsequent heating for a few hours from about 175C to
300 degrees Centigrade(347 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit)to obtain the desired
color,however,in most cases,this is not neccessary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of such a process is to enhance
the value of the relatively&quot;normal&quot; sky-blue topaz gem by moderately
deepening the blueness of the color of the topaz gemstone to a reletively
&quot;rare&quot; and more desirable blue color.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore an object of my invention
to provide a method whereby nearly all colorless or pale-colored topaz
can be treated to produce a very desirable blue color essentially equivalent
to the best color that can be produced in only a small percentage of the
world's topaz by irradiation with electrons only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another object of my invention
to provide a method whereby teh stones which have an undesirable gray or
&quot;inky&quot; color following neutron irradiation can be enhanced in
value
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further object of my invention is to provide
a method of producing a new blue color in topaz the is unique,superior
inquality and more valuable than any blue topaz existing prior to the discovery
of my invention
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A still further object of my invention is
to provide a method for additionally including heating following the irradiation
of the topaz gemstones which have not been completely changed in color
to erh color desired to be brought to such desired color
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally,this invention relates
to a new novel method for processing topaz by the combined use of high
energy neutron radiation and electron bombardment to produce a novel and
superior topaz and to the particular topaz produced by this unique processing
method
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More particularly,this invention relates to the
processing of colorless or pale colored topaz to produce a new product
of a different color,particularly of the moderated deeper blue,which I
describe as &quot;American Blue&quot;American Blue topaz is of a better
color,better quality and is of greater value than the original topaz gemstone.A
variation of this process can be used to producd a topaz gemstone which
has a very definitely enhanced blue coloration which I prefer to call &quot;Super
Sky&quot; blue.The &quot;Super Sky &quot;blue is a color which falls beteween
the &quot;sky&quot;blue and the &quot;American Blue&quot;.... The purpose
of such a process is to enhance the value of ehr relatively &quot;normal&quot;
sky-blue topaz gem by moderately deepening the blueness of the color of
the topaz gemstone to a relatively &quot;rare&quot; and more desirable
blue color.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
METHOD&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;PRODUCING SUPER&nbsp;SKY&nbsp;BLUE&nbsp;TOPAZ</p>

<p>My process for improving the color and quality of the topaz product
to produce a &quot;Super Sky&quot;blue colored topaz included the following
steps
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,the colorless or pale colored topaz
gemstone is immersed in a neutron environment to irradiare the topaz at
an exposure level sufficient to produce some color in the topaz so that
when the topaz is subsequently exposed to electron bombardment in hte range
of approximately 1,000 to 10,000 megarads a blue color is obtained in the
topaz.In most cases,the neutron bombardment of the topaz will produce a
light blue color.However,it is not unusual for the topaz to be changed
from its original colorless or near colorless state to a brown,yellow,green
or blue color or varying shades of these and other,color,color combinations.The
level of neutron irradiation to produce the light blue color will of course,depend
on a number of factors,including,just to name a few of the determinative
factors involved,the amount of topaz being irradiatred,the duration of
hte radiation exposure,the specific nature and character of the particular
topaz being bombarded,and the reletive sizes of ehr topaz gemstones.One
of the key and most important elements is that the topaz be treated with
a sufficient level of neutron radiation bombardment.Such a degree and amount
of neutron radiation bombardment is achieved when some color is induced
in the topaz.Of course,it has been found that such level of neutron radiation
bombardment of the topaz is preferred to be when the stone is turned to
a medium blue color.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second,the neutron irradiated medium blue
colored topaz is then irradiated with electrons to an exposure level in
the range of from approximately 1,000 to 10,000 megarads to produce a remarkable
and enhanced &quot;Super Sky&quot; blue colored topaz gemstone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionaly,some of the neutron and electron
irradiated topaz gemstone due to the particular nature and characteristics
of the material forming the topaz will not obtain the desired &quot;Super
Sky&quot; blue coloration,but instead will become greenish-blue or greenish-yellowish.When
this occurs,the desired &quot;Super Sky&quot;blue color can be obtained
by further treating the topaz by hours at between 250 to 600 degrees Fahrenheit(1212
to 315 degrees Centegrade). By heating,I find that nearly all of the Topaz
stones heat treated in this manner will have the very desirable color and
are highly marketable. </p>

<p>METHOD&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;PRODUCING&nbsp;AMERICAN&nbsp;BLUE&nbsp;TOPAZ</p>

<p>The process which I have discovered for the improcing the color and
quality of the topaz product to produce a &quot;American&quot;blue colored
topaz includes the following steps:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,the colorless or pale colored topaz
gemstone is immersed in a neutron environment to irradiate the topaz at
an exposure level sufficient to produce some color in the topaz.Sometimes
this involves the production of a steely or dark,blue or gray color.The
level of neutron irradiation to produce the blue color will,of course,depend
on a number of factors,kincludingf just ot name a few of the determinative
factors involved the amount of topaz being irradiated,the duration of the
irradiation exposure,the specific nature and character of the partivular
topaz being bombarded,and the reletive sizes of the topaz gemstone.One
of the key and most important elements is the topaz be treated with a sufficient
level of neutron radiation bombardment.Such a degree and amount of neutrron
radiation bobardment is achieved when some color is induced in the topaz.Of
couse,it has been found taht such level of neutron radiation bombardment
of teh topaz occurs when some color appears int eh topaz.In some cases
this level is achieved when teh topaz gemstone is turned a steely or gray
color. Second,the neutron irradiated dark blue colored topaz is than irradiated
with electrons at an exposure level in the preferred range of fomr approximately
1.000 to 10,000 megarads to produce a remarkable and enhanced &quot;American&quot;
blue colored topaz gemstone.&quot;American&quot; blue is a new,extremely
bright,intense blue color
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionaly,as in the previous method
which I have described to produce a &quot;Super Sky&quot; blue topaz,some
of the neutron and electron irradiated topaz gemstones because of theparticular
nature and characteristics of the material forming the topaz,will not obtain
the desired &quot;American&quot; blue colroation,but instead will become
brownish or yellowish.When this occurs,teh desired &quot;American&quot;
blue color can be obtained by further treating the topaz by heating it
for a few,that is ,further treating two or more hours at about 250 to 900
degrees Fahrenheit(121 to 482 degrees Centigrade)As a practical matter,teh
preferred time period for heating the topaz is from one to six hours.Further,it
shoud be clearly understood and noted that heating of the topaz to obtain
teh desired final color change may be accomplished at lower temperatures.Such
lower temperatures are from about 250 degrees Fahrenheit,but this,of course,requires
a longer period of heating than is accomplished at higher temperatures.Also,if
the temperature is raised to approximately 900 degrees Farhenheit,the desired
color change can be accomplished in a shorter time frame.Through this process
of heating ,I find that nearly all of the topaz stones heat treated in
this manner will have the very desirable color and are highly marketable

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the within described
process and product is intended to include all variations in composition
of topaz from any and all locations in the world and all forms of topaz
including but not limited to rough and prdfromed stones all manner of carved
stones and all manner of polished and cut stones the neutron irradiation
described includes treatment by neutrons of all energies produced by any
means including but not limited to isotopic sources,accelerator sources
and nuclear reactors.The electron irradiation includes irradiation by electrons
produced by any technique and accelerated by any method
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be clearly understood that certain
obvious modifications will occur to those skilled in the art to which this
invention pertains.However,such obvious modifications are intended to be
within the scope and purview of the present invention herin and the outer
boundaries of the scope of teh instant invention are intended to be limited

Reasons with no "because"<P>

You made trust<P>
You are like crust<P>

You shield me<P>
Holding me as tight as can be<P>
With all your good deeds<P>
Like planting a seed<P>

Watching me grow<P>
As the wind blows<P>
Seeing your face glow<P>
Understanding me slow<P>

Doubting and thinking wrongly<P>
Took me slowly<P>
Accepting you blindly<P>

Until you gave me life<P>
To have no more sighs<P>

<TITLE> About Mark </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#66BFBF">

<B>Vital Statistics</B><p>
<B>Name:</b>  Mark Raymo<BR>
<B>DOB:</b>  February 9, 1973<BR>
<B>Hair:</b>  Brown<BR>
<B>Eyes:</b>  Brown<BR>
<B>Height:</b>  6 foot 3 inches tall<BR>
<B>Weight:</b>  240 lbs (right now, anyway)<BR>

<B>Real World Profession</B><BR>
I work as a security guard at a retirement community.  Its a nice slow 
job that gives me lots of days off and lets me use the computers from 
work.<p>


<B>Favorite Music</B><BR>
Pink Floyd, Rush, NIN, Queen, Bjork, Soundgarden, BOC, Ministry, Helmet, 
Follow For Now, Metallica, <BR>
Alice in Chains, Vangelis, Enya, Drivin N Cryin, Sting, Tangerine Dream, 
Depeche Mode, Steely Dan, <BR>
Filter, The Smiths, The Cure, The Cult, 808 State, Led Zeppelin, Phil 
Collins, and just <BR>
about damn near anything, cept country and gospel.<p>


<B>Favorite Drink</B><BR>
Guinness, Mountain Dew, Milk :)<p>

<B>Favorite TV</B><BR>
I don't watch quite as much TV as I used to, though I still like Star 
Trek and Cops!<p>

<B>Ideal Dream Woman</B><BR>
Well, my fiancee Kim is my ideal dream woman... when I get a picture of 
her scanned, I'll put it here.<P>


<B>Commonly Referred To As...</B><BR>
Asshole, Stupid Bastard, Mark<p>

<B>Favorite Place To Go</B><BR>
Well, in Missouri, I havent a clue where to go, but I DO still enjoy 
taking a hefty shit every now and then.  Also, the bedroom figures 
prominently in life.<p>

<B>Favorite Things to Do</B><BR>
Well, sex with Kim rates up there, but I also like to stay home and avoid 
working overtime if possible.  I also enjoy going to Kim's parents house 
and playing with her son Ben, because he's cool to play with.<p>

I currently use either a cheap IBM PS1 from the early middle ages, or a 
DEC VT terminal attached to an external modem.  Both tend to suck, and 
any gifts of computer equipment would be GREATLY appriciated!<p>

Kim and I will be getting married on or about July 26th, 1997 in 
Columbia, Missouri.  If you'd like more information about it, please mail 
me.<p>

<p><img src="chart1.htg/img.gif" width="333" height="314" align="left" >This chart shows the condition in
September of 1994 of 4.5 million
workers laid off between January
1991 and December 1993*.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to Harold Wolchok, professor
emeritus of Labor Relations at the City
University of New York, the Labor
Department has now discontinued
compiling this statistic, as it earlier
discontinued compiling the "Discouraged
Worker" statistic.  Why?  Perhaps
because both of these statistics fail to
show the improvement that Wall Street
would have us believe is sweeping the
country.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This diagram, and the massive study it
represents, does not show such improvement.  When you add those who are still unemployed to
those who took part-time or lower paying work, two thirds of the displaced workers suffered a
reduction in their standard of living due to their displacement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>*Those included in the study had held their previous jobs for three or more years.  The official
document containing these figures is <u>Worker Displacement During the Early 1990s</u>, a News
Release dated September 14, 1994 from the US Department of Labor.

<TITLE>MHS ART DEPARTMENT</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
                          Art Department
<P>
 The Art Department offers a program of studies and activities
which provides for students' individual differences, creative
abilities, needs and interests, while developing a satisfying
way to think, feel and work in primary non-verbal disciplines.
Furthermore, we have through the years of working with our students
from other countries, believed that these creative experiences
bring about appreciation of their visual and verbal expression,
and that student's need to share ideas about their art increases
their ability to speak and write more fluently.
<P>
 The Art Department also offers a program for the gifted and talented
which meets daily. Students in this program explore art from a
personal approach which extends to other art experiences and prepares
them for acceptance into early admissions college courses in art.
These students are eligible for college credit while earning Carnegie
units on the high school level.
<P>
 Some of our art courses are:
<UL>
<LI>Art portfolio
<LI>Artscope
<LI>Calligraphy
<LI>Painting
<LI>Ceramics
<LI>Creative Crafts
<LI>Sculpture
<LI>Graphics and more....

<TITLE> The Struggle for National Health Insurance</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<br><br><br>

<p>For many people, William Clinton's election to the Presidency in 1992 signaled that something would at last be done about the shameful state of health care in America.  At last, the millions of uninsured would be covered, through universal coverage.  Children would no longer be denied vaccination, mother's would no longer be denied pre-natal care, the elderly would no longer die at home in order to preserve their meager estates.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  Despite popular support for universal health care in the 60% range, the idea of genuine single-payer insurance never had a chance.  The media and lobbying campaign against it was unprecedented in size and professional in presentation.  A remarkably low number of the citizenry were convinced to change their views (59% of the voters leaving the poles in 1996 still believed in universal care)</p>

<p>At the same time, a right-leaning government in much of Canada is axing its incredibly popular Single-payer health plan.  Cuts in payment have prompted doctors [who earn on average $130,000 dollars per year, about one eighth of what the average American doctor earns] to refuse new patients.  Nevertheless, about 96% of Canada's citizenry support single-payer health care, a majority being willing to pay higher taxes rather than have fewer benefits.  Such a public outcry has greeted the cuts, that in many areas, even right-wing politicos are backing away from the policies that are meant to force Canadians into an American style private system. (<em>In These Times</em>, January 20-February 2, 1997, <u>Bitter Medicine</u>  Pages 16-19)</p>

<p>What is going on?  Apparently American insurance companies, having saturated the market in the United States want to take over the markets in Canada.  Canadian Health care is more efficient than American health care, since Canada spends  less than 10% of its GNP per year to provide full health coverage for all its citizens; America on the other hand spends over 14% of its GNP to provide health care through a private system, and still leaves about forty two million people uninsured.  (ibid)  At the same time, the huge American Insurance companies do not want the US to institute a single-payer health care package, since that would destroy a portion of their base market.  The little people in insurance would find equal jobs in Government run public health care provision.  The CEOs, the Capitalists who back the corporations, those people would not.</p>

<p>Is Universal health care a good choice?  You judge.  In Canada, up unitl now at least, in most of our European allies, even in Mexico, no person ever has to choose between paying the rent and receiving medical care.  Here in the United States, where the "invisible hand of capitalism" rules the market, thousands of people have to make decisions of such nature daily.  Managed care programs, which were touted as more cost effective, and therefore cheaper, are no more affordable to the common man; and provide inferior care.  Portability of benefits is nice, if you have benefits to begin with. None of these solutions and ideas have done anything to reduce the number of Americans without insurance.  In fact, the number continues to increase. </p>

<p>So, did the defeat of Clinton's unacceptably watered down plan eliminate the chance for Universal care?  Not by a long shot.  The idea has to come from the grass roots, and it has to be pushed forward until it is accepted.  This acceptance will end the continued dabbling of our transnationals in other nation's affairs, and provide proper care for our people at home.   </strong></p>

<p>I propose to you that far from ending the possibility of  Univeral Care, Clinton's proposal, which was deeply flawed due to his attempts to pander to Corporate interests and  the Right wing  guarantees real universal health care within a decade.  You can help bring it about  There are organizations forming around the country to push this issue from the grass-roots up.  </p>

<p>I will update this page as I learn more.  For now, permit me to suggest contacting the following organization:</p>

New York Health Care for All Campaign
180 Varick St., 12th Floor
New York, NY   10014
(212) 741-8535
Executive Director Mark Hannay

<p>The organization should have a web-site by fall 1997, I will include the URL when it is established.  the sponsoring organizations read like a list of socially concerned groups, including Labor unions; Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Jewish, and Interfaith organizations and dioceses; political organizations; coalitions of the aged;  and various civil rights groups.  (My apologies to others not listed here as the list of initial sponsoring organizations covers a page and a half in small print, as columns of text.)</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, if you are not in the New York area, ask them about organizations in your area, or if you are hesitant to contact them, drop me e-mail, and I will find you an organization or coalition in your area.  ENDURE!</p>

<TITLE> The Detroit Paper Strike</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<br><br><br>

<p>It is one of the most bruising strikes in this century.  Newspaper workers at the<font color=aquamarine> <em><strong>Detroit Free Press</strong></em></font>    and the <font color=aquamarine>  <em><strong> Detroit News</strong></em></font>;  both owned by Gannett/Knight Ridder (the same people who own <font color=aquamarine><em><strong>USA Today</strong></em></font>) have been on the picket lines for about eighteen months while the paper continues operation with scab labor at a tremendous loss.  The mega-corporation refuses to post its own sales figures, and is believed to be salting away hundreds of thousands of copies daily, Advertising is down over half according to most observers, and paid circulation is believed to be down between 50% and 60%.  The Roman Catholic and Episcopal  bishops have both been arrested on the picket lines with the workers, as have dozens of other clergy members of nearly every non-fundamentalist persuasion.  </p>

<p>What is going on? </p>

<p>The consensus is that Gannett is determined to break the union that represents the workers at these two newspapers.  The question is why?  Is it an economic necessity?  <strong>No</strong>, it is not.  Is it an attempt at sending a signal to other union members at other papers, and to other companies saying 'look, these fools have no where to go, break their unions, we can do anything to them and with them that we wish.  The days of unions are over!"  <strong>Yes</strong>, apparently it is. Is it a further attempt at increasing profits on the backs of the working class (in this case the middle class)?  Almost without question.  </p>

<p>One can hardly argue that  newspaper reporters, editors, and pressmen are paid too highly.  Newspaper reporters for example make an average of $20,154 according to a study commissioned by the San Francisco State University Journalism Department.  About 22% of Journalists below the age of 25 earn less than $15,141, which as Randolph T. Holhut in his article "Has the Fun Gone Out of Journalism" (The Progressive Populist, January 1997, Vol. 3 #1) says, is the Federal poverty level for a family of four. Hardly what we are led to expect a college graduate professional to receive.  No, the newspaper people being punished in Detroit are by and large solidly middle class, the same as most of us  (though we constitute a diminishing percentage) in the American working class.</p>

<p>An example of <font color=red>CLASS WARFARE</font>?  Absolutely.  This struggle, while highly visible because of the presense of a union which has been able to draw the struggle out is no different than the struggle against cut backs, give backs, and down-sizing everywhere in the U.S.  All these abuses being heaped on middle class and poor workers by their wealthy employers during years of record profit.  Can there by an excuse for this abomination?  Only in the minds of those who are wealthy and those who have deluded themselves into believing that they themselves are destined to be wealthy.  Even then, only if the person in question is insanely and criminally greedy.</p>

<p>In most cases everywhere in this country and the world; when these horrors occur, people yield to them, usually without so much as  a whimper.  Workers, particularly those without unions are conditioned to accept whatever is dished out by the bosses and the employers.  The situation in Detroit has been, happily, somewhat different.  The unionized workers began an alternative paper, which has picked up a great deal of advertising, and now has a paid ciruclation in the hundreds of thousands.  This worker owned and administered enterprise is called <FONT COLOR=green><em><strong>The Detroit Journal</strong></em></FONT>  and is likely to continue in cirulation until such time as the corporation settles with the union and allows the workers to return to their jobs.</p>

<p>Trade Unionism is very important.  While it is true that some unions are corrupt, workers nevertheless fare much better with them than without them.  Average union wages are higher than average non-union wages, not only across categories, but within individual categories.  The reason I believe in unionism is simple.  If you pick up one dowel (round stick), how difficult is it to break?  Now how about breaking 100 dowels, all together, all at once.  Now try 1,000... 10,000.  The union gives to individual members of the working classes the ability to bargain collectively for wages and benefits.  Because unionists support one another (whether or not they may get along outside the job) they establish a somewhat more level playing field for their competition with the bosses.  If you do not belong to a union, go to the AFL-C IO homepage, linked below, and get in touch with your local Central Labor Council.  They can help you bring unionized labor to your place of employment, protecting yourself and your fellow workers from unfair treatment and illegal abuse.  Your right to belong to, or organize a union is guaranteed, don't be afraid to take advantage of it, and don't believe the bosses lies.</p>

<TITLE>The Struggle With Disney in Haiti and Burma</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<br><br><br>

<p>Last year I was involved in the struggle to bring justice to workers who were employed by third party manufacturers for 'The Gap.'  An historic agreement was signed between Vice President Stanley Raggio of 'The Gap' and Charles Kernegan from the <em>National Labor Committees</em>.  This agreement (detailed more fully in the section "Victory.") was signed in an allied parish's hall, only blocks from my home.  Excited, I informed the <em>NLC</em> that I wanted in on the next campaign.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise and shock when I received a packet in the mail, informing me that the next campaign was against  Walt Disney Company.  I entered denial for weeks.  This company, whose movies I have watched, toys I have bought, theme park I have visited; this company could not be involved in the exploitation of third world workers.  It could not be.</p>

<p><FONT COLOR=red>It is.</FONT></p>

<p>Disney has refused to respond to my phone calls, and is stonewalling information regarding the disregard for human rights that they are evidencing through the use of manufacters in Haiti and Burma.  The <em>NLC</em> is concentrating at the moment on Haiti primarily, and has combined its efforts with those of the <em>Justice for Haiti Committee</em>.</p>

<p>Here then are the facts that can be gathered independently:</p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Workers in Haiti get paid as little as 28 cents an hour
<li>Workers are laid off for Union organizing, or for appearing to be sympathetic to Unions (B.V.F. Apparel in Port-au-Prince laid off 6 workers for protesting the illegal firing of a Union organizer in one plant alone).
<li>At 28 cents an hour, workers in Haiti make less than half of their minimum needs.  Suggestions that the wage be increased to $5.00 <strong>per day</strong>, which would cover minimum needs have been ignored.
<li>Disney is therefore one of many multi-nationals who move their outsourced work from country to country, paying less and less, and thus forcing American wages down, continuing to disintegrate the middle class.
<li>Michael Eisner, CEO of Disney, paid himself $97,600.00 <strong>per hour</strong> in 1993, the last year for which I could obtain information.  He has no shame.

</ul>

<p>Disgusted?  You can do something about it.  Contact the following for information regarding groups in your community that may need your help to fight back against this appalling violation of human rights and disgusting evidence of long term <font color=red>Class Warfare</font> against the middle class and all other workers int he U.S.</p>

I suppose I ought to tell y'all a little about myself. I was born
in the Philippines sometime in the early 70s.  I stayed there
for 3 years, and loved it - well, what I can remember of it
- until mi familia and I moved to NYC, which is where I
am now.  And no, I'm not a gangster & I've never been shot.  Nor
have I ever raped, killed, or otherwise maimed a tourist.  At least,
not <I>intentionally</I>.

<BODY><CENTER><IMG SRC="dmlk"></CENTER>
<BODY><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>artin Luther King was an American clergyman and Nobel laureate, one of the principal leaders of the American civil rights movement and a prominent advocate of
nonviolent resistance to racial oppression. He was the leader of many boycotts and
marches, he also gave many famous speeches among his best is "I have a Dream"
	King was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929, he was the oldest son of
Martin Luther King, Sr., a Baptist minister, and Alberta Williams King. He entered
Morehouse College at the age of 15 and was ordained a Baptist minister at the age of
17. Graduating from Crozer Theological Seminary as class president in 1951, he then
did postgraduate work at Boston University.
	King's studies at Crozer and Boston led him to study the works of the Indian
nationalist Mohandas K. Gandhi, whose ideas became the core of his own philosophy
of nonviolent protest. While in Boston, he met Coretta Scott of Marion, Alabama. They
were married in June 1953, and the following year King accepted an appointment as
pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.
	King was killed on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. Some 100,000 people
attended his funeral in Atlanta. A white escaped convict, James Earl Ray, was arrested
for the murder; he pleaded guilty and in March 1969 was sentenced to 99 years in
prison. In 1983 the third Monday in January was designated a federal legal holiday in
honor of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday; his Atlanta birthplace and gravesite were
made a national historic site.

<TITLE> Campaign Finance Reform </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<br><br><br>

<p>Campaign finance reform is essential to the continuation of democracy.  According to a research survey by the Gallup group, which has tracked public opinion regarding public financing of political campaigns for 24 years, the idea of eliminating private contributions to political campaigns and financing them entirely from the public coffers has reached its highest level of support in all those years.  59% of people favor the idea, while only 29% oppose it.  The split increases if respondants have the exact meaning explained to them, and hear pro and con speeches from politicians.  After such in depth educational efforts, the number supporting a total ban on private financing goes up to 65%, while those opposing such a ban drops down to 25%.  Majority support spanned all demographic groups, althouigh it was highest among Democrats and Independents and lowest among Republicans and Conservatives.</p>

<p>With such numbers, why has nothing been done?  Because this would strip the "invisible government" (the rich and the corporations) of their power.   Do not think for a moment that just because the majority of people want something that the politicians will give it to them.  The politicians that we need to reform campaign finance, are those that are already bought and paid for by the very people  whom we wish to deny power to by campaign finance reform.  Another words, we are asking people to do something for the good of the country and of democracy that is definitely not for their own good, and will negatively affect their likelihood of re-election and whatever perks they may expect after their days in electoral politics are over.</p>

<p>This is not an issue that we can expect the politicians now in power to pony up to willingly.  This is another issue that has to come up from the grass-roots and force itself on the powers that be.  Can it be done?  Sure it can.  Of course it does require a substantial amount of real effort on the part of real people with other lives.  If you are someone who believes that campaign finance reform is needed so that we own our representatives, then rather than bitch about it while having a drink with frank or a salad with Sally, do something about it.  Help bring campaign finance reform about, and end the power of big business and the transnationals in Washington.</p>

<TITLE> Considerations 1 (The Politicians) </TITLE>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p><img src="bombpow.gif" lowsrc="bombpow.gif" alt="bombpow.gif " width=100  height=100 hspace=0 vspace=0 border=0 align=left></p>

<p>Are the two statements the same, the second one simply being dressed up to fall more easily on the ear?  Consider:</p>

<p>1) The <em>Unemployment Rate</em> is fairly stable for now, it hovers at about 5% of the total workforce  (figures from the <strong>US Department of Labor</strong>, through November of 1996). The chairman of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>(Alan Greenspan) has said in interviews  last year that he will not permit the <em>Unemployment Rate</em> to drop very much lower, since a low unemployment rate increases the possibility of  inflation. (Inflation devalues investment capital, which  upsets the wealthy who control said investment capital.  High inflation also damages the purchasing power of the average person, though to a lesser extent.)  Therefore, since the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> can take a number of actions that will slow the economy and increase <em>Unemployment</em>, it is safe to assume  that by hook or by crook we will continue to have at least 5% official  unemployment.  Remember, the official <em>Unemployment Rate</em> does not take into account those who have been out of work long enough to no longer be eligible for benefits, nor does it take into account those who have taken jobs far inferior to those that they  previously held,  in fact;</p>

<p>2) If we were to count the people who are in actuality have given up looking for jobs, or have accepted whatever work they could find (remember that legally one hour a week is a job, so is selling pencils door to door) then we would discover that we have double the number people who might be counted as unemployed, but for various "legal" reasons now aren't.  This brings us to approximately 10%  "real" (as opposed to "official") unemployment. and;</p>

<p>3) We still haven't considered those receiving welfare.  Counting them in as unemployed, which we certainly should do if we are going to require them to find jobs, and counting those who are homeless, but still receive occasional help through the system brings us up to an <em>Unemployment Rate</em> of between 15% and 18%.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p><FONT COLOR=Red><strong>Where are the jobs going to come from?</strong> </FONT> </p>

<p>Yes I know, people's automatic response is to mutter that anyone who really wants to work can find a job.  I've heard many people mutter it for many years.</p>

<p>There is a problem though, its <font color=blue><strong>FALSE!!!</strong></font></p>

<p>While it is true that a number of million new jobs have been created in the last few years, most are temporary, or part time, and  nearly all are service sector.  Very few of these new jobs pay a living wage.  In addition to all this, millions more jobs would be required to bring the truly unemployed in this nation even that level of support. (About  18,600,000 full time jobs more than exist now).  The idea that there are jobs for the asking is the cruelest of hoaxes.  Even if the economy  became wildly successful, more so than it has been in our history, and businesses were both willing and able to create those eighteen and a half million jobs, we know from Alan Greenspan's speech last year that the <em>Federal Reserve </em>(the most powerful central bank and currency control organism in the world) <font color=blue>would NOT permit it!</font> We know in fact, the <em>Fed</em><font color=blue> <u>would punish businesses until they cut back to the point that the nation had, minimally between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 citizens without jobs</FONT></u>.  </p>

<p>The sane person has to ask: Why do we lie to ourselves as a nation?  What do we gain by not confronting the real problems of our present society, and instead seeking scapegoats and whipping boys?  Who is it that is so misleading the majority of our populace?  How are they doing it?</p>

<p>The sane person has to wonder:  Who are really the friends of the common man?  With salaries shrinking in purchasing power throughout the 80's and into the 90's for the average American family and wealth only growing for those in the top few percent, whose purposes are served by diverting the people's uncertainty and fear away from the real crisis, and toward those powerless to defend themselves?</p>

<p>Who could it be?</p>

<TITLE> Rosa Parks </TITLE>
</HEAD><CENTER><H2>Rosa Parks</H2></CENTER>
<BODY>
Rosa Parks was a civil rights leader, born in Tuskegee, Alabama. She attended Alabama State College, worked as a seamstress and housekeeper, and was active in the Montgomery Voters League and the NAACP Youth Council. In 1943 she was elected secretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP. In a celebrated incident in 1955 she was arrested for violating segregation laws when she refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. This resulted in a boycott of the bus system by blacks, with Martin Luther King, Jr. leading the movement. In spite of harassment the boycott continued, and in 1956 segregated seating was challenged in a federal lawsuit. Within a few months bus segregation was ruled unconstitutional, and the buses were officially desegregated in December 1956. Parks, who had lost her job because of the boycott, moved to Detroit, Michigan, the following year, and again took in sewing. She also worked as a fundraiser for the NAACP. In 1965 she was hired by Congressman John Conyers, Jr., also a civil rights leader, to manage his Detroit office. She remained active in the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1987 she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, offering guidance to young blacks. She won the NAACP's Spingarn Medal and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award, as well as an honorary degree from Shaw College.

<P>
 In 1972, Special Education classes were introduced at Memorial
High School to provide classified students of high school age
an opportunity to fulfill their academic potential, to realize
their active importance as active citizens in the community and
to better socialize their peers. Classes are currently being offered
in reading, English, mathematics, social studies, typing, science,
and employment orientation with the Special Education Department
students whose native language is not English.
<P>
 The Special Education Program at Memorial follows the requirements
of the State and Local Board of Education concerning course and
graduation.
<P>
 Students are encouraged to participate in mainstreaming courses
if they show potential in the subject matter as well as participate
in extracurricular activities such as interscholastic sports,
clubs and/or performing arts.

<TITLE> Paige </TITLE>
</HEAD><CENTER><H2>Satchel Page</H2></CENTER>
<BODY><CENTER><IMG SRC="paige"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>atchel Paige was an American baseball player, noted for the length of his career and the speed and variety of his pitches, such as the hesitation ball, which involved stopping his pitching motion momentarily during a pitch. He was born Leroy Robert Paige in Mobile, Alabama. He acquired his nickname in his youth while working as a baggage handler in a Mobile train depot.
Satchel Paige began his career with the Birmingham Black Barons in the 1920s and for two decades pitched for many clubs, mainly in the Negro leagues, throughout the United States. As a free agent he played in Canada, and during the North American winter season with Caribbean, Central American, and South American teams. He once barnstormed (traveled throughout the country to play in exhibition games) 30,000 miles in one year, and in 1935 he pitched in 29 consecutive games in 29 days. Among his other feats, he struck out batting great Rogers Hornsby five times in one game.
In 1948, at over 40 years of age, Paige finally got his chance to play in the major leagues. That year he was signed by the Cleveland Indians and helped them win the pennant and World Series. From 1951 to 1953 he was a relief pitcher for the Saint Louis Browns and in 1952 was named to the American League All-Star team. Paige pitched in his last major league game in 1965, and in 1968 he was signed as a pitching coach for the Atlanta Braves.
Throughout his long career Paige always delighted in having fans guess his true age; his 1967 autobiography bears the title Maybe I'll Pitch Forever. Paige was famous too for his colorful observations on life, such as his maxim Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you. Paige was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

<BODY><CENTER><IMG SRC="jesspic"></CENTER>

<BODY><FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>esse Owens was one of the greatest track-and-field athletes of all time. He was born James Cleveland Owens in Danville, Alabama, and educated at Ohio State University. He competed in interscholastic track meets while attending high school, excelling in the running broad jump, the 100-yd dash, and the 220-yd dash. As a member of the Ohio State University track squad in 1935, he established a world record of 26 ft 83 in. for the running broad jump; the next year he set a new world record of 10.2 sec for the 100-m dash.
A member of the U.S. track team in the 1936 Olympic Games, held in Berlin, Owens won four gold medals. He won the 100-m dash in 10.3 sec, equaling the Olympic record; set a new Olympic and world record of 20.7 sec in the 200-m dash; and won the running broad jump with a leap of 26 ft 5I in., setting a new Olympic record. He was also a member of the U.S. 400-m relay team that year, which set a new Olympic and world record of 39.8 sec. Despite his outstanding athletic performance, however, Hitler refused to acknowledge Owens's Olympic victories because he was black.
Owens went on to play an active role in youth athletic programs and later established his own public relations firm. His autobiography, The Jesse Owens Story, was published in 1970.

 <FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>ackie  Robinson was an  American athlete and a business man. He was born Jack Roosevelt Robinson in Cairo, Georgia. He attended Pasadena Junior College in California and the University of California, Los Angeles. As an undergraduate, Robinson was very good in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He left college in 1941 in his junior year and shortly thereafter joined the U.S. Army.
Discharged early in 1945 with the rank of first lieutenant, Robinson signed a contract to play professional baseball with the Monarchs, a Kansas City, Missouri, team of the Negro American League. Later in 1945 Robinson signed with Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, to play with the minor league Royals in Montral. After one season with the Royals, Robinson joined the Brooklyn team and became the first black to play modern major league baseball. From 1947 to 1956, mostly as a second baseman, Robinson batted .311 in 1382 games. He was also a incredible baserunner. In 1962 Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, the first black player so honored.
After leaving baseball, Robinson was vice president of a restaurant chain in New York City. From 1964 to 1968 he served as special assistant for civil rights to Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York. Robinson started in the movie The Jackie Robinson Story and was the author, with Alfred Duckett, of I Never Had It Made .

She was born in Houston, Texas, on February 21, 1936, she earned a bachelor's degree from Texas Southern University and a law degree from Boston University Law School in 1959. After she graduated she returned to Texas to work for a judge in Harris County. In 1960 she worked for the campaign of John F. Kennedy as the Democratic party's presidential candidate.
In 1966 Jordan became the first black woman to win a seat in the Texas Senate. She authored the state's first successful minimum-wage bill and pushed for civil rights legislation.
In 1972 Jordan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She took a seat on the Judiciary Committee, where she earned national attention for her good speech in favor of impeaching President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate affair. She also delivered the keynote address at the 1976 Democratic Convention.
In 1978 Jordan left the House to teach at the University of Texas at Austin. In 1982 she was awarded the university's Lyndon B. Johnson chair of National Policy. During the 1992 Democratic Convention, Jordan earned praise for her powerful speech against racism towards whites and blacks.

           BASIC SKILLS DEPARTMENT
<P>
 Over the last decade the Basic Skills Department has grown from
a small remediation group to one of the largest departments at
Memorial.  State mandates have necessitated constant curriculum
changes dictated by the introduction of the Minimum Basic Skills
Test and progressing to the newly developed 11th grade High School
Proficiency Test.  The access to a computer room, interdepartmental
communications, and new course developments have added to the
high student success rate on the aforementioned standardized tests.
 The ultimate goal of the department is to prepare students for
the challenges of life.

<TITLE>Making your own web home ...</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Making your own web home ...</H1>

<UL>
<LI>You need to create the directory "<tt>~/.www</tt>".  You need to be
sure that this directory has world read and search permissions, and
that your home directory has least world search perms. (run: '<tt>chmod og+x
~; chmod 755 ~/.www</tt>' -- if you are uncertain).<p>

<li>Next you need to create a file in that directory called
"<tt>index.html</tt>".  This file should be a hypertext document
written in the <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML)</a>.  This document will be the first page remote users
would normally access to enter your personal web tree.<p>

<li>Poof: This document should now be available to you via the Web at the <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URL:</a><p>

<b>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/index.html</b><p>

where <i>login_name</i> is, of course, replaced with your login name
(also referred to as your unix account).<p>

To view this document run<p>
<tt> Mosaic http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/index.html</tt><p>
or<p>
<tt> lynx http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/index.html</tt><p>
or one of the other equivalent methods to access this page.<p>

<b>Please notice:</b> These <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URLs</a> do
not contain the ".www" that is part of the <i>real</i> filename (such
as "~/.www/index.html").  It is a common mistake to confuse the
<i>real</i> location of these html documents and the <i>virtual</i>
URL that is used to access them.  The http server maps the `top' of
your tree into your "<tt>~/.www</tt>" directory of your home directory
automatically, so you should never include the ".www" in your URLs.
Primarily, this is intended a security measure -- only files you
specifically place into your physical "<tt>~/.www"</tt>" are available
via the web, not the entire contents of your home directory as
"http:/home/login_name" seems to allude.  </ol>

<H2>Now the Possibilities are Endless</H2>

If you've gotten this far, then now your creativity is almost
boundless (quota and time allowing of course... :)<p>

Now you can place any other html documents and certain other types of
files, including fun things like images and sound files.  File types
are recognized by the <a href="/web/file-extensions.html">file suffixes.</a><p>

Other files in your personal page can be referenced with <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URLs</a> similar to the following:<p>

<tt>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/someother.html</tt><br>
<tt>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/subdirectory/index.html</tt><br>

<H2>Uh, oh, now were getting tricky</H2>

To try and clarify some of the issues involved in serving documents to
the Web through our server, perhaps an example would be useful.  This
example should help clearclear up some of the issues already discussed
and introduce some new concepts as well:<p>

<hr>
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Welcome to Joe Random's Personal Web Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Welcome web walker...&lt;/H1&gt;

This is Joe:
&lt;img align=top alt="Sorry you couldn't see me :)" src="MyPicture.gif"&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

What a funny looking picture of me ey?&lt;P&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;Here's a little info about me&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="General.html"&gt;General Information&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's my &lt;a href="MyMajor.html"&gt;major?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here's &lt;a href="resume/index.html"&gt;my resume&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;Here are some of my favorite links:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neu.edu/"&gt;Northeastern University&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/"&gt;NCSA&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://info.cern.ch/"&gt;Cern&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Thanks for checking out my personal Web Pages, come back again soon!&lt;p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;address&gt; jrandom@&lt;a href="/"&gt;ccs.neu.edu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
<hr>

<H3>Let's take a closer look at that</H3>

For the sake of this example, the <i>login_name</i> is jrandom.<p>

Joe's web directory would look something like the following:

<dl>
<dt>~/.www/index.html
<dd>	Contains the above document<br>

<dt>~/.www/MyPicture.gif	
<dd> This is a GIF format picture of the Joe.<p>

<dt>~/.www/General.html
<dd>Some general information about Joe,<p>

<dt>~/.www/MyMajor.html
<dd>Perhaps information about Joe's major.<p>

<dt>~/.www/resume/index.html 
<dd>Joe wanted to put his resume online, since it contained a number
of separate but related documents, he created a separate directory for
them.  As a general convention, Joe called the "first" file
"index.html" -- this document would have links pointing to other
documents that are part of his resume in the same directory.<p>

<dt>Other References
<dd>The other links point to other servers, and thus are specified
with Full <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URLs.</a>
</dl>
<p>

<h2>A note on the URLs presented in this example</h2>

The above document made extensive use of the concept of relative URLs.
Relative URLs are references that describe how to find another
document <b>relative</b> to the current document.  This concept is
analogous to the concept of <b>relative</b> pathnames and <b>full</b> pathnames
in a UNIX environment.  For example, when at a shell prompt in your
home directory, you could do either:<p>

<tt>cd .www</tt><br>
or<br>
<tt>cd /home/login_name/.www</tt><p>

Both of those would change your present working directory to your
".www" directory, however one is much shorter and easier.<p>

A similar function is available in HTML documents.  When a client is
looking at the top to your web tree (The URL
<tt>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/index.html</tt>) the
client's <i>present working directory</i>(in shell terminology)
is: 
"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>", so, as in the above
example, to retrieve the document
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/General.html</tt>, all
the client needs to know is the relative path from where he currently
is -- just simply "General.html" as was shown in the example.<p>

Another method in which URLs can be relative is to a particular
server.  In this case, the initial slash is included in the URL, but
the server name is not.  For example, in the personal web page example
above, the partial URL at the bottom is simply a '/'.  Since the
client is already at our Web Server, referring them to '/' will cause
them to return to the Top of our Web Server.  As another example, to
refer to friend's web page from your own, you could include an
anchor like:<p>

<tt>&lt;a href="/home/my_friend/index.html"&gt;My friend's Personal
Page&lt;/a&gt;</tt><p>

where <i>my_friend</i> is your friend's login name.<p>

Another benefit of using relative URLs is that they allow for
flexibility when it becomes necessary to rename or reorganize
things. For example, if a 'tree' of a 1000 documents needed to be
moved, and they all reference each other with <i>full</i> URLs a
couple hundred times, it would be necessary to edit a couple hundred
anchors.<p>

However, with the wise use of <i>relative</i> URLs a lot of this
effort can be saved.  In our example, say the original URL was:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/Hundreds_of_Documents/index.html, and we
decided we needed to rename "Hundreds_of_Documents" to "docs" because
it was too long and too many people misspelled it.  Well, if all of
the documents in the "Hundreds_of_Documents" used relative URLs, the
change of the directory name would not affect the anchors internal to
those documents, because they would reference each other 'relative' to
where they are first located.<p>

A word of caution, however, is in order.  One gripe many people have
with relative URLs often is just a simple '/'.  Yes, a forward-slash.
This slash is so important that if you have an extra one, or are
missing one, then relative URLs can be broken.  For example, say in
our personal web page example from above.  If a client was to request
the document:<p>

<tt>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/<i>login_name</i>/index.html/</tt><p>

(note the trailing '/')  That client would think the 'present working
directory' would be '/home/login_name/index.html' -- when in fact,
index.html is a File, not a Directory.  But the client has no way of
knowing that, everything up to the last '/' in the URL is considered
the 'present working directory'.  So be careful with those slashes.
:)<p>

As somewhat of a a side note, 'index.html' is often not required as
part of a URL.  Our server, and many others are trained to look for a
number of 'index' files, 'index.html' being one of the most common.
However, the trailing slash again becomes an annoyance.  In this case,
since the URL without 'index.html' is referring to a Directory, and
not a File, the trailing slash NEEDS to be included, otherwise the
client will not know the correct 'present working directory'.  One
NICE feature of the <a
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html">CERN
`httpd'</a> is that it has the ability to <a
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html#z10">redirect</a>
the client the correct URL containing the trailing-slash, thus
correcting the clients' mistake and curing one of the problems with
relative URLs.(<a href="/home/bdowling/">I</a> commend this feature,
interestingly, <a href="/home/bdowling/">I</a> had thought about it
before even knowing it was implemented in Cern's server.)  However,
since I notice how often this is a problem, I tend to always include
the 'index.html' on the end now, at least as anchors in html
documents.  The presence of the 'index.html' perhaps makes it more
apparent that I am referring to a file.
(http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/login_name/ verse
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/login_name/index.html is an example of
this some users have experienced.)<p>

As a final lesson that can be learned from the presented example; the
use of Full URLs.  When we are referencing a document with a full URL,
we used Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).  (Hostnames have no
relative quality as pathnames do.)  Although the URL http://www/ may
work while you are sitting on a machine inside the domain ccs.neu.edu
(and be nice and short), it would not have the expected results if the
President was to select it (The President lives in the domain
whitehouse.gov, in case you didn't know).  Instead, the President's
client would be attempting to connect to the server at the (presently)
non-existent hostname of www.whitehouse.gov.  So be sure you use the
fully qualified names, we don't want the President to be upset at
broken links on our site. <a href="/web/Personal-Pages.html">(Even with our disclaimer! :)</a><p>

EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY on <A HREF="../index.html">EurophysNet
</A><P>

<H2>European Physical Society Information</H2><BR>
The European Physical Society serves the dual purpose of providing a forum for individual physicists, and acting as a federation of national societies and academies.
<P>
<STRONG>Membership</STRONG><P>

About 3000 physicists, from over 50 countries and with a variety of occupations, are individual members of EPS (<A HREF="membership_information.html">Individual Ordinary Members</A>), while the 70 000 members of 36<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/europa.html"> National Members Societies</A> that belong to EPS are able to participate in EPS activities. Essentially all the countries of Europe which have an active physics community are represented. Moreover, scientific communities with strong physics interests, more directly identified with other disciplines or regions of the world outside Europe, are involved as <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/collab.html">Collaborating Societies</A>, while research centres and commercial organisations participate as <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/associate.html">Associate Members</A>.
<P>
<STRONG>Organization</STRONG><P>

The EPS is governed by a <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/council.html">Council</A> which includes delegates appointed by the National Member Societies and Delegates of the individual members, the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division.html">Divisions</A> and <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir//interdiv.html">Interdivisional Group</A>s, and the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/associate.html">Associate Members</A>. Council elects from amongst its number an <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/exg/exec.html">Executive Committee</A> which is responsible for the running of the Society, with the support of a permanent <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/secret.html">Secretariat</A>. <P>

The scientific activities of the EPS are organized through the seven <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division.html">Divisions</A>, covering the major sub-fields of physics, and eight <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv.html">Interdivisional Groups</A>. In addition, three <A HREF="/dir/action.html">Action Committees</A> are concerned with various aspects of international collaboration and interactions between the physics community and society. A <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/mobility.html">Mobility Committee</A> manages the European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students (EMSPS). Admission to the <A HREF="/eurphys">European Register of Physicists</A> is decided by a <A HREF="/dir/profqual/register.html">Register Commission</A>. Those admitted may use the designation European Physicist <A HREF="../eurphys">(Eur Phys</A>).
<P><STRONG>Location</STRONG><P>

The Society's Secretariat is about two kilometres from the centre of Geneva in Petit-Lancy.

<LI><A HREF=MAILTO:eps@cern.ch>Mailto eps@cern.ch</A><P>

It should be noted that the Secretariat will be located in Mulhouse, France, as from 1 January 1997.
</UL><BR><B>Division and Interdivisional Groups</B>
<P>
Each of the Society's 14 <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division.html">Divisions</A> and<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv.html"> Interdivisional Group</A>s carries out a variety of activities covering conferences, prizes, newsletters, coordination networks, peer review,  etc. related to their specialities. The EPS Secretariat is often called upon to help, especially when it comes to administering membership and mailing lists, organizing elections, promoting conferences, providing Internet-based services, channelling applications for funds to international bodies, establishing programme committees and editorial boards, etc.

<P>

<STRONG>Strategic Planning of Activities</STRONG>
<P>
The Society's activities are presently being recast within the framework of a <A HREF="../ene/ene_jun96_strategy_text.html">Strategy Plan</A> for EPS. The Executive Committee will implement the Strategy Plan by evaluating proposals for activities and action plans that are being sent in by all the Society's bodies. A preliminary round of proposals have been received. Individual members of the Executive Committee are now discussing these proposals with their originators.<P>
<B>Conferences</B>
<P>
Most of the Divisions and Groups organize annual or biennial meetings, sometimes in collaboration with other international organizations (see 1996 <A HREF="../conf/eps.html">EPS Organized and Sponsored Conferences</A>). Most are the major event in their field in Europe and some form an international series.<P>

In the case of the Condensed Matter Division representing about one-half of the membership, the Division's annual General Conference is held every third year in collaboration with the French, German or UK societies, while four of its Sections hold series of meetings, often on a regular basis. 
<P>

The EPS General Conference "Trends in Physics" is held every three years. The next (EPS 11) will take place in London on 6-10 September 1999 and is organized by the <A HREF="www.iop.org">Institute of Physics</A>. It allows eminent scientists to present the latest developments to a general audience that includes young physicists who are starting out on their careers. It is usually organized by a national society or societies, with EPS being responsible for the programme.
<P><B>Education Activities</B>
<P>
The European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students (<A HREF="http://130.88.203.16/emsps/">EMSPS</A>) which the Society set up and <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/mobility.html">supervises</A> enables students to study at a university in another country while retaining the course credits. Mobility stays have been funded by special donations and by grants from the European Union's TEMPUS and ERASMUS (now SOCRATES) programmes. A staff member is employed full time to administer the scheme.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv/ped.html">Interdivisional Group on Physics Education</A> aims to coordinate mobility activities under a general framework that includes its Forum on Education and a section dealing with university teaching. Special meetings are planned, including a symposium at the next General Conference on aspects of physics education. The European Physics Education network (<A HREF="http://allserv.rug.ac.be/~hferdin/eupen/">EUPEN</A>) is a major new initiative with which the Group has been involved from the outset. It is funded by the European Union's SOCRaTES programme.
<P><B>Physics and Society</B>
<P>
General aspects of the interaction between the physics community and society at large are handled by the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/action/acps.html">Action Committee for Physics and Society</A>. It holds regular workshops on topics such as employment, energy use and the public understanding of science. Most are based on surveys carried out in advance in collaboration with national societies and lead to a publication.
<P><B>Links with Industry</B>
<P>
Links with industry have long been recognized as an important aspect of the Society's work. A former action committee led to the establishment of the Interdivisional Group for Applied Physics and Physics in Industry (<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv/igappi.html">IGAPPI</A>). It organizes the very successful Europhysics Industrial Workshops that bring together university and industrial physicists working on specific topics in emerging new technologies. There has been in the past special activities for EPS Associate Members which include a wide range of industrial companies. The annual meeting with the Associates will now be incorporated into the work of the Group. This year's meeting will be held in Mulhouse on 29 November. Other Groups, notably the Group for Experimental Physics Control Systems (<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv/epcs.html">EPCS</A>), also have special links to industrial partners.
<P><B>EPS Lecturer</B>
<P>
The Society organizes a series of open lectures throughout Europe by a distinguished EPS Lecturer.

Regular meetings are held with representatives of national societies from east and central Europe (E&amp;CE) in order to initiate and coordinate general initiatives covering such topics as student mobility, conferences, publications, science policy, and science management. The Society has established special arrangements for distributing it bulletin <A HREF="../en">Europhysics News</A> in the region and grants are provided to support young physicists attending the General Conference.
<P>
East-west activities are coordinated by the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/exg/tgew.html">East-West Task Force</A> comprising executive officers of national socities from the region. <P><B>Qualifications</B>
<P>
Qualification activities are organized through the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/action/acc.html">Action Committee for Conferences</A>, the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/action/acp.html">Action Committee for Publications</A> (which is presently being transformed into a new action committeee with a wider remit) and the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/profqual/rc.html">Register Commission</A> for the European Register of Physicists. They include conference sponsorship, the EPS Recognized Journal qualification, and most recently, professional qualifications which have involved working with the European Commission (EC) on the recognition and granting of Eur Phys, a designation that is increasingly appreciated by members. The Conference Committee also coordinates Division and Group proposals to the EC for support, either as EC-sponsored events or as EC-funded European Research Conferences in Physics co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation.
<P><B>Prizes</B>
<P>
In addition to helping administer the High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize, the Quantum Electronics Prize, and the Accelerator Prize, the Secretariat manages the annual Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize. The Amaldi International Prize for high-school textbooks is awarded in collaboration with the EPS Forum on Education.
<P><B>Administrative Services</B>
<P>
The Secretariat's records of membership represent a major contribution to the work of the Divisions and Groups because they serve as their links to members of national societies. The Secretariat also handles, under contract, the Secretariat of the European Astronomical Society (EAS) which is in partnership with EPS in the Joint EPS-EAS <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division/apd.html">Astrophysics Division</A>. Up to 25 scholarships to EPS sponsored Erice schools are administered by the Secretariat each year along with Heraeus Grants for young physicists to attend EPS organized meetings, and Mayer Foundation Grants for scientists from E&amp;CE. 
<P><B>Publications</B>
<P>
The Action Committee for Publications encompasses working groups that promote European physics journals and harmonise standards and systems of interest to physicists covering all aspects of publications. These activities lead to regular workshops and reports. The committee advises on EPS publications and coordinates its work with the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/exg/icg.html">Internet Coordination Group</A> that develops and supervises the Society's <A HREF="/index.html">EurophysNet</A> World-Wide Web (WWW) service.
<P>
<A HREF="../en">Europhysics News</A> is the major vehicle by which the national societies and the individual membership are kept in touch with one another. It is published in collaboration with Springer Verlag with EPS and the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/publications/en.html">Editorial Board</A> being fully responsible for the editorial content. It is currently published six times a year and is distributed to the membership, either directly to Individual Ordinary Members or indirectly through national societies unless special arrangements are made. Europhysics News also takes charge of various information sources that are distributed in parallel via WWW such as the <A HREF="../conf">Europhysics Meetings List</A>, the Europhysics Directory of Large Facilities in Physics (which is supported by the EC) and the <A HREF="/dir">EPS Directory</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="Http://www.ed-phys.fr/docinfos/OnlineEURO.html">Europhysics Letters</A> is a letters journal published by a partnership between EPS and 16 national societies. It is published under the scientific responsibility of EPS which appoints the Editorail Board of <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/publications/eps.html">Coeditors and the Honorary Editors</A>. The EPS Secretariat  handles business management as well as manuscripts up until acceptance for publication. This arrangement will ceases on 1 January 1997 when the EPS Secretariat moves to Mulhouse. The Europhysics Letters management and editorial office will remain in Geneva. It is significant that as a result of the partnership the Europhysics Letters venture generates income, with a new issue appearing every 10 days.
<P>
The European Journal of Physics publishes scholarly articles for university staff. Initiated by EPS, it is a very successful partnership between the EPS and the Institute of Physics Publishing that brings income.
 The <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/publications/ejp.html">Editorial Board</A> is appointed by EPS.<P>
The <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/publications/eca.html">Europhysics Conference Abstracts</A> series of extended abstracts of Divisional Conferences are published by EPS in collaboration with conference organizers. 
<P><B>Special Activities</B>
<P>
In recent years, two administrative responsibilities have been undertaken by the Secretariat. First, the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union ( INTAS) provided EPS with some half million Swiss francs in 1994, and again in 1995, for the provision of journals to the FSU. Second, the Soros Foundations provided 350 kSFR in 1994 and the same in 1995 to facilitate the movement of students from East and Central Europe within the framework of the EMSPS scheme.
<P><B>New Activities</B>
<P>
The Solidarity Fund financed by a levy on participation at Divisional conferences is administered by the Secretariat. It has been established to provide seed money for new conference series and to make it possible for people from economically poor parts of Europe to attend EPS conferences, workshops and schools.
<P>
The Lapereau Fund was established recently, with an annual budget of SFR 10000, so that small sums could be made available at short notice during the year for an activity that was not included in the budget approved each year by Council in March. In this way the Society can give encouragement to lapereau (French for "little rabbit") that might grow into something larger.<P><HR>

<H3>THE EUROPEAN REGISTER OF PHYSICISTS</H3>
<H2>GUIDANCE NOTES FOR CANDIDATES</H2>

<BR>
<H3>PURPOSE</H3>

<BR>
The European Register of Physicists is open to all physicists in Europe.<P>

Admission to the Register entitles an individual to use the designation European Physicist with the abbreviation Eur Phys. The qualification should be particularly useful for those working in areas where a European identification of the physicist is likely to be required or may be useful, especially in relation to employment.<P>

Working conditions are changing: long-term positions have become the exception rather than the rule and self-employment as a consultant is becoming more common. In this environment, the professional qualification European Physicist could be a valuable asset.<P>

Inclusion of a physicist on the Register will give the public an assurance that the physicist concerned has satisfied the Register requirements and has agreed to adhere to a Code of Conduct. Furthermore, those who are on the Register of European Physicists will be kept informed of the latest developments about professional aspects relating to the practice of physics.<P>
<H3>REQUIREMENTS</H3>
<BR>
For admission to the Register it is necessary to produce evidence satisfactory to the Register Commission that the candidate has successfully completed a minimum total period of seven years of professional formation, including:<UL><LI>at least three years of university education in physics or in a physics-related discipline to an academic level acceptable to the Register Commission&#59;<LI>
at least two years of responsible post-graduation experience which may include a period of training&#59;<LI>
at least two years of additional university education and/or appropriate post-graduation experience.</UL><BR>
The initial phase of post-graduation experience may include training, whether formal or otherwise, but a candidate will be expected to demonstrate a capacity for independent judgment in work related to physics or its application. The nature of the experience may include research, project management, the supervision and training or others and safety management. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate an awareness of responsibility to the public when this is implicit in the nature of the work.<P>

<H3>How to complete the application form</H3>
<BR>
The standard <A HREF="application.html">application form</A> must be completed in all cases, but reference may be made in sections of the form to details given in a curriculum vitae which should be attached to the form.<P>

Please attach to the form copies of documentary evidence of academic awards.<P>

In the section headed PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE please enter details of your present employment and, in chronological order, other principal appointments you have held since graduation.<P>

Please read the instructions on the SUPPORTING STATEMENT carefully. The <A HREF="/dir/profqual/emc.html">European Regional Monitoring Committee</A> and the <A HREF="/dir/profqual/register.html">Register Commission</A> will consider this statement when assessing your application. You may attach to your application additional sheets if you so wish. Where instances of State security or company confidentiality prevent you from making a full description, this should be stated.<P>

Please note that you are asked to give the name of a professional REFEREE.<P>

Finally, please check to ensure that you have completed all sections of the form, including the DECLARATION.<P><H3>Submitting the application form</H3>

<BR>
The form should be submitted, together with payment of the application fee of <STRONG>70.&#173; Dutch guilders</STRONG>, to:<MENU><LI>Dr. E.W.A. Lingeman, Secretary, European Regional Monitoring Committee
<LI>
NIKHEF, P.O. Box 94395, NL-1090 GJ Amsterdam
</MENU><BR>
Payment can be by cheque (made out the European Regional Monitoring Committee) or by bank transfer to Postbank Arnhem, account number 1347301. This application fee is non-refundable.<P>

Some EPS National Member Societies have a representative on the European Regional Monitoring Committee who will be asked to advise the Committee. Societies with such a representative are indicated on an accompanying list.<P>

You may wish to send the Secretariat of a National Member Society to which you belong a copy of your application so that its representative can become acquainted with your application beforehand.<P>

<H3>The next steps</H3>

<BR>
As soon as your application has been received you will be sent an acknowledgment. The Regional Monitoring Committee will consider your application at its next meeting, but it may need to make further enquiries before passing a report and its recommendation to the Register Commission. When the Register Commission has been made its decision, the result will be communicated to you immediately. You will then be asked to pay an initial registration fee of 250.&#173; Swiss francs to cover the first five-year registration period.<P>

Confirmation of completion of registration will be sent to you in the form of a diploma. (In some instances you may be invited to attend a ceremony at which the diploma will be presented to you).<P>

During your period of registration you will be entitled:<UL><LI>to use the designation European Physicist&#59;<LI>
to use the designatory letters Eur Phys&#59;<LI>
to receive regular information bulletins.</UL><BR>
<H3>On expiry of the registration period</H3>

<BR>
Upon expiration of the initial five-year period of registration, it will be possible to renew the registration without the need to submit a new application (although you might be asked update information).<HR><H3>HOW TO APPLY</H3>
</H3>

If you are able to print out the Application Form (<A HREF="application.html">.html simple version</A>) or (<A HREF="/services/docs.html">.ps/.pf look-alike versions</A>), you may use it to apply.<P>

Otherwise applications should be made on the Application Form that may be obtained either from one of the National Members Societies of the European Physical Society (EPS) listed in an <A HREF="brochure.html">information brochure</A> or directly from the Secretary of the European Regional Monitoring Committee or from the  <A HREF="dir/secret.html">EPS Secretariat</A>:<P>

<STRONG>A new professional qualification for the physicist ........</STRONG>

<P>
The designation European Physicist (abbreviated as Eur Phys) is a new qualification for physicists. It may therefore need a brief introduction.<P>

Formal professional qualifications exist in many occupations. Generally, a person receives such a qualification on the basis of a combination of academic attainments and experience in a profession. Where they exist, however, there are for some professions wide differences between formal systems of recognition, in the body awarding the qualification, in the criteria applied, and in the code of conduct an applicant is expected to abide by.<P>

Such differences may restrict the opportunities for citizens of a given country to exercise their profession elsewhere. In the case of the European Union, the European Commission, which has been active for some time in promoting the mutual recognition of academic degrees, is now also taking initiatives regarding professional qualifications.<P>

Partly in response to this, national societies or institutes covering various fields of science and technology have collaborated in establishing several European Registers for qualified professionals.<P>

In physics, the situation is somewhat different from that found in most other disciplines as there exists the European Physical Society (EPS) which one can join directly or through a national physical society. Moreover, the EPS is not confined geographically to the European Union.<P>

Given its unique position, EPS has set up the European Register of Physicists and the necessary procedures for handling applications for entry on the Register.<P>

Some may question whether there is a need for this, arguing that physicists are often employed not so much on the basis of what they have done in the past, but rather on their promise for the future.<P>

However, working conditions are changing: long-term positions have become the exception rather than the rule, and self-employment as a consultant is becoming more common. In this environment, the professional qualification European Physicist could be a valuable asset.<P><HR><BR>
<H3>Requirements for admission to the Register

</H3><UL><LI>The academic qualification must be in physics or in a physics-related area which is acceptable to the Register Commission. It may have involved at least the equivalent of three years' full-time university-level education.<BR>
<LI>

Evidence of at least two years' appropriate experience gained in a professional  capacity  after graduating is also required. This experience could include research and development, project management, supervision and the training of others, and safety management.<BR>
<LI>

The remaining period, which must have lasted for at least two years, may consist of either education leading to an academic qualification or appropriate experience involving responsibilities and deemed satisfactory by the Register Commission. It must also include a period of training during which the applicant has acquired aptitudes or skills needed to exercise in the chosen profession and in a responsible capacity.
</UL>
<HR>
<H4>If you are included on the European Register of Physicists you will be .....<BR>
</H4>..... able to use the designation European Physicist and its abbreviation Eur Phys&#59;<P>

..... kept informed of developments in the way physicists are being recognized professionally.<BR><HR>

<BR>
<H3>How you apply for registration as a European Physicist</H3>
  <BR>
An application form may be obtained either from the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/secret.html">Geneva Secretariat</A> of the European Physical Society or from many of the national physical societies that are listed <A HREF="#nslist">here</A> or as an <A HREF="application.html">on-line document</A>.<P>

Upon completion the form should be sent, together with the non-refundable application fee, to the Secretary of the European Regional Monitoring Committee  (<A HREF="#address">address</A>), as indicated in the <A HREF="guide.html">guidance notes</A> accompanying the form.<P>

A <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/profqual/emc.html">European Regional Monitoring Committee</A> evaluates the application. It is assisted by independent experts familiar with the regions in which you have trained and worked. The Committee then makes a short summary and a recommendation to the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/profqual/register.html">Register Commission</A>.<P>

The Commission reviews the summary and recommendation to ensure uniform, high standards. If it is satisfied,  you will be invited to pay  the registration fee for admission to the European Register of Physicists for an initial period lasting five years.<P>

Thereafter, registration will be renewable without the need to submit a new application (although you might be asked to update your first application).<P>

You will be provided with a formal certificate of registration. From then on you will be able to use the designation European Physicist.<BR>
<HR><BR>

The <A HREF="/info">EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY</A> was founded in 1968 to contribute to and promote the advancement of physics in Europe. It does this by providing a forum for physicists as individuals and as members of professional Divisions and Groups, by acting as a federation of national physical societies, and by serving as a meeting point for laboratories and industry.<P>

<H3>Action Committees</H3>
<H2>Guidelines for Membership and Operation of Committees</H2>
Doc.No. B/2/89;  approved by the EPS Executive Committee, 28/6/89<P>

1.  According  to article 20 e) of the Constitution the Executive Committee is  empowered to appoint Committees entrusted with special tasks within the general framework of the Society.<P> 

2.  Tasks  to  take  action  by  a Committee are specified by the Executive Committee, which also appoints the Chairman. The Committee Chainmen are invited to the meetings of the Executive Committee. <P>

3.  Committees report to the Executive Committee by <P>
- written  reports  by  the  Chairman for each meeting of the Executive Committee; <P>
- one  written short annual report for the President to be presented to Council;<P>
- written  progress  reports  on specific activities whenever important changes occur;<P>
- sending to the EPS Secretariat in Geneva copies of meeting schedules, agendas, minutes of meetings and important correspondence.<P>

4.  Important  events in Committee activities should be summarized in short reports for publication in <A HREF="../../pub/en/index.html">Europhysics News</A>.<P>

5.  The  Members of the Executive Committee and the Executive Secretary are entitled to participate in all events of Committees.<P> 

6.  Effectiveness of work calls for keeping the committees small; ideally a Committee  should  consist  of  10-12 dedicated Members. To ensure wide coverage  of  fields  and geographical areas Committees may establish a net  of  correspondents  with  the  help  of  the  <A HREF="../secret.html">EPS Secretariat</A>. The Executive  Secretary will  ensure  that  all the <A HREF="../europa.html">National Societies</A> be informed about the activities of the Committees.<P>
7.  The  nomination  of  Members  of  Committees  shall  be effected by the Chairman  in  consultation with the Executive Committee which takes the final  dec1sion.  Membership should be on a rotating basis according to the  needs of the actiYities. Mem~ership of a Committee should normally not  exeeed  five  years. The National Societies will be consulted for proposals of Committee Members.<P>

8.  At  present  all  the activities of Committees have to be qperated in a self-suppnrting way except administrative tasks which can be taken care of by the EPS Secretariat. Efforts will be made through the Fundraising Committee (this committeee no longer exists) to contribute to the cost of Committee activities. <P>

<H3>Forthcoming Items</H3><HR>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>FEATURES</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Inverse Radiation Therapy Planning</STRONG>
<P>
A. Brahme from the Karolinska Instituet, Stockholm, describes the development of advanced methods of radiation dose delivery for cancer therapy based on inverse radiation planning where one calculates the distribution of the absorbed dose in tissue.
<P>
<STRONG>Measuring the Equation of State with Lasers</STRONG>
<P>
Equations of state of solid materials at high pressures are of crucial importance in such areas as inertial confinement fusion and astrophysics. Groups from the Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, Garching, the Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, and the University of Milan describe how high-intensity laser pulses can now be used to measure the equations for materials ranging from foams to solid iron.
<P>
<STRONG>The Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Distribution</STRONG>
<P>
F. Joos from the Climate and Environmental Physics Group, Institute of Physics, University of Bern, explains why in spite of about one-half of released carbon being sequestered by the ocean and the land biosphere, stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and thus a limitation of greenhouse gas warming, requires that carbon emissions are reduced well below 1990 levels. For if adverse climate changes do indeed materialise, trends may be persistent and even become aggravated.
<P>
<STRONG>Critical Fields in High-Temperature Superconductors</STRONG>
<P>
A. Dulcic from the Rudjer Bovskovic Institute, Zagreb, reports that by using microwave methods one can determine upper critical fields which lie beyond the field of laboratory magnets,thus avoiding ambiguities associated with the broadened transitions in high-temperature superconductors.
<P>
<STRONG>1996 Nobel Prize in Physics</STRONG>
<P>
An appreciation of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics that was awarded to D. Lee and R. Richardson (Cornell University) and D. Osheroff (Stanford University) for the discovery, in 1972, of superfluidity in helium-3, a substance that recently entered the news with announcements by groups in Grenoble and Helsinki of the formation of vortices under neutron irradiation with densities similar to those predicted for cosmic strings.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>FACILITIES</I></STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>The TESLA Scientific Centre</STRONG>
<P>
N. Neskovic reports on the creation of a regional scientific centre in Belgrade.
<P>
<STRONG>Facilities  in Physics</STRONG>
<P>
E.W.A. Lingeman discusses the results of a survey carried out on behalf of the European Commission on the use of experimental facilities in physics. It was found that the number of external users increase rapidly as the size of the facility increases, but the rate of increase slackens at large sizes, reaching a maximum at some 2000 external users.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>EVENTS</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>1996 Particle Accelerator Conference</STRONG>
<P>
V. Suller from the Daresbury Laboratory in the UK reports on the latest developments in particle accelerators as seen through the eyes of participants at the 1996 European Particle Accelerator Conference (EPAC 1996). Included is a highlight on the research and development of linacs for particle physics by R. Ruth of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, California.
<P>
<STRONG>1996 Quantum Electronics and Optics Conference</STRONG>
<P>
Highlights of the 1996 European Quantum Electronics and Optics Conference that was held on Hamburg in conjunction with the Conference on Lasers and Electro-optics (CLEO). J.C. Webb of Oxford University and R. Corbalan of the Autonomous University, Barcelona, review the latest developments in the fast-moving world of  lasers and quantum devices.
<P>
<STRONG>Nanostructures and  Nanodevices</STRONG>
<P>
H.-J. Fecht and R.E. Palmer who chaired EPS industrial workshops in Berlin and Birmingham, respectively, summarise the latest advances in applying nanostructured materials and devices. Included are highlights on devices based on amorphous materials.  
<P>
<LI><STRONG>OPINION</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Limited Mobility: The UK Case</STRONG>
<P>
S. Robins , a research associate at Queen Mary College, London University, considers the example of the UK in attempting to understand why job mobility within the European Union is low in spite of the generally positive attitude of young people and the energy devoted to creating the single market. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>PHYSICS AND SOCIETY</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Ion Beam Analysis in Art and Archaeology</STRONG>
<P>
G. Demortier from Namur who chairs the COST Action <I>Ion Beam Analysis Applied to Art and Archaeology</I> explains how accelerator techniques are being applied in art within the framework of an international cooperative programme.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>AROUND THE REGIONS</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Regional Organizations and the Globalization in Physics</STRONG>
<P>
G. Akdeniz from Istanbul who is the President of the Balkan Physical Union argues that regional non-governmental organizations such as the Union play a vital role in stabilising scientific and cultural traditions in multi-ethnic communities. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>NEWS FROM EPS</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>EPS Divisions and Groups</STRONG>
<P>
Profiles of EPS Divisions and Groups are presented in order to help National Society Members identify groups of interest.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>EUROPHYSICS MEETINGS CALENDAR</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>1997/1998 Meetings in Physics</STRONG>
<P>
A 10-page listing of conferences, schools and workshops of interest to European physicists (available at <A HREF="../../conf/index.html">http://epswww.epfl.ch</A>).

<TITLE>Europhysics News: Instructions for authors</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG SRC="../../logos/eps_logo.gif" ALT=" EPS">
<P><STRONG>European Physical Society</STRONG> on <A HREF="../../index.html">EurophysNet</A><P>
<A HREF="http://enimpressum.html"><H3>europhysics news</H3></A>
<H2>Guidelines for Authors</H2>
<STRONG>SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS</STRONG><BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Motivation</STRONG>
<P>
You are asked to contribute an article to <I>Europhysics News</I> to promote your scientific topic and field to a broad audience. Our circulation is wide and is drawn 
from all sections of physics.<BR>

<P>
Long articles of about 3500 words aim to review the latest developments in a topic; short articles of 1500-2000 words aim to give a flavour of the latest development  in a specific new, &quot;hot&quot; topic.<BR>

<P>
Both types should be concise, straightforward and the ideas accessible to a wide audience: the reader should be persuaded to read even if the ideas presented are not immediately self-evident.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Commissioning</STRONG>
<P>
All proposals for articles are put before the Editorial Board where they are discussed, often via electronic messages, etc. as the Board generally meets only once each year. The Editor is then asked to invite authors to contribute.
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Level</STRONG>
<P>
Our readers are physicists: specialists 
in different fields as well as students, physics teachers and 
industrial physicists who will not be specialised. Assume a knowledge of general physics: classical and quantum mechanics, basic atomic physics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and the corresponding mathematics and chemistry, but very little knowledge of your special field. Please do <U>not</U>:<BR>

<P>
- use jargon unless you define it;
<P>
- be afraid of mathematical descriptions, 
but use no more than eight equations per article. Please define 
all symbols somewhere.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Style</STRONG>
<P>
Readers hope to learn something new (for them) and interesting, but they are still reading for pleasure so they want a text which is easy to read. So:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>avoid long lists and boring tables;
<LI>do not worry about completeness and absolute rigour;
<LI>make sure ideas come across clearly by not getting caught 
up in details.<BR>

</UL>

<P>
The Editor will often take parts of the text and put it into boxed inserts to help break up long manuscripts into eye-catching pieces. Please think of this when 
you write. <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Contents</STRONG>
<P>
<I>Europhysics News</I>
is not a primary journal: but we try to be topical. What we ask 
for is a review of a topic of current interest that analyses the 
results of other workers in a field, and not just your own work.
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>References</STRONG>
<P>
Very few readers will take the trouble 
to consult references to understand an article. So try to make 
an article as self-contained as possible. If you do not have space 
to explain an item, do not mention it at all.<BR>

<P>
Some references are useful, especially 
recent ones, as they allow interested readers to start somewhere 
if they wish to go deeper into a topic. But the references must 
be easily available (preferably widely available journals). Some 
references for further reading are sometimes useful, so give both 
conventional references and further reading if necessary. Supplementary 
references based on Internet links are encouraged.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Figures</STRONG>
<P>
Good and lively figures are essential 
(about 4-6 in total, including photographs). 
Photographs of people and equipment liven up an article. But our 
intention is not to trivialise good science so we prefer keeping 
the scientific information presented in a &quot;scientific&quot; 
format, often as a copy of an original figure in a journal article.
<BR>

<P>
If we feel a figure is too overloaded 
and technical we shall suggest changes that we would carry out 
for you. We do not generally use block colour to give the appearance 
of full-colour as this often trivialises information.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Colour</STRONG>
<P>
Colour can be accepted, sometimes 
at the author's expense, but often at no cost if the Editor can 
place colour illustrations on certain pages. So colour figures 
are encouraged and should be discussed with the Editor.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Figure Captions</STRONG>
<P>
Longish, self explanatory captions 
are encouraged: some readers may initially only scan figures and 
captions.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Biographical Details</STRONG>
<P>
<I>Europhysics News</I>
likes to publish short biographical details of each of the authors. 
So please add at the end of your text a short paragraph that summarises, 
past and present positions, education, prizes, books published. 
Alternatively, please include standard CV's or suchlike.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Length</STRONG>
<P>
<I>Europhysics News</I>, 
as mentioned above, publishes:<BR>

<P>
- longer articles of 3-4 printed 
pages. <BR>

<P>
Equivalent to 2500-3500 words of 
6.5 characters in length (the English norm). Total: about 6-8 
A4 typed pages;<BR>

<P>
- short articles on &quot;hot&quot; 
topics of 1-2 printed pages. Equivalent to 1500-2000 words.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Language</STRONG>
<P>
Your articles will be sub-edited 
for obvious problems of language. But we do not rewrite as we 
try to preserve the flavour of the original. The Editor is used 
to working with non-English speakers and hopefully has learnt 
to balance freedom of expression with reasonable English.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Reviewing</STRONG>
<P>
All long articles are read by all 
members of the Editorial Board who recommend clarifications, changes, 
etc. (occasionally articles are rejected, but this is rare as 
all articles are invited). Short articles are read by Board Members 
specialising in your field. Comments are occasionally sought elsewhere.
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Editing</STRONG>
<P>
A sub-edited version of a proposed 
version of your text is sent to you for comment before sending 
it to the printer. This text will generally be a draft of the 
page layout as it would appear when printed. With it you will 
receive details of modifications sought and proposed changes that 
have been incorporated, subject to your approval of course.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Manuscripts</STRONG>
<P>
Production is presently entirely 
Mac-based using the latest photocomposition technologies. It involves 
the use of a normal word processor followed by loading into Quark 
XPress for page layout and photocomposition. The text you are 
sent for comment is the printout of the Quark layout<BR>

<P>
We basically accept manuscripts 
in any form as we do not have that many to process. But of course 
we prefer one that can be loaded directly into a standard wordprocessor 
or TEX processor (most authors will not have sophisticated page-layout 
programmes such as Quark XPress, PageMaker, FrameMaker, etc.).
<BR>

<P>
Your can send your manuscript as:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI><B>typed</B> pages which are scanned into the computer. But 
please try to use a standard font such as Times, Helvetica, Geneva, 
etc.
<LI><B>diskettes</B> (31/4) PC- or Mac-formatted holding copies 
of your wordprocessor or TEX/LATEX file and a &quot;flat&quot; 
ASCII (text) file. Including PostScript and/or encapsulated versions 
and an Adobe PDF files is a good idea if you have these.
<LI><B>electronically</B> by email (peter.boswell@cern.ch) as 
ASCII/TEX/LATEX text or as a file attachment or by FTP to epswww.epfl.ch; 
logon = epswww; password = /ask Editor); directory /disk3/usr/people/eps/incoming. 
An upload facility via the Netscape browser is also implemented 
(please ask the Editor for details). You can send compressed files 
provided the compression used is fairly standard (BinHex, Stuffit, 
UUencode, PKzip, .tar, .gz, etc.). Guidlines for trouble-free 
transmission of files by email are available at the Los Alamos 
eprint server (http://xyz.lanl.gov).
<LI><B>fax</B> (preferably at high resolution to the EPS telephone 
number +41-22-79311 31) so that we can capture the fax directly 
into a computer.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Figures</STRONG>
<P>
Figures (black and white and colour) 
can be:<BR>

<P>
- originals (line drawings, photographs, 
etc.) sent by normal mail to EPS, BP 69, CH-1213 Petit-Lancy 2.
<BR>

<P>
Figures are scanned and then adjusted 
for contrast, etc. So you can submit fairly &quot;rough&quot; 
figures of poor quality if this is all you have. Please try to 
use Helvetica fonts and remember that figures are usually reduced 
to 1- column (60 mm) and 2-column (120 mm) widths, so adjust letter-sizes 
accordingly. Line diagrams that are not too complicated are redrawn 
by computer, if necessary.<BR>

<P>
- computer files sent as above (diskette, 
email, FTP). They can be in virtually any standard format (PostScript, 
EPS, TIFF, PICT, JPEG....) and compressed. <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Europhysics News Extra</STRONG>
<P>
Items are generally made available 
electronically via WWW at the EPS EurophysNet (http://<A HREF="../index.html" >epswww.epfl.ch</A>) news service under <A HREF="..//ene" >europhysics news extra </A> (ENE). You will be asked if you do not object to having the draft version 
(clearly identified as such) loaded. This draft version is extremely 
useful as it is often used by the Board (and occasionally the 
author) during the process of finalising the text. A final version 
is then agreed with the author and loaded on ENE, replacing the 
draft version. <BR>

<P>
The item that is published in Europhysics 
News (EN) may, however, differ from the final ENE version owing 
to layout restrictions. If substantial changes are made to the 
final ENE version, the proposed final EN version is sent to the 
author for checking. The EN version is not released on EurophysNet.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Advertising</STRONG>
<P>
Europhysics News aims to accompany articles with targeted advertising 
to highlight the industrial relevance of much of physics. So authors 
are often asked to suggest possible advertisers to the Editor.
<P>
<HR>
Europhysics News, the Bulletin of the European Physical Society, 
is published at least six times each year in collaboration with 
Springer Verlag. It is edited and printed in Geneva and distributed 
by Springer Verlag to all our individual members. Many institutions 
and subscribers also receive copies for their libraries. Most 
European national societies receive multiple copies in bulk for 
further distribution. The total circulation is currently about 
30000 copies per issue. Advertising is handled by Springer Verlag.

<H3>EPS ORGANISED AND SPONSORED MEETINGS</H3>

<H2>GUIDELINES</H2>

<STRONG>EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY</STRONG><P>
The <A HREF="../../info/index.html">European Physical Society</A> is now recognised to be the central organisation for the coordination of international physics meetings in Europe. The Society protects the interests of physicists by encouraging high standards at European meetings and ensuring that the perceived needs are filled whilst avoiding proliferation and needless dissipation of effort. The two main instruments through which EPS achieves its aims are Approval and Sponsorship of events. For many physicists, EPS approval or sponsorship of a meeting is a key (even essential) criterion for them to receive authorisation and funding to attend. Meetings may be described as conferences, symposia, seminars, schools, workshops etc. Any of these may be eligible for approval or sponsorship, but to simplify the terminology they are referred to in EPS documents under the two main headings: Conferences and Schools.<P>


<STRONG>SPONSORSHIP</STRONG><P>

Meetings organised independently of EPS or one of its subdivision, but which are held in a country whose national society is a member of EPS, may be eligible for sponsorship (see also "<A HREF="#special">special cases</A>" below). <P>

"Sponsored by EPS" indicate that, following an examination of the arrangement for a meeting, the EPS <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/action/acc.html">Action Committee on Conferences </A>has formally agreed to award this distinction. The award has no financial implication: EPS does not give grants or guarantees.<P>

Sponsorship of EPS means that EPS has been satisfied on the following points:<P>

<DL>
<DD>1. The meting fulfills a clear need (topics, repetition rate) and, if a conference, deals with new and important advances made since the previous conference  on the same topic.<P>
<DD>2. The invited speakers and the papers accepted for discussion are of high caliber, and some form of refereeing procedure for submitted papers has been instituted.<P>
<DD>3. The scientific programme is determined by a Programme Committee in which at least 60% of the members  are from countries outside the hosting country and at least one half from European countries. A local committee may take care of detailed arrangements including refereeing.<P>
<DD>4. Participation is planned to be international and at least one half of the invited and contributed speakers are from countries other than the host  country.<P>
<DD>5. Nobody wishing to attend will be prevented from doing so because of nationality, race or religion. The organisers are required to assure themselves that freedom of entry will be accorded by the civil authorities.<P>
<DD>6. The registration fee demanded and the price of accommodation in the region where the meeting will be held are reasonable. A lower registration fee for EPS Individual Ordinary Members is strongly encouraged and also substantial reductions for students.
</DL>

Application for sponsorship should be made to the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/secret.html">EPS Secretariat</A> on the appropriate form (available at the Secretariat or as an <A HREF="form_spon.html">.html document</A>). EPS sponsorship can be announced only after authorisation to this effect has been received by the organisers.<P>
 

<STRONG>APPROVAL</STRONG><P>

Approved meetings are those organised (see also "<A HREF="#special">special cases</A>" below) by or through an EPS Division, Section or Inter-Divisional Group. The majority form part of a regular series, but this is not a requirement.<P>

Approved meetings satisfy all the criteria applicable to sponsored meetings and, in addition, conform to the norms laid down for such meetings by the EPS Advisory Committee on Conferences. They are distinguished by the word "Europhysics" appearing in the title and if abstracts are prepared, these are published in the <A HREF="../../pub/index.html#eca">Europhysics Conference Abstracts</A> series. The organisers are required to fix the basic registration fee for <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/europa.html">National Society Members</A> (NSM) with a reduction  for Individual Ordinary Members (IOM) and a substantial surcharge for non members. The students' fee should be considerably lower. A contribution to the Solidarity Fund (see document <A HREF="bc2694.html">Bc/2/94</A>) has to be build in the registration fee.<P>

One particular type of conference has been singled out for special consideration. This is the Europhysics Study Conference which is a meeting that lasts over a few days and is held in a secluded place to encourage total commitment. The programme is specifically designed to stimulate discussion. Attendance is limited to about 70 participants, mainly invited, of whom not more than one third may be from a single country and not more than half from any two. Normally no proceedings are published.<P>

For a meeting to be approved, application must be made on the appropriate application form available from the EPS Secretariat or as an <A HREF="form_app.html">.html document</A>.<P>


<HR>
<STRONG>* <A NAME="special">SPECIAL CASES</A></STRONG>

Special rules for International Conferences, Series organised by other bodies, and not always held in Europe:

<UL>
<LI>EPS may sponsor/approve such conferences provided that the following additional rule is satisfied:
<UL>
<LI>one member of the board of the corresponding Division/Section/Interdivisional Group will have to be member of the Programme Committee
</UL>
<LI>Furthermore
<UL>
<LI>the same (or another) member of that Division/Section/Interdivisional Group will belong to the Advisory Board of the next conference if not organised in Europe.
</UL></UL><HR>


<STRONG>ADVANCE NOTICE</STRONG><P>

Application for sponsorship or approval should be made at least <STRONG>nine months</STRONG> before the date of the meeting in order that the full benefit of EPS support can be gained. Late applications will be considered only in special circumstances.<P>

Sponsored meetings are printed in the Meetings Issues of <A HREF="../../pub/index.htnl#en">Europhysics News</A> in bold face; Approved meetings are, in addition, boxed.<P>

The 1995 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize for introducing fundamental concepts in physics that have had a profound impact on condensed matter science, notably the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Berry's phase, was awarded during a special symposium on quantum physics that took place during the Institute of Physics Annual Congress (Telford, 27-30 March 1995). Y. Aharonov and M.V. Berry, the prizewinners, are see here on the left and right, respectively, with L.S. Cutler from Hewlett-Packard.<BR><HR>
<BR>
<B>CALL FOR NOMINATIONS</B>
<BR>
<H3>1996 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize
</H3>
<BR>
The Selection Committee for the Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize invites nominations for the 1996 award. The Prize is given for an outstanding contribution to condensed matter physics within the last five years, with the potential for leading advances in electronic, electrical or materials engineering. Nominations may be submitted by EPS members (Individual Ordinary Members and National Society Members) as individuals or as a representative of a Division, Section or Group.

<H3>INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC UNIONS</H3>
<H3>Special Committee in Science in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union - ICSU-COMSCEE</H3>
<H4><CITE>This item is refered to in a Letter to the Editor by O. Lock</CITE></H4>
<HR>
<H3>History</H3>
<BR>
A Round Table on Science in a New Europe was organized at the 23rd General Assembly of ICSU in Sofia in October 1990. Following this, the Executive Board of ICSU set up an ad hoc committee to examine the ways in which ICSU could help relieve problems facing science in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).<P>

The 24th General Assembly of ICSU, held in Santiago de Chile in October 1993, decided to transform the terms of reference to the Committee for Science in Central and Eastern Europe (COMSCEE) by making it into a Special ICSU Committee and expanding its remit to cover the states of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).<P>

<H3>Objectives</H3>
<UL><LI>to define the current problems affecting science in CEE and the FSU
<LI>to explore ways in which ICSU might help relieve these problems</UL>

<H3>Activities</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>1.UNESCO/ICSU Mission to Russian Federation (1992)</STRONG><P>

In November 1992, the Chairman of COMSCEE undertook a mission to Moscow on behalf of the Director-General of UNESCO and of ICSU to look into the serious crisis facing science in the Russian Federation and to make suggestions for assistance.<P>

The recommendations from this mission have been followed up by ICSU and UNESCO.<P>

<STRONG>2. Evaluation of Science (1993)</STRONG><P>

The report of the evaluation of selected Institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences carried out by international teams coordinated by COMSCEE on behalf of ICSU was circulated widely and followed up in Hungary. COMSCEE has made it known that it would be prepared to organize similar evaluations at the request of appropriate authorities in other countries in the region, and preliminary enquiries have been received from several of these.<P>

<H3>Possible Future Actions</H3>
<BR>
COMSCEE has identified the following activities which should be undertaken by ICSU, either on its own or in partnership with other bodies.<P>

1. Organization of two workshops:
<UL><LI>A workshop on Funding of Science involving heads (and possibly managers) of independent national research funding organizations from the FSU, CEE and selected OECD countries.
<LI>A workshop on the Administration of Sciences involving government officials from Russia and selected OCED countries and perhaps some other countries in CEE and the FSU.</UL>
<P>
2. Independent reviews of scientific institutions on countries of the region: requests have been received to date from Moldova, Kirghizstan and Kazakhstan and are presently under examination.<P>

3. Rescue of endangered scientific reference and data collection by setting up the following process:
<UL><LI>circulation of a list of endangered collections of scientific importance (specimens and/or data) to COMSCEE members and to the appropriate decision-making bodies of the ICSU family who will be asked to add to the list and comment on any assistance they can give&#59;
<LI>bring this list to the attention of the media and funding agencies.</UL><P>

4. Organization of a meeting to evaluate assistance programmes already in place aimed at reducing brain drain (external and internal)<P>

5. Assistance with preparation of grant proposals either through individual visits or workshops<P>

6. Assistance with the setting up and optimum utilisation of electronic communication networks<P>

7. Provision of scientific journals and other publications through the ICSU International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP)<P>

8. Preparation of Directories of scientists and scientific information in the FSU and CEE<P>

9. Encouragement of the freedom of movement of scientists and of scientific information through the activities of the ICSU Standing Committee on Freedom in the Conduct of Science<P>

<H3>Leeds Castle Conferences (1993 &amp; 1994)</H3>
<BR>
In April 1993, at Leeds Castle, Kent, England, COMSCEE organized a high level Conference on the &quot;The Role of Science in Rebuilding Central and Eastern Europe&quot; which was jointly sponsored by ICSU, UNESCO and the European Community (now Union).<P>

The meeting brought together ministers of science, chairmen of parliamentary science commissions, and other influential decisions-makers from Central and Eastern European countries to exchange views with participants from West including decision-makers, industrialists, Nobel laureates, and individuals from international and other funding agencies. The opportunity provided at Leeds Castle for making personal contacts and for informal exchanges was enthusiastically welcomed and led to a unanimously agreed Conference Statement which stressed strongly the importance of science and technology both for achieving economic progress and prosperity, and as part of a nation's cultural heritage. The Conference Statement was distributed widely after the Conference.<P>

In June 1994, a similar Conference, this time on &quot;The Role of Science in Rebuilding the Countries of the Former Soviet Union&quot; was organized at Leeds Castle. This second conference was again jointly sponsored by UNESCO, the DG XII of the European Union and ICSU. Its aim was to discuss the serious problems facing science in the FSU and to explore strategies for solutions.<P>

The Conference provided the opportunity for detailed sharing of information and resulted in the identification of a list of priorities for future action.<P>

<H3>Mobilisation of ICSU Members</H3>
<BR>
In 1993 and again in 1994, COMSCEE requested ICSU's Members and Associates to provide information on their activities of relevance to the mandate of COMSCEE and also to provide advice and comments on the ways in which COMSCEE could assist them in the coming years. The responses to these requests serve as useful guidance for the work of the Committee.<P>

<H3>Partnership</H3>
<BR>
COMSCEE has been represented at various relevant meetings on science in CEE and the FSU organized by other bodies, thereby assuring that the concerns of the international scientific community have been voiced.<BR>

1996 HEWLETT-PACKARD EUROPHYSICS PRIZE

<H2>
<B>Opening the Door to Bright Prospects</B>
</H2>
<P>
The 1996 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize for outstanding achievements in condensed matter physics has been awarded to R.H. Friend, Cavendish Professor of Physics in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, for "pioneering work on semiconducting organic polymer materials and demonstration of an organic light-emitting diode". The prize will be presented at the <I>15th General Conference of the Condensed Matter Division of EPS</I> (Baveno-Stresa, Italy; 22-25 April 1996).<HR><IMG SRC="ene_dec95_hewlett_fig1.gif">
<UL>
<LI><I>A seven-segment polymer light-emitting diode display device made by Cambridge Display Technology.</I>
</UL><HR>
<P>
There has been a long standing interest in developing solid-state light-emitting devices for displays and the like. Light generation is efficient in direct band gap inorganic semiconductors, but these systems are usually unreliable and difficult to process. Efficient photoluminescence is also common in organic molecular semiconductors so light emission in these materials through charge injection under high applied fields has been investigated for many years. Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials offers better stability, and conjugated polymers are a good choice since they often have good charge transport and a high quantum efficiency for luminescence.
<P>
This application of polymers as semiconductors is perhaps not obvious owing to the large number of defects such as bends and twists along a molecular chain. However, there are no unsatisfied bonds at the surfaces of conjugated polymers, so problems associated with surface effects at electrode interfaces can be avoided by preparation under clean conditions. Secondly, the defects naturally weaken the degree of delocalization of the *-electrons distributed along the molecular chain, thereby increasing the energy needed to excite electrons from the valance band into the conduction band. So electronic levels associated with the defects do not in fact play an active role.
<P>
<B>Turning to Active Devices</B>
<P>
Much of the early work on conjugated polymers dealt with simple transport properties since polyacetylene, the most widely studied of these materials, shows very weak photoluminescence. The Cambridge group led by R.H. Friend was one of the few groups to focus on active devices, being the first to construct working field-effect transistors and electro-optic light modulators based on polyacetylene synthesized by colleagues in the University's Chemistry Department. The group then turned to photoluminescence in other conducting polymers because it was realised that they can have larger semi-conductor gaps than polyacetylene while offering high quantum yields for photoluminescence if prepared in a sufficiently pure form. Among these materials, poly (p-phenylene-vinylene), or PPV, could be conveniently made into high quality films showing strong photoluminescence [1].
<P>
The concept of self-localised excited states, either neutral or charged, has been very useful in describing fundamental excitations in conjugated polymers. The softness of the polymeric lattice leads to a strong coupling between the polymer's electrons and vibrations (phonons) such that it is energetically favourable for the local molecular structure to deform around free charges to form lattice-stabilised quasi-particles with spins and effective mass very different to those for electrons and holes. For PPV, these excitations are the neutral polaron exciton, the singly charged polaron and the doubly charge bipolaron. The Cambridge group showed that radiative decay by recombination of the singlet polaron exciton formed by interchain excitation following photon absorption was responsible for photoluminescence in PPV [2].
<P>
<B>The First LED</B>
<P>
<B> </B>
<P>
The group then demonstrated [3] that PPV can be used as the active element of a large-area, light-emitting diode (LED). The spectral emission was the same as for photoluminescence, so electroluminescence was assigned to radiative decay of the same excited state (the singlet polaron). In the LED, one applies a voltage across a sandwich structure comprising metal electrodes (one of which is semi-transparent) attached to opposite sides of a film of undoped PPV with an empty conduction band. Holes and electrons are injected and travel as oppositely charged polarons along a chain. The polarons capture each other, forming quasi one-dimensional excitations which decay radiatively. This interpretation contrasted with earlier work based on optical properties suggesting that bipolarons were the most stable quasiparticles in PPV.
<P>
It is in fact the group's basic research leading to a detailed understanding of the processes involved in light emission which has contributed much to the development of polymer-based LEDs covering the entire visible range, and to improvement of the quantum efficiency. For example, poly(cynoterephthalylidene) with a greater electron affinity than PPV allows the use of more practical electrodes such as aluminium instead of calcium [4].
<P>
Semiconducting organic polymers with delocalized *-electrons are now seen to have possible applications in a wide variety of electronic devices. Owing to the relatively low mobility of charge carriers, the most exciting opportunities at the moment are found in LEDs and photovoltaic cells. The innovative work at Cambridge showing that easily processed polymers such as PPV exhibit good efficiency for light emission has clearly made feasible the fabrication of low-cost, large-area flat-panel displays. This demonstration of the rich possibilities to exploit and control structure, and hence the electronic functionality, of organic materials has opened up a field with a promising future and generated a tremendous amount of scientific and industrial activity.

Electronic Publishing in Science
</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>J.C. Sens reports on the joint Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) - UNESCO conference of experts entitled Electronic Publishing in Science  that took place in Paris on 19-23 February.</STRONG><HR>
<P>
Electronic publishing in science started many years ago as an activity from the bottom-up. It has now reached the esoteric realm of high councils in international organizations, from where the field can be viewed in all its splendour, without hindrance from mere  soft- and hard-ware problems. One such exercise took place recently at UNESCO in Paris where UNESCO and the press section of the Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) jointly organized a <A HREF="#gen1">conference of experts</A>. 
<P>
It became immediately apparent during introductory presentations on the state-of-the-art that electronic publishing is having a profound impact not only on communications among scientists, but also on education, on access by developing countries to information, and on the roles of learned societies, commercial publishers and indexing services, librarians, databank creators, archivists, copyright lawyers, and network operators.
<P>
The prolific growth of the information industry and its destabilizing side effects are characterized by many striking statistics that were quoted during the conference (see <A HREF="#gen0">insert</A>). With these statistics setting the scale of the problems, presentations focussed on several specific issues such as the digital library, pricing policies for journals, electronic archiving, copyright, standards, and network access in developing countries.
<P>
Traditionally, scholarly journals have been produced by learned societies (mainly the case in the US) and by publishing companies (mainly the case in Europe). In spite of much publisher-bashing by the scientific community, it seems unlikely that this pattern will change very soon.
<P>
<STRONG>Digital Library Initiative
</STRONG><P>
Two years ago, the National Science Foundation, NASA and the Advanced Research  Project Agency in the US launched the Digital Library Initiative involving four-year, 24 M$US grants to six universities to develop prototypes of systems for the electronic distribution and retrieval of scientific journal literature. The University of Illinois' contribution was described in some detail at the conference. Its purpose is to build a large-scale, multi-journal/multi-publisher production testbed for scientific journal articles. This effort, along with the experience gathered at the five other universities, is likely to lead to a pilot of a digital library of the future two to three years from now.
<P>
In the Illinois project, collaboration agreements have been reached with several scientific societies and institutes, among them the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP). They provide the project with electronic copies of articles which will be published in their journals. Each article contains the complete text, graphics, images, tables, and equations in the Standardised Generalised Markup Language (SGML) format, with publisher-defined document-type-definitions (DTD) to delineate the document structure (title, authors, etc.). Commercial publishers are also supplying articles in this format. The project will grow to cover all articles in about 30 science and engineering journals.
<P>
The project intends to provide access to World-Wide Web (WWW)-based document repositories and links to full texts, digital images and video, and other information resources. At present, the focus is on the submission of publisher-provided articles, where the emphasis is on the conversion from printing-and-mailing to Internet-based retrieval and distribution. However - and this is a crucial point - the model will apply to any suitably organized repository of manuscripts, provided they are supplied in standard format. 
<P>
Preliminary findings at Illinois indicate that SGML is sufficiently fine-grained to permit the sophisticated indexing and retrieval needed in a full-text environment, but has shortcomings when used as a display tool for mathematical formulae. The project uses SoftQuad's Panorama SGML viewer, implemented over Internet using Netscape's Navigator browser. This makes it possible to view documents incorporating WWW link protocols.
<P>
In the final version, documents will not be delivered by publishers, but will be searched for by users and downloaded. Open Text Corporation's  Open Text Index search engine will be used for searching.
<P>
Problems under investigation include conversion from SGML to the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) DTD used by WWW, difficulties in dynamic updating due to bandwidth limitations, and "tag normalisation", i.e., the conversion of tags as defined in various DTDs to a normalised form. To overcome this last problem, the project recommends the use of the International Standards Organization's ISO 12083 physics and maths DTD as the standard for all publishers.
<P>
<STRONG>Non-Technical Issues Looming
</STRONG><P>
Looming in the background of such digital libraries are copyright issues and pricing policies. No less than four plenary presentations were devoted to legal questions, e.g., the intellectual property rights of electronic manuscripts residing in commercial databases; the futility of a reward structure for creators based on the right to copy in a digital, zero-cost reproduction environment; the notion of transmission to and display on home computers, for instance, as a violation of copyright.  
<P>
In spite of being the creators of intellectual property, scientists are largely unfamiliar with, and on the whole totally allergic to, the complex world of legal terminology, most of which is carried over from the music, motion picture and television industries. Indeed, it is with amazement that one hears of notions such as encryption (requiring a software key to read material), tattooing or watermarking (creating a permanent, indelible mark in a digital record) and fingerprinting (like watermarking, but adding a mark to identify the user at the time of use) as ways to combat piracy in electronic publishing.
<P>
The basic motivation for much of this wrestling with copyright stems clearly from the fact that commercial publishers have been well served by the now largely defunct paper-only journals. Manuscripts provided free-of-charge or paid for by scientists, free-of-charge value addition by unpaid editors and referees, copyright sign-over by authors who assign exclusive reproduction and distribution rights to publishers, sale-back to the providers, and subscription fee income from libraries in advance of incurring print and distribution costs cannot fail to leave a feeling of nostalgia among the beneficiaries of this 300-year-old system at the threshold of the electronic era.
<P>
Copyright legislation is national; electronic publishing is international. Constructing multimedia products - by adding graphics, sound and video to text, from sources which may themselves be compilations - makes adherence to copyright virtually impossible. Digital libraries are competing with database vendors in providing access, and are thus becoming primary suppliers of information ...... without the copyright, etc. The list of problems is long and few solutions are in sight.
<P>
In electronic publishing it usually is an institute or university which owns the copyright of  papers produced by its scientists. So the transfer of copyright by authors to publishers is in fact illegal. Without a legal transfer, the publisher is neither an author nor a producer, and is thus unprotected. Yet publishers have made major investments, in both the paper and electronic sectors. This paradox has led to a draft International Convention for the Protection of Publishers of Electronic Editions by the International Publishers Copyright Council, and a draft Directive for the Protection of Databases by the European Commission. These initiatives aim to create a new right, and to allow database owners to exercise copyright, i.e., prevent unauthorized, i.e., free-of-charge, extraction and/or use, of all material in a database, including papers by authors who have not signed away copyright and favour free circulation.
<P>
<STRONG>The Scientists' Approach
</STRONG><P>
Legal problems take on an entirely different dimension when seen from the  "Ginsparg perspective" (P. Ginsparg, a high-energy physicist, pioneered the Los Alamos National Laboratory e-print server in the US which now covers nine domains of physics and has mirrors in Italy and Germany). This perspective finds conventions such as the ones mentioned as being merely pacts with the Devil, as devious as they are ineffective, since on the information highway of the future, scientists will take matters into their own hands and simply ban commercial science publishers.
<P>
Some two and a half hours were set aside at the conference for scientists to present their views. This was ample time, however, to make clear to an audience consisting largely of representatives of commercial interests of one sort or another, that electronic publishing replaces paper journals not by electronic journals but by publications residing on a scientific organization's, rather than a publisher's database. Issues of cost, peer review, archiving, and copyright must be re-examined from this vantage point.
<P>
It is tempting to quote from Ginsparg's (written) contribution to the conference: "The essential point is now self-evident:  if we, the researchers, are not writing with the expectation of making money directly from our efforts, then there is no earthly reason why anyone else should make money in the process (except for a fair return on any non-trivial "value-added" ..... or except if, as in the paper-only era, the true cost ..... is sufficiently high)". Another nail is then driven into the coffin of commercial interests by the observation that journals in several fields of physics fail to fulfil their dual role of reporting research results (owing to today's preprint activity) and of serving as a vehicle for career advancement and grant allocation (since a name on a paper, as opposed to say "recent activities", plays a minor role, in decisions on jobs and grants). "Certain physics journals", it is then concluded, "play no role whatsoever for physicists. Their primary role seems to be to provide a revenue stream to publishers, a revenue stream invisibly siphoned from overhead on research contracts through library systems." Translate "overhead on research contracts" by "government funding of universities and institutes", and we have the situation in Europe. A revenue stream, one might add, that some publishers can probably do without, since physics represents only a minor fraction of their income.
<P>
This may seem just rebellious rhetoric, were it not for the fact that in subsequent presentations it was shown how two, albeit relatively small, learned societies, the International Union for Crystallography (IUCr) and the American Astronomical Society (AAS) have been able to set up fully electronic journals, with all manuscripts accepted, edited, refereed, archived, and distributed electronically (<A HREF="#gen2">insert</A>). These two example, represent admirable illustrations of what a small team of experts, librarians and the staff of a learned society can accomplish. They contain some valuable lessons (<A HREF="#gen3">insert</A>) for societies, which have yet to go electronic.
<P>
<STRONG>Regional Publishing Offices
</STRONG><P>
The APS, in a short contribution, made the all-important announcement that it is "re-engineering" its entire publishing process, by constructing a "seamless electronic web from preparation by the author of a manuscript, through submission, refereeing, editing, production, and distribution". Furthermore, the society will install an e-print server that "will make available unrefereed and unedited articles in all fields of physics. This server will be linked to potential submissions to and refereeing for the APS journals, although authors will be free to submit their work to any other journal", or leave it unpublished. With these initiatives, the world's largest physical society  is now addressing the heart of the problem. It is moving one step beyond copying paper versions to screens, leaving cost-increasing current-awareness services (e.g., indexes) to others, and halting increases in the income needed to maintain both paper and electronic versions.
<P>
It is only through such measures that dialogue, on the time scale of an office conversation,  between scientists and between authors, editors and referees can become a reality, that paper versions become manageable in size and cost, that publication delays can be reduced, and that libraries will be able to upgrade their services, reduce cataloguing work and devote more of their budgets to books.
<P>
In another short presentation, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Working Group on Communications in Physics proposed the creation of "Regional Publishing Offices (RPOs)" to be managed by regional physical societies. RPOs would act as clearing houses for manuscripts submitted by authors usually, but not exclusively, located in a given region. All manuscripts would be collected on regional databases (logically one, physically one or more per region, with all regions interconnected) and manuscripts to be published would be translated into SGML, and made available to the publisher of the author's choice. There are six regional societies around the world which could qualify for participation, so the project would provide a single standard for the world's physics literature.
<P>
The APS and IUPAP initiatives, although developed more-or-less independently, are in fact in complete accord with one another. Perhaps the greatest beneficiaries of such proposals will be developing countries. Instead of having to buy information from commercial publishers, and then having to appeal to charitable organizations to pay for it, there will be, after initial investments, equality between all regions in the handling of and access to physics publications worldwide. How well this works will mainly depend on the cost of access to wide-area computer networks.<HR>

Some 156 people (25 % UK, 14 % US, 40 % continental Europe, 3 % South America, 18 % others) attended the well-organized ICSU conference Electronic Publishing in Physics. Summaries by invited speakers with expertise in specified domains were followed by working group sessions. This format proved to be effective and well-suited to the main goal of the conference, namely the formulation of recommendations to UNESCO's Director-General for further action. All presentations were well-prepared and highly informative. Of the 21 speakers, 12 were from the UK and the US. This is not surprising, since these two countries are the most active in electronic publishing. Among the scientific disciplines, physics was relatively well-represented, and life sciences poorly represented. Representatives of commercial interests outnumbered those from learned societies. Bandwidth, economics and the extension of networking were not on the agenda.<HR>
<P><B>
<A NAME="gen0">Some Statistics</A>
</B>
<P>
Computer performance has increased a million-fold over the last twenty years. Within the European Union, over 25% of offices and 15% of homes are equipped with computers.
<P>
One-half of the world's population has never placed a telephone call. Some 80 % of the world's population, and 24% of the world's scientists, live in developing countries. Developing countries account for 2% of the production and use of the indexed output of scientific information; the quality of research and the economics of scientific publishing are the main factors responsible for this small amount.
<P>
The number of Internet users is expected to reach 200 million by the year 2000. At the end 1995 there were  70000 WWW sites worldwide, with some 800 new ones being added on average every day; the principal scientific fields on WWW are engineering (880 sites), computer science (727), medicine (612), biology (509), earth sciences (473), and physics (469).
<P>
In a survey of 4000 scientists, less than 20% make frequent use of current awareness services.
<P>
Scholarly literature doubles in volume every 10-15 years. Worldwide, there are some 90000 periodicals and 1500 electronic journals; of the academic journals, some 50 are peer reviewed.
<P>
Between 1988 and 1992, five mid-west US research libraries cancelled subscriptions to 13021 titles (some 5.7% of the total).Yet these libraries ended up paying 30.5% more for the remaining subscriptions. Average subscription prices have risen by about 10% p.a. over the last four years, and continue to increase. Subscription prices have doubled since 1985.
<P>
The electronic publishing market in Western Europe lags some 3-5 years behind the market in the US.<HR>
<P><B>
<A NAME="gen2">The IUCr and AAS Approaches to Electronic Publishing</A>
</B>
<P>
The IUCr project began with the definition of a standard ASCII file, the Crystallographic Information File (CIF), having simple syntax rules. At present, only manuscripts in CIF format are accepted; they are submitted to the journal's office, usually via e-mail, and processed automatically. The manuscripts are validated with dedicated software, turned into PostScript files and returned to the author, along with an error report, for checking. Editors then receive, from the journal office, the text in proof format, the report of the checking and Internet FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access to the CIF file, the last to enable the editor and referees to view the manuscript on their screens. Editors and referees communicate via e-mail. Once editing has been completed, the CIF file is updated and archived in the journal's database. As to delivery, the list of contents (title, authors and synopsis) of each journal issue is placed on WWW. URLs point to the CIF files and chemical diagrams, which may be downloaded and displayed by the reader free-of-charge. The full text is as yet not available on WWW, but will be so in the future, probably for a fee. Annual sets of issues will be available on CD-ROM. Absence of adequate WWW and FTP services in much of the world and the high cost and unpredictable performance of networks have compelled the journal to maintain hardcopy distribution for the time being.
<P>
The AAS publishes Astrophysical Journal and the Astronomical Journal, which together comprise one-half of the world's peer-reviewed literature in astronomy. An electronic version of the Letters section of Astrophys. J. has been available on WWW since July 1995. Authors submit manuscripts in a AAS version of LATEX; editors receive the manuscripts electronically or by telefax, and forward the corrected versions to the publisher. At this point, the LATEX version is converted automatically into SGML with tags defined by ISO 12083, and then entered into a database. Translation is required since LATEX, although containing logical markup, is not equipped to provide hypertext links and links to databases containing the material referenced in the manuscript. The next step is copy editing on the screen of the SGML version and the automatic insertion of pointers to the abstracts database. This requires the two databases to have compatible standards and software. After assembly of text and figures into the definitive SGML-formatted manuscript ready for archival, two versions are derived: an on-screen version, via automatic SGML-HTML conversion, and a version in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using PostScript to PDF conversion to enable subscribers to locally print the article using Adobe's free-of-charge Acrobat reader. The SGML version is archived and made available for deriving new tools and functions as and when they are developed. The electronic version is presently released one month before the paper version and since its launch, the AAS system has served an average of 40000 files each week.<HR>

<B><A NAME="gen3">Some Lessons</B><P>

</A>* The IUCr project addresses a highly specialized, virtually closed community, so it contains a somewhat parochial undertone: authors must submit their articles in a format (CIF) which is special to crystallographers, a feature that precludes simple access to the databases of other fields of physics. Access to WWW and on-screen display are via ad hoc software, and will remain so for future developments as long as the input is in CIF. This may be adequate for a closed community, but cannot serve as a general model. The AAS project has a wider base: it requires a given version of LATEX as input, and converts to SGML, the universal standard for database content and hyperlinks. 
<P>
 * It is important to realise that a database must satisfy stringent requirements (searching; access to other databases; coding so that different versions of the same manuscript can be extracted).
<P>
 * Mathematical formulae are represented as images in a standard file format (GIF), inserted one-by-one into the text. This is time consuming and unsatisfactory. The ISO 12083 DTD offers an alternative, but at present it also has problems [see EPSIG News 1 (2) 1995), published by the Electronic Special Interest Group which maintains and promotes ISO 12083]. 
<P>
* HTML DTDs are generally unable to cope with the large number of special characters needed for scientific documents and "it seems that HTML 3.0 (the latest version of the HTML DTD presently being reviewed by a Internet Engineering Task Force will) not emerge as a standard" [P. Boyce, Computers in Physics, January 1996].<HR>

<B>CALL FOR NOMINATIONS</B>
</H2>
<P>
The EPS Quantum Electronics and Optics Division (<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division/qeod.html">QEOD</A>) has established a Quantum Electronics Prize of the EPS. The Prize is given for outstanding contributions to quantum electronics and quantum physics in both basic physics and applied science. It consists of a medal and a diploma. The Selection Committee invites nominations for the 1996 Prize which will be awarded during the <I>6th European Quantum Electronics Conference/Laser and Electro-Optics Conference</I> <I>(EQEC/CLEO-<BR>
Europe)</I> in Hamburg on 9-13 September 1996. Nominations may be submitted by EPS members, both Individual Ordinary Members and National Society Members) as individuals or as a representative of a Division or Group.
<P>
To establish a high standard it is necessary that the Committee receives proposals that represent the strength and variety of the European quantum electronics and optics community. Proposals should consist of a short presentation of the nominee (a maximum of one page), a brief <I>curriculum vitae</I>, a list of major publications, and the motivation for the award. Letters of support from authorities in the field outlining the importance of the work would be very useful.
<P>
Nominations should be submitted before <B>31 January 1996</B> to Prof. L.A. Lugiato, Secretary of the Selection Committee, EPS Quantum Electronics Prize, Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit&agrave; di Milano, Via Celoria, 16, I-20133 Milan.

Education Network to be Funded</H3>
<P>
Hendrik Ferdinande (Ghent University), the Coordinator of the European Physics Education Network (<A HREF="http://allserv.rug.ac.be/~hferdin/eupen">EUPEN</A>), reports that the network has been accepted as a Thematic Network in the European Union's SOCRATES Programme. Subject to approval by the Union's financial committee, EUPEN will receive 70 000 ECU for the first year of operation. Some 80 networks were chosen from among over 500 expressions of interest, of which about 30 were retained.
<P>
EUPEN [EN 26 (1995) 69] grew out of the <A HREF="../ene/ene_jun95_ferdinande_text.html">Thematic Evaluation Conference on Physics</A> which EPS helped organize. A Steering Committee will manage EUPEN, and act as the reference point for EUPEN activities. It was spun off from from the conference's Scientific Committee and it will call for advice from the Scientific Committee when necessary. The EPS Interdivisional Group for Physics Education will be coordinating activities with EUPEN.
<P>
The two committees aim to establish a consortium agreement or founding convention for the institutions that take part in EUPEN. The actual EUPEN structure will be optimised once the level of involvement of each partner institution is known.
<P>
EUPEN's general aims will be achieved through the combined action of five working groups that will treat physics education in a  comparative manner. Contact persons from partner institutions to serve and take the lead in one (or more) of the groups are presently being sought. The groups, whose activities will mainly involve conferences and questionnaire-based peer review, cover:
<P><UL>
<LI>the student experience: measurement of workloads, assessment of teaching quality, implementation of the European Credit Transfer Scheme, etc.
<LI>curricula structure and development: 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels/cycles, course content and specialisation, physics and/or engineering physics, communication skills, etc.
<LI>organisation of physics studies: comparative statistics, number of students at the various levels, cost per student, numerus clausus, fees, student grants, financial support, etc.
<LI>career aspects: recruitment, job orientation, industrial needs, research opportunities, post-doctoral positions, etc.
<LI>research in physics teaching at the University level (distance learning, computer-assisted laboratories, etc.) and at the school level (teacher training, permanent learning, etc.).</UL>
<P>
A <A HREF="http://allserv.rug.ac.be/~hferdin/eupen/list.html">preliminary list</A> of the 107 partner institutions, with details of contact persons, is available at the EUPEN WWW site (http://allserv.rug.ac.be/~hferdin/eupen/list.html) via EurophysNet (http://epswww.epfl.ch).

<H2>A European Physics Education Network</H2>
<P>

<UL><LI>Hendrik Ferdinande is a member of the Mobility Committee that manages the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/mobility.html">European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students</A> (EMSPS). He is seen here in front of the EMSPS stand at the last EPS General Conference.</UL><HR><BR>
<B></B><STRONG>
Hendrik Ferdinande from the University of Ghent, who chaired the conference <I>Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe</I> (Ghent, 7-8 April 1995) and its Scientific Committee, summarises the meeting's conclusions and recommendations, many of which will be taken up by a proposed <A HREF="#socrates">SOCRATES</A> Academic Development Programme for physics called the <A HREF="#eupen">European Physics Education Network</A>.</STRONG></B>
<P>
Physics being universal does not of itself have a European dimension. Yet the European dimension in physics teaching is vital if we are to build upon the diversity of approaches<BR>
to physics. The conference Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe was perhaps the first occasion on which authorities on physics teaching could take a detailed look at how the European dimension in physics studies and training can be enhanced. Discussions were based on <A HREF="#national reports">National Reports</A> [1] prepared by National Experts (members of the conference's Scientific Committee). They include a considerable amount of invaluable data describing the present status of the teaching of physics in 24 European countries, as well as discussions of future needs and the implementation of special measures.
<P>
The meeting, which went under the title of a European Evaluation Conference, was sponsored by the European Commission's (EC) new Directorate-General for Education, Training and Youth (DG-XXII). Some 20 of these thematic conferences in various academic disciplines are being held in order to provide the basis for creating SOCRATES Academic Cooperation Projects (see below), where the level of funding will be decided once proposals have been evaluated. The conference also aimed to prepare for other aspects of the SOCRATES programme so support was provided by the current TEMPUS and ERASMUS programmes. These are now largely absorbed in SOCRATES which aims to develop a European dimension at all levels of education.<P>

<IMG SRC="ene_jun95_ferdinande_fig2.JPG" WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=201ALT="University aula">
<I>Some 170 participants from 25 countries attended the conference </I>Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe<I> which was held n the Aula complex of the University of Ghent. It was organized by the University of Ghent, chaired by Hendrik Ferdinande, and sponsored by the EPS student mobility scheme and the EPS Interdivisional Group on Physics Education. The meeting was supported by various European Union programmes and by the EC's DG-XXII as a thematic evaluation conference to prepare initiatives to be proposed to the recently launched SOCRATES programme.</I><P>

Science in general and physics in particular through their search for understanding are by their very natures cultural activities. In their application they are also vital for our modern high-technology society since they promote technological progress and economic growth. The conference concluded that physics teaching provides scientific literacy in the sense that it shapes the analytical thinking of society, which is important for solving complicated social problems. This perspective also implies that the popularization of science must be encouraged and that good practice in physics teaching is essential at the secondary school and university levels for both non-physicists and for physicists. For this one needs well-qualified teachers who can teach physics in an attractive, up-to-date way.
<P>
The National Reports which were summarised by P.J. Brussaard from Utrecht ("Present Day Trends") and by R.A. Ricci from Legnaro ("Suggestions for Future Directions") clearly demonstrated that studies at universities and equivalent institutions for a degree or diploma in physics train young "physicists" for work in a variety of environments, notably research, industry and teaching. In addition, physics graduates will increasingly occupy positions outside physics in the strict sense of the term, where flexibility, creativity, intuition, problem-solving, communication skills, and teamwork are crucial. Basic and intermediate training in physics should be oriented towards all of these four career opportunities, so courses must be sufficiently general in scope.<P>
They should include interdisciplinary material and have connections to the social and behavioural sciences as well as to economic and management studies. On the other hand, advanced (and, in particular, doctoral) studies in physics should allow students to acquire a profound knowledge in specialized fields and to obtain high-quality research training. To achieve these latter aims, institutions must undertake research in at least some of the active fields of present-day physics.
<P>
Since physics as a scientific discipline does not possess a European dimension in itself, the presentations by European Commission officials, notably I.V. Mitchell who is responsible in DG-XXII for the higher education aspects of SOCRATES (see <A HREF="#socrates">insert</A>), stressed that a European dimension in the teaching of physics must be achieved with the help of information networks and supplementary measures such as student and teaching staff mobility, attendance at international schools and language training. The ERASMUS part of SOCRATES will primarily use a new institution-based approach to channel funds to universities while essentially keeping the ERASMUS Interuniversity Cooperation Programmes that provide networks between academic coordinators.
<P>
<H3>Problems Identified</H3>
<P>
Research and teaching in physics in Europe have good reputations: being highly diversified they constitute a richness which must be preserved. Despite this high-quality, P.J. Brussaard described a number of problems. Some of them are general, such as the decreasing respect for, and status of, teachers. Others, such as excessively long physics courses, concern particular regions or countries. The specific problems related to the topics that were singled out by the conference as being in need of special attention, possibly via an EC-supported European Physics Education Network (EUPEN -- see <A HREF="#eupen">insert</A>), are described below together with the proposed recommendations.
<P>
Others specific problems include:
<P>

<P >
- A decreasing interest in physics by secondary school students and a decreasing number of university-level physics students in some countries.
<P >
- Physics is considered difficult and unattractive by secondary school students and by non-physics students at the university level.
<P>
- Physics teaching in secondary schools in some countries seems to lag well behind modern developments in physics.
<P>
- A low proportion of women among physics students and teaching/research staff (pronounced in northern Europe).
<P>
- The effective duration of physics studies is often (much) longer than the official one, even given the fact that in some cases the official duration of first-degree studies is already relatively long, and sometimes much too long.
<P>
- The drop-out rate in some countries is high (although it should, of course, not be decreased by sacrificing quality); little systematic information is available about the reasons why students abandon the study of physics.
<P>
- Physics teaching is isolated from industry and research laboratories.
<P>
- The pronounced diversity in the structure of the physics curricula in Europe may create problems connected with mobility and recognition (e.g., the mathematical approach in continental Europe as compared with a more experimental approach in the UK and Ireland).
<P>
- Open and distance learning is little used in physics education.
<P>
There are some problems that are common to all scientific disciplines and can be addressed by national and/or institutional bodies. These include:
<P>
- Academic calendars (subdivision of the academic year; beginning and end of course and examination periods) are very different from country to country. This impedes student and teacher mobility.
<P>
- In some countries, pre-university foreign-language training is inadequate and does not allow students to make efficient use of mobility schemes.
<P>
<H3>Four Themes</H3>
<P>
The <EM>Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe</EM> conference identified four themes that could be addressed by a SOCRATES network as an Academic Development Programme. They are:
<UL><LI>Curriculum development.
<LI>
Intensive programmes, notably for secondary school teachers, one of several possible new initiatives.
<LI>
Mobility of students and teachers which effectively represents the application of new methodologies to physics teaching.
<LI>
Educational resources and the quality of teaching.
</UL><BR>
<P 
a) Curriculum development
<P>
There is little exchange of information and little common effort on curriculum development, and on research on physics education, in some countries and within particular institutions. The great diversity of physics curricula thus leads to difficulties in academic recognition for study periods and in the recognition of diplomas, and more generally in comparing curricula. Proposed solutions to these problems seek:
<UL><LI>Widely available information on university physics courses (structure of studies; degrees awarded; content of studies; summary of the content of each course; ECTS credits attributed to each course; assessment and grading scale used with respect to the ECTS grading scale). The generation of information and its availability on the World-Wide Web (WWW) need to be encouraged. Conferences on the content of physics programmes and on new ways to teach physics should be organized regularly; comparability studies are required.
<LI>
Curriculum development pjects need to be promoted and they should publish intermediate and final results in an easily accessible way via WWW, electronic bulletin boards, specialized journals, etc.
<LI>
Short-duration programmeawarding lower degrees (e.g., B.Sc.) which emphasize physics are of interest to east and central Europe (E&amp;CE). Dissemination of the experience gathered by west European universities should be encouraged.
</UL>
<H4>b) Intensive programmes</H4>
<BR>
There are many advanced research schools and workshops, but usually attendance is not formally recognized with a view to obtaining an advanced degree. Moreover, information on schools is not readily available to all students and many schools are not synchronized. There are also few programmes for in-service training and few refresher courses for secondary school teachers, especially at a European or international level. There is also little contact between teachers and university staff teaching introductory physics and thus little effort to smooth the transition from secondary school to university.<P>

Recommendations include:
<UL><LI>Adaptation of the ECTS credit system represents one way to promote research schools and other intensive programmes as part of standard physics curricula (at the advanced, mainly doctoral, level and maybe at the undergraduate level).
<LI>
Advanced schools and other types of intensive courses for secondary school teachers must be organized in order to update teachers on developments in physics and on teaching methods applied to physics. Information about advanced schools must widely disseminated and the schools should be synchronized.
<LI>
School teachers and university staff, especially those responsible for introductory courses, should establish contacts and coordinate their programmes.
</UL><H4>c) Mobility</H4>
<BR>
In the case of students, mobility at both the undergraduate and doctoral levels seems to be lower than for other disciplines, and there are large imbalances between in- and out-flows in some countries. The potential for a student to spend time in industry and in research centres is not adequately exploited. The quality and impact of mobility stays and exchange visits (course recognition; amount of study time lost; improvement of foreign language skills; job prospects) remain largely unknown.
<P>
Student mobility can be promoted by:
<UL><LI>Including all institutions in exchange schemes so that all students may profit from mobility if they wish to do so. This may take some time to achieve so special measures are needed for countries with particularly low in- and out-flows.
<LI>
Widely available information on possible exchanges distributed using modern communication means (e.g., the ECTS information package and the EMSPS database) and by generalizing the ECTS and EMSPS student application forms. These measures will facilitate the establishment of study programmes and recognition by enabling credit transfer.
<LI>
Students/potential employer contacts, especially if "external" expertise can be exploited by extending student mobility to project work for a diploma or M.Sc. thesis performed in industry or in research centres (France's CIFRE initiative [2] provides a good example).
</UL><BR>
Student mobility during advanced (mainly doctoral) studies is promoted by:
<UL><LI>Recognized research schools.
<LI>
doctor europeus or some other (European) qualification that is attached to the degree awarded by the home institution (conditions: stay of at least three months in one or more foreign universities/research laboratories; international thesis panel; paper corresponding to thesis published in a refereed scientific journal; part of the thesis defence in a foreign language). France operates a scheme [3] of this type.
</UL><BR>
In the case of teachers, while the mobility of physics research staff is well developed this is not so for teachers. Moreover, universities seldom call on physicists working in industry to give lectures. One solution is:
<UL><LI>A much higher priority and funding level for the mobility of teaching staff between institutions and between industry and universities. Mobility of the former type is not only beneficial for the staff members themselves and their institutions, but also allows students who do not move to acquire some of the benefits otherwise obtained through student mobility.
</UL><H4>
d) Educational resources</H4>
<BR>
It is clearly necessary to continuously monitor quantitatively and qualitatively all aspects of the teaching of physics and to propose measures for improvements. It will thus be useful to:
<UL><LI>Evaluate educational resources and teaching quality on a regular basis at the European level.
</UL><BR>
An assessment meeting for representatives who took part in the various thematic conferences is planned for July 1995 to coordinate approaches to the European Commission. It will effectively constitute the first step on the road to forming a much-needed European forum for physics education.

<H3><A NAME="socrates">SOCRATES</A> at a Glance</H3>
<P>
<I>The European Community Action Programme in the Field of Education (1995-99; 850 MECU)</I>
<P>
Approved by the European Union Council of Ministers and by Parliament in March 1995 to develop quality education by encouraging cooperation and by supporting complementary measures while respecting each Member State's responsibility for the content and organization of teaching. Aims to develop the European dimension at all levels of learning via mobility, academic recognition, cooperation, information exchange, and distance education. SOCRATES is open to east and central European countries (E&amp;CE) but it is unclear how they will be able to participate in 1995. Guidelines and information package to be issued in June 1995. Managed by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Education, Training and Youth (DG-XXII), formerly the Task Force on Human Resources. Overview available on WWW at http://europa.cec.lu/
<P>
Higher Education: expansion of the former ERASMUS programme; &gt;55% of budget. Initiatives for E&amp;CE will focus initially on generating information describing courses so that course credits can be transferred during mobility stays (some 70% of ERASMUS mobility stays now involve at least partial recognition).
<P>
<STRONG>Activities within Institutional Contracts:</STRONG> Postponed for one year to give universities time to prepare the internal consultative procedures needed for the new Institutional Contracts involving financing through universities based on coordinated work plans submitted by the universities by mid-1996. Hence ERASMUS Interuniversity Cooperation Projects will continue for an extra year (i.e., for the 1996/7 academic year). Activities:
<P>
- organization of student &amp; teaching staff exchanges
<P>
- implementation of the European Credit Transfer Scheme (ECTS)
<P>
- joint curriculum developmen 
- intensive programmes
<P>
- preparatory visits/study visits
<P>

- development of integrated language courses
<P>
<STRONG>Activities outside Institutional Contracts:</STRONG> 1995 announcements for 1996 implementation.
<P>

- Academic Development Projects to develop a European dimension within various disciplines through university cooperation.
<P>
- stimulation measures (open &amp; distance learning; analyses/surveys; association activity).
<P>
<STRONG>Student Mobility Grants organized through national agencies.
</STRONG><P>
School Education: COMENIUS to bring the European concept to schools; &gt;10% of budget; new action calls for proposals starting in 1995 and some activities planned for 1995.<P>

Activities: school partnerships; in-service training for teachers.
<P>
<STRONG>Horizontal Measures</STRONG> (&gt;25% of budget)
<P>
- Promotion of language skills: expansion of the original LINGUA which terminated in 1994; <BR>
some activities planned for 1995.
<P>
- Open and distance learning: new activity; pilot projects in 1995.
<P>
- Exchange of information and experience: EURYDICE (information network/statistics: statutory activity so no calls); ARION (visits scheme for decision makers; calls in 1995); NARIC (academic recognition information centres; statutory activity).
<P>

- Complementary measures: association support; awareness generation.

<HR>
<H3>Towards <A NAME="eupen">EUPEN</A></H3>
<P>
Most of the specific recommendations stemming from the Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe conference need further study before they can be transformed into actions. They also cannot be implemented at the same time so priorities must be set. Moreover, once launched, actions should be monitored and improvements proposed and carried out. The conference therefore proposed as a main conclusion the creation of a permanent forum, tentatively called the European Physics Education Network (EUPEN), which would be responsible for various promotional, advisory and operational tasks.
<P>
The idea is that EUPEN would apply for support from the European Commission under the SOCRATES heading to organize a thematic Academic Development Programme (ADP) for physics within the so-called "SOCRATES space" (essentially the European Union and the six east and central European countries that participate in the SOCRATES programme). It may also be possible to seek funding from other sources.
<P >
EUPEN would operate in close connection with EPS, and more specifically with the EPS Interdivisional Group on Physics Education, consisting of the Forum on Education, th University Teaching Section and the European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students (EMSPS). It would also co-operate with similar bodies acting in other parts of the world (e.g., Asian Physics Education Network, Arab Physics Education Network, Council of Inter-American Physics Education Conferences) or on the global scale (e.g., International Commission of Physics Education).
<P>
The network would be open to all the European universities (and equivalent institutions) that award degrees in physics, to national and European societies for physicists, for physics teachers, and for physics students (e.g., the International Association of Physics Students), and to industry and international and national research laboratories.
<P>
The conference endorsed the proposal that the Scientific Committee acts as a working party for setting up the EUPEN network by formulating terms of reference and by filing an application for an ADP to SOCRATES. Moreover, institutions in eastern and central Europe (E&amp;CE) participate successfully with universities from western Europe in exchange programmes such as the EU's TEMPUS programme and the EPS European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students which received grant support from the The Soros Foundations. Physics can set a promising example by continuing and intensifying this collaboration in education and training across all of Europe. So integrating institutions from E&amp;CE in the proposed EUPEN network is vital, and SOCRATES envisages this.

<H2>Medical Physicists Opt for Decentralisation</H2>
<P><STRONG>
Pieter Inia from the Department of Clinical Physics, Katholike Universiteit Leuven, summarises the role of medical physicists and the steps being taken to ensure that their professional qualifications meet the highest possible standards.

Pieter Inia<HR>
<P>
Scientific thought became an important factor in medicine in the 17th century, and by the early 20th century it was clear that, generally speaking, no single person could have sufficient knowledge of biomedicine and physics to make important and fundamental contributions in both fields. So together with other scientists, physicists became involved in medical work. After R&ouml;ntgen's discovery of X-rays, applications of ionizing radiation developed into an important field of interest: Marie Curie isolated radium and then set up mobile x-ray imaging units in field hospitals behind the front lines during the 1st World War; artificial radionuclides were introduced into medical practice soon after the 2nd World War.
<P>
The number of medical physicists in clinical practice began to rise steeply in the 1960s following the introduction of cobalt-60 radiation therapy, linear accelerators and gamma-ray cameras. In the same way as a pharmacist is responsible for the delivery of drugs, a medical physicist working in radiotherapy is responsible for the delivery, from a therapy unit, of a prescribed quantity of ionizing radiation to a prescribed volume in the patient.
<P>
The number of areas of medical practice which interest physicists has increased considerably in recent years with the introduction of lasers, microelectronics, sensor technology, computerized imaging techniques, etc. For example, medical physicists now play an important role in developing anatomical and functional imaging based on magnetic resonance of the body's constituents.
<P>
<STRONG>Medical Physicists Today
</STRONG><P>
Two categories of medical physicist can be identified based on their principal objectives, although many medical physicists span both categories. The first consists of medical physicists working as teachers and scientists in universities and medical schools, or as scientists in industry. The nature of their employment essentially defines their (mainly scientific) role and responsibilities.
<P>
The other category covers the medical physics carried out in clinical practice in institutions and hospitals; it is well developed and generally recognized as an essential part of medical care and health services. Two functions can be distinguished in clinical medical physics. One is professional, being fulfilled through a special competence in a particular field of clinical medical physics, which is not found among any other medical, paramedical or technical specialty. A specialist working in clinical medical physics is responsible for training all of those involved, both medical and non-medical. As a member of a team of professionals responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of patients, the medical physicist has a direct influence on diagnosis, therapy and safety procedures used in health care. The professional roles and responsibilities of physicists as part of the medical team should be clear and well defined.
<P>
The second function is managerial: the medical physicist helps administer a hospital's medical physics, reporting to the institution's highest administrative level. Owing to the relatively large amount of high-cost equipment involved, the medical physicist's expertise and knowledge with regard to supervision and management is generally highly appreciated.
<P>
<STRONG>EFOMP Established
</STRONG><P>
Most European countries have national organisations for what is comprehensively termed medical physics. However, the practice of medical physics varies from country-to-country, with differing educational requirements and legal status. Representatives of national organisations for medical physics felt a pressing need to harmonize these differences in order to achieve the objectives of freedom of movement and employment within the European Union (EU) Member States. In 1980, when these representatives came together to inaugurate the <A HREF="#gen0">European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics</A> (EFOMP), they decided, however, not to limit membership to the then European Community countries, but to embrace all of Europe.
<P>
Recognizing that medical physics covers today the very broad field of physics applied directly or indirectly in health care, representatives of the various national organisations for medical physics used the following definition as a preamble to EFOMP's Constitution:
<P>
In most European countries there are national organisations: - in which the principal defined category are persons, qualified with a university degree or equivalent in physics, mathematics, computing sciences, physical chemistry, mechanical or electrical or electronic engineering, and working in alliance with medical staff in hospitals, universities or research institutes; 
<P>
- and which carry the responsibility of guiding and supporting the professional character of the work of their members and encouraging and promulgating the scientific work of their members. Their activities and field of work are described by the comprehensive expression: Medical Physics.
<P>
A major initiative has been to harmonize the various education schemes for medical physicists in Europe, and to assure a certain level of competence. Practical experience in a medical environment is considered paramount for a well-trained medical physicist.
<P>
Another, closely related initiative concerns professional qualifications. While some national organisations of medical physicists have established registration schemes, EFOMP has taken the lead by creating a mechanism for the proper recognition of medical physics by means of approved National Registration Schemes. As an EFOMP Policy Statement [1] puts it: EFOMP does not have the resources to set up and run a centralised registration scheme. Nor would this accommodate the rather varied local circumstances in the different countries. Therefore member organisations are encouraged to set up their own Registration Schemes. They can be either Statutory or Indicative (i.e., voluntary), but must satisfy general criteria laid down by EFOMP if they are to be recognized by EFOMP.
<P>
From its inception EFOMP has sought to establish a close working relationship with the European Commission (EC), mainly by responding to Directives which impinge on the practice of medical physics, such as those relating to education and training [2]. EFOMP is now accepted by the EC as the body which speaks for medical physics in Europe. 
<P>
EFOMP should also be seen as the competent body to decide how the <A HREF="../eurphys">European Physicist</A> (Eur Phys) qualification set up recently by the European Physical Society will be applied in the context of medical physics. EFOMP is the obvious partner in setting the standards for Eur Phys accorded to applicants whose main area of training and experience involves medical physics. The necessary coordination is achieved by having a member of the EFOMP executive comittee on the Register Commission that awards Eur Phys.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="gen0">EFOMP</A></H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="#gen1">European Federation of Medical Physicists</A> aims to:
<P>
* foster and co-ordinate the activities of its member organisations in the field of medical physics, and to collaborate where appropriate with national and international organisations, particularly the International Organisation for Medical Physics (IOMP);
<P>
* encourage exchanges between member organisations and the dissemination of professional and scientific information through publications and meetings;
<P>
* encourage scholarships and the exchange of medical physicists between countries;
<P>
* propose guidelines for education, training and accreditation programmes;
<P>
* make recommendations on the appropriate general responsibilities, organisational relationships and roles of workers in the field of medical physics;
<P>
* encourage the formation of organisations for medical physics where such organisations do not exist.
<P>
Membership of EFOMP is open to the organisation in each European country responsible for the professional and scientific work of medical physicists (it is not open to individuals). EFOMP has seen a steady increase in membership, and now represents 26 national societies in which 5500 individual medical physicists are organised all over Europe. One of the Federation's roles is to stimulate the organisation of medical physicists in east and central Europe.
<P>
The activities of EFOMP are controlled by an annual meeting of Council, in which all member organisations are represented, while the activities are initiated and coordinated by an executive committee.
<P>
EFOMP has been able to raise, at an international level in Europe, the awareness of medical physics and the position of medical physicists, particularly through the presentation of policy documents. Council has adopted and published policy documents on: the roles, responsibilities and status of the clinical medical physicist; the education and training of medical physics; departments of medical physics; guidelines for national registration schemes.
<P>
Since its foundation the Federation has maintained contact with the individual members of national organisations by publishing the bulletin European Medical Physics News, giving news items and details of activities. EFOMP sponsors three international journals and to create opportunities for personal contacts and scientific exchanges, it has initiated a series of triennial conferences on medical physics in close cooperation with the various national organisations.

A New Qualification for Physicists

<P><B>

<P><CITE>
Chair, Register Commission
</CITE><HR><IMG SRC="ene_jun96_peter_fig.gif" ALT="M. Peter">
<UL>
<LI>Martin Peter, the Chairman of the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/profqual/register.html">Register Commission</A> for the designation European Physicst is with the Physics Department, Geneva University. He has served as the Department's Head and as the University's Rector.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
The designation <A HREF="../eurphys"> European Physicist </A>(abbreviated as Eur Phys) is a new qualification for physicists that was established by the EPS in 1995. The fundamental reason for its creation stems from the fact that times are changing, and are becoming harder for many physicists. Gone are the days when a permanent position is offered to most successful students upon graduation from university. Permanent employment may become the exception rather than the rule, so physicists, like most professionals, have to reeducate, and to adapt to a new career more than once.
<P>
The reason for this evolution is to be found in the changing nature of the European economy, which is moving increasingly from the secondary sector into services. One might have hoped that this trend would increase rather than decrease research activities. To a certain extent this is indeed happening, but at the same time the nature of these activities is also changing since industrial research is tending to move to where manufacturing has gone.
<P>
In this changing climate, the possibility to adapt one's activities becomes an important asset. Adaptation includes continued education and the ability to take initiatives in organizing work for oneself and for others. It also includes mobility. Mobility is facilitated by professional qualifications which are widely recognised.
<P>
<STRONG>Professional Qualifications</STRONG> 
<P>
Formal professional qualifications exist in many occupations. Generally, a person receives such a qualification on the basis of a combination of academic attainments and experience in a profession. Where they exist, however, there are for some professions wide differences between formal systems of recognition, in the body awarding the qualification, in the criteria applied, and in the code of conduct an applicant is expected to abide by.
<P>
Such differences may restrict the opportunities for citizens of a given country to exercise their profession elsewhere. In the case of the European Union (EU), the European Commission, which has been active for some time in promoting the mutual recognition of academic degrees, is now also taking initiatives regarding professional qualifications. The EPS includes EU countries as well as most of the European countries that are not part of the Union. It will therefore be a special challenge for the EPS to establish for its Eur Phys qualification widespread and efficient recognition both within the EU and between the EU and non-EU countries.
<P>
National societies, institutes and associations covering various fields of science and technology have collaborated in establishing several European Registers for qualified professionals. In physics, the situation is somewhat different from that found elsewhere owing to the existence of the EPS which one can join directly or participate in through a national society. Given its unique position, the Society has set up the European Register of Physicists and the necessary procedures for handling applications for entry on the Register.
<P>
<STRONG>Requirements for Admission
</STRONG><P>
To be admitted to the European Register of Physicists, the academic qualification must be in physics or in a physics-related area which is acceptable to the Register Commission. It must have involved the equivalent of at least three years full-time university-level education.
<P>
Evidence of at least two years of appropriate experience gained in a professional capacity  after graduating is also required. This experience could include research and development, project management, supervision and the training of others, and safety management.
<P>
The remaining period, which must have lasted for at least two years, may consist of either education leading to an academic qualification or appropriate experience involving responsibilities and deemed satisfactory by the Register Commission. It must also include a period of training during which the applicant has acquired aptitudes or skills needed to exercise in the chosen profession and in a responsible capacity.
<P>
These requirements clearly show that Eur Phys is not an alternative to degrees awarded through traditional academic channels. Instead, it is complementary to the hierarchy of academic degrees: it requires evidence for a minimum of practical experience, performance and professional behaviour along with a minimum level of recognised academic training. 
<P>
<STRONG>The Register
</STRONG><P>
Those included on the European Register of Physicists are:
<UL><LI>able to use the designation European Physicist and its abbreviation Eur Phys;
<LI>
kept informed, by means of a section in Europhysics News, the Bulletin of EPS, and a special electronic newsletter, about professional aspects relating to the practice of physics and of developments in the professional recognition of physicists.
<BR>
</UL>
Inclusion of a physicist's name will give the public an assurance that the physicist concerned has satisfied the Register's requirements and has agreed to adhere to a Code of Conduct.
<P>
The Register is open to all physicists in Europe. For admission it is necessary to produce evidence satisfactory to the Register Commission of the successfully completion of a minimum total period of seven years' professional formation, including:
<UL><LI>at least three years' university education in physics or in a physics-related discipline to an academic level acceptable to the Register Commission;
<LI>
at least two years' responsible post-graduation experience which may include a period of training;
<LI>
at least two years' additional university education and/or appropriate post-graduation experience.</UL> 
<P>
The initial phase of post-graduation experience may include training, whether formal or otherwise, but a candidate will be expected to demonstrate a capacity for independent judgment in work related to physics or its application. The nature of the experience may include research, project management, supervision and training, and safety management. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate an awareness of responsibility to the public when this is implicit in the nature of their work.
<P>
A European Regional Monitoring Committee evaluates the application. It is assisted by independent experts familiar with the regions in which applicants have trained and worked. The Committee then makes a short summary and a recommendation to the Register Commission.
<P>
The  Commission  reviews  the  summary  and  recommendation to ensure uniform, high standards. If  it  is  satisfied,  you  will  be  invited  to  pay  the registration  fee  of 250.- Swiss francs for  admission to the European Register of Physicists for an initial period lasting five years.
<P>
Thereafter, registration will be renewable without the need to submit a new application (although you might be asked to update your first application).
<P>
You will be provided with a formal certificate of registration. From then on you will be able to use the designation European Physicist.

<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Acknowledgments</STRONG> are due to those who thought of the Register, and who believed in it from the start, namely Peter Boswell, Secretary of the Register Commission, Eddy Lingeman, Secretary of the European Regional Monitoring Committee, and last but not least Derek Jefferies who formulated the scheme and is now the coordinator.
<HR>
<STRONG>Information and application forms</STRONG> can be obtained on the WWW EurophysNet service at <A HREF="../eurphys">http://epswww.epfl.ch/eurphys</A>, from many national physical societies and from E.W.A.

<P>
Some applicants have been asked to resubmit applications once they have gained more experience; others have been asked to provide additional information. The Register Commission is aware that the application and registration fees may present difficulties for some applicants. The problem is under study, and proposals will be made in due course to the Council of the EPS. Eventually, the operation of the Register should become self-supporting, and render possible the establishment of a Eur Phys Solidarity Fund.
<P>
National physical societies have been asked to help ensure that the European Register of Physicists becomes well established by:
<P>
- making the Register known to their members;
<P>
- nominating representatives to the European Regional Monitoring Committee.

<B>Remembering Gilberto Bernardini</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Gilberto Bernardini, the first EPS President, left us on August 4 of this year while living in his beloved Florence where he was born in 1906.</B>
<UL>
<LI><I>Gilberto Bernardini in April 1968 at the EPS Inaugural Conference</I>.
</UL><HR>
<P>
<I>"....We do believe, then, that Europe is the country that has the best chances of bringing a fundamental contribution to the creation of this new approach to the life where science will represent a new humanism for the structure of societies, as well as for the comfort of individuals. The European Physical Society, according to us, should be formed into these hopes."</I>
<P>
It was with these words that Gilberto Bernardini ended his speech at the ceremony held in the University of Geneva's Aula Magna on 26 September 1968 marking the foundation of EPS.
<P>
His message culminated the realisation of the dream that Gilberto spoke of for the first time at the National Conference of the Italian Physical Society in November 1965 in Bologna. This dream was defined and articulated three years later in Pisa in the spring of 1968 following the creation, at the end of 1967, of a steering committee to draw up the first EPS Constitution.
<P>
As Bernardini recalled in 1988 when we celebrated in Pisa the 20th anniversary of the foundation of EPS, the Society's creation was a "milestone of the future European nation ...."  - nation that he and the founding fathers had in mind for the physics community throughout Europe, both east and west. This "universal spirit" was present in Florence at the EPS Inaugural Conference held in April 1969 at the Palazzo Vecchio with Bernardini, as the   EPS President (1968-1970), in the chair. It was present 24 years later in Florence at the 9th EPS General Conference and celebration of the 25th EPS anniversary, where he made one of his last public appearances.
<P>
Before becoming President of EPS, Gilberto  was from 1961 to 1967 the second President of the Italian Physical Society. He always represented an exceptional point of reference, both as a scientist and as  a human being, in developing and strengthening the unity and cultural development of physics in Italy and in Europe. With him a truly historical era disappears, since he belonged to the group of founding fathers to which we owe the renaissance of physics research in Italy in the 1950s after the Second World War. Its members tackled a challenge that let Amaldi, Bernardini, Occhialini, and Rostagni among others, together with Polvani, the first President of the Italian Physical Society, assume the  inheritance of Enrico Fermi and Bruno Rossi who worked in Rome and in Florence in the 1930s.
<P>
It was in fact near Florence (in Arcetri) that Gilberto met Bruno Rossi in 1928. Let's quote Rossi himself from "Early Days in Cosmic Rays" [<I>Physics Today</I>, October 1981]: <I>".... The group I found in Arcetri was quite small, but quality made up for the size. Gilberto Bernardini, a recent PhD in physics from the University of Pisa, had joined the group before my arrival. Among the students were Guiseppe Occhialini, Giulio Racah, Daria Bucciarello, Guglielmo Righini, Lorenzo Emo..... Both Bernardini and I were very anxious to start some experimental program ...."</I>
<P>
It is this tradition which enabled Gilberto, after his research in the United States (Columbia, Urbana and Chicago), to contribute personally and enormously to the evolution of cosmic-ray and elementary particle physics in Italy in the 1940s with the realisation of the "Testa Grigia" laboratory on Mount Cervino (Mont Blanc) in 1942. It was the first European high-altitude laboratory dedicated to detecting cosmic rays. Moreover, Gilberto Bernardini, together with Edoardo Amaldi, was one of the founders of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (the INFN). He served as the organization's first President from 1954 to 1961 while contributing to the foundation of CERN, where he was Director, initially of the Synchro-cyclotron (SC) Division and subsequently of the Research Division. His Presidency of the INFN saw the creation of the National Laboratory of Frascati with its 1000 MeV electrosynchrotron which was for some time Italy's principle research instrument. This step allowed Italian physicists to work once again at the frontiers of nuclear and sub-nuclear physics and of the related studies on the fundamental interactions.
<P>
Last September's meeting on "Astrophysics and Cosmic Rays" held in Florence to honour Occhialini, Pontecorvo and Rossi - three of Italy's most eminent physicists - should have been opened by Bernardini. Unfortunately for us he could not attend. Now he has joined them for ever in our memory. And together with them he leaves us, as his precious heritage and his most  edifying example, not only his scientific stature but also his inspiring humanity.

<P>
<B><I>Second international Conference on Research and Communications in Physics</I></B>
<P>
18-22 September 1995; Tokyo, Japan
<P>
The international physics community will continue to explore the furthest frontiers of Nature and work for the benefit of humankind. We are therefore committed to basic science as one of the highest expressions of human culture, and to applicable science as an essential instrument for human progress.
<P>
We acknowledge our obligation to contribute to the prosperity and welfare of all peoples, to dispel the ignorance which imprisons humankind in superstition, conflict and error, and to work for international amity and peace.
<P>
In pursuit of these goals,
<P>
&#133; We shall seek to apply the physical sciences to the problems of society such as energy, the environment and renewable resources. Partnerships among scientists from the developing and developed nations will work together to improve economic conditions in all regions. We acknowledge that unless everyone shares in the sustainable growth of the international economy, no nation can be secure in its prosperity. We seek to accelerate industrial development and to ally fundamental and applied sciences with the engineering sciences in common cause. We will forge collaborations with industry to support the exploration of new and exciting scientific and technological innovations.
<P>
&#133; We shall strive to invigorate education in the physical sciences at all levels; for children, university students and graduates, and for the wider public. Only an educated public will be prepared to benefit from the emerging technologies. And only an informed public is equipped to decide upon and support the investments needed to improve and expand the economic base of society.
<P>
&#133; Because science is an international enterprise, dependent upon the collective  intelligence of the international science community, we shall work to broaden the use of the new telecommunications technologies throughout the world. The physics community will exploit these new tools to improve inter-personal contact and dissemination of knowledge through electronic publishing, communication, research, and education.
<P>
We call upon all governments, non-governmental organizations, international agencies, sister disciplines, regional and international foundations, the international scientific unions, national academies, and others to join with us in common cause.
<P>
We shalll convene the <I>Third International Conference on Research and Communications in Physics</I> to asses our progress in achieving these goals and to establish new objectives for the coming century.

Many Opportunities for Collaboration 
</H2>
<P>
The EPS Internet Coordination Group  (ICG) and the EPS Publications Committee ad hoc Discussion Group for Online Publication organized a discussion meeting in Paris on 26 February to review developments in electronic communication in science, current activities carried out under the EPS <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch">EurophysNet</A> umbrella, and plans for future action. The meeting was divided into sessions on indexing, electronic publications and information services to reflect  EPS initiatives involving Oldenburg University's PhysNet index services, the EurophysNet information service supervised by the  ICG and the deliberations of the Publications Committee, part of which involve a Task Force on Electronic Publishing. In a short introduction, Franck Lalo&euml; (ENS Paris) who chairs the Publications Committee, spoke of the pressure from colleagues to exploit electronic means of communication and to consolidate the proliferating sources of information. He felt that the EPS was in a good position to act, at least as a coordinator. WWW URLs of the services described below are available in <A HREF="../ene/ene_apr96.html">europhysics news extra</A> (March-April 1996) on <A HREF="../index.html">EurophysNet</A> at http://epswww.epfl.ch).<HR>
<P>
<B>PhysDep Expansion
</B><P>
 The first PhysNet pilot project to be operated under the EurophysNet umbrella, namely the <A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/Harvest/brokers/EurophysNet/PhysDep/query.pl.cgi">PhysDep</A> indexing service, was reviewed by Eb Hilf (Oldenburg University). PhysDep allows one to search for information (research topics, fax numbers, teaching materials, etc.) found on the WWW pages of European Physics Institution Servers. The service is in the process of being upgraded by ensuring that the indexed pages are authorised by institutions and by encouraging the use of tags and keywords to improve the indexing. It was felt at the meeting that the authorization procedure needed top-down action as well as the bottom-up identification of sources using search engines. The ICG has therefore recently asked national physical societies to nominate National WWW Coordinators who would help ensure that physics institutions name authorised WWW server sites which they then make known to PhysDep.<P>

<P>
Eb Hilf envisaged a series of index services for various topics, each operating under the PhysNet banner and collaborating with groups specialising in particular topics. Like PhysDep, they could be supervised by EPS under the EurophysNet umbrella, and perhaps carry the EPS logo as long as they fulfiled set standards.
<P>
<STRONG>TIPTOP Collaboration
</STRONG><P>
A group based at the Technical University of Vienna maintains a list of physics servers as part of a well-known collection of useful physics links called Physics Around the World (<A HREF="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/physics-services/">PAW</A>). The site's developers (Mikko Karttunen, a student at McGill University in Canada, and G&uuml;nther from the TU Vienna) agreed at the meeting that PAW would collaborate with PhysDep to create a single list PhysNet of physics institution servers. It will be mirrored at The Internet Pilot TO Physics (<A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/">TIPTOP</A>) to which PAW now belongs.<P>
<IMG SRC="../ene/ene_apr96_paris_fig2.gif">
<UL>
<LI>From the  left, G&uuml;nther Nowotny, Mikko Kartunen  and Kenneth Holmlund, founder members of TIPTOP who partictpated at the EPS discussion meeting. Kenneth and Madelen Holmlund from the University of Ume&aring;, Peter Berglund from the Helsinki University of Technology, and Risto Nieminen from the Centre for Scientific Computing in Finland recently joimned TIPTOP, along with Karen Keck and Norman Redington from the MIT-based <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/~redingtn/www/netadv/">Net Advance of Physics</A>.
</UL>
<P>
TIPTOP is a new "world-wide, one-stop, knowledge-server", and Mikko Karttunen described how it took shape in the early 1990s when he and Nowotny created PAW. The TIPTOP team has automated the laborious work of running a state-of-the-art global information service over WWW using a dedicated server in Sweden. The MIT-based Net Advance of Physics has joined the project, bringing a subject index to archival literature as well as a US site.
<P>
TIPTOP operates sophisticated upload facilities that allow users to input information that can then be made available in a systematic fashion over the WWW. It was agreed at the meeting that the complementary PhysDep and TIPTOP upload facilities will be coordinated to ensure that physics institutions have a highly visible entry point for updating the institution list. 
<P>
<STRONG>PhysDoc and PhysDis
</STRONG><P>
PhysNet launched late last year a second service, called <A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/Harvest/brokers/EurophysNet/PhysDoc/query.pl.cgi">PhysDoc</A>, which indexes documents stored on PhysDep servers. Thomas Severiens, a student from Oldenburg University who helped establish PhysDep, outlined the reasons for selecting the <A HREF="http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu">Harvest </A>search machine (it is one of the best available and lies in the public domain). In the case of PhysDoc, indexed information may be either full texts or bibliographic information, depending on how an author  stores a document locally. PhysDoc complements the centralized e-print bulletin board system based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov">LANL</A>), especially for fields where no e-print slots exist and for non-permanent documents, large graphic-oriented papers, annual reports, and scanned-in texts.
<P>
In order to enlarge PhysDoc's coverage beyond the present 3 000 documents stored in servers based at 70 European institutions, the ICG is in the process of contacting physics institutions through the national coordinators to ask them to make sure that the document archives are known to PhysDoc. PhysNet is also planning to enlarge the scope by establishing an index (PhysDis) for PhD theses. In this case, authenticity is extremely important and has to be guaranteed by institutions. It is envisaged that the national coordinator scheme will lead to the necessary authenticity, and that PhysDis will also operate under the PhysNet banner as a EurophysNet service supervised by the ICG.
<P>
 It is also necessary to improve PhysDoc and PhysDis indexing by ensuring that the search engines identify relevant documents. Information providers can help by using a short list of metatags or keywords. Paul Ginsparg (LANL) suggested that indexing information contained in the headers of PostScript files can also be accessed. It was therefore agreed that physics institutions would be asked by the ICG through national coordinators to incorporate metatags, keywords or PostScript header information to denote basic indexing items such as authors, titles, etc.
<P>
<STRONG>Links to Indexes
</STRONG><P>
Several major institutions and commercial databanks and publishers maintain indexes of specialised literature and/or substantial collections of electronic documents stored on-line. It is important to see if these sources can be integrated into the PhysDoc index without excessive effort. In the case of institutions, this should be reasonably straightforward if resources can be found to set up scripts that pass queries from the PhysDoc query interface to the institution index. It was therefore interesting to review institutional indexes.
<P>
Hartmut Preissner from DESY, Hamburg, described the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's <A HREF="http://www-slac.slac.stanford.edu/FIND/spires.html">SPIRES</A> high-energy physics index that has been mirrored at DESY since 1973. The index is extremely comprehensive, but labour intensive and further effort is needed to convert it into a modern, automatically loaded, WWW-compatible database system. However, while extension of the SPIRES system into other fields seemed unlikely, it appeared that a query interface to PhysDoc could be implemented.
<P>
Michael Draper described how CERN is extending its WWW <A HREF="http://preprints.cern.ch/">preprint server </A>by interfacing it to the organization's library database system ALEPH. After this is established it should be possible to see how the query interface could be linked to PhysDoc. Once again, the CERN approach is unique and poorly adapted for more general use.
<P>
Only a few projects have developed ways to pass WWW search queries between different systems. However, the <A HREF="http://www.physik.th-darmstadt.de/htdocs/fachinfo.html">TH Darmstadt</A> has pioneered techniques to search for documents stored in the servers of several German libraries. This experience suggests that PhysDoc could be interfaced to other indexes without too much effort. 
<P>
<STRONG>General Information
</STRONG><P>
Kenneth Holmlund described how TIPTOP has introduced new features which will doubtless soon become as popular as PAW. The most important are a "<A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/LEP/">living encyclopedia</A>" of physics (an on-line encyclopedia maintained by authors and editors), a &quot;<A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/VLAB/about.html">virtual laboratory</A>&quot; in physics with interactive online experiments, a global bulletin board for announcements, and an online archive of PhD theses. Discussion focussed on how TIPTOP could be collaborate with physical societies and with EurophysNet in these areas. In addition to PhysDis, Oldenburg's PhysNet team, in collaboration with a group from Kiel University, has in mind a PhysEd indexing service for educational materials. So interaction with TIPTOP in the education area seemed possible.
<P>
TIPTOP's global bulletin board also offered interesting possibilities for collaboration, in addition to maintaining the institution list. It was agreed that TIPTOP would provide a EurophysNet <A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/FORUM/CONF/newconfentry.html">upload facility</A> for conference organizers wishing to place announcements on WWW. It was also envisaged that the EurophysNet Europhysics conference list would be merged into the bulletin board to give PhysCal, a single physics calender. Eventually, one could envisage doing the same for job openings (EurophysNet maintains a list of pointers to lists of <A HREF="http://www.nikhefk.nikhef.nl/~ed/herepeter.html#jobs">job openings</A> and jobs announcements can be <A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/FORUM/JOBS/newjobentry.html">uploaded</A> into TIPTOP ).
<P>
<STRONG>Electronic Publications
</STRONG><P>
Electronic preprints and prepublications obviously represent a key aspect of communication in science so it was very interesting to hear Paul Ginsparg's opinions during his review of the status of the renowned <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov">Los Alamos e-print server</A> with its 36 000 accesses each day. The server has been mirrored at <A HREF="http://babbage.sissa.it/">SISSA</A> in Trieste since 1992 and at <A HREF="http://physinfo.uni-augsburg.de/archiv">Augsburg University</A> starting in 1993; an Australian mirror takes to the air shortly and discussions are underway to establish mirrors in Brazil, France, Russia, and Sweden. An important recent innovation is  an upload filter to ensure that stored TEX documents are reasonably homogeneous. Ginsparg agreed at the meeting that one could envisage a consortium of European preprints servers based on the Trieste and Augsburg sites, and on others which could be rapidly put into operation in Paris and Ume&aring;. One possibility is to coordinate activities under an EPS/EurophysNet umbrella and logo - an approach that would guarantee long-term stability, security and accessibility. Other countries could be included in the future, and the framework could provide a base for expansion into fields not covered so far. One could also organize experiments involving such things as indexing and storage that would eventually provide add-on services offering secure archival, links to publishers, thesauri, sophisticated search engines, systems for annotating texts, etc. One such service could be a clearing house to mark up texts prior to transmittal to publishers. Hans Sens, who has been much involved in promoting the use of standard mark-up to ensure flexible, robust and durable archiving, presented a proposal along these lines.
<P>
The framework may also be appropriate for evaluating on-line peer review - a subject which was not directly addressed at the meeting. However, it emerged that an interesting experiment is planned in high-energy physics involving a fully electronic journal, including refereeing by the usual techniques. The American Physical Society has apparently expressed interest and offered encouragement. The EPS could perhaps be involved as well by, for instance, asking its High Energy and Particle Physics Division to propose coeditors, as is already the case for Europhysics Letters.
<P>
Publishers clearly have an interest in such developments so it was useful to learn about the status of electronic publishing as seen from their standpoint. Many  larger publishers are producing, or will soon produce, electronic versions of journals in parallel with printed versions. Smaller publishers, including those in eastern Europe, are considering this possibility.
<P>
One interesting aspect of electronic publishing that is often overlooked is historical archiving. Walther Bollman from Jena University described a project that is archiving, on CD ROMs, Annalen der Physik 1-20 (1999-1805) as well as papers published in Annalen der Physik and Z. Physik in 1920-24. It follows on from a project that archived in the FIZ Karlsruhe PHYS database some 2000 papers published in 1900-78. Discussion naturally centred on the possibility of having such archives available over WWW and integrated into a larger information system. 
<P>
The future in a time of rapid change may not be foreseeable. The discussion meeting demonstrated that one nevertheless has not only the duty but also the opportunity to cooperate and collaborate coherently as a single distributed  group in establishing a web of integrated services.

From the left, R. Herzog, the President of Germany, with J. R&uuml;ttgers, the Minister for Education, Science, Research, and Technology, and R. von Weizs&auml;cker, the former President, at the cermony to mark to 150th anniversary of the Germany Physical Society on 22 March. The cermony formed part of the Society&#185;s 59. Physikertagung which included a press conference announcing the 1995 <A HREF="#memorandum">Memorandum on Energy</A>.
<BR>
<HR>


<BR>
The German Physical Society, on the occasion of the first follow-up conference of the signatories of the Rio convention on the climate (Berlin, 28 March - 7 April 1995),  issued a <A HREF="#memorandum">Memorandum</A> on Energy appealing for public support for energy policies. As a major technical and economic power, Germany should take a lead in implementing measures to stabilise the Earth's climate. The Memorandum, summarised below, recommends that Germany reduce its CO2 emissions to 20% of today's level by the year 2050. It notes that despite several positive high-level declarations, long-term planning is still lacking and that guidelines are needed to strengthen the ways that will be applied well into the next century to guarantee protection of the climate.
<BR>
<HR><P>
The uncontrolled emission of green-house gases, especially carbon dioxide, enhances in a very dramatic way our atmosphere's  natural green-house effect. The atmosphere's normal CO2 content gives rise to an average global temperature of the atmosphere of 15 oC that permits life as we know it to develop. The rapidly growing and enormous use of fossil fuels accumulated over millions of years will lead to a doubling of the atmosphere's CO2 content in the next century (an effect that is accelerated by other gases such as ozone and nitrous oxide). Calculations [<A HREF="#ref1">1</A>] by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization show that this doubling will lead to an increase of 1.5 to 4.5 oC in the average global temperature. The latest data demonstrate that the atmosphere has already warmed up by more than 0.5 oC, and an increase of 2.5 oC corresponds to one-half of the difference in temperatures between recent ice ages and the intervening warm periods. A 0.5 m increase in the mean sea level, must be expected along with the disappearance of major wheat growing regions, enlargement of sub-tropical dry zones, deforestation in the temperate zones, and a dangerous melting of the tundra's permafrost. The paradox is that the people who will suffer most from these climatic changes are not responsible for their development.
<P>
The Rio de Janerio convention of 1992 agreed that the joint efforts of nations should aim to limit over the next 100 years the increase in the atmosphere's temperature to 1 oC. To reach this goal, the IPCC has recommended a 40% reduction by 2050 of CO2 emissions. The highly industrialised countries are responsible for three-quarters of today's CO2 emissions so they will have cut back to a more than proportional 20% of their present-day levels to achieve the proposed limit. Action is unavoidable since even with this target, the expected increases of the world's population and its economic activity imply a doubling of the atmosphere's CO2 content within about 100 years.
<P>
The German Physical Society is aware that there has not been enough public discussion about the issues involved. One may also forget that the reductions cannot be achieved through separate, independent steps without an overall strategy. Moreover, planning must be implemented now because several decades will pass before effective technical solutions are fully exploited in buildings, transport, heating, housing, and power generation, essentially owing to the extended lifespans of existing systems. One should also be aware that reasonable effort in all of these areas will not be sufficient to meet the proposed limit.
<P>
The recommendations (see <A HREF="#recommendations">insert</A>) of the Society's 1995 Memorandum on Energy [<A HREF="#ref3">3</A>], in endorsing a parliamentary committee's [<A HREF="#ref2">2</A>] recommendations for energy saving and a coordinated world-wide energy policy, stress the need for long-term planning. Economic incentives to encourage industry to adopt energy-saving measures are also required since improved technology for all of the main areas (renewable; nuclear; energy efficient) will not be commercially viable in the short term. Job creation in new industries is expected to offset job loss, a sensitive political issue. The Memorandum then discussed in more detail technical measures for each of the three main energy consuming sectors, namely heat generation (accounting for 40% of the Germany's energy consumption), transport (20%) and electricity generation (40%).
<P><HR>
<H3><A NAME="recommendations">The Recommendations</A></H3>
<P>
- Man's consumption of energy must be related not to the resources available but rather to its effect on the world's climate. Supply based on fossil fuels must be reduced quickly and drastically to avoid problems related to CO2 emissions and associated climatic changes.
<P>
- The lifespans of buildings and energy-supply systems are so long that an effective reduction in CO2 emissions within the first half of the next century depends on decisions taken today.
<P>
- The industrialised countries must reduce CO2 emissions to 20% of today's level by the year 2050. Considerable investment will be needed to achieve this difficult goal, so political decisions providing long-term guidelines and the necessary economic incentives must be taken quickly.
<HR><H3><I><A NAME="memorandum">1995 Memorandum on Energy</A></I></H3>
<P>
The German Physical Society's 1995 Memorandum on Energy [<A HREF="#ref3">3</A>] follows on from a statement issued in 1987 jointly with the German Meteorological Society, the recommendations of a parliamentary committee [<A HREF="#ref2">2</A>] and the work [<A HREF="#ref1">1</A>] carried out by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It also falls within the framework of the follow-up to the 1992 Rio de Janerio convention on the climate.

<H2>EVENT</H2>
<H3>Young Physicists Meeting at the EPS-10 General Conference</H3>
<HR>
<h2>Job opportunities in Europe</h2>
 It is planned to hold a meeting of young physicists at the EPS-10 General Conference <CITE>Trends in Physics</CITE> (Sevilla; 9-13 September 1996) to discuss the job situation in Europe.<P>
During the lunch break on Monday 9 September (Hotel Meli&aacute; Sevilla).
<p>
<STRONG>Outline</STRONG>
<ul>
<li>Each participant gives a short review about the job-market situation in his or her 
country. This implies basic statistical data, trends, examples and hints (to be derived 
e.g., from the national physical societies, etc. - see below for details).
<P>
<li>Speakers from different European countries experienced in the various 
activities that have already been undertaken (e.g., in The Netherlands, France, Germany) 
give a more detailed perspective of the actions as well as of the outcome and 
possibilities that originated from them.
<P>
<li>A list of essentials needed in order to search for a position in physics throughout Europe will be drawn up in a round-table discussion.
<P>
<li>Based on this list, a European "frame" can be described: 
Starting from the experiences already gained, the WWW's job-opportunity links 
maintained by European national societies could be altered to contain not only 
links to databases, but also guidelines for presentating candidatures and interviews and special links to  institutions (e.g., Chambers of Commerce), and to people who have been successful.
<P>
<li>The results of the meeting will be published in <CITE>europhysics news</CITE> and on <CITE>europhysics news extra</CITE>.
</ul>
<P>
<STRONG>Programme details</STRONG>
<ul>
<li>To have the possibility of a comprehensive comparison, basic statistical 
data such:<P>
- the number of degrees awarded per year (Diploma/PhD) split into people who are
<P><ul>
<li>employed permanently
<li>employed temporarily
<li>unemployed
<li>no information provided.
</ul>
<P>To be able to judge about the importance of these data, it is important to 
derive not only the numbers, but also to determine some facts about HOW the data have been accumulated. As the job-market situation is changing rapidly, time-dependent statistics are interesting (e.g., survey over the last few years).
<P>
*Reference: <CITE>europhysics news</CITE> 27:2 (1996) 72, "A Mixed Profile" by E. 
Lingeman; who will be a speaker in Seville.
<P>
<li>Other national activities at all levels such as:<P>
<ul>
<li>institutional (national/regional departments of employment)
<li>economic (Chambers of Commerce)
<li>industrial (trainee programmes, workshops, infomation bulletins)
<li>profit-oriented (training programmes offered by specialized enterprises)
<li>not-for-profit (students' initiatives)
<li>university activities
<li>initiatives untertaken by national physical societies
<li>anything else that is of interest under these aspects 
.</ul>
<P>Their effects are also important, and thus will be presented in a short form. This does not mean that all of these topics can be described in detail, owing to the short time available for the meeting. It still seems worthwhile to survey these points as in general the quality and quantity of such activities differs greatly from country to country.
</ul>
<P> 
<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><P>
One of the main objectives of the meeting is to internationalize efforts. 
So going through the material, one should keep in mind, that the international 
connection is most important. Comments and ideas how this can be implemented most effectively will be the essence of the round-table discussion with the invited speakers, who are already engaged in the field and have industrial experience. <P><UL><LI>Proposals are WANTED.<p>
<LI>A limited number of participation grants are available.</UL><p>

<B>PHYSICS FOR DEVELOPMENT</B>
</H2>
<H2>
<B>Helping to Reach a Minimum Level</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Annick Suzor-Weiner, Professor of Chemical Physics at the University of Paris VI, who chairs the EPS Interdivisional Group of Physics for Development describes the Group's work which now favours joint initiatives.</B><HR>
<P>
The European Physical Society has always felt that there is a strong mutual interest in scientific collaboration between the more industrialised countries of northern Europe and the less advanced ones inside as well as outside Europe. This attitude was crystallised in March 1985 by launching the Interdivisional Group of Physics for Development (IGPD) chaired by Endre Lillethun from Bergen. The IGPD's 10th anniversary is an appropriate opportunity for reviewing its scope, past achievements and future perspectives.
<P>
<B>Focusing on Education and Research</B>
<P>
Some 220 members of EPS and national physical societies are presently IGPD members. As for all EPS Divisions and Groups, they joined by contacting the EPS Secretariat or their national society. Other individuals may be invited to participate in specific activities. A Board of 10, including the Chairman and the Secretary, is elected by the Group's members for no longer than six years, with at least half of the Board being renewed every three years. The Board, to which a few co-opted members may be added, has overall responsibility for the Group's activities and reports to the EPS Council. It was chaired until earlier this year by Lennart Hasselgren from Uppsala who took over from Endre Lillethun in 1992.
<P>
The IGPD's overall goal is to strengthen physics and physics-related research and education in developing countries, <I>i.e.</I>, countries which have not yet reached the same level of technical and industrial development as northern Europe and North America. This obviously covers a broad range of situations each calling for a different approach.
<P>
Most colleagues in northern Europe are easily convinced of the mutual benefits stemming from collaboration with east and central Europe and southern Europe, whose well-rained young physicists may contribute much. Links with several countries in Asia and South America undergoing rapid development are also sought. However, physicists often question the value of scientific cooperation with some countries, such as many in central Africa, where the general situation is so bad that other aspects seem much more urgent. The IGPD believes that any country needs a minimum level of scientific potential and education to avoid complete technological dependence, to relate imported technologies to local resources, and to be able to grasp any opportunity for improving living conditions. It aims to help create links between universities, institutions and individuals that enhance this indispensable potential.
<P>
Whatever the level of development, the Group focuses on collaboration between groups in developing countries from the same region, and on long-term collaborative research under the joint responsibility of physicists from both developing and more industrialised countries. To help initiate projects, the IGPD promotes the organization of meetings, preferably workshops and summer schools held in developing countries. As it has few resources for cooperation, the IGPD's possibilities are of course modest. But we can offer effective input towards developing long-term collaboration and training. Contacts with organizations supporting physics in developing countries (<I>e.g</I>., Third-World Academy of Sciences, International Program in the Physical Sciences, International Atomic Energy Agency, UNESCO) are essential to ensure complementarity and efficiency.
<P>
<B>A Range of Activities</B>
<P>
The IGPD has managed several very successful activities and some new initiatives are underway.
<UL>
<LI><I>A modern, large-scale solar energy plant. in southern USA.</I>
</UL>
<P>
&#133; <B>Workshop on solar energy:</B> One of the first, and most fruitful, activities of IGPD was to organize a workshop entitled <I>Planning of Network Projects in Materials Science and Solar Energy</I> in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1988. There were  52 participants from 18 African countries (from both English- and French-speaking regions which was unusual) as well as 14 specialists from Europe. Besides the strong interest in exchanging scientific information, a concrete outcome were plans for new or enhanced cooperation projects (<I>e.g.</I>, a collaboration between Senegal, Egypt, Thailand, Germany, and France on the study of special solar equipment in different types on southern climates, and another between Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Sweden in the field of photovoltaic cells).
<P>
&#133; <B>Southern European School of Physics: </B>Southern Europe has few training schools because the institutional infrastructure that offers and promotes courses is lacking. Initiated by Henri van Regemorter (Meudon Observatory) and Siegbert Raither (UNESCO, Paris), the Southern European Schools of Physics aim at providing supplementary training for talented Ph.D. physics students and young post-doctoral physicists from Europe, through interaction with senior scientists and between young physicists from different countries. Each is hosted by a different institution whose main research field matches the topic of the school. Funding was to be provided by UNESCO, the European Commission and the Council of Europe but this has not always been possible so some planned schools had to be cancelled. Two have been held to date (<I>Dynamical Processes in Molecular Physics</I> in September 1991 in Avila under G. Delagdo-Barrio from Madrid; <I>Lasers and Applications</I> in Heraklion in May 1994 under C. Fotakis from Heraklion). The outcome of the first two schools was very positive, largely owing to the quality of the interactions between participants. The IGPD feels strongly that this activity must continue, with a new location and topic each time. Extension of the geographic area to both eastern Europe and to all countries around the Mediterranean should be encouraged. Unfortunately, financing has been too problematic to allow the schools to be held on a regular basis. The IGPD will be collaborating in the organization of the third school that is being planned for Portugal in 1997, for which there are positive signs of support from some new funding sources.
<P>
&#133; <B>Satellite meetings:</B> Since its foundation the IGPD has worked hard to remind participants at the triennial EPS General Conferences of the problems physicists face in developing countries and of the need for cooperation between countries inside and outside Europe. For instance, a satellite meeting to EPS-8 (Enschede, 1990) organized by M. Rodot and D. Feil on <I>Physics and Physicists for Development</I> attracted more that 60 participants from 23 countries and resulted in a widely-distributed declaration. At EPS-9 (Florence, 1993), two IGPD members (F. Brouillard and C.G. Granqvist) gave talks during a session on <I>Physics in a Changing World</I>. In collaboration with the Action Committee for Physics and Society, we aim to organize a satellite school on <I>Renewable Energies</I> (mainly solar energy and related topics) after EPS-10 (Sevilla, September 1996).
<P>
&#133; <B>Conferences:</B> A conference in Dakar on spectroscopic methods in physics is  planned for early-1997. As usual, we intend to favour joint initiatives with other EPS bodies concerned with education and applied physics, notably the Action Committee for Physics and Society, the Interdivisional Group for Education, the new Interdivisional Group for Applied Physics and Physics and Industry, since technological development implies commitments in all these aspects.
<P>
&#133; <B>Directories:</B> A <A HREF="#gen0">catalogue</A> on research activities in physics and related fields in north and west Africa is being prepared by the IGPD with help from the International Program in Physical Sciences, Uppsala, which published a similar catalogue for east and southern Africa in 1994 [1]. The aim is to present active research groups, with an emphasis on experimental and teaching facilities, so as to stimulate regional cooperation by avoiding duplication [2].
<P>
More generally, it is the contribution of all its members which makes the IGPD visible and efficient. We believe that the Group's main resource comprises people having considerable knowledge and experience and that direct links between institutions or individuals in countries at different stages of development are more effective than solemn declarations. We aim to seize opportunities being offered by the European Union (EU) for supporting scientific collaboration, notably the many interesting opportunities for physics-related topics which are available outside the EU Training and Mobility of Researchers programme (<I>e.g</I>., the JOULE and THERMIE for research on energy). Improving teaching and training in physics, from the first year at university (or even secondary school) to the graduate level, are of primary importance and here we may be able to obtain substantial support from the EU <I>via</I> ALFA (academic formation in South America), TEMPUS and TACIS (for east and central Europe and the former Soviet Union), MEDCAMPUS (for countries around the Mediterranean), and CAMPUS (for African countries). Several bilateral programmes for cooperation between Europe and developing countries are also open to physics-related research. If we promote collaborations by circulating information on  funding sources and enabling direct contacts during schools and conferences, the IGPD will continue to help bridge the scientific and technical gaps between countries at various stages of development.<HR>

Was not present but after the meetings expressed interest in participation:
<UL><LI>V.A. Zayats, National Committee of Russian Physicists</UL><P>

<STRONG>1. Welcome by the EPS President</STRONG><P>

H. Schopper stated that EPS considers supporting activities in and with East and Central  European (E/CE) countries including European states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) as an important task. Unfortunately, some funds (e.g., Soros grants in the FSU) will be discontinued. In the future the East&ntilde;West policy of EPS should take into account the existing significant differences between E/CE countries. The recently formed new <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/ecg/ewtf.html">East-West Task Force</A> (EWTF) should concentrate on a few topics only.<P>

Considerable amount of money can be saved by moving the EPS Secretariat from Geneva to Mulhouse. Also some support from Brussels (EU) can be expected. The EPS budget shall be distributed among the committees in a competitive way. The committees should ask for money for specific actions. These actions should make EPS more visible than before.<P>

The EWTF consists of a kernel and of the representatives of the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/europa.html">national societies</A>. National societies should preferably but not necessarily be represented by their Presidents or General Secretaries. Continuity is an important item so that representatives of the National Societies should preferably serve for several election periods.<P>

<STRONG>2. Information on the purpose of the EWTF, EWTF Action Plan, EPS Strategy Plan</STRONG><P>

The rest of the Agenda was discussed in one item.<P>

J. Nadrchal gave information on the purpose of EWTF. He suggested that the whole body consisting of the kernel (J. Nadrchal, H. Szymczak and D.L. Nagy) and the contact persons will not meet very often. He reported about the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/ene/ene_feb96_presidents_text.html">1st EWTF Meeting</A> in Prague, 8 July 1996. He emphasised that conference support was given to applicants who were active participants of EPS conferences and were supported by their national societies. He suggested to insist on these conditions also in the future. He summarised the principles and items of the proposed Action Plan.<P>

A. Sandulescu suggested to extend full membership of the EWTF to all national delegates. In reply, H. Schopper repeated that inexpensive and efficient work can only be expected from a small kernel. D.L. Nagy emphasised that all national delegates will take part in decisions and the kernel is nothing but the executive board of EWTF.<P>

V.O. Andreev stressed the importance of the access to electronic journals and to NATO grants.<P>

P. Sauer gave a report on the TEMPUS mobility program.<P>

Z.B. Rudzikas: general access to <A HREF="../../pub/en">Europhysics News</A>, to up-to-date books and the possibility of publishing in English journals are important items for the region.<P>

J. Dittrich: The national societies should build links to the industry within their own country.<P>

A. Sandulescu: Shall EWTF ask for additional money? Why is EPS not supporting activities in Romania?<P>

Z.B. Rudzikas: EPS conferences should be held in Lithuania in order to give morale and financial aid.<P>

D.L. Nagy: This seems to be a general demand from the E/CE countries. For example, Hungary also would like to host the General Conference of EPS and conferences of the Divisions.<P>

H. Schopper: We cannot expect more money from Brussels than until now. The EU is very much industry-oriented: the success quota of EU proposals in physics is not more than 6%. EPS can not force its Divisions to organise conferences in E/CE countries. The initiative should come from the E/CE country that should convince the corresponding Division.<P>

In what follows the Action Plan of the EWTF was discussed in detail. The Action Plan was explained by J. Nadrchal. I. Strzalkowski stressed the importance of supporting EPS Divisions and Groups&#59; D.L. Nagy emphasised the access of E/CE physicists to European large scale facilities should be strengthened.<P>

H. Schopper commented on the draft of the Action Plan. As a rule, activities should be concretised when money is asked for. This holds for organisational activities, to contacts with governments, to enhancement of scientific exchange and to use of European large-scale facilities. Regarding the support of the participation of E/CE physicists at  <A HREF="../../conf/eps.html">EPS conferences</A>, no fixed money should be asked for. Applications should be encouraged and  the EWTF should act as a referee&iacute;s board. EPS conferences have already formed a Solidarity Fund with a very high priority for applicants from E/CE countries. EPS is only willing to support activities of <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/interdiv.html">Interdivisional Groups</A>, Task Forces, etc. not, however, of <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/division.html">Divisions</A> that have sometimes more money than EPS itself. Joining of E/CE countries European large-scale facilities can be supported if the proposals are concretised and priorities are set. As of generally simplifying visa formalities of scientific visitors, the possibilities of EPS are very limited. In some cases, however, guarantee is asked for that can be overtaken by EPS. The initiative of exchanging journals and disseminating information about cheap and used equipment should be encouraged. The importance of this latter item was stressed and some technical questions discussed by V.O. Andreev, H. Schopper, S. Lanyi and J. Nadrchal.<P>

The rights of the corresponding members (contact persons from the national societies) were further discussed. V.O. Andreev remembered that presently only Central European countries are represented in the kernel. The result of the discussion was that EWTF shall meet its decisions only after the national representatives have been consulted and the decisions will be formulated by the kernel.<P>

H. Szymczak draw the attention to the fact that large scale facilities exist not only in Western but also in Central and Eastern Europe. For example, there are Centres of Excellence of the Central European Initiative in Poland (the Warsaw heavy ion accelerator) where guests from Europe are expected. D.L. Nagy added that the Budapest research reactor is also in operation and is expecting guests.<P>

G. Thomas: Until now, there was no application from E/CE countries for the title <A HREF="../../eurphys/">European Physicist</A>. The probable reason for that is the relatively high registration fee. EWTF should apply for contribution from EPS for E/CE applicants.<P>

A. Sandulescu invited the EPS President to visit Romania and to contact governmental officers responsible for research. Physics Abstract is not refereeing EPS journals published in Romania&#59; EPS should consider paying a fee to Physics Abstracts for this purpose.<P>

The problem of simplification of visa for scientific visitors was discussed in some detail. While it was agreed that this is not a serious problem for most E/CE countries, differences exist and some countries (e.g., Albania and Rumania) would welcome the aid of EPS in this respect. A general problem is that the visa fee has increased very much.<P>

S. Lanyi: The mobility is often made more difficult by health insurance laws. EPS should contact the governments to simplify health insurance for scientific visitors.<P>

D.L. Nagy: The same holds for income taxes. EPS might consider formulating a recommendation for governments how to handle income tax and health insurance problems (reciprocity, waiving or refunding) for scientific visitors.<P>

G. Thomas: Recommendations for governments should be formulated by IUPAP rather than by EPS the former being a governmental organization.<P>

Z.B. Rudzikas: Repeatedly emphasises the importance of holding EPS conferences in E/CE countries.<P>

J. Nadrchal: As stressed by H. Schopper, the initiative should come from E/CE countries and directed to the Divisions. However, in order to achieve a better position of E/CE countries, more representatives of them should be incorporated in Division Boards.<P>

Z.B. Rudzikas: Not the national societies but scientific libraries should exchange journals and not only national journals should be included into the journal exchange program. EPS should give more emphasis to education.<P>

D.L. Nagy: <A HREF="../../pub/">Europhysics Letters</A> was formally received by the national societies but actually stored in scientific libraries. This praxis should be followed with other journals, as well.<P>

V. Urumov: Not only researchers but also physics teachers should be included into the mobility programs.<P>

V.O. Andreev: EPS should consider financially contributing to using Internet databases by E/CE physicists.<P>

E.A. Ershov-Pavlov: Probably the most important task is to promote mobility.<P>

It was agreed that the kernel should incorporate the results of the discussion into the Action Plan the revised version of which should be submitted to the Executive Council. It was also suggested that the Secretary General takes into account the relevant points of the meeting when preparing the revised version of the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/ene/ene_jun96_strategy_text.html">EPS Strategy Plan</A> for the Executive Council.<P>

A European Forum Aims to Unite Efforts
</H2>
<P><B>
G. Tibell who chairs the EPS Forum on Education outlines the background to the Forum's initiatives to promote physics among young people.
</B><HR><IMG SRC="../ene/ene_apr96_tibell_fig1.gif">
<UL>
<LI>Promoting physics in schools. G. Tibell, on the left, and L. Sammuelsson,on the right,  the Editor-in-Chief of the European Journal of Physics, the EPS journal for physics education. They are seen here with H.U. Bengtsrom, one of 12 finalists in a physics competition organized in 1994 among 2200 Swedish secondary school students that was sponsored by a Swedish newspaper.
</UL><HR>
<P>
One hears from many different countries in Europe about the difficulty to interest young people in the natural sciences. Things do not look the same everywhere, of course, and there are also differences between topics within the sciences. Closer connections to environmental problems might, for instance, give biology and chemistry a greater significance in the minds of young people. At last year's Thematic Conference Physics Studies for Tomorrow's Europe in Ghent, many examples were given of the declining interest in physics at the secondary school level, and as a consequence, also at the university level. In an attempt to analyze the situation more closely, some possible causes for the trend were indicated at the Gent meeting:
<P>
* physics is considered difficult;
<P>
*  in some countries the teaching in schools seems to have lagged behind modern developments in physics which, in turn, could point to a third comment,
<P>
*  physics teachers are not given the opportunity to continue their own education, or they do not take up existing opportunities.
<P>
The exchange of students and teachers on the European scale will be supported by the new European Union's Socrates programme. In Comenius , the second of its three chapters, attention is focused on pre-university education, whereas Chapter I will continue with the present Erasmus programme in a slightly modified form. Other parts of Socrates will promote European contacts in the school sector. As an example, mention is made in Chapter III of support for projects developed by European associations operating in the various educational areas covered by the programme. Also mentioned in the same Chapter are visit schemes for education decision makers and European cooperation in open and distance learning.
<P>
<STRONG>National Societies Play a Vital Role
</STRONG><P>
However important these international exchanges may be, there are certain things which can also be done within each country. In this respect, the national physical societies could play an important role to encourage contacts between academia and schools. Such measures are already undertaken in many countries, but there are others in which improvements could be made. An inquiry made during 1994, under the auspices of the EPS Forum on Education, clearly shows that there is room for a further development along these lines.
<P>
A table on page 216 of the November/December 1994 issue of Europhysics News shows the results of the Forum's inquiry, in a very condensed form. It can be seen that almost two-thirds of the EPS member societies replied. The questions asked were geared towards information on contacts between teachers and university personnel, thought to make up the majority of physical society members. This assumption turned out to be wrong for some countries where the majority consisted of school teachers. In countries where few teachers are society members, and therefore few society activities concern school education, there may instead be frequent contacts with teacher associations.
<P>
Many physical societies have sections for education or teachers as part of their structures which run activities of various kinds. Many of the societies engage themselves in the Physics Olympiads, and help organize preparatory competitions within their school system in order to select the best national team. Continuing education for school teachers is another activity of great concern to some of the societies which were surveyed. Some also include educational matters in their regular meetings as well as in their publications.
<P>
<STRONG>Possible Initiatives
</STRONG><P>
More intense and more frequent contacts between academic researchers and physics teachers working in primary and secondary schools might be one way to help cure the last two causes mentioned above for the diminishing interest in physics. The aim would be to keep up or even raise the level of competence of school teachers which is acquired after finishing university training. Of course, the way future teachers are prepared for their jobs in schools could also be the subject of discussion. However, it seems reasonable to believe that even experienced teachers would be stimulated if, for instance, they are informed about new results in physics research, if they received help in designing demonstration experiments in physics, if discussions on the contents of courses at all levels were encouraged, and if there was collaboration in organizing competitions on problem solving and performing model experiments in physics.
<P>
In most secondary schools in Europe, pupils must choose which line to follow in the last few years of their schooling, whether the school be called a gymnasium, lyc&eacute;e or something else. In order to recruit more of these students into physics one could encourage the pupils to visit research laboratories or physics related industry, or at least have them exposed to some inspiring presentations of modern physics and its applications in everyday life. For a few years CERN has been very helpful in this respect by inviting young people or, beginning last year, teachers to spend a few days in the very stimulating environment of an active research laboratory.
<P>
Regarding the imbalance between boys and girls in physics classes, it was recognized at the Ghent conference that this might appear to be different in different countries. Very roughly speaking, Northern Europe seemed to be lagging behind the South, perhaps owing to cultural differences. It was felt that ensuring a good example was set should be an important issue, and in this regard countries such as Italy, Spain and France had an advantage over, for instance, the Scandinavian countries. There are, relatively speaking, more women working in physics in the former countries than in the latter, whereas in the latter it is unusual to find a female physics professor in , for instance, a university.
<P>
<STRONG>Forum on Education
</STRONG><P>
The Forum on Education recently set up a Board to discuss ways to proceed with activities on the European scale. An immediate task is to help organize a session on physics education at the next EPS General Conference Trends in Physics (Seville; September 1996). The Forum must also contact other organizations with similar goals such as, for instance, the IUPAP International Commission on Physics Education, the American Physical Society's Forum on Education and GIREP, the International Research Group on Physics Teaching. It was also proposed at Ghent to call on the Forum on Education to help establish the European Physics Education Network (EUPEN). The main lines of action of this network have been formulated and an application for financial support is to be sent to the European Community under the Socrates framework. It is noted that EUPEN plans to have a broader range of activities than the Forum on Education, for it would also assume responsibility for issues on university teaching as well as student and teacher exchange programmes.
<P>
For countries with physical societies or equivalent organizations such as The Institute of Physics in the United Kingdom which are already very active in promoting interest in physics at all levels (schools, universities, the general public, etc.), an EPS effort may seem superfluous. However, it is my belief that information about activities within these countries could serve as examples for others, and thus help increase efforts to pursue the important task of promoting an interest in physics among young people throughout Europe.

<A HREF="ene_aug95_jarlskog_text.html">1995 EPS High Energy &amp; Particle Physics Prize</A></H3>
<P >
The EPS High Energy and Particle Physics Division (HEPP) has awarded the 1995 High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize to: 
<P>
<B>Paul S&ouml;ding</B>, DESY-Institute of High-Energy Physics, Zeuthen,
<P ">
<B> Bj&ouml;rn Wiik</B>, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, <P>
<B>G&uuml;nther Wolf</B>, DESY, Hamburg,<P>
<B> Sau Lan Wu</B>, University of Wisconsin,Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
<P>
for the first evidence for three-jet events in e+e- collisions at PETRA, the 2.3 km in circumference storage ring at DESY which started operating in November 1978.
<P>
This important experimental contribution, first reported in June 1979, was the result of a large joint effort by accelerator and experimental particle physicists based both at DESY and collaborating institutes. It was obtained while the prizewinners were working with the TASSO detector, one of the four experiments initially installed at PETRA. It generated considerable interest and stimulated an enormous analytical effort because a possible interpretation invoked the creation of gluons by quark bremsstrahlung (in three-jet events, two jets - small bundles of several high-energy particles - originate from a quark and an anti-quark and a third jet from a radiated gluon).
<P>
The Prize was presented by the Chairman of the HEPP Division to the four prizewinners at the <I>1995 International Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics</I> (Brussels; 27 July - 2 August 1995).
<HR>
<H3><A HREF="ene_aug95_jarlskog_text.html">Special EPS High Energy &amp; Particle Physics Prize</A></H3>
<P>
The Executive Committee of EPS, in agreement with the Chairman of the EPS High Energy and Particle Physics (HEPP) Division, has awarded a special complementary Prize to: 
<P>
<B>The JADE Collaboration</B>, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg
<P>
<B>The MARK J Collaboration</B>, DESY
<P">
<B>The PLUTO Collaboration</B>, DESY
<P>
<B>The TASSO Collaboration</B>, DESY.
<P>
each responsible for one of the four detectors initially installed at DESY's PETRA storage ring.
<P>
While the 1995 HEPP Prize is in recognition of the observation of three-jet events representing a first indication for the existence of the gluon, confirmation of the existence of this important fundamental particle emerged gradually in several independent ways from data obtained by the four collaborations, all of which presented results for gluon bremsstrahlung in August 1979 at the <I>Lepton-Photon Conference</I> (Batavia, IL, USA). Confirming the existence of the gluon, the carrier particle for the strong interaction, was of fundamental importance for the Standard Model of particle physics. In view of this, and because the HEPP Prize can only be awarded to nominated individuals, the special Prize supplements the 1995 HEPP Prize by recognizing the Collaborations' achievements.
<P>
The Prize was announced by the Chairman of the HEPP Division at the 1995 <I>International Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics</I> (Brussels; 27 July - 2 August 1995) and has been communicated to the Spokesperson for each of the Collaborations (U. Timm for JADE, S.C.C. Ting for MARK-J, R. Felst for PLUTO, and G. Wolf for TASSO) and to those who presented the Collaborations' findings at the 1979 <I>Lepton-Photon Conference</I> (S. Orito for JADE, H.B. Newman for MARK-J, Ch. Berger for PLUTO, and G. Wolf for TASSO).<HR>

<P>
Edith M&uuml;ller, a member of the EPS Executive Committee from 1978 to 1983 when she served consecutively as Vice-Secretary, Treasurer and Secretary, passed away on 24 July. She was born in 1918 in Madrid where she studied before obtaining a diploma in physics and mathematics, and subsequently a doctorate, from Zurich University. After seven years as a research assistant at the university, she worked in Cambridge, Ann Arbor (MI, USA), and Basle before becoming an Associate Professor at the University of Neuch&acirc;tel in 1962, an extraordinary Professor at the University of Geneva in 1964, and Full Professor in Geneva in 1972. A specialist in astronomical spectroscopy and in solar and stellar atmospheres, she co-authored the basic reference on elemental abundances in the Universe which was among the most quoted astronomy texts for 25 years. Professor M&uuml;ller contributed greatly to the development of European solar space research, notably in experiments to measure the Sun's infrared radiation. Owing to her broad experience, she took part in many international programmes and made major contributions to the management of science. Besides being the General Secretary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and a member of the IAU Executive Committee, she served in various capacities with the Joint Organization for Solar Observations, the Astrophysical Centre (Canary Islands), the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Henri Chr&eacute;tian Fund. Her personal qualities and her outstanding example as a teacher, organizer, and pioneering astronomer will be greatly missed.

A Strategic Move
</H2>
<P><STRONG>
The 1996 EPS Council took place at the Technical University, Lisbon, on 22-23 March.
</STRONG><HR><IMG SRC="ene_jun96_council_photo1.GIF" ALT ="H. Schopper, J.-M. Bockel and G. Prado">
<UL>
<LI>The EPS President, H. Schopper (seated in the middle), signing the framework agreement with J.-M. Bockel, Mayor of Mulhouse (left) and G. Prado, President of the Universit&eacute; de Haute Alsace (right), that covers the establishment on 1 January 1997 of the EPS Secretariat at the Technop&ocirc;le de la Mer Rouge on the outskirts of Mulhouse. The ceremony took place in Mulhouse on 29 May in the presence of representatives of the various local and regional authorities and organizations that are partners in the agreement.
<HR></UL>
"A somewhat special report" was how the President, H. Schopper, described his introduction to the 1996 EPS Council, for Council was to endorse the first ever <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/ene/ene_jun96_strategy_text.html">Strategy Plan for EPS</A> [see accompanying item] and agree to the Executive Committee <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/ene/ene_dec95_constit_text.html">proposal</A> [EN 26 (1995) 133] that the Society base itself from 1 January next year in Mulhouse, France.
<P>
<STRONG>A Strategy Plan for EPS</STRONG>
<P>
The discussion that followed the President's presentation of the Strategy Plan, and implementation based on input from EPS bodies during the summer, confirmed the importance of having an agreed strategy that singled out the next generation of physicists as the key issue. For basic science is "facing new external conditions" and physics risks becoming an academic sideline in an era when research is a worldwide commodity and most of those who train as physicists will work outside physics (K.H. Chang, Utrecht). It was suggested that the Plan should therefore incorporate the notion of physics as an important and enabling science, and special effort must be made to ensure a strong and viable implementation - something that tended to be difficult for learned societies. Areas outside physics in which physicists find employment should be spelt out and advice on how to access these opportunities generated (H. Kummer, Vienna), especially in medical and environmental physics where there are many possibilities (T. Henriksen, Oslo). Disseminating this information, and indeed general information about EPS, was vital (L. Samulesson, Link&ouml;ping) and electronic means should be the priority (A. B&aacute;r&aacute;ny, Stockholm). National societies must be encouraged to incorporate the EPS strategy within their own plans (P.H. Melville, London). This would come about quite naturally if physicists from every country have the means to participate in EPS activities (D. Kiss, Budapest), which is not the case at present owing to financial constraints (J. Nadrchal, Prague); contacts with international organizations must also be strengthened (R.A. Ricci. Legnaro).
<P>
<STRONG>The Move to Mulhouse</STRONG>
<P>
Before Council, by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting, narrowly agreed to the proposed amendments to the EPS Constitution whereby the Society would be based in Mulhouse, the President reviewed the Mulhouse proposal. He first thanked the national societies that had made offers to host the EPS Secretariat. Mulhouse had been selected on the basis of apparently generous conditions made possible by the local authorities' wish to attract European organizations. The Budapest office would be closed down within two years and a future Secretary General, replacing G. Thomas on his retirement in August 1997, would be engaged in 1996 and made responsible for building up a new Secretariat. The Europhysics Letters partnership had decided to kept the journal's editorial office in Geneva for the time being so the office would be separated from the Secretariat , thereby reducing considerably the impact on the Secretariat staff. 
<P>
The Executive Committee was also proposing to change the unit fee from Swiss francs to the ECU to reduce the effect of the strong Swiss franc on the EPS budget and on members' fees. He was confident that cost reductions, modern management and the contracting out of tasks to national societies to reduce administrative overhead would allow greater support for activities, improved complementarity with national activities, an effective contribution to important problems (notably employment for physicists), and increased opportunities for generating a greater appreciation by the general public of the importance of physics. 
<P>
The President indicated that more discussion about the move in order to plan better links between the Secretariat and European organizations (K. Bethge, Frankfurt; R.A. Ricci) was inadvisable because there had already been a postponement. Mulhouse being not only within the European Union but also cheaper, and cheaper to visit, were important features (A.D.W. Jones, London), although they did not mean that the Society should not look beyond its traditional sources of funding for support.
<P>
The Secretary, J.-Ph. Ansermet (Lausanne) summarised the consequences of the move on the EPS part of the Secretariat staff (an equivalent of 3.2 people). The Secretary General and the Editor of Europhysics News would be based full-time in Mulhouse together with about two junior staff. J.L. Lewis (Malvern), the Treasurer, assured Council that the move would produce savings, beyond the period of the additional expenses. He could not produce  figures because they depended on many factors, including how the new Secretary General wished to organize the Secretariat. 
<P>
The audited accounts for 1995, which Council approved, reflected a very satisfactory year largely owing to a special payment to Europhysics News by Springer Verlag and to a surplus on conference activities. After attributing 59 kSFR to the Special Development Fund there was a surplus of 62.5 kSFR which eliminated the accumulated deficit. Council also approved the 1996 budget that sees a surplus of 30 kSFR  and support for a wide range of activities. A 1997 budget according to activities for greater transparency will be drawn up now that the Society's future base has been decided.
<P>
<STRONG>ECUs for the Unit Fee</STRONG>
<P>
The Executive Committee's proposal to change the unit fee to 9.76 ECU, based on the prevailing SFR-ECU exchange rate, was discussed in depth. A fee of 9.1 ECU was finally voted, it having been agreed by a show of hands that any value below the proposed fee implied a reduction and thus required the support of three out of four votes cast, with only IOM and national society representatives voting. Rounding up to 10 ECU (O. Poulsen, Copenhagen) and a decrease to 8.80 ECU, based on the rate that prevailed when the new EPS Constitution came into force (V. H&auml;selbarth, Bad Honnef), were proposed. A compromise would maintain the support for east and central Europe while reducing the impact of the strong Swiss franc (E. Jakeman, Malvern), given that averaging backwards in time made little sense (E. Osnes, Oslo), some adjustment for inflation was reasonable (C. S&eacute;benne, Paris) and fixing a particular day was arbitrary (C. Matos Ferreira, Lisbon). Council also agreed with the President's proposal that the unit fee be reexamined once the impact of the move to Mulhouse had been assessed.
<P>
<STRONG>Various Activities Highlighted</STRONG>
<P>
The reports by representatives of the various EPS Boards and Committees highlighted Internet-based activities as a major area of interest. Several Divisions and Interdivisional Groups have launched WWW-based newsletters. EPS initiatives are managed by the Internet Coordination Group which has recently launched a scheme to improve links between national WWW sites at the institute and society levels. The Group received the go-ahead to explore the possibility of making Division and Group membership lists available via WWW.
<P>
Physics teaching will receive a major boost once the European Physics Education Network (EUPEN) is in place (C.Matos Ferreira, Chair, Physics Education) and it would be wise to incorporate EUPEN into the EPS strategy (O. Poulsen). However, obtaining further funding for the European Union (EU)-supported European Mobility Scheme for Physics Student (EMSPS) to cover every east and central European country was proving difficult (H. Ferdinande, Mobility Committee) and reducing costs by having the administration contracted out to a national society may help (I. Strzaltkowski, Warsaw). But the demand remained clear, especially since an impressive 70% of students moving within the scheme have been able to transfer course credits to their home universities.
<P>
The very positive response to the launch of the Eur Phys designation clearly showed the needed for enhancing the professional recognition of individual physicists in modern economies (M. Peter, Chair, Register Commission). So it was important to help physicists from the economically weaker regions of Europe meet the cost of registering by scaling fees (P.H. Melville, Chair, Applied Physics and Physics in Industry) and having them in ECUs (G.C. Morrison, Birmingham), by establishing a solidarity fund once there was sufficient income, and by extending the registration period (J. Bessa Soussa, Porto) if this was compatible with the need to demonstrate satisfactory retraining. In the meantime, more information must be circulated via national societies, especially  with regard to the impact of professional recognition on job opportunities (R. Morgenstern, Chair, Atomic and Molecular Physics). A proposal (P.H. Melville) to examine the possibility of having more than one physics-based EPS member society in a country, so that the scheme can be promoted more widely, was accepted. 
<P>
The Solidarity Fund that supports participation at EPS conferences using a levy had set off to a good start with funds for 33 grants available this year (R. Pick, Chair, Conference Committee). But EU-support had become more difficult to obtain since rules encouraged participation by young people while the reviewing of each European Research Conference (physics ERCs are proposed by Divisions) led to uncertainty about the ERC series.
<P>
Summaries of the decisions taken by Council (and by the Executive Committee that met on 21 March) were reported in News from EPS (March-April 1996 ).

Research Strategies for Europe
</H3>
<IMG SRC="ene_jun96_council_photo2.GIF"ALT ="[J.E. Fenstad and H.U. Karow]">
<P>
Promoting the importance of European Union (EU) support for basic research has become a vital issue, with most attention focused on the Union's next Framework Programme. K.H. Chang, the Director of The Netherlands' science funding agency FOM, speaking at the EPS Council felt that this effort risks becoming unfocussed since virtually every science-based organization in Europe is active. EPS must therefore define a clear strategy. J.E. Fenstad from Oslo, who chairs the European Science Foundation's (ESF) Standing Committee for Physical and Engineering Sciences (shown here on the left, with H.U. Karow, the ESF's Scientific Secretary for the Natural and Technical Sciences) explained in an invited presentation to Council that his committee aims to act as a platform to help the science and basic research communities develop arguments for the relevance of research. Long-range training in the context of the excellent scientific environment offered by facilities is a vital ingredient, so the ESF wants to create a clearing house to review proposals for facilities. In reinforcing links within the scientific community, this role would help build the vital broadly based consensus needed to launch a new facility. Another ESF goal is to secure more support for research from outside the EU's Training and Mobility of Researchers programme. According to D.L. Weaire (Dublin), who was elected as the EPS President-Elect by Council, science now expects too much from the programme, which has moved to centre stage for science.

Responsibility Unclear
</H2>
<P><STRONG>
Jaap Willems from the University of Nijmegen recently surveyed senior physicists and science journalists in The Netherlands in order to identify the barriers to communicating physics to the media and ways they may be overcome. The results were reported in the bulletin of The Netherlands Physical Society [Nederlands tijdschrift voor Natuurkunde 62 (1996) 59]. They indicated that most Dutch physicists felt popularization was needed, but had different opinions on who was responsible, especially since science journalists, while interested in physics, were handicapped by a low estimation of their own knowledge which led to a reliance on popular science magazines.<P>
</STRONG><IMG SRC="ene_aug96_willems_fig.gif">
<P>
Recent research shows that Holland's mass media give little attention to science in general and to physics in particular [1]. This is fundamentally not a problem unless the public and physicists feel that the situation is undesirable. However, both criticize the media. The public wants to know more about physics because of the money spent on research. It also worries about the future owing to what is happening in science. Meanwhile, physicists seek public support more and more due to their funding needs.
<P>
US surveys have shown that 40% of the population is interested in science [2, 3], and that many people want to learn about science from newspapers and television. The level of interest in Holland is unknown, but the popularity of science lectures, specialised science magazines, books about physics and so on gives the impression that physics is very popular.
<P>
Nevertheless, improvements are possible and barriers to popularising science do exist. A survey carried out in 1995 in Holland of 30 well-known physicists from universities and research laboratories and 20 science journalists working for newspapers aimed to identify the barriers to popularizing physics through communication between physicists and journalists [4].
<P>
<STRONG>
TV Better</STRONG>
<P>
All of the physicists said that popularizing physics is necessary, with only three expressing some reservations. As one explained: "Physics is everywhere in society but most people do not know how important physics is for everything. More and more people do not want to know about physics. That is dangerous. Even politicians do not know since most have an education in the arts".
<P>
Most also said that television offered the best medium for popularizing physics, but they were unhappy with the way television journalists treated the different fields of physics. The daily newspaper was the next best medium, and newspaper journalists were the more highly regarded.
<P>
All of the journalists said that they were interested in physics, but many had problems with its specialised and abstract character. One stated: "Physics is often too specialised, and physicists are most of the time unable to explain things: they know much about a very small field."
<P><STRONG>
Interested Generalists</STRONG>
<P>
Most of the journalists had to cover a variety of specialties in science. Part (1a) of the table shows that all were interested in physics to a moderate-to-large extent: those with a broad, general interest in science had a major interest, and even those reporting on a broad range of topics (not only science, but also medicine and the arts) were moderately interested.
<P>
Most of the journalists were educated as scientists, seven as physicists, so it seemed obvious that they were more-or-less experts in science. However, US surveys show that journalists often do not completely understand their material [2]. Many of the journalists said that they were essentially generalists: only two said their knowledge of physics was very good, (1b in table) and a few with university degrees in physics estimated their expertise as moderate, which is strange.
<P>
The journalists kept abreast by reading science magazines like Science and Nature - part (1c) of the table - and by attending scientific meetings [2, 5]. They generally did not appreciate conferences (too expensive; take too much time). The only highly valued meeting was the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The journalists who did not possess a degree appreciated magazines like Scientific American.
<P><STRONG>
Informal Rules</STRONG>
<P>
Formal rules covering the communication of research results can raise barriers between scientists and science journalists since they hamper and frustrate contacts [2]. Among the public-sector physicists, only one mentioned the existence of rules (erroneously in fact). Those working in the state-supported research and development agency TNO mentioned similar rules (all contacts with journalists should be arranged by a special department after permission has been granted by a department head). But they said that formal rules had never raised barriers to communicating with journalists. Similarly, physicists from industrial research labs mentioned that they were also subject to rules on communicating results, but that they too did not raise barriers.
<P>
Parts (2a) and (2b) of the table show that most respondents felt that the individual physicists themselves should normally neither make contact with the media nor decide on the information to transmit (the total number of answers was larger than the number of respondents because some gave more than one answer). About one-half mentioned informal rules concerning media contacts, but only two said they could raise barriers with journalists.
<P><STRONG>
Courses Needed</STRONG>
<P>
Most respondents had considerable experience of contacts between physicists and science journalists, and there were few complaints about the quality of the contacts. Part (2c) of the table shows that many of the physicists felt that courses in science writing offered the best way to improve communication with the press.
<P>
Barriers between physicists and science journalists also arise when scientists are incapable of explaining their work. When a physicist writes for the general public about a research topic one assumes that he or she would also be able to explain the topic to journalists. About one-half of the physicists had written for popular science magazines, although the reaction of colleagues was not always positive since some did not appreciate the popularization of science by fellow scientists.
<P>
Nearly all those who had popularized physics admitted that writing in a popular style was difficult - more difficult than writing a scientific publication. None of the respondents had followed a course on the popularization of science. Some physicists regretted the lack of such a training; others thought that they did not need it.
<P>
The science journalists expressed differences of opinion about the capability of scientists to explain their work; some stated that scientists were incapable of doing so, others had a good experience. The firm opinions expressed by some physicists are worth noting: 
<P><CITE>
"Physicists make their work more difficult than necessary. Chemists are more capable of explaining their work; they have learnt to communicate. Biologists are the best in science communication. Perhaps this is because of the character of biology. Physicists still have to learn how to communicate with the public."
<P>
"Most physicists are able to explain their work if you as a journalist ask the right questions. But most physicists indeed have difficulty in imagining the world of the layman: it is difficult for them to place themselves in a layman's way of thinking".</CITE>

<H3>Press Release</H3><P>

<H2>EPS Opinion on Basic Research in the Next Framework Programme</H2>
<P><STRONG>The text of a letter that was sent in June 1996 by the European Physical Society's Executive Committee to Mme. E. Cresson. It was accompanied in europhysics news extra by a <A HREF="ene_aug96_schopper_text.html">discussion</A> by H. Schopper, the President of the <A HREF="../info">European Physical Society</A>.</STRONG>
<P>
In the past European Union (EU) Framework programmes have focused on the development of generic technologies. These programmes have recently been supplemented by task forces which can be seen as driven by urgent social concerns. It is to be expected that EU research policy will remain application-oriented in the future.
<P>
However, we want to emphasize the widely recognized role that basic research plays for the long-term development of technology, industry and the economy. To guarantee European competitivity in the long run, this aspect should be taken into account when the next Framework Programme is set up. In particular, knowledge-based industries such as information and communication technology do not fit easily into the main EU programmes, as is well expressed in the European Commission's Green Paper on Innovation. For this reason the research policy needs to be established in a wider context that takes into account basic and applied research.
<P>
We do not expect that physics should enjoy privileged treatment, but it should obtain an adequate support if account is taken of its benefits to society in the general understanding of Nature, in applications in technology and medicine, and as the methodological basis for other sciences, e.g. chemistry, biosciences, geosciences. It has also pioneered the introduction of communication networks, new methods of teaching and the use of large facilities. Research networks in physics have been spearheading international cooperation in an outstanding way.
<P>
In parallel with other scientific bodies, such as European Science and Technology Assembly and the European Science Foundation whose recommendations we strongly support, we should like to make some specific suggestions. We believe that the scientific infrastructure in Europe could be strengthened by taking these into account when the fifth Framework Programme is formulated.
<P>
<STRONG>Suggestions
</STRONG><P>
1. The support given to training and mobility has been one of the most successful actions of the EU. Indeed knowledge and skills are best acquired by training in high-level research. The objectives of the ERASMUS and TEMPUS programmes should be continued and strengthened in the fifth Framework Programme. EPS has made a significant contribution to the management of the physics part of ERASMUS and TEMPUS and to the programmes themselves. It is prepared to continue to do so in follow-up programmes.
<P>
2. The support of conferences is essential for a better cooperation between EU countries on the one hand, but also with those in central and eastern Europe. Conferences also contribute to better relations between the academic world and industry. The funds for conferences should be increased and the programme should be handled in a more flexible way.
<P>
3. Large facilities have proven to provide excellent infrastructure for interdisciplinary research and international cooperation. Although the principle of subsidiarity will limit the EU actions as far as the construction and operation of large facilities is concerned, the present programme for their use should be considerably increased in order to improve the exploitation and coordination of large facilities and provide better access for scientists from smaller and less developed countries.
<P>
4. Small companies, often developed in the incubator units of university campuses, are
<P>
<UL><LI>seeds of future growth for European industry;
<LI>
ideal interfaces between the academic and commercial world;
<LI>
less resistant than larger companies to involvement with EU research programmes. With only a few employees (at least initially) they are the extreme lower end of the conventional "small and medium enterprises" definition. They deserve a special place in European research policy.
</UL><P>
Grants to such companies can be small and of an exploratory nature. Every effort should be made to see that they are not burdened by paperwork. Support of this kind is available through structural funds in disadvantaged regions, but it is not always well attuned to the needs of technology-based companies. Moreover, such "microcompanies" can make an important contribution within more developed (but possibly stagnant) economies. The EPS through its Group specializing in industry links, can help to formulate and promote policy on the support of these new enterprises.
<P>
<STRONG>Summary
</STRONG><P>
EPS considers it as its obligation to contribute to the success of the European Union programmes. As in the past, it offers its services, be they in a consultative role or in implementing programmes on behalf of the European Commission.

<P>
The discovery and exploitation of physical, chemical and biological phenomena have given Europe and other industrialized countries advanced welfare systems combined with a high life expectancy and the ready availability of energy, food, mobility, and leisure time. Owing to today's problems such as unemployment, state deficits and criminality, politicians and the population as a whole often forget that this standard of living was achieved solely by vigorous effort - an effort which was ultimately based on fundamental research, where physics played a major role. Future technological development to maintain our advantages and to cover, in addition, the needs of the developing countries calls for an even greater effort; in view of the long-term aspects, basic research has also to be supported.
<P>
The present tendency, however, is to concentrate on near-term economic competitivity so the view is often put forward that research and development should be guided by market needs. Immediate competition might justify such an attitude, but relying on the evolution of existing technologies will not guarantee long-term competitivity. Indeed, the Japanese government has decided to double in the coming five years the funding of research at universities since the country anticipates that new ideas and visions will emerge from basic research.
<P>
The difficult question is, of course, a quantitative one: how much of our resources should be used to support basic research ? There is no objective answer to this question, although history has shown that industrialized countries should spend about 10% of their overall R&amp;D budget on basic science. A recent report by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities has argued that if a country spends more than 20% than it has insufficient industry to benefit from what is being accomplished in basic science. Conversely, spending less than 7% of the total national R&amp;D budget on basic research means that one has done next to nothing.
<P>
The science policy of the European Union (EU) is governed by the subsidiarity principle which implies that the Union's actions should be complementary to national programmes. Indeed, the EU's total spending on R&amp;D amounts to only a few percent of the combined national efforts of its member states. The major part of the EU Framework Programme concentrates on developing generic technologies at a pre-competitive level, with the topics mainly determined by industrial needs. The programme has recently been complemented by Task Forces which are even more strongly determined by today's needs, namely technology for automobiles, aeroplanes, railways, multimedia, etc. 
<P>
It was hoped that the Maastricht agreement would make it easier for the Union to extend its activities in a broader way to basic research. Meanwhile, several European scientific bodies (e.g., European Science Foundation, European Union advisory committees, European Science and Technology Assembly) have made recommendations which also imply a strengthening of basic research. However, the preparations for the next Framework Programme do not indicate such a trend. EU policy will of course remain application oriented, but it would be useful if, for instance, each specific programme contained a small component for research relevant to the programme, but not directly related to an objective. 
<P>
Based on the reactions and worries of some of our members, and on discussions in the Divisions and Interdivisional Groups, the Executive Committee decided to address the appropriate European Commissioner, E. Cresson, and to supplement the recommendations by other organizations with a statement covering a few specific issues. A memorandum (see insert) was formulated and sent in June to research ministers and to the European Parliament.
<P>
Secondly, on 1 July an EPS delegation comprising the President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Secretary General met J. Routti who took over as the Director-General of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Science, Research and Development (DG-XII) at the beginning of 1996. The aim was to discuss future policy and possible areas of cooperation with him and his colleagues, notably P. Kind who is responsible for cooperation networks and access to large facilities, and B. Schmitz who is responsible for indicators and accompanying measures. Dr. Routti, a physicist by training, has a full understanding and appreciation of basic research, and an impressive record as the Director of SITRA, the Finnish agency for research and innovation under the direct responsibility of the Finnish Parliament, where he made considerable contributions to the rapid development of Finland's high-tech enterprises. He favours strong basic research but feels, however, that it should also contribute to economic success through an efficient mechanism for transferring technology .
<P>
Four of the memorandum's topics were discussed in some detail, together with several general aspects of collaboration. The President pointed out that the ERASMUS, TEMPUS and TMR mobility programmes are very successful and have made considerable contributions to a closer cooperation in Europe. They should be strengthened since at present the success rate for applications to some TMR's activities is a mere 6%, implying that the effort of the majority of the applicants is in vain. Various ways to improve the success rate were considered. The introduction of qualification criteria could improve the situation so rules for qualified applicants will probably be implemented. However, it was agreed that the formulation of suitable criteria is very difficult and insofar as physics is concerned, it was ruled out that certain fields of physics should be exempted. EPS was invited to suggest qualification criteria and it was indicated that physics could possibly be a testing ground for a qualification procedure.
<P>
The delegation argued that specific programmes were not appreciated because applicants felt frustrated when applications were unsuccessful. Providing more information and making selection procedures more transparent would probably help improve acceptance by scientists..
<P>
We expressed our willingness to continue to help manage certain parts of the <A NAME="../dir/mobility.html">mobility</A> programmes, notably student mobility within ERASMUS and TEMPUS, and it was established that DG-XII support of conferences will continue as at present (i.e., for general conferences with a broad impact on science and society; TMR Euroconferences; European Research Conferences; dissemination of information).
<P>
We underlined the importance of further support for using and accessing large facilities, which include relatively small installations and not only the very large facilities. Research at these installations provides excellent opportunities, even for small groups, to participate in international and interdisciplinary work and to train scientists and engineers. The Director-General indicated that support for this activity will continue in the new Framework Programme.
<P>
Regarding relations between academia and industry, the importance of support for smaller enterprises was discussed, together with other more general issues.
<P>
We were assured that the good relations between the Commission and the EPS will continue under the new Director-General, while those responsible for the various specific programmes will redouble their efforts to help develop European science, and among it physics, in the most efficient and flexible way possible. However, we received the impression that increases in funding for basic research will be very limited, and even unlikely. It seems, moreover, that legal aspects and restrictions are becoming more important.

<UL><LI>The Framework V budget has not beeen discussed in detail, but MS seem to agree to at least keep the <STRONG>same budget </STRONG>as Framework IV.<LI>
Most Memeber States are in favour of Framework V supporting <STRONG>targetted precompetitive research</STRONG> and development whicle recognizing the ever shorter period between research and application.<LI>

The majority of Member States support the Task Forces' present role with their limited funding. However, 

some Member States favour having the Task Force activities funded <STRONG>&agrave; la carte</STRONG> (variable geometry). <LI>

The larger Member States seek better coordination with their <STRONG>national programmes</STRONG>.<LI>

To reduce administrative delays, the Member States seek no more than <STRONG>6-7 specific programmes</STRONG> in Framework V.<LI>
The Member States criticize strongly programmes directed at <STRONG>small-to-medium companies </STRONG>(e.g., CRAFT&#59; support for promotion in Framework IV) since they are ineffective. But they have no alternative suggestions.</UL>

The decision process is summarised below.</STRONG><P>
<UL>Only the European Commmssion has the right to to formulate Framework V. It submits a proposal simultaneously to the Council of Ministers and to the European Parliament.<P>

After the first reading by Parliament, Parliament submits advice to the Council which formulates a joint proposition grouping the positions of Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commisssion.<P>

If the points of view are different there is generally a second reading by Parliament, which can refuse the proposal of seek modifications.<P>

Once Framework V has been unanimously approved by Council and by the Parliament by a qualified majority, the programme is adopted. The Intergovernmental Conference now in place is seeking a qualified majority for Council decisions. If this is accepted it could come into force for the Framework V decision, thereby shortening delays (which are expected as the deciding on the co-decision process will take time).<P>

The various specific programmes within Framework V are formulated by the Commssion and adopted by the Council of Minsusters. Parliament is only consulted and has no decison-making powers in this area.

<B>RACIP-2</B>
</B>
<H3>
<B>World Congress of Physical Societies</B>
</H3>
<H5>
<B>The role of physics and its relations with industry featured strongly during discussions at the <I>2nd International Conference on Research and Communications in Physics</I> (RACIP-2) which went under the title <I>The World Congress of Physical Societies</I>.</B>
</H5><HR>
<P>
The Presidents of some 50 physical societies were either present or represented at the <I>2nd International Conference on Research and Communications in Physics</I> (RACIP-2) conference. Apart from the dissemination of an enormous amount of information concerning the development of physics in different parts of the world, several specific topics were at the centre of discussions. They were treated in plenary sessions and in panel discussions, and a Declaration (see insert), accepted by all the Presidents, was adopted at the end of the conference.
<P>
Various themes were considered (<I>e.g.</I>, communication technologies in physics, notably electronic publishing; physics in developing countries; the importance of secondary school physics education) but it was the relationship of physics to society and to industry which generated the most interest. Several speakers referred to the fairly common remark that with the end of the cold war, physics must find a new role and define a new relation to society. In addition to creating knowledge, and thus being part of human culture, its contribution to the development of applied technologies has to be strengthened and better explained to politicians and the public. New paradigms are needed to place the relationship between physics and society on a new basis. It was agreed that one of the difficulties in describing the role of physics to the public is the absence of a physics industry, in contrast to a chemical industry, for example. It was proposed that the term "industrial physics" should be introduced as one step towards improving the situation. But such a term might create additional problems by distinguishing applied and industrial physics from fundamental physics. The term "physics-based industry" that has been introduced by the UK's Institute of Physics is probably more appropriate.
<P>
Regarding the relationship between physics and industry, representatives of European companies pushed for more applied research, with one representative even going so far as to say that basic research is now unnecessary. The American Physical Society (APS) wanted to do much more to integrate industrial physicists and even their employers in its activities (in the discussion it was thought that involving the latter went too far). The Japanese government's view was totally different. It does not expect much from fundamental physics in the area of new product development, but recognizes that present technologies have achieved a certain maturity and cannot be further exploited to a large extent. So the government is supporting "innovative research" in the hope that new paradigms and perspectives will come from universities. It seems that by being very short-sighted, the West risks to end up lagging behind.
<UL>
<LI><I>The  Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Korea, nearing completion in 1993. The main circular building houses a 2 GeV synchrotron light source. </I>
</UL>
<P>
Particularly impressive were reports about the economic development of South Korea where the GNP per capita has increased 100-fold from 1962 to 1994. The country has managed to dominate some markets within a few years (<I>e.g.</I>, shipbuilding, read-only memory chips) and to become an important competitor in others (second in motor cars and in liquid-crystal displays, both of which were invented in Europe). This was possible not only because of low salaries but also because much was invested in research (first in government-sector institutions and later in industry). A new synchrotron radiation which recently came into operation testifies to the county's commitment to the importance of basic research. North Korea is also interested in joining the ITER fusion project.
<P>
One was impressed by the extent to which physicists from the US have managed to build up activities in all of the areas which were discussed. This is partly because they have a large national physical society. Europe in contrast is split and cannot yet speak with one voice. It became clear that the EPS has to be strengthened if Europe wants to make a comparable contribution towards tackling the difficult issues that physics faces at the world-wide level.
<P>
The conference organizers agreed that a third event would be useful. Since the APS will be celebrating its 100th anniversary in 1999 with a series of major events, it was decided that RACIP-3 should be in 2000 in Europe.

The <I>2nd International Conference on Research and Communications in Physics </I>(the first was held nine years ago in the US) took place at the United Nations University in Tokyo on 18-22 September 1995. It was organized by Physical Society of Japan and the Japan Society of Applied Physics in coordination with the American Physical Society, the EPS, the Asia-Pacific Association of Physical Societies, and the United Nations University. H. Schopper, the EPS President, gave a talk in the opening session entitled <I>Perspectives Towards the 21st Century</I> (available at http:// epswww.wpfl.ch on EurophysNet under EPS Presentations) while N. Kro&oacute;, the EPS Vice-President spoke on east-west activities and led a panel discussion on east-west cooperation.

<H2>Letters to the Editor</H2>
<H3>Fonts</H3>
<P>
Europhysics News is printed with a classical "sanserif" font, and it is a good choice since in this font any confusion between 0 ("zero") and O (capital "o"), and between 1 ("one") and l (capital "i") is avoided. Clearly, this font is the least bad one. However, a confusion remains between l (the letter "l") and I ("capital i"). At the time when you have a new printing contract you could perhaps negotiate a better font. For example, in your font (Ed.: Helvetica), Cl and Cl are identical so CI (capital "ci") can be confused with chlorine.
<P>
Finding a non-ambiguous font seems trivial: it is not. However, the chemists should have solved the problem. It would be nice to have an unambiguous font for European journals. The font used by Physics Today is correct, although the difference between 1 ("one") and l (the letter "l") is not striking. Such confusions have been eliminated in the banking area.

<P>
You may remember that at the meeting of the EPS East-West Coordination Committee (EWCC) held in Cracow in March 1994 I reported on the activities of the Special Committee on Science in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU-COMSCEE), and mentioned that a general information brochure about it was in course of publication. This has now seen the light of day and I enclose a copy for your information. the text takes into account decisions taken at the last meeting of COMSCEE, held in Paris in mid-January 1995. If you need further copies, please let me know.
<P>
I understand that the EWCC has disappeared and will be replaced by some new, more restricted body. I trust that it will be able to continue the good work already carried out by the EWCC, which received very favourable comments at the recent COMSCEE meeting.

<P>
I wish to express my appreciation for your editorial "A Question of Tuning" in Europhys. News 25 (1994) 162. I commend especially its balanced standpoint and right timing.
<P>
A few years ago I ventured myself (in two articles published in Romania) to put forward a schema for evaluating scientific output and I have discovered that one must know and understand the content of a scientific paper in order to assess its relevance.
<P>
You may know that in the physics community of the post-revolution Romania there have appeared many persons who play with scientometric indicators. They remind me of a famous joke about a ship which after being stranded on the rocks of an isolated island in the Pacific Ocean succeeded to start the cruise again, but the crew forgot a violin on the island. The native tribe took long looks at the violin wondering what it could be for. After two years the youngest son of the tribe's chief - the smartest one - came up with an answer: "It is a musical instrument". "How is this?" was asked. "Look, you may beat the drum on its reverse side" was the answer.

Physics Documents (<A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/Harvest/brokers/EurophysNet/PhysDoc/query.pl.cgi"><B><I>PhysDoc</I></B>)</A> has started operation as a pilot EurophysNet service to enable index searches for documents stored in <I>PhysDep</I> servers. The HARVEST "gatherer" which scans each site presently finds all locally stored publication references known to the system. Each department can help improve the service by: 
<P>
* ensuring that <I>PhysDoc</I> knows the local home page URLs that contain references and/or links to electronic documents (use <A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/Harvest/brokers/EurophysNet/PhysDep/query.pl.cgi">form</A> <BR>

<P>
* organizing a local server page which branches to all the other pages for the various local servers containing documents;
<P>
* having a fairly standard approach for identifying electronic documents (authors/title/source/status of publication).

<BR>
<H2>
EPS CONSTITUTION
</H2>
<P>
<B>Executive Proposes Amendments</B>
<P>
<B>* Article 1 (Legal Basis and Seat)</B>
<P>
At its meeting on 24-25 March 1995, the EPS Council accepted an Executive Committee proposal that the Society consider consolidating its Geneva and Budapest Secretariats in a European Union Member State. The Executive Committee then set up a working group to report in June on possible alternative locations for the Secretariat (it is presently split between a Secretariat in Geneva and another in Budapest) and a request for proposals was sent to National Member Societies. Offers were received from Amsterdam, Graz, London, Mulhouse, and Vienna, and from a science park located on French territory beside Geneva. On the basis of the working group's recommendations, the Executive Committee decided in June to recommend moving the Secretariat and to seek further information with the aim of having a final proposal in November. Meeting on 17-18 November in Budapest, the Executive Committee accepted the working group's recommendation to move the Secretariat to a science park located near the University of Mulhouse on the outskirts of Mulhouse in France.
<P>
The Executive Committee plans to propose this move of the Secretariat to Mulhouse to Council on 22-23 March 1996. If Council accepts the proposal (by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting), it will have to take a formal vote on changing Articles 1.1 and 1.3 of the EPS Constitution. Since any amendment of the Constitution must be communicated to members at least three months before Council shall decide on a proposal, the present Articles 1.1 and 1.3 and the proposed amendments are given below.
<P>
- Present Article 1
<P>
.1: <I>"Under the name of European Physical Society (EPS), an association has been organized and incorporated; it is governed by Article 60 and the following of the Swiss Civil Code and by the present Constitution."</I>
<P>
.3: <I>"Its seat is in Geneva, Switzerland."</I>
<P>
- Proposed Article 1
<P>
.1: <I>"Under the name of European Physical Society (EPS), an association has been organized and incorporated; it is governed by Article 21 and the following of the Local Civil Code (Alsace/ Moselle)."</I>
<P>
.3: <I>"Its seat is in Mulhouse, France."</I>
<P>
<B>* Article 21 (The Executive Committee)</B>
<P>
The Constitution's formulation of eligibility to serve as the EPS President is slightly contradictory. The Executive Committee will propose to Council the following amendments to Article 21 of the Constitution:
<P>
- Present Article 21.3 shall become Article 21.2 and the first sentence which reads:
<P>
<I>"The President shall be in office for two years."</I> shall read:
<P>
<I>"The President shall be in office for no more than two years."</I>
<P>
- Present Article 21.2 shall become Article 21.3.
<P>
If Council accepts the amendments, the decisions will be communicated in writing or in an equivalent form to all members. A mail ballot of Ordinary Members is required if one-eighth request within 40 days that a decision be submitted to the EPS General Meeting.

<H2>The New Challenges</H2><P>


<STRONG>Herwig Schopper</STRONG><BR>
<CITE>EPS President
</CITE><P>
<STRONG>Society needs science, both basic and applied. To fluorish, both aspects need forseeable conditions. Convincing the public and politicians will require much effort on the part of EPS in addition to the vital tasks that can be undertaken by a learned society.
</STRONG>
<P>
<IMG SRC="ene_jun95_schopper_fig1.JPG" ALT="[H. Schopper]">
<UL><LI>Herwig Schopper is seen here addressing the EPS Council in March 1995 shortly after being elected EPS President.</UL><HR>
During the cold war, science and physics were seen as essential for national security. This perspective has changed in the minds of politicians and the public. A major effort in weapons development is now considered unnecessary, and defence budgets providing, directly or indirectly, important funding for technology and even for fundamental physics, are being cut considerably. In one way we should be happy about these trends; but on the other hand the consequences for science remain difficult to assess, and a new equilibrium has to be found. Profound changes are still taking place; we must recognise them and react. In doing so, EPS will have to tackle a much wider range of challenges.
<P>
We can detect everyday that the cold war is being replaced by an economic struggle. Different parts of the world strive for economic supremacy to guarantee their welfare. To Europe, North America and Japan we shall have to add very soon the "small tigers" in the Far East as well as China.
<P>
Science and technology are recognised as essential bases for long-term economic competitiveness. However, politicians are also concerned with short-term success and contrary to the long-term aspects, claim that science cannot contribute to solving today's burning problems, such as unemployment and state deficits. Consequently, cuts in resources for science are quite common.
<P>
Another evolution (should I say crisis?) concerns teachers and young physicists. Apart from some minor ripples in the job market, physicists have been in demand for many decades. Today, partly because of the developments mentioned above, but also because of a certain "overproduction", even excellent young physicists have difficulty finding positions.
<BR>
<H3>A Deeper Crisis</H3>
<BR>
However, the West is confronted with a much deeper crisis. Since the Renaissance, logical thinking and rationalism were viewed as great achievements, and democracy and the search for truth were considered pre-eminent. Science and technology developed on this basis, and changed the shape of humanity. Indeed, only they made it possible for slavery to be abandoned and thanks to them many enjoy a standard of living unthinkable a century ago. Unfortunately, insufficient efforts were made to minimize negative effects. As a result, and because of other trends, we are surrounded today by a frightening anti-rationalist movement mixed up with pseudo-scientific beliefs. These "post-modernist" critiques seem to grow daily. As a famous German environmentalist said: "I do not need facts; I am concerned!" Such an attitude makes it almost impossible to discuss rationally the need for technological development and the measures to prevent negative effects on, for instance, the environment. So newspaper articles about astrology fill many more pages than scientific issues, and emotion-based movements, strange sects, creationism, etc. are much more fashionable than rational activities.
<P>
The post-modernistic critics claim that modern science has badly misled Western civilisation by providing false models, such as the primacy of rationalism and the search for objective truth -- believed to be illusory since truth is only a socially constructed fiction. But history has shown repeatedly that a dissatisfaction with science and its view of the world can turn into a rage that links up with far more sinister movements.
<BR>
<H3>The Future Needs Physics</H3>
<BR>
The adversity, or at least the disinterest, towards science in general and physics in particular is surprising if one accepts that our standard of living owes much to breath-taking technological developments over the last 200 years. Humane working conditions and the like are achievements which were restricted in the past to a very small, privileged class. Social ideas may have contributed, but were certainly insufficient.
<P>
Our technological evolution was, of course, founded on basic research. The contributions from physics were essential since apart from generating the results vital for new technologies, they also played crucial roles as interdisciplinary links by providing new research techniques which have influenced strongly other fields.
<P>
It has become fashionable for the political establishment in many countries to emphasize the importance of applied research, technology transfer and the creation of new products, notwithstanding the view expressed by some that technology will become less important since services of all kinds rather than production will be decisive for economies. But who provides the products which are the bases for new services?
<P>
It is unfortunately more difficult to demonstrate the usefulness of physics relative to other scientific fields since physics satisfies requirements indirectly through technology. Everybody knows what a lawyer, medical doctor or engineer does; but what about a physicist? This lack of knowledge derives partly from the fact that there is no physics industry.
<P>
Nevertheless, physics research will be absolutely vital for solving some of the urgent problems of society such as energy production, distribution and saving, information and communications technology, and environmental issues. But apart from providing the basis for technical applications, physics forms part of human culture. Driven by the curiosity to find the principles which determine Nature, physics research has profoundly changed human thinking and has established new approaches in the search for truth. We recognize that final truth will not, and cannot, be found. But the scientific method nevertheless brings us closer to it. There are no revolutions in physics in the sense that old, well-founded knowledge is destroyed. Instead, the limits of validity are restricted: a new theory confirmed by experiment encompasses the old one. The outcome is that physics has contributed more to our concept of the world than many other sciences. Only the discoveries in biology of evolution and the role of DNA have perhaps had an equally strong influence on our way of thinking.
<P>
In view of the practical and cultural values of physics for society, in an ideal, or at least more reasonable, world it should not be scientists who go begging for support but rather politicians in formulating their requests to science.
<BR>
<H3>Action Needed
</H3>
<BR>
One of the strengths of physicists is that they learn how to respond to new situations. Indeed, major progress in our field is always coupled to change, both in concepts and experimental techniques. Rabi once said: "Physicists are the Peter Pans of the human race". We also learn that changes should be introduced only when necessary, and not as an objective in themselves. Heisenberg once told me that revolutions and their results usually do not last since they are introduced too rapidly; he felt that physics teaches us that only adiabatic transitions lead to a stable state.
<P>
Given the new challenges, one asks what changes are really necessary and how they should be introduced. Some of the challenges are so fundamental that a change in mentality will be unavoidable; this is sometimes difficult to accept, even for physicists. But I am confident that physicists will demonstrate sufficient intellectual flexibility to adapt to the new realities and even be leaders. EPS has a vital role to play, so I want to discuss some of its more important <A HREF="#long-term">tasks</A>.
<P>
<I><STRONG>1. Take science to the general public</STRONG></I>
<P>
It is partly our fault if wrong impressions about physics flourish. Scientists have contributed mightily to the specialization of knowledge that also threatens to tear physics into non-communicating branches whose relevance is sometimes not obvious. I still believe in the unity of physics, but to preserve it requires an effort which few are prepared to make. And we are not doing enough to inform our fellow citizens and to communicate with them. The situation has certainly improved thanks to the efforts of national physical societies, but much remains to be done. We possibly make the mistake that we want to tell the public what we think it should know while not asking ourselves what it would perhaps like to know.
<P>
The presentation of science in the media, in particular on television, deserves great attention. Meetings organized by the German Physical Society and and by CERN with top representatives of the media gave depressing results. Even the government-financed TV channels, faced with competition from private channels, give great weight to audience levels. Some predict that in several years there will practically be no scientific programmes, except those dealing with animals and medicine, since they interest only about 6% of spectators. Special cultural channels will reach a very limited number of people. So learned societies are faced with a difficult but enormously important task that will require great effort and much patience.
<P>

<I><STRONG>2. Reinforce links with applied research</STRONG></I>
<P>
I believe that the distinction between basic and applied physics is to a large extent arbitrary and even destructive. One must certainly avoid being too dogmatic because indicators for the relevance to applications of a specific piece of research are missing. But we can say that the results of curiosity driven research have often and within a short time led to major changes in daily life. For example,  there is: electromagnetism -- the basis of electrical engineering in its many forms; stimulated emission -- an abstract notion in quantum mechanics upon which lasers are based; nuclear fission and fusion -- demonstrating via its two main applications (nuclear reactors and atomic bombs) that science can be used for the welfare or to the detriment of mankind. Moreover, instrumentation developed for basic research has often opened up new avenues for technology (e.g., the tunnelling microscope).
<P>
On the other hand, applied research which usually concentrates on the question "What can and must be done so that something works?" has provided new insights. D'Alembert wrote as long ago as 1751 that: "The discovery of the compass has brought to humanity as much benefit as the understanding of its properties will contribute to physics". This is also the case for aeroplanes (a better understanding of hydrodynamics) and high-temperature superconductors (new light on the mechanism of superconductivity).
<P>
The close relation between applications and curiosity driven research does not guarantee that the transfer of knowledge functions automatically. Effort must be made by physicists in both camps, where effective technology transfer depends more on the mentality of people than on institutionalized cooperation. I see here one of the most important tasks of the recently established Interdivisional Group for Applied Physics and Physics in Industry (IGAPPI). It should develop contacts between all fields of basic research and applications. The recruitment of Individual Ordinary Members (IOMs) in industry may be very effective in establishing closer links at a personal level.
<P>

<I><STRONG>3. Change mentalities at universities</STRONG></I>
<P>
Much basic research is performed in universities, and it is generally understood that the major part should in principle remain independent of commercial influences, open to the free exchange of results and integrated into teaching. However, university professors have mainly cared about physicists who became researchers in universities or large laboratories. We paid much less attention to students who would move into industry or out of physics. The situation has dramatically changed: many students leaving universities will have to find jobs in industry or outside research (marketing, customer services, administration, environmental activities, etc.). Most new opportunities require the methodology which physicists learn, as well as mental flexibility and an understanding of how to treat complex systems where a broad knowledge of Nature's basic laws is vital.
<P>
But, scientific knowledge is no longer sufficient for a successful career. Human values have become as important. Leadership and the ability to motivate collaborators, to "sell" achievements, to cooperate in teams, to undertake interdisciplinary work, and to hold one's ground in international enterprises are as essential as factual knowledge.
<P>
Our universities are not yet taking sufficient account of these changes. Physicists leaving universities are often considered too specialised to be effective in situations requiring solutions of complex, multidisciplinary problems. Academic research, in not being submitted to a large extent to restrictions involving cost efficiency, time schedules and cooperative working, operates under conditions that are quite different from those for industrial research. If universities want to have the support of society they will have to adapt. But introducing the changes involves not only details of curricula; mentalities will also have to change. This will require a major effort and physical societies can play an important role.<P>
<I><STRONG>4. Improve physics teaching in schools</STRONG></I>
<P>
We are living in a world where daily life is determined to a large extent by technology. It seems to be of the utmost importance that citizens understand at least the principles underlying these technologies. Otherwise how can they or politicians form an opinion concerning decisions that have to be taken in favour of or against a particular technology? Without some basic understanding there is a danger that rational debates are replaced by emotional controversies (examples include nuclear power and the biological effects of electromagnetic waves).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So more attention should be given to the training of those who will not stay in science by focussing on teaching in elementary and secondary schools. The deep-rooted misconception that technology is an evil can only be changed through education starting at the elementary level. An educational programme for teachers has been organized by the new EPS Forum on Education and I encourage all concerned to strengthen their efforts.
<P>
<I><STRONG>5. Enhance employment opportunities</STRONG></I>
<P>
If we wish to improve teaching we of course have to ask and answer the question: "Teaching for what?" Employment prospects for physicists need much more attention in EPS. The golden era when practically all physicists found jobs without too much difficulty have gone and most forecasts show that the situation will not change in the near future. Modifying the way physics is taught at universities, as mentioned above, will improve the chances for physicists in competition with other professionals.
<P>
Students will increasingly seek advice on jobs in different "markets" and I consider it a necessary activity of EPS to help students in this respect. There are many ways to do this, including meetings between industrialists and students and the generation of information about industry's requirements, including statistical data on positions and the future prospects. Some national physical societies are active in this area, and an updating of a review of the European situation is being prepared by the EPS <A HREF="http://128.178.177.16/action.html">Action Committee for Physics and Society</A>. This is an extremely important role for EPS in view of the necessarily increased mobility of physicists across national frontiers.
<P>
<I><STRONG>6. Develop international cooperation</STRONG></I>
<P>
International cooperation has been an integral element of physics and of EPS for a long time. It has promoted the progress of science and, equally important, understanding and confidence among people of different nations, cultures, political systems, race, and religion. Indeed physics has been spearheading such developments independently of a sometimes rapidly changing political climate. International cooperation is more necessary then ever now that the cold war has ended, but many new problems with very different features have arisen. In particular:
<UL><LI>We sadly notice a backlash with regard to tolerance and mutual understanding.
<LI>
International cooperation, even in applied research, is essential and should be strengthened in spite of economic competition since joint effort is needed to overcome some of mankind's major problems.
<LI>
Some major activities intrinsically require  international collaboration (e.g., climatic change research, oceanography, earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics). Others are simply too expensive to be undertaken by a single large country or region (e.g., the ITER fusion device; the space station; Mars missions; CERN's LHC).
<LI>
East-West cooperation, which attracted considerable attention with the end of the cold war, remains a crucial topic even after having met with some disappointments.
<LI>
North-South cooperation, not only with poor countries but also with evolving countries, will become more important.
</UL><BR>
EPS has established several activities that promote European cooperation, notably in central and east Europe. But the Society's role is also becoming more important in a world-wide context. While there are many bilateral contacts between national physical societies, in addressing global problems our partners in other parts of the world prefer to deal with a single European representative. A good example is the Physics Action Council (PAC; see <A HREF="#PAC">insert</A>) established last year by UNESCO.
<P>
<I><STRONG>7. Streamlining EPS</STRONG></I>
<P>
A major effort is being made to make the operations of EPS as efficient as possible so that the Society can fulfil its many tasks with the limited personnel and financial resources. This is of particular importance in view of the new objectives envisaged by the revised EPS Constitution. The three measures that make EPS much more attractive are:
<UL><LI> The possibility for all members of national physical societies to participate in Divisional activities.
<LI>
 Intensification of the activities of the Inter-divisional Groups and Action Committees, with eventually new ad hoc groups for specific activities.
<LI>
 A new concept for <CITE>Europhysics News</CITE> which is now being delivered to members of national societies (except for the UK's Institute of Physics and the German Physical Society which publish the Society's information to members in their own bulletins).
</UL><BR>
In order to find the necessary resources for these and other tasks a <A HREF="#immediate actions">major effort</A> will be made to streamline administrative services. Moving the Secretariat from Geneva to a less expensive location will be the most important action. The production of <CITE>Europhysics News</CITE> in collaboration with a publishing house is also envisaged.
<P>
An effort will also be made to provide full information to the national societies concerning the various EPS activities and the resources involved. This will place the societies in a better position in evaluating the distribution of resources.
<P>
I appeal to all our members, be they IOMs or members of a national society, to help us with active cooperation and constructive criticism. Together we can meet the goals of EPS in promoting our field of science, not only because we appreciate it so much but also for the benefit it brings to society at large.<P>

The Physics Action Council (PAC) was established in 1993 by UNESCO (the "S" in the acronym stands for science!) to help reinvigourate relations with the physics community [<CITE>EN</CITE> <STRONG>25</STRONG> (1994) 84]. Members, although nominated ad personam, were recruited mainly from regional physical societies. PAC has working groups on large facilities, communications and education and it also aims to make the voice of the physics community hear in governmental organizations. For instance, the large facilities working group will hold a high-level meeting in June with the Central European Initiative (the government-level collaboration that aims to promote the development of science in central Europe). The Director-General of UNESCO agreed recently to extend the Council for a third year to give more time to decide upon the conclusions of a final report which will be submitted at the end of 1995.

<H3>A Tolerable Investment Risk</H3>
<P>
Economists, engineers and physicists met in Geneva on 10-13 May to analyse the economic, social and physics aspects that must be taken into account when considering energy production and consumption and their related environmental problems.
<P>
The meeting, entitled <I>Economy - Energy - Entropy</I>, was organized by the European Physical Society's Action Committee for Physics and Society as the latest in a series of triennial Europhysics Study Conferences on energy and the environment.
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------<P>
The availability of energy  is a prerequisite for satisfying basic human needs and for improving the quality of life, but with today's supply systems many people will continue to be unable to access an adequate amount of energy. 
<P>
In-depth discussion at the meeting confirmed that there exists great potential for energy systems which:
<P>
* can provide secure, reliable and affordable energy now and for future generations in an efficient way;
<BR>
* have less impact on the environment than today's approaches;
<BR>
* help harmonize the world's unbalanced distribution of energy production and consumption.
<P>
We must invest now in these intelligent technologies with
<P>
* education
<BR>
* research
<BR>
* improved legal and financial frameworks
<P>
to enhance their potential to become future winners in the market for energy supply systems.
<P>
For although they are not economically viable at present, it is clear that the opportunities for technical improvement are so large that the financial risk from starting investment too soon is tolerable.

<P>
Economists, engineers and physicists met at CERN on 10-13 May to analyze the economic, social and physics aspects that must be taken into account when considering energy production and consumption and their related environmental problems. 
<P>
Beat B&uuml;rgenmeier (University of Geneva) opened the discussion with a talk on Economic approaches to environmental protection that explained why policies to protect the environment require not only traditional economic incentives but also direct controls to change the institutional structure of the debate between science, economics, politics and ethics (see <A HREF="#burgenmeier">insert</A>). 
<P>
Other topics presented were:
<P>
<UL><LI>The economical system and environment (B. Trezza, University of Rome)
<LI>
Energy concept future of the HEW: renewable energies and demand site management (W. von Braunm&uuml;hl, Hamburger Electricit&auml;ts Werke - HEW)
<LI>
Options and policies to improve the efficiency of energy consumption (E. Worrell, University of Utrecht )
<LI>
MARKAL-Macro: model structure and climate change issues (S. Kypreos, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen)
<LI>
Energy policies in the developing world (M. Munasinghe, Colombo University)
<LI>
Status and prospects of renewable energy sources (H.J.M. Beurskens, ECN, Petten); New perspectives in energy from nuclei:  the energy amplifier (C. Rubbia, CERN) Self-consistent nuclear energy systems (Y. Korovin, Obninsk, Russia)
<LI>
Technical and economic competition of advanced energy technologies (H.-C., Groscurth, European Institute for Economic Research, Mannheim)
<LI>
Energy - entropy - economy - environment - ecology (K. Rebane, Tartu).
</UL>
<P>
In opening the round-table discussion, Horst Wachsmuth from CERN, the conference chairman, reviewed the question marks surrounding so-called "facts" about the relation between global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures (see <A HREF="#wachsmuth">insert</A>). His remarks prompted a lively debate which led to a press release articulating the need to invest now in new energy systems with reduced impact on the environment (see <A HREF="#pressrelease">insert</A>). Socrates Kypreos (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen) demonstrated in his presentation of least-regret hedging strategies (see <A NAME="kypreos">insert</A>) that the investment risk is affordable.<HR>

</UL>
<BR>
According to Beat B&uuml;rgenmeier (Geneva University), market-based incentives to protect the environment use taxes and subsidies since they view protection as one aspect of an economic policy that analyses the scarcity and allocation of resources. Such strategies are currently favoured because they work (in contrast to regulation-based approaches): one simply decides on the relative prices for goods by comparing costs of pollution with the utility of keeping the environment intact for future generations.
<P>
However, pollution is fundamentally a consequence of our way of life. Changing environmental policies therefore involves many different institutions, value systems and power balances. Economic policies must recognize the need for a combination of different strategies based on extremely varied viewpoints by broadening the analysis to include other disciplines. Economics must also come to terms with the fact that it is not an exact science with immutable laws, but a social science that has to reconcile all aspects of society's development. This overlooked feature has its roots in the notion that one cannot continue to assume capital and labour will substitute for natural resources ad infinitum. For the system is exhausting itself in much the same way as a system's entropy increases (order decreases) when its energy is used.
<P>
A socio-economic approach to environmental policy is essentially based on a sociological concept of society and not on an economic concept of trade. Economics must therefore replace its strict rationality with the notion of the bounded rationality of human behaviour  - man wants to be rational but is imperfectly so, with individual preferences largely depending on the social context.
<P>
Transactions extend beyond market forces to information flow within society. However, the flow is increasing since incentives and technical advances that make workers more cost effective are tending to make people more individualistic. So it is costing more to ensure that the democratic rules governing collective decision making prevail, and developing environmental policies involves higher consensus costs. To handle these cost increases, governments have allied themselves with pressure groups. But as the number and variety of groups increase, they are finding it increasingly difficult to give each group something in return. So they now surround environmental decisions with precautionary measures such as impact studies and expert reports, and the lack of clear information and transparency results in hostile consumers.
<P>
One must therefore improve the flow of information and change the way pressure groups interact. In other words, institutional structures must change, and environmental policy must combine not only incentives which lead to modification of the relative prices of goods but also direct controls that produce this change.<P><HR>

<P>Horst Wachsmuth (CERN, Geneva), based  on results reported by Z.

The dashed lines give thecarbon dioxide emission paths calculated using the MARKAL-Macro model for deterministic scenario-by-scenario cases with business as usual (upper curve: open squares), stabilisation (middle: open triangles) and a cumulative 20 % reduction (lower: open circles), relative to 1990. The solid lines are the corresponding paths with least-regret hedging to 2005 before applying the deterministic policies. Hedging gives only a slightly higher emission in 2025 if it turns out in 2005, when the uncertainty about carbon dioxide emission is resolved, that a 20% reduction was necessary all along.
</UL>
<P>
According to Socrates Kypreos (PSI, Villigen), most economists agree that a 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 (as demanded by the 1988 World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere) would have a drastic economic impact. In deciding what should be done, policy makers seek a single set of recommendations, such as a level of carbon tax. Using economic models, one can analyse different scenarios case-by-case.
<P>
PSI's MARKAL-Macro model (that combines an engineering model of the energy system with a macroeconomic model) predicts that for Switzerland, for example, very high and probably unacceptable carbon taxes are needed for a cumulative reduction of 30% in the global carbon dioxide emission level by 2030.
<P>
However, carbon dioxide emission is an uncertain threat and policy makers risk imposing premature and costly measures. A way to resolve the uncertainty uses multistage stochastic theory for a so-called "minimum-regret" short-term strategy, to gain time until 2005, followed by the full deterministic scenario-by-scenario strategy. One proposal is to have a low and reversible carbon tax to achieve by 2005 a carbon dioxide emission level mid-way between the levels that would be achieved if one simply set in motion policies for cumulative stabilisation and for a cumulative 20% reduction. If it turns out in 2005 that a 20 % reduction was necessary all along, one then applies the original deterministic strategy. According to MARKAL-Macro, this least-regret hedging strategy under all outcomes of uncertainty not only leads to sacrifices that are affordable for most people but costs less overall (15% lower marginal cost ) than the deterministic strategy. It is also nearly as efficient in reducing the carbon dioxide level (figure).<HR>

</STRONG>
<P><HR>
Roger Poultney coordinates the Electronic Systems Initiative (ESI) that promotes on-line publishing in physics. Information about the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/rwp/eshome.html">ESI</A> is provided as a service to EPS members by the <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/dir/action/acp.html">EPS Action Committee for Publications</A>.<HR><P>

People have been saying for the last five years that something exciting is happening in science publishing. The reality is somewhat different. While visionaries predicting the imminent downfall of the publishing establishment are almost too numerous to mention, it seems that little has been able to shake the status quo - yet.  Does this mean that, despite the electronic communications revolution, nothing will change after all ? Nobody really knows, but it does seem a relatively safe bet that some kind of dramatic sea-change could still be just around the corner.
<P>
As many readers will know, ever since the beginning of the decade, new preprint initiatives (such as the famous Los Alamos preprint server http://xxx.lanl.gov/ pioneered by the string theorist Paul Ginsparg) have challenged the way particle physicists traditionally publish their results. As a matter of course, new papers are now routinely posted on the preprint servers for international distribution long before any kind of peer review or conventional publication has taken place.
<P>
International laboratories such as CERN have chosen to cease hard copy mailing of preprints in favour of their own electronic systems (http://<A HREF="http://www.cern.ch">www.cern.ch</A>/), and there can be little doubt that the new servers, along with electronic versions of some existing journals (<I>e.g.</I>, Elsevier Science's <I>Nuclear Physics Electronic</I> at http://<A HREF="http://www.elsevier.nl">www.elsevier.nl</A>/ and IOPP's <I>Physics Express Letters</I> at http://<A HREF="www.iopp.org">www.iopp.org</A>/), are here to stay.
<P>
But what do the changes really mean for the world of scientific publishing ? Paul Ginsparg believes that the technological developments will have some profound implications: "Since publication in a journal no longer gives a particularly useful guide, readers are forced to perform the majority of their selections by their own criteria. The current implementation of peer review should be entirely rethought in view of the new methods of electronic publication and dissemination."
<P>
While some scientists may argue that without quality control an unprecedented proliferation of information will ensue, others passionately believe that a fairer and more objective system of evaluation could emerge from the technological advances. There are even those who believe that freedom from any kind of censure can only be of benefit to the scientific community as a whole.
<P>
One proposal is to measure the amount of citations that preprints made available on databases receive, a philosophy which has been supported by several observers. The main drawback seems to be that papers which are controversial in nature (but not necessarily correct) invariably provoke an interested reaction, and initial citations alone are not necessarily a reliable indicator of quality. Neither, indeed, is traditional peer review, which is often seen as an arbitrary and subjective process. Ensuring a uniform standard is more-or-less impossible, and although some attempts have been made to measure the objectivity of reviewing procedures, there can be little doubt that any policy will have its shortcomings. Says Ginsparg: "One of the foremost problems at present is the large amount of information lost in the conventional peer review process, with the end result only a single, one-time, all-or-nothing binary decision. Although this may somehow be adequate for the purpose of validating research for job and grant allocations, it clearly provides little benefit to the average reader."
<P>
<STRONG>Second-tier Front-ends</STRONG>
<P>
In reality, what will probably happen is the development some sort of "two-tier" system, where all works are systematically archived on the preprint databases (so that nothing is rejected erroneously), but with a form of indexed "front-end" guide to the literature which acts as a filter and takes readers directly to the most significant publications. The situation is neatly summed up by Ginsparg: "Since there are now no financial or physical barriers to widespread dissemination, we can imagine a relatively complete raw archive unfettered by any unnecessary delays in availability. Any type of information could be overlayed on this raw archive and maintained by any third parties."
<P>
This scenario has the natural advantage that while papers stored in the preprint archives are "written in stone", the front-end review systems are dynamic and can be changed to include papers retrospectively as fields and subject emphasis evolve. This is especially true in high-energy physics theory, where the impact of new ideas may only show up years or even decades after their construction. In this way the initial rejection of what are eventually realised to be classic papers (such as George Zwieg's 1963 work predicting the existence of quarks) should never happen.  Good science will not be thrown away on the whims or prejudices of editors and referees, and the more democratic taste of the international community will be the force that prevails.
<P>
Several researchers and private organizations have sought to develop front-end systems along the new model advocated by Ginsparg. Examples include Paul Mende's <I>Virtual Review</I> (http://<A HREF="http://www.het.brown.edu/physics/review/index.html">www.het.brown.edu/physics/review/index.html</A>), run from Brown University in the USA, and Eagle Intermedia's new <I>Particle Physics</I> (http://<A HREF="http://www.eagle.co.uk/ppj/home.html">www.eagle.co.uk/ppj/home.html</A>), which is based in Europe and run in close affiliation with <I>Theory of Atomic and Molecular Clusters</I> at the University of Oldenburg. These systems work essentially on the same principle, with volunteer "referees" nominating those papers which they believe to be currently the most important in their respective fields. In the <I>Virtual Review</I>, papers are often cited as hypertext links appearing within the text of a general review of the field, whereas in <I>Particle Physics</I>,<I> </I>discrete lists of selected works are compiled on a bi-monthly basis (with hypertext links to signed reviews, where the referee does not wish to remain anonymous).
<P>
In any such front-end system, the issue of confidentiality is a difficult one, since while more open reviewing has its advocates, it does tend to discourage the criticality crucial to maintaining standards. It is for this reason that <I>Particle Physics</I> has chosen to experiment with both options, allowing referees the choice of anonymity or disclosure. Only through trial and error will the community discover which is to be preferred in this new world, since there are clearly pros and cons associated with both approaches. There is always the danger that participating individuals may end up visibly nominating papers for mainly political purposes. Worse still, it is not unknown for rival research groups to veto each others' results in order to gain the advantage of publishing first. But this is hardly a problem if both groups have already submitted their respective papers to the preprint archives; they are there for posterity (with their original submission dates), and it is the democratic opinion of the physics community, expressed through the front-end systems, which will ultimately decide on their relative impact.
<P>
<STRONG>Some Reservations</STRONG>
<P>
All physicists do not see this kind of approach as the way forward. David Fairlie, a theoretician at the University of Durham, remains unconvinced that front-end systems will have an impact. Says Fairlie: "The idea of nominations is a waste of time; indeed, when all physics articles [on the Web] carry abstracts there should be no need for a review at all ! Increasingly, I believe people are finding and learning new ideas through conference participation, rather from the Internet, because they are a captive audience for the duration of a presentation."
<P>
Of course, there is little doubt that conventional peer review serves an important function in raising standards by improving papers through requested revisions. This process will still be required, though it seems possible that authors may arrange for it informally. It is certainly in their professional interests to have this kind of check before submitting to the preprint servers, where work becomes instantly accessible worldwide. Voluntary scrutiny already takes place with experimental papers produced by the large international collaborations. Here, an internal committee checks and double-checks the data, analysis, conclusions, and presentation before releasing the work. The result is that experimental papers rarely require any kind of revision before acceptance in the established journals. With more emphasis being placed on preprints as the "finally accepted form" of an author's work, theorists may well follow the trend and "self-police" their own papers. If this were to happen, standards could actually rise of their own accord. Far from leading to an uncontrolled explosion in mediocre preprints, the new developments might lead to an increase in quality, provided there is a widespread endorsement of the new culture.
<P>
How this new culture takes off depends to a strong extent on existing traditions within different scientific disciplines. Outsiders are very often surprised to learn that publishing traditions may be very different even between closely related fields. Bertrand Duplantier, a theoretical physicist at CE Saclay in France collaborates with biologists on topics relating to DNA macromolecule statistics. As an active editor, Duplantier is intrigued by the differences in publishing culture between physicists and biologists. "Preprint distribution is already widely accepted in the high-energy physics community, and the new electronic systems have become very popular. But in biology there is a greater fear of plagiarism at the pre-publication stage, so preprint distribution is relatively less important."
<P>
From this it would seem that electronic publishing developments may take place at a different pace within even closely related scientific fields. But one thing that will promote new systems across the board will be rapid advances in communications technology. Ever more sophisticated World-Wide Web browsers are being released, and the ability to interpret and format data in a wide variety of input formats will help smooth over cultural differences. Besides handling HTML (the standard language for presenting material on the Web), browsers are now being developed that can process and display TeX and LaTeX (the preferred typesetting language of particle physicists) as well as files from popular word-processing packages (which are often used to prepare less mathematical texts). These more flexible browsers will make the construction of on-line journals much simpler, with text conversion of articles to HTML becoming unnecessary. The age of the "do it yourself" journal really does seem to be here.
<P>
From all this, it can be seen that, whether the momentum for change is driven by technology, or by a real need for peer review reform, real opportunities to change things for the better clearly do exist. For this reason, it is important that the physicists give the new systems their full and dedicated support: much will ultimately depend on the dedication and determination of individual practitioners. Only time will tell if those (Ginsparg included) who believe that the advantages make radical change inevitable are correct. However, one could well imagine that, without the active participation of senior figures in the new front-end systems, important new initiatives could wither and die. This would be a great pity for the physics community (which after all invented WWW technology), and for science publishing in general. <HR>

<H3>PRESS RELEASE
</H3>
<H2>The 1995 High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize of EPS
</H2>
<BR>
<STRONG>The Prize Committee of the High-Energy and Particle Physics Division of the European Physical Society (EPS) announces that the 1995 High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize of EPS has been awarded jointly to:</STRONG> <P>

	Paul S&ouml;ding, DESY - Institute of High-Energy Physics, Zeuthen<BR>
	Bj&ouml;rn Wiik, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg<BR>
	G&uuml;nther Wolf, DESY, Hamburg<BR>
	Sau Lan Wu, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.<P>

for &quot;the first evidence for three-jet events in e+e- collisions at PETRA&quot;.<P>

This important experimental contribution to understanding the strong interaction in particle physics, first presented in the summer of 1979, was obtained while the prizewinners were working with the TASSO detector at DESY's PETRA accelerator.<P>

<STRONG>Individuals Stand Out</STRONG><P>

The Prize Committee faced the very delicate task of choosing between many excellent nominations. Not only were there important discoveries to consider, but there was also the major question of how to single out individuals whose achievements should be recognized. New challenges are presented in the era of large experimental collaborations, based on general-purpose instruments and working in parallel with other similar groups, and the Committee felt that it was very important not to exclude such collaborations. There have been, and there will surely continue to be, cases where one has to select individuals who play key roles in a discovery but whose contributions also reflect the work of many distinguished colleagues.<P>

Clear experimental evidence for planar three-jet events and jet broadening was described in June 1979 in presentations of early results by B. Wiik at the Neutrino Conference in Bergen by P. S&ouml;ding at the High-Energy Physics Conference in Geneva. They generated considerable interest and stimulated an enormous analytical effort because the only viable interpretation was based on the creation of gluons by quark bremsstrahlung. This was soon  quantified in a convincing way by all of PETRA's experiments, including MARKJ, PLUTO and JADE. It is important in this connection to give full recognition to the accelerator engineers and scientists, and to G. Voss (DESY, Hamburg) in particular, for providing high-quality beams and a superb experimental environment.<P>

Each of PETRA's detectors represented a formidable joint effort and required the skilful coordination of the work of many people. The preparation of the TASSO detector and its smooth running was ensured by the first three recipients of the Prize. Computing aspects were carefully planned and executed, at DESY and in parallel within collaborating institutes. The identification method devised by S.L.Wu working at DESY, which made possible an early recognition of the three-jet structure, is specially recognized.<P>

 <BR>
<STRONG>Direct Evidence</STRONG><P>

Gluons have a particularly important role in the Universe as they interact among themselves and can to some extent be expected to be self sufficient. However, this is not the case: there are no &quot;glueboys&quot; or &quot;gluegirls&quot;. Quarks are the required building blocks to form Nature, although many details of the reasons why gluons do not confine themselves remain unknown.<P>

The experimental evidence for the gluon did not come as a total surprise. Following the results of deep-inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the USA about 10 years earlier (which were recognized by the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics) it was known that the quarks did not carry all their momentum to the proton in which they are imprisoned.<P>

Gluons were in fact required in models for confinement. Secondly, features of the hadronic decays of ypsilon (the bound states of bottom and antibottom quarks) were consistent with an interpretation based on gluons, but they were not yet regarded as conclusive evidence for the gluon. These model-dependent indicators needed direct experimental confirmation in more clear-cut searches, in much the same way as the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN were important steps in pinning down rather well-established theoretical ideas, and the recent identification at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory of the top quark confirmed compelling indirect evidence from CERN's LEP experiments.<P>

<STRONG>EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY</STRONG><P>

<BR>
The EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY (EPS) was founded in 1968 to contribute to and promote the advancement of physics in Europe. It does this by providing a forum for physicists as individuals and as members of professional Divisions and Groups, by acting as a federation of national physical societies, and by serving as a meeting point for laboratories and industry.<P>

Some 70 000 physicists in 36 countries support the EUROPEAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY either directly or through their membership of national physical societies.<HR><BR>
<STRONG>High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize of EPS</STRONG><P>

The High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize of EPS is presented every two years at the International Europhysics Conference on High-Energy Physics. It is awarded through the Board of the High-Energy and Particle Physics Division of EPS for work appearing in print by candidates who are still living. The Board invites experts to nominate candidates and winners are selected by a Prize Committee established by the Board. The 1995 Prize will be presented during the opening ceremony on 27 July of the 1995 International Europhysics Conference on High-Energy Physics which takes place in Brussels on 27 July - 2 August 1995. <P>

The Prize is sponsored by Cray Research France, Digital Equipment, LeCroy, Philips, Siemens, and Thomson Tubes Electroniques.<P>

The 1995 award is the 4th in the series. Previous winners were: G. Charpak (1989), N. Cabibbo (1990) and M.J.G. Veltman (1993).<P>

<B>EMSPS Scheme Continues to Expand</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>The Mobility Committee reviewed the European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students and other activities during a meeting in Belfast on 21-23 September 1995.</B><HR>
<P>
It is a little earlier to estimate exactly how many students will move this year between institutions participating in the European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students (EMSPS) scheme which is the managed by the EPS Mobility Committee. But the number will certainly be larger than the 253 for the 1994/5 academic year so the scheme continues to grow.
<P>
Many students moving between participating institutions located within European Union (EU) countries receive grants funded by the EU's <B>ERASMUS</B> programme. ERASMUS has been absorbed into the new SOCRATES programme, but to give universities time to coordinate applications for mobility grants, the European Commission (EC) decided in June to delay implementing of the ERASMUS part of SOCRATES funding. The committee has prepared an application for a renewal of its ERASMUS Inter-university Coordination Project in 1996/7 which takes into account the fact that the SOCRATES transitional measures allow neither "internal expansion" nor new participating institutions. Since Switzerland does not participate in SOCRATES there will be no ERASMUS under SOCRATES mobility grants for students moving into or out of Switzerland as from the 1996/97 academic year. However, the Swiss authorities are preparing measures to award grants to both incoming and outgoing students (details will be known later this year).
<P>
The EMSPS made applications in 1994 to the EU's <B>TEMPUS</B> programme for mobility grants for students moving in 1994-97 between EU countries and a total of eight east and central European (ECE) countries. Applications covering Hungary, Latvia and Poland were successful, those for the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Romania  being unsuccessful because the national TEMPUS authorities did not include student mobility in science as a priority. The situation has fortunately changed somewhat since TEMPUS applications for Lithuania and Romania covering some 10 institutions in the period 1995-98 have been accepted.
<P>
Students from some 24 EMSPS participating institutions in Austria, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are also eligible for mobility grants awarded by the Central European Exchange Programme for University Studies (<B>CEEPUS</B>). H. Latal, the EMSPS Chairman, reported that  81 CEEPUS scholarship-months have been awarded to 23 institutions for 1995/6, a sizable increase from the 10 that were taken up in the last semester of the 1994/5 academic year when CEEPUS was launched.
<P>
The <B>Soros</B> Foundations have been supporting mobility grants awarded by EPS to students moving from ECE to institutions in western Europe. Unfortunately, priorities have changed and it now seems unlikely that the programme will continue beyond the 1995/6 academic year.
<P>
The EMSPS <B>database</B> in Manchester is a vital element of the scheme as it allows students and their coordinators to identify suitable courses. Information about courses in each participating institution is essentially loaded by the institution's coordinator to ensure relevance and a reasonable level of homogeneity. It can be consulted over Internet by telneting to emspsdb.man.ac.uk (logon = "student"; password = "student1"). The committee decided to convert the information to make it available on the World-Wide Web (WWW). This process has started and the EMSPS database together with all the information and documents relating to the scheme can now be accessed at <A HREF="http://info.mcc.ac.uk/emsps/">http://info.mcc.ac.uk/emsps/</A>. Links to other WWW servers giving general information on mobility arrangements in participating institutions are envisaged. Only time will tell if a more decentralized structure is desirable.
<P>
The EMSPS service is coordinated by the EPS Internet Coordination Group as part of the EPS <A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch"><B>EurophysNet</B></A> network of linked WWW servers covering all EPS activities. So it can be linked to via the EurophysNet home page at http://epswww.epfl.ch. However, WWW access is by no means universal and even telnet access is rare in some EMSPS institutions. Coordinators are obviously working to improve the situation. It is envisaged that the telnet service will be maintained for another 18 months while information is converted.
<P>
The committee has also been collaborating with the new EPS Interdivisional Group for Physics Education on the much wider issue of ways to improve physics education in Europe. One opportunity is to establish a European Physics Education Network (<B>EUPEN</B>) to support a European dimension through cooperation between university departments. A steering committee (H. Ferdinande, C.M. Ferreira, L. Dona'dalle Rose, J.C. Dore, and E. Elbaz with I. Sosnowska as an associate) is to submit an application for funding by 1 January 1996 to SOCRATES that will be based on the outcome of last April's EC thematic evaluation conference [see <I>EN</I> <B>26</B> (1995) 69].
<P>
Thanks to the indefatigable R.G.H. Greer who hosted the meeting, the Committee was able to tackle a very charged agenda while enjoying several different locations interspersed with special events. The latter included a reception organized by Belfast's City Council in its City Hall and a meeting with four students from France, Austria and Poland who were  starting their mobility year at The Queen's University.

<H2>
Integration Through Regionalisation
</H2>
<P><B>
Representatives of physical societies from east and central Europe met on 20 November 1996 in Budapest with Herwig Schopper, the EPS President, and Norbert Kro&oacute;, the Executive Committee member responsible for east-west coordination, to review progress and to develop new strategies.
</B>
<P>
The most striking feature of any discussion about science in east and central Europe (ECE), is the region's desire for integration in the European Union (EU). The physics community aims to be one of the driving forces, and this is the main reason why representatives of the region's physical societies stressed at their second meeting with the EPS President - the first took place last February [<A HREF="http://epswww.epfl.ch/ene/ene_feb95.html"><I>EN</I> <B>26</B> (1995) 45</A>] - that participation in the EU's Framework programme for science remains a principal objective. The November meeting, recommended that the EU's PHARE programme, along with national governments, should support Framework participation, and the EPS President was asked to communicate this recommendation to the European Commission (EC). The societies also view the EU's TEMPUS programme for student mobility as being an extremely important element for promoting integration. Once again, the EPS President was asked to contact responsible decision makers to seek support for extending the programme's funds for student mobility, both in time and in geographical coverage (five ECE countries presently receive EU TEMPUS programme support for student mobility within the EPS European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students). 
<P>
Owing to the dramatic effects that economic restructuring is having on research and development, the meeting recommended that physicists working in industry in ECE should be included in EPS east-west initiatives. Many representatives felt that this was especially important at the present time because recent new openings for physicists in areas outside research and teaching may dry up as more specialists become available. One needs to stress the role of physicists as broadly trained, flexible problem solvers capable of addressing strategic issues.
<P>
In order to reinforce job opportunities it is necessary to ensure that modern and up-to-date training is available to young physicists. The meeting suggested that EPS should ask the heads of the larger European laboratories to support scholarships for scientists from ECE. CERN's Associates scheme was noted as providing an excellent example of what can be achieved, and discussions with the organization's Director General have indicated that it should be possible to arrange for CERN scholarships for all ECE countries independent of whether or not they are a member of CERN. This follows on from earlier initiatives that promoted efforts to facilitate the access of ECE scientists to experimental facilities. For instance, the Central European Initiative which aims to promote a lasting fabric of personal and institutional links throughout ECE [EN 26 (1995) 93] has generated opportunities for participation in regional facilities such as Trieste's ELETTRA synchrotron and Budapest's neutron source. 
<P>
There is an urgent need to improve the circulating of accurate and timely information throughout ECE concerning topics of mutual interest, notable student mobility, curricula, conferences, and job opportunities. Special attention should also be given to information about EU programmes because it is often somewhat confusing owing to the size and scope of the programmes and because there are multiple interpretations depending on the source of information within the EC. A regional news service based on the World-Wide Web and forming part of the EPS EurophysNet service, with information supplied largely by organizations within the region, is one important possibility.
<P>
The meeting decided that the best way to follow up on these and earlier east-west initiatives would be to form a regional working group made up of national society secretaries or their equivalents. While the region is geographically very large, specific problems are common to many countries and can be tackled effectively on a regional basis. The group, which reflects a shift in focus from east-west initiatives coordinated by the former East-West Coordination Committee to a more "self-help" philosophy, would formulate suggestions for Presidents and coordinate initiatives while taking care to integrate the work of the EPS Action Committees and Interdivisional Groups. In reflecting the meeting's recommendations and earlier actions, the main areas in which the new working group could act involve:
<P>
- the public awareness of science;
<P>
- government policy, notably integration of ECE science with EU programmes; 
<P>
- a regional news service;
<P>
- journal subscription support to match the INTAS/EPS Journals for the FSU programme and November's announcement that <I>Europhysics Letters </I>would offer 30 free subscriptions to ECE;
<P>
- expansion of mobility, access to large facilities, and training opportunities;
<P>
- locating conferences in ECE;
<P>
- extending conference participation via initiatives such as the EPS Solidarity Fund which supports ECE participation through a levy on conferences organized by EPS.<HR>

<H2>Linear Colliders have Arrived</H2><P>

Supplement to the EPAC'96 report by <A HREF="ene_dec96_epac_text.html">V. Suller</A>.<P>

<IMG SRC="ene_dec96_epac_fig5.GIF" ALT="CLIC section">
<UL>
<LI>An early prototype of the accelerating section for the main linac of CERN's CLIC collider scheme.
</UL>
<P>
Linear colliders have made great strides during the last eight years or so. The <B>Stanford Linear Collider</B>, the first linear collider, has moved from an accelerator physics experiment to a useful high-energy physics tool where the high polarization of the SLC beams allows precision measurements of certain parameters. At the same time an extensive research effort aimed at a linear collider with an energy around 1 TeV has developed around the world. It is coordinated and reviewed within the framework of a Linear Collider collaboration. There are workshops held each year on specialized topics and an overview workshop, the "LC" series, is held every 1 1/2 to two years.
<P>
The EPAC session on linear colliders began with a review of this world-wide research effort by J.-P. Delahaye (CERN). He presented a concise, but encompassing view of the various approaches to linear collider design. The primary differences in these approaches is the choice of the technology for the linear accelerator used to reach to high energy. In all of the designs the beams are focused to a tiny spot ranging from 5 - 50 nm. Delahaye's talk was highlighted by a movie produced by G.Guinard (CERN) that illustrated the effect of the accelerator environment on the transverse beam size; it showed graphically how one can accelerate tiny beams in a 30 GHz structure.
<P>
After the introductory talk we heard reports from the various test facilities around the world. Hans Braun (CERN) reported on the <B>CLIC</B>Test Facility which tests the two-beam approach where the energy is transferred from a high-current, low-energy beam to a low- current, high-energy beam. This "transformer" is a bit more exotic than the usual ones: the acceleration is done at 30 GHz (with accelerator cavities the size of a contact lens) and a acceleration gradient of 100 MV/m, - 5 times higher than the Stanford Linear Collider. Braun showed high-power tests with as much as 100 MW of 30 GHz power and no evidence of breakdown. Accelerating gradients of 90 MV/m have also been achieved. The next phase at the CLIC Test Facility will include a test of the two-beam concept. The drive beam will be deaccelerated and and the resulting 30 GHz power will be used to accelerate a low intensity beam.
<P>
R. Ruth (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, CA, USA) presented the <B>Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator</B> (NLCTA) which uses 11.4 GHz technology, four times the frequency of the SLAC linac. This facility is a 0.5 - 1 GeV model of the high-gradient linac for the Stanford design. Ruth showed data from the klystrons, RF pulse compression system and accelerator structures that exceeded the NLC design specifications. Acceleration gradients of 65 - 120 MV/m have been achieved in high-power tests. The NLCTA RF system is being installed now and this test accelerator will have first beam in late-1996. Ruth also noted that SLAC has just completed a feasibility study of the Zero-order Design Report for the NLC, a major milestone for the SLAC effort.
<P>
The <B>KEK Accelerator Test Facility</B> was presented by H. Hayano from KEK, Tsukuba, Japan. This facility seeks to test the injectors for a future accelerator, including a special electron storage ring to shrink the beam size to a few microns. The linac is reported to be up and running while the damping ring is being installed now. First tests with beam are planned for early-1997. The KEK Japan Linear Collider (<B>JLC</B>) design also uses 11.4 GHz technology but a small contingent at KEK has been investigating 5.7 GHz.
<P>
Work at DESY, Hamburg, towards a future collider was described by B. Aune (DESY) who reported on the <B>TESLA Test Facility</B> which seeks to accelerate beams at 15 MV/m up to 0.5 GeV. The TESLA linear collider design uses the efficient energy transfer in a superconducting accelerator to obtain very high beam power. This allows a somewhat larger spot size at the final focus. Aune showed tests of accelerating structures achieving 25 MV/m, the design goal for the TESLA linac. N. Holtcamp (DESY) then presented work on the <B>S-Band Linear Collider Test Facility</B>. This design uses the RF technology developed for the SLAC linac more than 30 years ago. He showed examples of the tunnel layout and emphasized differences in the new S-band design, higher-power klystrons and tighter structure tolerances. It is planned to be complete next year both DESY test facilities.
<P>
Overall the linear collider session showed the field's impressive progress. With the completion of the test facilities and extensive design studies, linear collider technology has matured to the point that in the very near future one can consider the construction of 0.5 TeV linear collider which could be upgraded to 1 TeV and beyond.

Released: November-December 1995
<BR>
<H2>
<B>A Broad Range of Activities</B>
</H2>
<P><B>
If one excludes special contributions and the funds that are redistributed on behalf of foundations and associations, the EPS income in 1995 amounts to about 985 kSFR. Of this, some 600 kSFR comes from national societies, 340 kSFR from other forms of corporate membership and from individual members, and 45 kSFR from commercial activities not counting income to <I>Europhysics News</I>, the Society's bulletin. J.L. Lewis, the EPS Treasurer, feels that the very wide range of activities made possible as a result of this income is not always appreciated.
</B>
<P>
<B>* Division and Interdivisional Groups</B>
<P>
Each of the Society's 14 Divisions and Interdivisional Groups carries out a variety of activities covering conferences, prizes, newsletters, coordination networks, peer review, <I>etc.</I> related to their specialities. The EPS Secretariat is often called upon to help, especially when it comes to administering membership and mailing lists, organizing elections, promoting conferences, providing Internet-based services, channelling applications for funds to international bodies, establishing programme committees and editorial boards, <I>etc.</I> Most of the Divisions and Groups organize annual or biennial meetings, sometimes in collaboration with other international organizations (see 1996 EPS Organized and Sponsored Conferences  at the end of the section <I>Information to EPS Members</I>). In the case of the Condensed Matter Division representing about one-half of the membership, the Division's annual General Conference is held every third year in collaboration with the French, German or UK societies, while four of its Sections hold series of meetings, often on a regular basis. 
<P>
 
<P>
<B> * General Conference</B>
<P>
The <I>EPS General Conference</I> "Trends in Physics" is held every three years. It allows eminent scientists to present the latest developments to a general audience that includes young physicists who are starting out on their careers. It is usually organized by a national society or societies, with EPS being responsible for the programme.
<P>
<B> * Education Activities</B>
<P>
The <I>European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students</I> (EMSPS) which the Society<BR>
set up and supervises enables students to study at a university in another country<BR>
while retaining the course credits. Mobility stays have been funded by special donations and by grants from the European Union's TEMPUS and ERASMUS (now SOCRATES) programmes. A staff member is employed full time to administer the scheme.
<P>
The <I>Interdivisional Group on Physics Education</I> aims to coordinate mobility activities under a general framework that includes its <I>Forum on Education</I> and a section dealing with university teaching. Special meetings are planned, including a symposium at the next General Conference on aspects of physics education.
<P>
<B>* Physics and Society</B>
<P>
General aspects of the interaction between the physics community and society at large are handled by the <I>Action Committee for Physics and Society</I>. It holds regular workshops on topics such as employment, energy use and the public understanding of science. Most are based on surveys carried out in advance in collaboration with national societies and lead to a publication.
<P>
<B>* Links with Industry</B>
<P>
Links with industry have long been recognized as an important aspect of the Society's work. A former action committee led to the establishment of the <I>Interdivisional Group for Applied Physics and Physics in Industry</I>.<BR>
It organizes the very successful <I>Europhysics Industrial Workshops</I> that bring together university and industrial physicists working on specific topics in emerging new technologies. There has been in the past special activities for EPS <I>Associate Members</I> which include<BR>
a wide range of industrial companies. The annual meeting with the Associates will now be incorporated into the work of the Group. Other Groups, notably the Group for <I>Experimental Physics Control Systems</I>, also have special links to industrial partners.
<P>
<B>* EPS Lecturer</B>
<P>
The Society organizes a series of open lectures throughout Europe by a distinguished <I>EPS Lecturer</I>.
<P>
<B>* East-West Activities</B>
<P>
Regular meetings are held with representatives of national societies from east and central Europe (E&amp;CE) in order to initiate and coordinate general initiatives covering such topics as student mobility, conferences, publications, science policy, and science management. The society has established special arrangements for distributing <I>Europhysics News</I> in the region and grants are provided to support young physicists attending the General Conference.
<P>
<B>* Qualifications</B>
<P>
Qualification activities are organized through the <I>Action Committee for Conferences</I>, the <I>Action Committee for Publications</I> and the <I>Register Commission for the European Register of Physicists</I>. They include conference sponsorship, the <I>EPS Recognized Journal</I> qualification, and most recently, professional qualifications which have involved working with the European Commission (EC) on the recognition and granting of <I>Eur Phys</I>, a designation that is increasingly appreciated by members. The Conference Committee also coordinates Division and Group proposals to the EC for support, either as EC-sponsored events or as EC-funded <I>European Research Conferences in Physics</I> co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation.
<P>
<B>* Prizes</B>
<P>
In addition to helping administer the <I>High-Energy and Particle Physics Prize</I>, the <I>Quantum Electronics Prize</I>, and the <I>Accelerator Prize</I>, the Secretariat manages the annual <I>Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize</I>. The <I>Amaldi International Prize</I> for high-school textbooks is awarded in collaboration with the EPS <I>Forum on Education</I>.
<P>
<B>* Administrative Services</B>
<P>
The Secretariat's records of membership represent a major contribution to the work of the Divisions and Groups because they serve as their links to members of national societies. The Secretariat also handles, under contract, the Secretariat of the <I>European Astronomical Society</I> (EAS) which is in partnership with EPS in the <I>Joint EPS-EAS Astrophysics Division</I>. Up to 25 scholarships to EPS sponsored <I>Erice</I> schools are administered by the Secretariat each year along with <I>Heraeus Grants</I> for young physicists to attend EPS organized meetings, and <I>Mayer Foundation Grants</I> for scientists from E&amp;CE. 
<P>
<B>* Publications</B>
<P>
The <I>Action Committee for Publications</I> encompasses working groups that promote European physics journals and harmonise standards and systems of interest to physicists covering all aspects of publications. These activities lead to regular workshops and reports. The committee advises on EPS publications and coordinates its work with the <I>Internet Coordination Group</I> that develops and supervises the Society's <I>EurophysNet</I> World-Wide Web (WWW) service.
<P>
<I>Europhysics News</I> is the major vehicle by which the national societies and the individual membership are kept in touch with one another. It is currently published six times a year and is distributed to the membership, either directly to Individual Ordinary Members or indirectly through national societies unless special arrangements are made. <I>Europhysics News</I> also takes charge of various information sources that are distributed in parallel via WWW such as the <I>Europhysics Meetings Lis</I>t, the <I>Europhysics Directory of Large Facilities in Physics</I> (which is supported by the EC) and the <I>EPS Directory</I>.
<P>
<I>Europhysics Letters</I> is a letters journal published by a partnership between EPS and 16 national societies. EPS handles business management as well as manuscripts up until acceptance for publication. It is significant that as a result of the arrangement the venture generates income, with a new issue appearing every 10 days.
<P>
The <I>European Journal of Physics</I> publishes scholarly articles for university staff. Initiated by EPS, it is a very successful partnership between the EPS and the Institute of Physics Publishing that brings income.
<P>
The <I>Europhysics Conference Abstracts </I>series of extended abstracts of Divisional Conferences are published by EPS in collaboration with conference organizers. 
<P>
<B>* Special Activities</B>
<P>
In recent years, two administrative responsibilities have been undertaken by the Secretariat. First, the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (<I>INTAS</I>) provided EPS with some half million Swiss francs in 1994, and again in 1995, for the provision of journals to the FSU. Second, the <I>Soros Foundations</I> provided 350 kSFR in 1994 and the same in 1995 to facilitate the movement of students from East and Central Europe within the framework of the EMSPS scheme.
<P>
<B>* New Activities</B>
<P>
The <I>Solidarity Fund</I> financed by a levy on participation at Divisional conferences is administered by the Secretariat. It has been established to provide seed money for new conference series and to make it possible for people from economically poor parts of Europe to attend EPS conferences, workshops and schools.
<P>
The <I>Lapereau Fund</I> was established recently, with an annual budget of SFR 10000, so that small sums could be made available at short notice during the year for an activity that was not included in the budget approved each year by Council in March. In this way the Society can give encouragement to <I>lapereau</I> (French for "little rabbit") that might grow into something larger.

<H2>European Group for Atomic Spectroscopy (EGAS)
</H2>
<P><STRONG>
28th Conference - Graz
</STRONG>
<P>
<CITE>16 - 19 July 1996
</CITE>
<P>
The outcome of this year's <A HREF="#egas28">EGAS</A> conference gave the impression that atomic spectroscopy flourishes and is still developing very rapidly. A special feature comprising four invited lectures and several contributions which together formed a symposium dedicated to <I>Lasers in Medicine</I> (see <A HREF="#medicine">insert</A>) confirmed this feeling. The conference itself opened with a talk by M.O. Scully (Texas Laser Lab and Garching) on <I>Lasers without inversion - accomplishments and perspectives</I>. The first experimental realization of such a laser and its theoretical modelling, based on quantum interferences, was discussed along with the potential of this type of lasing for future applications (<I>e.g.</I>, UV lasers; improvement in the efficiency of free-electron lasers). H.-P. Winter (Vienna) followed with a talk entitled <I>Interaction of multicharged ions with solid surfaces: production of hollow atoms and related phenomena</I>. Electrons from the surface are captured by these ions into highly excited electronic states, emitting later on X-rays. Besides this relaxation, many other processes, <I>e.g.</I>, emission of Auger electrons and potential sputtering, accompany the interaction process.
<P>
A talk by R.C.Thompson (London) on <I>Spectroscopy and quantum optics with trapped ions</I> not only reviewed the different types of traps and the spectroscopy of trapped ions, but also paid special attention to several mechanisms of laser cooling of trapped ions. Quantum mechanical experiments, such as the investigation of quantum jumps, can be performed using these trapped, ultra-cold particles. G.Werth (Mainz) continued with examples of <I>High-resolution spectroscopy on simple and complex atomic ions in traps</I>. A highlight of his talk was the extension of spectroscopic applications of ion traps to hyperfine states of excited states using coherent Raman excitation (so-called "dark resonances").
<P>
D. Charalambidis (Heraklion) reported on <I>Light induced modification of continua and ionization dynamics</I> by reviewing recent results on light-induced mixing of autoionizing states and on modifying continua structures by intense light pulses in one-valence electron systems and doubly excited autoionizing states. J. Dalibard (Paris), in a lecture entitled <I>Quantum phenomena with ultra-cold atoms</I>, discussed developments in laser cooling of atoms made during the last few years. They have allowed one to lower the kinetic energy of neutral atoms to values corresponding to temperatures in the sub-mK range. Besides phenomena involving single atoms, such as atom optics and atom interferometry, special attention has been paid to collective effects. The condensation of an ensemble of bosonic atoms to the potential ground state of a magnetic trap following successive laser and evaporative cooling cycles was discussed. Such a dilute system of a large number of atoms in the same quantum state should have several applications, and may be seen as a first step towards a coherent atomic source.
<P>
H. Kleinpoppen (Stirling) reported on <I>Coherence and polarization analysis of the two-photon radiation from metastable atomic hydrogen</I>. This two-photon decay of long-living metastable states, which provides insight into the validity of local or quantum mechanical theories, lends support to the latter theory. Especially important are measurements on the coherence length of the emitted correlated photons: the lifetime of 1/8 seconds for the 2S state corresponds to about 37500 km (one-photon decay), but the measurements showed a very short coherence length of some 390 nm. This can be explained by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and be attributed to the large wavelength region (and therefore to the energy uncertainty) of the detected photons.
<P>
The final two lectures were devoted to small molecules. First, L.Krause (Windsor, Canada) reported on <I>Laser spectroscopy of Hg2 excimers</I>. Pump-probe techniques were used to produce rotationally resolved excitation spectra of monoisotopic mercury dimers, leading to very accurate values of spectroscopic constants that allow meaningful comparisons with <I>ab inito </I>calculations of 
<P>
potential-energy diagrams. G.Gerber (W&uuml;rzburg) then spoke on <I>Molecules in intense ultrashort laser fields</I>. The real-time dynamics of sodium dimers has been studied in femtosecond pump-probe molecular-beam experiments. Coherent control of molecular multiphoton ionization by a single phase-shaped, chirped femtosecond laser pulse has been shown in electron and ion spectra of Na2.
<P>
The entire manifold of atomic spectroscopy was mirrored in the contributed papers, beginning with the classical analysis of the spectra of several neutral or ionized atoms in order to determine the properties of atomic energy levels. This was followed by a wide range of topics such as: atomic theory; hyperfine structures; spectroscopic instruments; trapped neutrals and ions; atomic collisions; interactions with photons; radiative lifetimes; XUV and X-ray emission; plasma spectroscopy; highly resolved molecular spectra. These themes stretched to topics in quantum optics.
<P>
In general, one can say that this year's EGAS conference was ideally suited to enhancing contacts between research groups and to promoting discussion on the methods and results of atomic spectroscopy. The next EGAS will be in 1998.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="egas28">EGAS-28</A></H3>
<P>
The 28th Conference of the European Group for Atomic Spectroscopy (EGAS) was held on 16-19 July 1996 at the Institut f&uuml;r Experimentalphysik der Technischen Universit&auml;t Graz. The programme consisted of 13 invited lectures and 340 contributed papers, presented to 250 spectroscopists from 32 countries. The conference was organized by H. J&auml;ger, T. Neger, C. Neureiter, G. Pottlacher, and L. Windholz (Chairman). One of the principles of the EGAS conferences is to maintain low costs in order to allow young researchers and graduate students to participate. A major effort is also made to support colleagues from east and central Europe and to make their participation possible. In this way the exchange of ideas between different regions of Europe will be enhanced by direct and informal contacts during the conference. To maintain this goal, EGAS gave substantial financial support to approximately 40% of the conference participants. Therefore, we would like to thank the following for generous support: the European Commission (Eastern Europe Programme), the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research, the Province of Styria, the City of Graz and the Technical University of Graz. Several companies also contributed to the conference budget by participating in a technical exhibition or by placing an announcement in the conference booklet.
<P>
It should be mentioned that this is the second time that the EGAS conference has been held in Graz, the first being in 1988 with the same team. Many personal contacts were established in 1988 and they led to several cooperations between the  institute in Graz and scientists from Russia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Germany. So the 1988 event remains fixed in the minds of most EGAS participants. This provided a special reason to make the 1996 conference at least as successful and enjoyable as the previous one. As far as can be concluded from the response of the participants, the goal was reached. People were satisfied not only from the scientific level of the lectures and contributions but also with the social events, including receptions hosted by the Governor of Styria and the Lord Mayor of Graz and a scenic tour of he Styrian Alps. Some participants ended their stay in Austria by taking part in a post-conference hiking tour which included climbing the Zirbitzkogel (2396 m above sea level).                &#009;

</H3>
<P>
The EGAS <I>Lasers in Medicine</I> symposium, which opened with an overview by S. Svanberg (Lund) entitled <I>New developments in laser medicine</I>, concentrated on non-thermal applications of laser light for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, emphasizing especially spectroscopic methods and applications. For example, using laser-induced auto-fluores-cence of human tissue, regions of cancers at the surface can be distinguished from healthy tissue using the profile of the fluorescence spectrum. Laser-induced fluorescence analysis can also easily be performed inside the body, <I>e.g.</I>,within the bladder, by combining it with endoscopic techniques. Hence the interest in the talk by D. Contini (Florence) on <I>Models for photon migration and optical properties of biological tissue</I>.
<P>
The lecture by G.Nilsson (Link&ouml;ping University), <I>Tissue blood-flow mapping</I>, introduced a method of blood-flow diagnostics based on investigating the Doppler broadening of laser light reflected from skin. In this case, a fast spectroscopic technique disperses the scattered light. The resulting information can be used, for example, to determine blood flow after severe burns in order to identify areas where a skin transplant is necessary, thus keeping the total area treated as small as possible. Finally, S.Avrillier (Paris) reported in detail on <I>Laser-induced autofluorescence diagnostics of tumours</I>.

8th European Meeting
</STRONG><P>
<CITE>Thessaloniki, Greece; 13 - 18 May 1996</CITE>
<P>
<CITE>Solar and Heliospheric Plasma Physics</CITE> was the title of the 8th triennial Sectional Conference organized by the Board of the <A HREF="../../dir/division/sps.html">Solar Physics Section</A> of the joint EPS - European Astronomical Society Astrophysics Division. Traditionally, the European solar physics meeting tries to be broad. But it also keeps a focal point which is related to the most active area of research at the time of the meeting. This year's focal point was the interaction of the Sun with the heliosphere, since two major satellites (Ulysses and SOHO) with an important European involvement were at the time of the meeting already in orbit .
<P>
The invited reviews (two were presented at each of the seven scientific sessions together with several oral contributed papers and a poster session) covered "traditional" topics such as the solar interior and oscillations (Patterno, Italy; Weiss, UK), the physics of flux tubes and waves (Solanki, Switzerland; Roberts UK), structure and flows in the upper atmosphere (Schmieder, France; Carlsson, Norway), restructuring of magnetic fields (Nordlund, Denmark; Benz Switzerland), particle acceleration physics (Trottet, France; Sarris, Greece), as well as current issues in the heliosphere and cosmic rays (Sanderson, ESTEC; Burgess, UK) and new instrumentation (Mein, France; Antonucci, Italy). A special afternoon session was devoted to SOHO with talks by P. Martens (ESTEC), E. Antonucci (Italy) and G. Simnett (UK).
<P>
This year's event was attended by 170 participants from 24 countries including the USA and Venezuela. Thanks to the generous contributions from several institutions, notably the European Commission, the Greek Ministry of Education, the Greek General Secretariat of Science and Technology, the Greek National Committee for Astronomy, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and the University of Ioannina, the Local Organizing Committee could offer 70 accommodation grants, 35 of them to Ph.D. students and 15 to participants from east and central Europe (together with 12 travel grants). Moreover, the registration fee was waived for all east and central European participants as well as for those from Greece.
<P>
The programme committee made a determined effort to balance observation and theory in all contributions. A total of 45 invited oral contributions were presented and some 90 posters were on display throughout the meeting. An abstract volume (edited by C.E. Alissandrakis) was distributed to participants at the time of registration. The invited reviews will be published in <I>Lecture Notes in Physics</I> (Eds. C.E. Alissandrakis, G. Simnett and L. Vlahos). Contributed papers (including posters) which authors decide to submit will be refereed and possibly published in a special volume of <I>Solar Physics</I> with P. Heinzel and G. Simnett acting as proceedings organizers.
<P>
The meeting was very lively, thanks to the presence of many young participants from all over Europe and the splendid facilities of the Hotel Athos Palace in Chalkidiki. The proximity of the beach and the pleasant weather did not affect the meeting and all sessions were very well attended. A boat trip around the Athos peninsula and a dinner accompanied by traditional Greek dances offered extra relaxation and plenty of opportunity to socialize.
<P>
The local organizers succeeded to large degree thanks to the tireless efforts of Despoina Papadaki, the conference secretary, and students from the University of Thessaloniki's Physics Department. It is worth mentioning that 500 initial applications were received and more than 2,000 e-mail messages were exchanged with applicants and participants.We believe that in the future other bodies which collaborate with the Solar Physics Section, <I>e.g.</I>, CESRA and JOSO, should join forces so that every European solar physics meeting can be a truly unique opportunity for all solar astronomers to get together while at the same time sharing the financial cost of such a large gathering.

<H2>General Meeting of EPS Members
</H2>
<P><STRONG>Seville; 11September 1996
</STRONG>
<P>
The President, H. Schopper, in his report to the 1996 <I>General Meeting of EPS Members</I> stressed the need to adapt to changes in the outside world. The Executive Committee's response had been to formulate a <A HREF="../ene_jun96_strategy_text.html">strategy plan</A> with four main lines of action. It was now necessary to "give it life" by planning an implementation based on inputs from Action Committees and Interdivisional Groups. It was also necessary for the Society to become more efficient so that there would be funds available to make it more visible. The Executive had therefore been decided to move the EPS Secretariat to <A HREF="ene_oct96_mulhouse_text.html">Mulhouse</A>, France, on 1 January 1997. The President then gave a brief review of some current activities where they have been important developments, notably east -west relations, student mobility, physics education, and professional qualifications. In stressing the need to establish firm contacts with the European Commission (EC), he referred to a memorandum on basic research which had been sent to the Commissioner for science following a visit to the EC Director General for science.
<P>
The Secretary (J.-P. Ansermet) began his report by saying that for an established society, EPS was "quite youthful": it had recently changed its <I>Constitution</I>, decided to relocate its Secretariat (which would start up with an entirely new staff), appointed a Secretary General Designate, changed the distribution arrangements for <I><A HREF="../../pub/index.html#en">Europhysics News</A></I>so that national society members received the bulletin, and entered into an agreement with Springer Verlag for its publication. He thanked the staff for their hard work; some had been asked to leave, others would transferred full time to <I>Europhysics Letters</I> which remains in Geneva and only the Secretary General would stay on (until retirement in August 1997). He stressed that all members of national societies are now able to join EPS Divisions and Groups through their societies, and he urged the societies to enable members to do this with charging a fee.
<P>
The Treasurer, J.L. Lewis, summarised the Society's finances by saying that the accumulated deficit had been eliminated and that with the move to Mulhouse there would be additional funds available for activities since staff salaries were lower in Mulhouse.
<P>
The questions and comments from members focussed on the arrangements for the production and distribution of <I>Europhysics News</I>, and on the continuing role of Individual Ordinary Members and the benefits they enjoy. S.F. Edwards, E. Heer and H. de Waard were endorsed as Honorary Members.

Jeffery Williams, who has been appointed as the EPS Secretary General Designate to replace Gero Thomas, the Secretary General, when he retires in 31 August 1997, has been the Assistant General Secretary and Information Officer of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry at its Secretariat in Oxford, since 1994. Born in 1956, he studied chemistry at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and received a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1981 from Cambridge University for research on the electrical properties of small molecules. He then worked as a postdoc at Manchester University and a further two years in the USA at Harvard University and the University of Illinois. On returning to the UK he was a Research Scientist with Schlumberger Cambridge Research for three years before rejoining the Cambridge University Chemistry Department where he established several projects. Dr. Williams joined the Institute Laue-Langevin in Grenoble in 1987 as a staff physicist on contract, and in 1993 he became Editor for Physical Sciences in the Europe office of <I>Nature</I>.
<P>
The Secretary General Designate takes up office on 1 January 1997 and will be based full-time in the new EPS Secretariat located on the first floor of one of the buildings on the Technop&ocirc;le de la Mer Rouge in Dornach on the outskirts of Mulhouse. The centre of Mulhouse is some six kilometres away. There is a bus (No. 18) which leaves the railway station (<I>Gare Wilson</I>) every 30 minutes approximately (weekdays; early morning to evening; 25 minutes duration) and stops in front of the building - 34, rue Marc Seguin, F-68060 Mulhouse Cedex; tel.: +33 (0)3 89 32 94 40, fax: +33 (0)3 89 32 94 49 - which houses the Secretariat. It is planned to have 4-5 people working in the Secretariat (the Secretary General Designate, the Editor of <I>Europhysics News</I>, two secretaries, and a half-time accountant). Gero Thomas, who is also the Business Manager of <I>Europhysics Letters</I>, will spend most of the week in Mulhouse (the <I>Europhysics Letters</I> editorial office is to remain at the present EPS Secretariat in Geneva).

http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/EPS/EurophysNet/PhysDoc/query.pl.cgi<BR>

which can be linked to through <A HREF="../index.html">EurophysNet</A> at http://epswww.epfl.ch.<P>

These indexing services provide uniform and efficient access to the wealth of information distributed throughout department and institute servers. However, the results of a search depend strongly on the structure of the locally stored information. They can be improved considerably if some fairly simple guidelines are adopted by those responsible for providing physics information and documents over WWW, notably pagemasters and institution coordinators. <P>

The guidelines discussed below are being sent to pagemasters and institution coordinators. The EPS ICG is also using its network of National WWW Coordinators to promote the guidelines. These coordinators are nominated by national physical societies in order to develop WWW information services in physics within each country by identifying institution coordinators and by interacting with the heads of departments and institutes.<P>
<STRONG>The Birth of PhysNet Indexes</STRONG><P>

It is often very difficult to locate documents on special topics and general information (e.g., the email address and telefax number of a colleague) which are stored on department and institution servers if you do not have the Uniform Resource Locate (URL) giving the Internet address of the relevant homepage. Search machines help overcome this difficulty by generating searchable indexes of  distributed information and documents.<P>

The idea of collecting information from the Internet, feeding it into a database (a process called gathering) and making this database available for Internet users (brokering) is very old, by Internet standards !<P>

There are two main types of search machines. The first type, which includes the well-known Lycos, Alta Vista and Webcrawler services, try to outperform each other in their coverage of the Internet by gathering and indexing all known WWW pages. The result is a very large amount of information, with search results that are fairly unstructured and not very specific.<P>

The <A HREF="http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/">Harvest</A> system (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/), by collecting information from a defined subspace of the Internet, epitomises the second type of search machine. It allows one to gather specific information about a defined topic and to process it to produce coherent and useful output. It is also possible to exchange database information between Harvest systems to help reduce network traffic and the load on Harvest brokers.<P>

The idea of setting up a Harvest-based search machine for physics and physics-related information was born in early-1995, shortly before Heinrich Stamerjohanns set up a Harvest search machine to make information stored on Oldenburg University's Institute of Physics WWW server searchable.The next step came when Bernd Diekmann added a search machine which collected information from the homepages of European physics departments which had been included in a link list. This link list was added to in the following months, thereby improving the service, and in mid-1995 Thomas Severiens incorporated a system which reduced data traffic by selecting data types during the gathering process.<P>

It was decided at a workshop in Berlin in September 1995 to install the Harvest system in all of Germany's physics departments, and to set up a broker to make the databases of all of the gatherers searchable through the exchange of the database files. The main advantages of this approach were a reduction in net traffic and the fact that the gatherers could be tuned to the specific interests of each data provider. Many German departments are today included in this network of Harvest brokers (the list is available at <A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/EPS/EurophysNet/PhysDep/query.pl.cgi">PhysDep</A>).<P>

With the German experience in hand, the ICG asked the PhysNet team in December 1995 if it would be possible to set up a broker specializing in documents. It turned out that the link list of physics departments provided an excellent starting point for a document search index, which we called PhysDoc. Some weeks later it was established that it was necessary, for formal reasons to ensure authenticity, to set up a separate broker for Ph.D. theses. It was then decided to incorporate the PhysDoc and PhysDis indexes, as well as the original department index which we called PhysDep, under the PhysNet umbrella. <P>

<STRONG>Keywords Offer Improvements </STRONG><P>

As a first step to improving the PhysNet brokers it was necessary to ensure that every physics department and institute with a WWW server could become known to PhysDep. An upload service was therefore added to allow servers to be registered by pagemasters and institute coordinators. It was also agreed at a <A HREF="ene_apr96_paris_text.html">meeting</A> in February 1996 in Paris organized by the ICG that the <A HREF="http://www.tp.umu.se/TIPTOP/">TIPTOP</A> (Internet Pilot to Physics) information service at which had been built up by students at Ume&aring; University and the Technical University of Vienna would merge its link list of physics departments with the PhysDep list. So instead of two incoherent lists one now has one list which is more complete, fully maintained and checked regularly.<P>

At the present time, pagemasters and coordinators are asked to register the URL of department and institute homepages using the PhysDep query interface so that general information can be indexed. Using the PhysDoc query interface, they are also asked to register the URL of the page - called a document page - that lists documents (publications, reports, preprints, etc.) stored by the server as well as pointers to these documents. <P>

The next step is to seek some structuring of the information provided by physics servers so that relevant information can be identified and indexed by the Harvest search engines and presented in a more uniform manner. Keywords included in homepages and document pages help improve the output of search machines without placing restrictions to the layout of the WWW pages.They can be incorporated either directly in the text, in which case they are visible to any WWW browser, or hidden in tag, in which case they are invisible if one views a page with a modern browser such as Netscape or Mosaic.<P>





Keywords clearly work best if the same ones are used by every PhysDep server. Lists of proposed PhysNet keywords for homepages and document pages are given in Table 1. In using the keywords it is important to note that most search machines are line-oriented so it is necessary to type the keyword and the information in the same line or tag.<P>

<STRONG>Several Ways to Incorporate</STRONG><P>

Examples of the four different ways of implementing keywords in the World-Wide Web's Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files are given  in Table 2 for a typical document page. In the case of the approach based on META tags, PhysNet provides the <A HREF="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/EPS/mmm/">My-Meta-Maker</A> (MMM) form interface at 
http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/EPS/mmm/ to help make META-tagging the document page as easy as possible. One types in bibliographic information and the MMM form returns HTML source code as output which can be pasted into the document page's citation list.<P>


To ensure an accurate listing of citations in a document page, PhysNet recommends adopting the so-called BibTeX format used by TeX word processors for bibliographies so that complete citations can be cut and pasted into TeX documents. An example of a BibTeX entry for a document page is: <BR>
	@article{short1,<BR>
	author = {A. Betaman},<BR>
	title = {&lt;A HREF=&quot;example.html&quot;&gt;An {E}xample-{T}itle&lt;/A&gt;},<BR>
	journal = {...},<BR>
	........<BR>
	}<P>

If you have any questions or comments about the PhysNet keywords and how they should be used, please contact a member of the PhysNet team  (<a href=mailto:severien@merlin.physik.uni-oldenburg.de>severien@merlin.physik.uni-oldenburg.de</a> or <a href=mailto:hilf@merlin.physik.uni-oldenburg.de>hilf@merlin.physik.uni-oldenburg.de</a>. Meanwhile, please make sure that all your department and institute servers are known to PhysDep so that the physics community can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Internet to access distributed information and documents.

<STRONG>Report on the</STRONG>

<H2>CLEO/Europe '96 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics  - Europe 1996</H2>
Hamburg, 8-13 September 1996<P>


The second European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics
(CLEO/Europe '96) was held from September 8 to 13, 1996 in
Hamburg, Germany.  This conference has been organized by a
consortium of members of the Quantum Electronics and Optics
Division of the European Physical Society (EPS), the Optical
Society of America (OSA) and the IEEE/Lasers and
Electro-Optics Society (LEOS).  For a second time in Europe
scientists, researchers, engineers and end users, managers
from industry, academia and government
have gathered for an update and review of a wide range of
laser and electro-optics disciplines from device development
to systems engineering and applications.  More than 1000
scientists preregistered for this conference.  The general
chairs were David Hanna and Jean-Pierre Huignard
and the program chairs were Colin Webb and G&uuml;nter Huber. 
Fifteen subcommittees covered different areas of research. 
In addition, similar to the first time two years ago
CLEO/Europe was running parallel to EQEC.  In the technical
exhibition, open during the conference, 136 companies have
shown their latest products.  This exhibition was sold out
and many additional requests had to be turned down.<P>

The CLEO/EQEC Conference together had 8 parallel sessions ,
whereas CLEO alone had 5 parallel sessions.  In addition,
together with EQEC seven tutorials of one hour were offered
in major research areas ranging from applied to basic.  They
offer a great opportunity for everybody to learn more about
subjects outside their own area of expertise and to obtain a
state-of-the-art update over a wide variety of hot research
areas.  A highlight was the plenary talk by Prof. K. J.
Ebeling, University of Ulm (Germany) about the recent
advances and prospects of semiconductor lasers. He presented
an outstanding review for everybody at the end of the first
day.  The plenary session was addressed to Alexander M.
Prokhorov on the occasion of his 80th birthday.  With 9
short courses throughout the conference a more in debt
review typically four hours long was offered to
interested conference participants. A complete review of
such a large conference is a hard task.  Therefore, I will
point out only a limited number of the most relevant papers
presented in each sessions and I apologize for those non
present in this brief review.  To get a complete report of
the conference, I recommend the reading of the conference
digest.<P>

The impact of solid-state lasers continues to increase,
which also shows in the high number of contributions to this
field.  Several sessions were dedicated to high power
lasers.  High power diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers with more
than 300 W cw have been reviewed by A. T&uuml;nnermann, Laser
Zentrum Hannover (Germany) and high power diode-pumped
Yb:YAG lasers with an average power as high as 150 W by A.
Giesen, University of Stuttgart (Germany).  The low thermal
loading of Yb-doped solid-state lasers makes those materials
very interesting for high-power application.  Thus, there
were reports about a large variety of different Yb-doped
solid-state lasers such as Yb:fluoride-phosphate glass, Yb:S-FAP, Yb:GGG
and others.  For longer wavelength than &ordf; 1 mm
Erbium-Ytterbium microlasers were reviewed by P. Laporta and
O. Svelto at the Politechnico di Milano (Italy).  A special
symposium on solid-state lasers in honor of the 80th
Birthday of Nobel Laureate A. M. Prokhorov was started by an
invited paper for V. Ostroumov and G. Huber from the
University of Hamburg (Germany) about their 1.2 W cw green
generation from an intracavity frequency doubled
diode-pumped microchip Nd:LSB laser.  Tunable solid-state
lasers based on OPOs using periodically poled LiNbO<SUB>3</SUB>
crystals was reviewed by D. Hanna's group from University of
Southhampton (UK).  The strong trend towards miniaturization
by moving away from bulk scale lasers to hybrid,
quasimonolithic lasers was well represented by two sessions
dedicated to diode-pumped fiber, waveguide and microchip
lasers.  An overview of microchip lasers was given by E.
Molva et. al. from LETI, Grenoble (France).<P>

The latest trends in the mid- and far-infrared gas lasers
have been reviewed by D. P. Scherrer, F. K. Kneub&uuml;hl at ETH
Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland) and in high power CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers by H. J.
Baker, D. R. Hall, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh (UK)
and W. L. Bohn, DLR Institute of Technical Physics, Suttgart
(Germany).<P>

Semiconductor lasers have made exciting progress in
performance over the last few years extending to longer and
shorter wavelength ranges. The available shorter wavelength
range has been pushed to 410 nm using GaN based devices.  A
review of the 3 mm to 4 mm wavelength range based on III-V
alloys was given by Y. P. Yakovlev from the A. F. Ioffe
Physical Technical Institute in St. Petersburg (Russia). 
InSb diode lasers at 5 mm were reported by T. Ashley,
Defence Research Agency, Worcestershire (UK). Surface
emitting laser diodes (VCSELs) demonstrated extremely low
laser threshold currents of less than 10 mA and more than
50% conversion efficiency at 1 mW output power.  At longer
wavelength such as at 1.3 mm with a GaInAsP/InP VCSELs S.
Ulchiyama et. al. from Yokohama (Japan) reported a threshold
current as low as 2.4 mA for cw operation up to 36 0C.
Materials and process approaches for improved VCSELs was
reviewed by R. P. Schneider et. al. from Hewlett Packard
Labs, Palo Alto (USA).  55 W cw has been demonstrated by C.
Peyrot et. al. from Thomson-CSF (France) with a large-area
(>0.20 cm<SUP>3</SUP>) 0.8 mm GaAlAs/GaAs VCSEL resulting in an optical
power density of 220 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>.<P>

Many different optical materials and fabrications processes
have been presented.  Recent progress on
semiconductor/polymer-based integrated devices has been
summarized by N. Bouadma, France Telecom (France).  H.
Melchior from ETH Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland) discussed planar InP
waveguide space switches which led to polarization
insensitive switches with low loss or even gain for
high-speed optical communication applications.  Quantum
engineering of optical nonlinearities in semiconductor
heterostructures were reviewed by E. Rosencher, Thomson CSF
(France).  Engineered nonlinear materials using
quasi-phase-matching strongly increases nonlinear conversion
efficiencies over a larger wavelength range.  A review on
periodically poled RbTiOAsO was given by H. Karlsson et.al.
(Sweden) and on etching studies of poled glasses was given
by B. Lesche et. al. (Brazil
and Sweden).  Efficient blue light generation by SHG and
sumfrequency mixing of laser diodes in KNbO<SUB>4</SUB> has been
reviewed by D. Fluck, P. G&uuml;nter,
ETH Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland).  A review of organic and inorganic
photorefractive materials  has been given by P. G&uuml;nter, ETH
Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland).  First net two-beam coupling gain was
demonstrated in an organic crystal.  A novel technique to
determine electronic and lattice contributions in single
crystals up to frequencies of 1 GHz were presented. All
presently reported highly efficient photorefractive polymer
composites rely on the orientational enhancement mechanism,
which was discussed in more detail by A. M. Cox et. al. at
the University of Manchester (UK). Different photorefractive
devices were presented.  L.-A. de Montmorillon et al.
(France) demonstrated a photorefractive self-adaptive
homodyne detector working at 1.06 and 1.55 mm.  A. Bignon,
J. P. Huignard, Thomson-CSF (France) presented recent
investigations of four-wave mixing by gain saturation in
laser materials.  Methods for achieving phase-locked phase
conjugation via stimulated Brioullin scattering were
discussed by A. M. Scott, K. D. Ridley, Defense Research
Agency, Worcestershire (UK).<P>

Rapid progress in the development of ultrashort pulsed
lasers has continued.  The inofficial news was that two
European groups have broken the world record of 6 fs pulses
by external pulse compression and achieved pulses as short
as about 5 fs.  Different techniques for measuring
ultrashort pulses in time and space were discussed. 
Engineered dispersion compensation with chirped mirrors was
reviewed by R. Szip&ouml;cs, Budapest (Hungary), which resulted
in pulses as short as 7.5 fs directly from a KLM Ti:sapphire
laser (presented by L. Xu et.al. from the Technical
University of Vienna Austria).  Self-starting soliton
modelocked pulses as short as 10 fs using intracavity
semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors were discussed by
F. X. K&auml;rtner et. al. from ETH Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland).  Many
applications require more compact and simpler femtosecond
sources.  This issue was addressed by different talks about
diode-pumped Cr:LiSAF and Cr:LiSGAF lasers.  Prismless KLM
femtosecond Cr:LiSGaF lasers were reviewed by I. T. Sorokina
et. al. from the Technical University of Vienna (Austria).<P>

There was a joint symposium on high peak power lasers and
their applications which was started off with an invited
talk by G. Mourou, University of Michigan (USA).  A novel
pulse compression technique for high energy application is
based on a hollow fused-silica waveguide filled with noble
gases.  S. Silvestri and O. Svelto's group (Italy)
demonstrated compressed 10 fs pulses with a pulse energy of
240 mJ.  The very active area of high-order harmonics
generation and application was reviewed by A. L'Hullier at
Lund Institute of Technology (Sweden).  B. Wellegehausen et.
al. at the University of Hanover (Germany) discussed the
recent progress in the generation of coherent tunable VUV-
and XUV radiation by low- and high-order nonlinear optical
nonlinearities.  P. V. Nickles, Max Born Institut, Berlin
(Germany) reviewed short-pulse driven soft X-ray lasers.<P>

Many contributions addressed the different applications in
Optics.  Dynamic Holography for applications in information
storage and processing was reviewed by N. A. Vainos, Institute of Electronic
Structure and Laser, Crete (Greece).  Applications of
nonlinear optics methods in molecular dynamics has been
summarized by S. Rosenwaks, Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev (Israel).  Athmospheric pollution measurements by DIAL
was reviewed by M. Milton, National Phyiscal Laboratory,
Middlesex (UK).  The past and future mission of spaceborne
lidar was discussed by C. Werner, DLR-Institute of
Optoelectronics, Wessling (Germany) and the ESA R&D programs
in optical remote sensing from space was discussed by E.
Armandillo (The Netherlands). Optical switching, storage and
logic device applications have been addressed by P.W. W.
Smith, University of Toronto (Canada) and A. A. Friesem,
Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel).  F. K. Kneub&uuml;hl's
group at ETH Z&uuml;rich (Switzerland) presented a novel
nanometer thin-film Ni-NiO-Ni diode with integrated antenna
for mixing and detection of 10 mm infrared laser radiation. 
Novel liquid crystal phase elements were described by M.
Stalder, PSI Z&uuml;rich and M. Schadt, Rolic Ltd. Basel
(Switzerland).  J. Y. Andersson et. al. at IMC (Sweden)
discussed quantum well photodetector arrays for low cost,
high resolution thermal imaging applications.  Many more
talks reviewed optical sensors, medical and biological
applications, laser material processing and lightwave
communications.  For further reference I refer to the
conference digest.<P>

The next CLEO Europe will be held in 1998 in Glasgow

<STRONG>Report on the</STRONG>

<H2>EQEC '96: European Quantum Electronics Conference 1996</H2>
 
Hamburg, 8-13 September 1996<P>



For the second time, the EQEC was held back-to-back with
theCLEO/Europe, in conjunction with a technical exhibition.
This new formula turned out to be successful two years ago
in Amsterdam. The number of participants for both meetings
combined was around 1200, not counting the visitors of the
exhibition.<P>

The original idea of the EQEC when it was held for the first
time (Hannover, 1988) was to create a forum for this rapidly
growing field in Europe, so that it would be easy for
students to participate. Of course, the large combined
meeting requires high-tech facilities, which cannot be
realized at the low-budget that a meeting at university
facilities can afford. Nevertheless, the policy to keep the
registration fee modest for students has been very
successful: first data show that the percentage of students
participation is around 40 %.<P>

The meeting had three parallel session during nearly four
days and a half (about fifty sessions of oral contributions
and posters). There was a continuous exchange of
participants between the two conferences, so that in total 8
or 9 parallel sessions were going on simultaneously. The
attendance was good, and the discussions lively. The
contributions to EQEC were selected by programme committees
on spectroscopy, non-linear optical phenomena, quantum optics, optical interactions with
condensed matter, physics of coherent light sources,
ultrafast phenomena, and lasers in chemistry, biology and
medicine. First responsibles for the programme were the two
programme chairs Wolfgang Ertmer (Hannover) 
and Sune Svanberg (Lund). The general chairs for EQEC were
Elisabeth Giacobino (Paris) and Ove Poulsen (Copenhagen).
The local organizing committee was headed by Guenter Huber
(Hamburg).<P>

The development of the field of quantum electronics is maybe
best illustrated by considering new and growing topics.
Examples of session topics of this meeting that were not
present in Amsterdam are Bose-Einstein Condensation, Optical
Lattices, Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, Non-local
Quantum Correlations, Dynamics of Semiconductor Lasers,
Semiconductor Cavity QED, Lasing Without Inversion. Probably
these give the best indications of the areas of rapid
progress. The large number of invited lectures (around
fifty) offered excellent possibilities to get a broad
overview of the present status of the field of quantum
electronics. What struck me most is maybe the natural
combination of fundamental physical problems, ranging from
quantum non-locality to gravity waves and applications of
lasers and modern optics in technology and science at large.<P>

A special service of this meeting is the presentation of
short courses, and of tutorials. The tutorials were very
well attended. Within the domain of the EQEC the main topics
were Bose-Einstein Condensation (by J.T.M.Walraven,
Amsterdam) and Quantum Computing (by P. Zoller, Innsbruck).
Short courses on miscellaneous topics of somewhat technical
nature were quite instructive and well-prepared, but
the number of participants was rather varying from topic to
topic.<P>

It is not possible to review a meeting of this size in any
fair way by selecting special contributions out of the many
hundreds, or even out of the fifty Invited Lectures. The
reader who is interested in more details of the
contributions is invited to consult the summaries in the
Advance Programme, and in the Technical Digest of EQEC'96.<P>

<STRONG> SEPTEMBER 1996</STRONG><HR>
<H2>A Report on The XX International Quantum Electronics Conference</H2>
Sidney, Australia<BR>
14 - 19 July, 1996<BR>
<P>
The International Quantum Electronics Conference (IQEC'96) was held this year at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Center, Sydney, Australia from 14--19 July. This conference usually takes place every second year since 1959, and is an international forum for discussion of all aspects of quantum electronics. In this occasion it was organized by the Australasian Council on Quantum Electronics under the aegis of the International Council on Quantum Electronics. This is the first time IQEC has been held in the Southern Hemisphere.<P>

In IQEC'96 600 papers have been presented, which included 3 plenary and 5 tutorial lectures, 90 invited papers, 472 regular contributed papers and 30 postdeadline contributed papers. Of the total 600 papers, 253 were presented in poster sessions and 347 in oral sessions, which were held in 5 different rooms (there were 5 parallel sessions each day).They covered most of the aspects of quantum electronics. In particular, topics of IQEC'96 included the physics of coherent light sources, laser cooling and spectroscopy, atom and quantum optics, optical materials, nonlinear optics, optical interactions with condensed matter, ultrafast phenomena, advanced  photonics, and optical communications. There were also three more specialized satellite meetings, also held in Australia, dealing with guided-wave propagation and devices, quantum optics, and atom optics.<P>

The plenary lectures summarized last advances in three outstanding areas of quantum electronics. Prof. Cornell (University of Colorado) explained the processes that takeplace when an atomic gas is cooled from room temperature to nano Kelvins, emphasizing the counter intuitive behaviours that emerge at very low temperatures, as well as the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation. Prof. Polany (University of Toronto) reported on recent experimental advances in the field of photochemistry of adsorbates and clusters. Prof. Miller (Bell Laboratories) showed how recent advances allow quantum wells to be regarded as an ideal &quot;laboratory&quot; to perform fundamental experiments of quantum mechanics, as well as to construct useful devices.<P>

The five tutorials covered rapidly developed areas inquantum electronics. Prof. Hanna (University of Southampton) devoted his tutorial to planar waveguide lasers in dielectric materials, explaining what may be their role in future applications. Prof. Keller (ETH, Zurich) explained the new developments in ultrafast solid-state laser that have given us the possibility to create pulses as short as 8 fs, which has applications in other areas apart from Physics. Prof. Ekert (Oxford University) gave a tutorial on quantum computation. He showed how a quantum computer would perform certain operations much faster than the computers we have today, and explained the present obstacles to build one. Prof. Weisbuch (Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau) showed how the control of optical modes through cavity effects can be used to improve light emission properties, as well as to perform some of the quantum mechanical experiements that so far have been carried out only in the context of quantum optics. Prof. Lugiato (Universita degli Studi di Milano) explained the phenomena of spontaneous formation of two-dimensional patterns in the radiation field, when it interacts with a nonlinear medium.<P>

An special symposium was devoted to commemorate the 80th  birthday of Prof. A.M. Prokhorov, who was one of the founders of Quantum Electronics. He, Prof. Basov, and Prof. Townes are the three key scientists who proposed the generation of radiation based on stimulated emission of atoms. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964. There were four invited papers in this symposium, given by outstanding contributors in the field of quantum electronics: Profs. Manenkov (Russian Academy of Sciences), Krupke (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), Byer (Stanford University) and Walther (Max-Plank-Institut).<P>

In the following I will give a brief summary of some of the results presented at the conference. Since there were 5 parallel session each day, I have only included the oral 
sessions that I attended, which were those related to laser cooling, Bose-Einstein condensation, atom and quantum optics, and quantum measurement and information. Parenthetical names credit the speakers who presented the corresponding talk. I apologize to the participants in other oral sessions and in the poster sessions, whose work I have not mentioned. Fortunately, a summary of their contributions is available in the IQEC'96 Technical Digest.<P>

<STRONG>Bose-Einstein Condensation </STRONG><BR>
 <BR>
Bose -Einstein condensation has been one of the most important achievements in atomic physics during the last years. It was predicted 70 years ago that if a gas of weakly interacting bosonic atoms is cooled below a critical temperature, the atoms tend to occupy the same quantum state. This prediction was verified experimentally in 1995 by three groups, at the University of Colorado, MIT, and Rice University. Once the condensate is formed, one can perform a great variety of experiments with it. Some of these remarkable experiments were presented at IQEC by the first two groups.<P>

The JILA group (E. Cornell) reported on the measurements of the collective excitation frequencies of the condensate, and how the corresponding oscillations damp out. They have also measured the specific heat of the condensate. The excitation spectrum has been also measured by the MIT group (W. Ketterle). This group has &quot;seen&quot; the condensate using off-resonant laser light, without perturbing the condensate. In addition, they have been able to &quot;cut&quot; the condensate in two parts using laser light and, after dropping it, they have observed interferences.<P>

These experimental results coincide remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of K. Burnett's group based on the non-linear Schr&ouml;dinger equation. This equation seems to contain most of the physics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (K. Burnett). For example, it predicts the possibility of a stable condensate for gases with negative scattering length, provided the number of atoms is small enough. One can also understand theoretically the growth dynamics of a condensate by studying how it is affected if one adds particles to it (R. Ballagh). Other theoretical studies of the dynamics of a condensate show that the macroscopic wavefunction that describe the condensate can undergo collapses and revivals (D. Walls). This prediction could be observed in an interference experiment.<P>

After having observed Bose-Einstein condensation, the possibility of building a coherent source of atoms (the boser or atom laser) is one of the present goals in this field. So far, there are two approaches to this problem: the first one is to use evaporative cooling, whereas the other one relies on laser cooling. Theoretical models describing these two situations were analyzed (H.M. Wiseman and U. Janicke, respectively).<P>

<STRONG>Laser cooling and atom optics </STRONG><BR>
 <BR>
The progress made during the last ten years in atom trapping and cooling can be now applied in many areas. For example, it has permitted to observe Bose-Einstein condensation, to build atomic interferometers, and to reach an extraordinary precision in spectroscopy. Several experimental groups presented new results in this rapidly progressing field. Atomic interferometers have reached a point where they can be used not only for demonstration purposes, but also to measure with more precision than with any other technique. Using one of such devices the quotient h/M  (M is the atomic mass) has been measured with a relative error of 10-8  (S. Chu). It is expected that in the near future this will be improved by more than a factor 10. This will allow to measure the fine structure constant a with a higher precision. High precision measurements can be also achieved with atomic interferometers based on the Moire effect (J. Schmiedmayer). On the other hand, two-atom correlations (i.e. quantum statistical effects) have been observed for the first time with bosonic atoms by detecting the arrival time (F. Shimizu). This is the analogue of the Brown-Twiss interferometer for photons.<P>

The basic components of atomic interferometers and other atom-optical experiments are improving very rapidly. At this conference very efficient atomic mirrors were presented. They were based either on evanescent waves (J.H. Eschner and A. Aspect) or on magnetic forces coming from permanent magnets (P. Hannarofd and D. Meschede). Other atom-optical tools are well suited to write spatial patterns with high spatial resolution. At the University of Konstanz, they have written submicron structures using Cr beams focused by laser standing waves (J. Mlynek). They have also written more sophisticated patterns using He. Physicists at the University of Tokyo have managed to paint a picture with Ne atoms by passing them through a computer generated hologram (F. Shimizu). On the other hand, Rb atoms have been successfully guided through a hollow fiber filled with an evanescent wave (H. Ito). The role of the van der Waals interaction between the atoms and the dielectric surroundings have played an important role in these experiments (A. Aspect and H. Ito).<P>

The developments in laser cooling and trapping have also permitted to carry out a series of experiments that so far were considered as &quot;gedanken&quot;. Using laser standing waves one can entangle the internal and external degrees of freedom of an atom (G. Rempe). The diffraction pattern of the atoms in a screen can be modified or erased by measuring and manipulating the internal atomic state. Entanglement between atoms and photons in an atom--optical experiment has been also demonstrated (C. Kurtsiefer). Furthermore, Bloch oscillations of ultracold Cs atoms in a periodic optical potential have been observed for the first time at the ENS in Paris (E. Peik). On the other hand, a single Ba ion has been cooled near the zero point energy via &quot;stochastic cooling&quot; (P.E. Toschek). This will permit to generate non-classical states of motion of a single Ba ion.<P>

Other precision measurements have been carried out with atoms in optical traps. Information about the scattering length, dipole moments, and van der Waals interaction has been obtained (D.J. Heinzen). This information is very important to achieve and manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates. Dipole traps are being constructed by means of holographic produced light fields (W. Ertmer). Other optical traps using blue far--off resonance 3D optical lattices have been constructed in Konstanz (J. Mlynek). Combined with laser cooling, they will allow to observe quantum statistical effects of atomic gases. Other theoretical efforts to see these effects in optical lattices were presented (I.H. Deutsch).<BR>
    <BR>
<STRONG>Cavity QED </STRONG><P>

Cavity QED provides one of the most important scenarios to observe some of the most intriguing properties of Quantum Mechanics. Recent experimental advances allow today to have single atoms crossing high-Q cavities in the strong coupling regime, whereby the cavity mode-atom interaction is stronger than all other dissipative processes. This has allowed the observation of several quantum phenomena, without classical analogy (H. Walther).<P>

The possibility of using an atom interacting with a cavity mode to perform a simple quantum logical operation has been predicted theoretically some time ago. Steps towards this goal have been taken by several experimental groups. In particular, at the ENS in Paris they have been able to measure the collapse and revival of the population inversion of an atom that crosses a cavity (S. Haroche). This gives evidence of the granularity of the electromagnetic field in the cavity. In a very beautiful experiment, they have also produced a Schr&ouml;dinger cat state of the electromagnetic field, which paves the way for observing ``live'' the process of decoherence, i.e. the transition between the microscopic world ruled by quantum mechanics to the macroscopic world ruled by classical mechanics. At Caltech, in another remarkable experiment, they have been able to observe conditional phase shifts of two weak laser beams that enter a cavity (H. Mabuchi).<P>

The dynamics of this and other cavity QED processes is described by the Jaynes-Cummings Model, in which dissipation in both the cavity and the atoms can be included. Numerical predictions obtained using quantum trajectories were reported at the conference, and a new semiclassical theory to describe these phenomena was presented (H. Carmichael). Using quantum trajectories the possibility of entangling two cavity modes by sending an atom through them was analyzed (H.W. Giesen). It was also shown that direct evidence of completely quantum effects in cavity QED can be obtained by performing two-photon coincidence measurements on the outgoing cavity field (B. Sanders). The possibility of trapping atoms inside the cavity by continuously monitoring the outgoing cavity field was also proposed (A.S. Parkins).<P>

<STRONG>Quantum Measurement </STRONG><BR>
 <BR>
The quantum theory of measurement is one of the open problems in quantum mechanics. Different interpretations for the way a collapse of the wavefunction takes place (if it does) are still under dispute. From the more practical point of view, however, there are several situations in which quantum mechanics has to be taken into account in the measurement process. Quantum non-demolition measurements, quantum tomography, and interaction-free measurements are examples that have been already demonstrated by several experimental groups. Some of the new advances in this field were presented at IQEC'96.<P>

The problem of determining completely the quantum state of a system (quantum tomography) is a delicate one. The key point is that the measuring apparatus (the quantum ruler) also behaves quantum mechanically, and this has to be taken into account in order to reconstruct the original state of the system (P. Knight). The tomography of an electromagnetic field generated by an optical parametric amplifier has been carried out experimentally (S. Schiller). The reconstructed field corresponds to a squeezed vacuum state that presents oscillations in the photon number distribution. It was also shown how the quantum tomography of a trapped ion moving in a time-dependent potential could be carried out (W. Schleich). The possibility of detecting quantum chaos in this system was proposed as well.<P>

On the other hand, it is well known that in a single shot measurement there is always back action in the system to be measured. However, this back action can be manipulated in such a way that it does not disturb the quantity that is measured. Individual and sequential quantum non-demolition experiments with a squeezed light beamsplitter was achieved (S. Schiller). An adaptative measurement based on a feedback loop was proposed to improve the uncertainty in the phase of an electromagnetic field (H.J. Wiseman). On the other hand, an experimental demonstration of a high-efficiency interaction free detection of an opaque object was presented (P. Kwiat).<P>

<STRONG>Quantum computation and cryptography </STRONG><BR>
 <BR>
Quantum cryptography and computation are two of the most striking applications of interference phenomena in quantum mechanics. If some day they are going to be useful, we firsthave to understand how are they affected by the presence of decoherence, and how to avoid this last process. It is not yet clear whether error correction schemes will be sufficiently efficient to circumvent this problem (A. Ekert), at least in the field of quantum computation. In quantum cryptography, however, after the latest experiments, it seems that may be of practical use in the foreseeable future (S. Barnett). Unfortunately, existing quantum cryptographic schemes are not secure in the presence of decoherence. An entanglement-based quantum cryptographic scheme that is probably secure over a noisy channel was presented (C. Machiavello). There are other possible cryptographic systems that are easier to operate than the present ones (J.D. Franson and N. Imoto). Quantum communication could be also benefited from quantum dense coding, in which acting only on one two-level system, one can produce four (orthogonal) bits of information. This has been demonstrated for the first time with polarization-entangled photons (P. Kwiat).<P>

In summary, IQEC'96 presented some of the most important contributions of the last few years in the field of quantum electronics.<BR>

<H3>Report on Recent Meetings on Nonlinear Dynamics in Optical Systems</H3>
<STRONG>June 1995</STRONG>
 <P>

Ten years after the first conference devoted to instabilities, chaos and  nonlinear dynamics in optical systems, the international community of  scientists working in this field gathered at two conferences in June 1995. The first was the <B>Nonlinear Dynamics in Optical Systems</B> satellite meeting held in Rochester, NY, June 5-7, preceeding the Seventh Rochester Conference on Coherence and Quantum  Optics. The second was represented by sessions on <B>Nonlinear Waves and Nonlinear Optical Systems</B> and by a symposium on <B>Nonlinear Dynamics in  Laser Systems</B> as parts of the joint meetings of the International Coherent and Nonlinear Optics and Laser Optics series in St. Petersburg, Russia at the end of the month.<P>

These meetings were the latest of a series of meetings and schools over  the intervening ten years on such topics as optical chaos, optical  instabilities, instabilities and chaos in quantum optics, optical  bistability, nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear waves, etc. The field now has a mature branch of study of the formation of transverse patterns in  optical beams and spatio-temporal dynamics.This complements the earlier and continued emphasis on the linear stability analysis of models  involving ordinary differential equations and the study of temporal  signals from such systems. The spatio-temporal dynamics of interest ranged from problems of the coupling of a few spatial modes to the study  of dynamics that might be considered the analog of fluid turbulence.<P>

Talks ranged widely over the temporal and saptio-temporal dynamics of some of the latest devices for applications in laser technologies:  microchip lasers, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, semiconductor lasers with external retroreflectors (nominally for better stability), laser arrays, fiber lasers, photorefractive oscillators, additive pulse mode locked lasers, and large aperture lasers. Key subjects included: the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of internal or external roundtrip paths as delayed feedback to the laser systems, the coupling of longitudinal and transverse modes that goes beyond simple &quot;beating&quot; to at least partial phase locking or mode alternation, and the role of the state of polarization of the electric field in the dynamics. A number of these lasers have a simple cylindrical symmetry and such high gain that the vector nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has become an important topic. The photorefractive oscillators with their slow time constants permit video recording of the spatio-temporal evolution of patterns and thus are one of the few examples in which the striking visual and video graphics from numerical simulations can be compared with real-time dynamics in optical systems.  The challenges to the field are to determine whether similar dynamics are occuring in the more commonly high speed laser systems, or whether measurements of average properties in these high speed systems can be used to distinguish different kinds of dynamical behaviors.<P>

At several other recent meetings on optical nonlinear dynamics, there was a strong interest in the role, formation, and interaction of optical singularities (zeroes of the optical intensity which are centers of phase vortices). The great debate has been among those seeking these defects as nonlinearly supported structures in an essentially infinite transverse extent of a beam, and those identifying defects which result from nonlinearly supported combinations (quasi-superpositions) of cavity modes. While defects can be created by linear optics (gratings and reflectors) and their interaction then studied as the beams propagate, it has been the nonlinear interaction that has excited more recent attention. Whether these are sustained and propagate in Kerr or Photorefractive media as transverse spatial solitons which may be addressable as pixels, whether they move and interact in ways more like those of particles in leading to a form of optical turbulence, or whether defects or defect arrays could be used for particle trapping or manipulation, all are issues which suggest the more esoteric debate about their intrinsic or modal origins was only a temporary distraction.<P>

Applications of nonlinear dynamical approaches and methods were reported for &quot;control of chaos&quot; (such as the stabilization or selection of steady states or periodic pulsations of a chaotic system), control of spatio-temporal dynamics, and for (more secure) communication by linking and locking (&quot;sychronization&quot;) two chaotic laser systems. Important questions include the speed with which a system could be compelled to settle onto an unstable periodic orbit, the speed and reliability of switching from one selected orbit to another, and the nature of detection and feedback required for the selection of particular patterns or particular spatio-temporal dynamics (whether described by one or a few modes, or many modes).<P>

One advantage of a workshop setting is that the moderate number of attendees and papers permits a program in which all can participate. Although there were a few parallel sessions, the majority of the program brought the assembled contributors together to hear all the talks and the poster sessions were equally lively and diversified. The gatherings in the larger Russian meetings worked less well because of pressure on those attending the dynamics symposia to also attend topical sessions on particular types of lasers, phase conjugation, and a vigorous parallel workshop on coherence phenomena including lasing without inversion and electromagnetically induced transparency organized by P. Mandel and O.Kocharovskaya.<P>

The Rochester NDOS meeting was organized by a steering committee made up  of G. Agrawal (Rochester, USA), R. Roy (Georgia Tech, USA), Ya. I. Khanin  (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia), M. Piche (Quebec City, Canada) and Pierre  Glorieux (Lille, France).  Although plans have not been made for the next  meeting (they have been held every two or three years heretofore), the  more than 150 different papers contributed by nearly 400 authors at the two meetings indicate that these topics will be a continuing source of  interest and investigation and an important part of nonlinear optics and  laser meetings in the future.<P>

The Russian-organized ICONO and LO meetings will probably be held again in 1997 and the strong Russian traditions in nonlinear mathematics and nonlinear dynamics in physics seem likely to ensure that there will be interest and contributions from many groups and individuals which are  surviving the economic and social upheavals in the former Soviet Union which are requiring restructuring of many government and academic institutions.<P>

<STRONG>JUNE 1995</STRONG><HR>
<STRONG>A Report on the</STRONG><BR><H3>Seventh Rochester Conference on Coherence and Quantum Optics</H3>
<STRONG>7- 10 June, 1995</STRONG><P>
For 35 years scientists from around the world have been gathering at  (generally) 6 year intervals at the University of Rochester to discuss, and sometimes dispute vigorously, the fundamental physics (as contrasted with the commercialization of devices) of coherence and quantum optics. The participants, nearly 300 this year from more than 30 countries, came  primarily from universities. Most elected to stay in dormitory housing  and share three daily meals with their fellow scientists, engaging in the  traditional academic activities of sharing criticism and advice, discussing new experiments and theories, and forming opinions on research  options and researchers. During the four day conference there were 8  hour-long tutorials, 32 half-hour invited talks in two parallel sessions, and some 250 afternoon or evening poster presentations of new results or  work in progress. As in the past, abbreviated versions of all of this  will be published by Plenum Press (J. H. Eberly now joins L. Mandel and  E. Wolf as editors).<P>

The Rochester conferences concern the coherence properties of light -- the properties that allow superpositions of waves to exhibit interference  patterns. There is a close connection with these wave phenomena and the  superpositions of quantum states that are responsible for some of the most vivid departures from what is usually regarded as classical physics, or intuitive physics. The quantum optics of the conference title refers  to the use of optical techniques to demonstrate quantum mechanical  phenomena, or to the application of quantum theory to various optical  devices. Both lines of research were well represented.<P>

The disputes that marked past conferences (over such issues as the extent  to which classical electrodynamics provides an adequate description of the Lamb shift, atomic fluorescence, and spontaneous emission) have abated, perhaps just for the moment. Differences of opinion remain, as evident in the various uses proposed for the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) of micromasers and resonators into which single atoms and single photons can be injected. The two topics that particularly struck me as being new and novel were quantum tomography and quantum cryptography, each of which was the subject of several talks.<P>

The following brief and incomplete remarks highlight what appeared to me to be particularly interesting topics. Parenthetical names credit the speakers who presented the relevant invited talk. I apologize to the several hundred participants, many of whom presented invited talks, whose work I have not mentioned. Fortunately their efforts will be available in the published proceedings.<P>
<H4>Lasers and Lasing</H4>

<BR>
The first Rochester conference was held just weeks before the first laser was publicly announced. Since then the laser has come to dominate the subject matter of these conferences, both as a tool for probing or modifying atomic phenomena and as a prototype of a simple quantum system.<P>

Lasers offer means reducing the momentum spread in an ensemble of atoms, thereby cooling them to unprecedented low temperatures and offering new high-precision  opportunities for measuring atomic properties free from Doppler effects (C. Cohen -Tannoudji).<P>

Although the coherence properties of laser radiation have growing commercial use, the interplay of atomic excitation processes that underlie the lasing action can also exhibit irregular behavior that provides useful examples of chaos (R. Roy).<P>

While some national laboratories pursue the design of increasingly powerful lasers, researchers elsewhere have been creating and using minute devices in which single atoms and a few photons, in a cavity or resonator, display most clearly the quantum nature of radiation and matter. A continuing succession of experiments with micromasers at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, Munich, has revealed such quantum phenomena as collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations of two-state atoms passing through a cavity, and of nonclassical photon statistics of the radiation coupled to such atoms, and now offers interesting possibilities, when used with Ramsey-type two-field interaction, for observing novel quantum interference effects (H. Walther).<P>

A growing variety of quantum phenomena are being demonstrated and examined with the aid of appropriate cavities and atomic beams at the Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris (S. Haroche). A somewhat different approach to cavity QED pursued at Cal Tech, Pasadena, offers tools for ultimately synthesizing quite general states of the electromagnetic field (H.J. Kimble).<P>

As work continues toward perfecting apparatus in which only a fraction of a photon, on average, is involved, perhaps the ultimate device would involve&quot;lasing without photons&quot;, the tongue-in-cheek partial title of a quite sensible talk (A.Siegman) that pointed out some of the practical difficulties attending the definition of photons as quanta of normal modes in gain-guided media or unstable resonators. The very definition of photon wavefunction continues to be debated (I. Bialynici-Birula).<P>

The traditional understanding of the operation of a maser or laser involves the preparation of an atomic population inversion, whereby some pumping mechanism places more population into an excited state than exists in a lower-lying state to which radiative decay can subsequently be induced. During the last few years it has been noted that light amplification by stimulated emission need not require a population inversion, and various possibilities for creating &quot;lasing without inversion&quot; have been both theoretically described and experimentally verified (M. O. Scully).<P>
<H4>Atom Interference</H4>

<BR>
The potential for demonstrating interference of wavelike behavior of atoms, inherent in the deBroglie wave-particle duality that is central to quantum theory, is now being put to use in the construction of atomic interferometers (D. Pritchard).<P>

The two-slit diffraction pattern historically linked with T. Young has, in the pedagogy of quantum theory, been used in numerous thought experiments designed to demonstrate the impossibility of simultaneously measuring position and momentum. Now such a Heisenberg microscope, using diffraction of helium atoms, has become an experimental reality (J. Mlynek).<P>
<H4>Quantum Phase and Quantum Tomography</H4>

<BR>
Concerns over useful (and mathematically sound) definitions of phase in quantum mechanics date back to 1926, when F. London proved that no Hermitian phase operator can exist, and have been present at each of the Rochester conferences. The vigorous controversy over mathematical rigor that marked the last conference has given way to milder differences over usefulness, with continuing application of the Pegg-Barnett phase states (D. Pegg), and experimentally defined phase operators (V. Buzek&#59; K. Wodkiewicz).  Indeed, a variety of theoretical and operational definitions coexist, each offering useful computational tools or insights into quantum behavior (W. Schleich).<P>

At the heart of quantum theory is the notion of quantum state. The early work on quantum electrodynamics, based on the use of photon-number states for the harmonic oscillators that underlie electromagnetic fields, began giving way (at around the time of the first Rochester conferences) to the use of coherent states in which neither photon number or photon phase are precisely specified. Coherent states incorporate the impossibility of precisely specifying both the position and momentum of an oscillator&#59; they present a state that minimizes simultaneous uncertainty in these variables, or in photon number and phase. The creation of field oscillator states in which conjugate operators have unequal uncertainties (squeezed states) continues to hold interest.<P>

Attention has now shifted toward various quasi-probability distributions which provide information about each of the paired conjugate variables that are linked by uncertainty relations, and from which one can obtain either a momentum or a position probability distribution by integrating over the conjugate variable.These quasiprobabilities are quantum counterparts of the classical phase space density, and  they incorporate as complete a description of  motion as is possible with quantum mechanics. The most well known of these is the Wigner distribution for position and momentum (of a particle or of an oscillator). This distribution can reveal, through the presence of negative values, the nonclassical nature of a quantum state. For squeezed states the Wigner function appears elongated, while for macroscopic superposition states (Schroedinger cats) the function has the appearance of two distinctly separate distributions. Recently developed techniques of phase-space tomography now allow the determination of Wigner functions for the quantum state of a single mode optical field. In the special case of optical homodyne tomography, tomographic reconstruction methods are based on repeated measurements for electric field amplitude at several phases (M.G. Raymer). Tomographic methods are also being applied to the determination of periodic wave packet dynamics in molecules, using an inverse Radon transform and time-dependent emission spectrum (I. A. Walmsley).<P>
<H4>Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Cryptography</H4>

<BR>
Because quantum theory deals with (complex-valued) probability amplitudes whose absolute squares provide observable probability distributions, there are innumerable opportunities for quantum systems to exhibit interference effects that cannot be obtained with classical probability distributions. The two slit interference has an extension to more general two-path phenomena in which measurements of photon paths destroy interference (A. Zeilinger).<P>

One of the most startling and unsettling aspects of quantum theory becomes evident when one considers a system involving two or more parts (e.g. two electrons, two photons, a photon and an electron, etc.) It is possible to prepare such systems in states for which the properties of individual parts become inextricably correlated. The singlet state of the helium electrons is a simple example, apparent as the correlation energy of quantum chemistry. In contemporary literature the individual components are said to be entangled, and the emphasis is on the seemingly paradoxical fact that measurement of one part gives immediate information about an extremely distant but entangled companion part. The possibility for such purely quantum effects, though distressing to an earlier generation of physicists, leads to possibilities for quantum logic and entirely new forms of information processing. The immunity to passive eavesdropping of information encoded in an entangled photon is being demonstrated (R.J. Hughes). Newly developed quantum optical devices that generate entangled states  now  make possible the construction of quantum gates and offer the possibility of a quantum universal Turing machine (P. Zoller). The novel aspects of quantum computing have important implications for the present day data security schemes that rely on public-key cryptography (A. Eckart).<P>
<H4>Quantum Jumps and Quantum Monte Carlo</H4>

<BR>
The bridge between the completely incoherent rate equations used by Einstein and the completely coherent time-dependent Schr&#154;dinger equation which governs isolated closed systems has traditionally been through the equations of motion for a density matrix. These equations permit the randomizing action of spontaneous emission, which the traditional Schroedinger equation does not, but they lead to practical difficulties when the very large matrices must be computed.  Within the last few years an alternative approach, involving nonlinear stochastic Schr&#154;dinger equations and random intervals as used in Monte Carlo simulations, has made possible computations that were hitherto impossible (H.J. Carmichael&#59; K. Molmer). Whereas the traditional Schr&#154;dinger equation presents a smoothly varying probability, these equations incorporate explicitly the quantum jumps first proposed by Bohr but missing for decades from actual computations.<P>
<H4>Optical and Atomic Coherence</H4>

<BR>
Although coherences based on quantum mechanics dominated the research reported at Rochester, there are still unexpected discoveries about coherences to be made within the domain of classical optics.  The connection between correlation within an optical source and the spectral properties of the distant radiation has been the subject of ongoing study (E. Wolf).<P>

By using the coherence properties of optical pulses it is possible to produce quite startling results. Appropriate counterintuitively timed pairs of pulses in a Raman transition can produce complete population transfer (K. Bergmann). Even more striking, pairs of appropriately matched pulses can permit probe pulses to propagate thousands of optical depths through resonant media (S. Harris).<P>
<H4>Other Topics and Poster Sessions</H4>

<BR>
The hundreds of poster presentations offered a snapshot of many (though by no means all) currently popular research topics relevant to coherence, to lasers, and to the exhibition of quantum effects. The stalwart two-state atom, long used with the Jaynes-Cummings model of an atom coupled to a radiation mode, now contends with the far richer world of three-state atoms and pairs of fields. There has been work also on excitons of quantum wells (Y. Yamamoto). Interest continues on weak fields in cavities and the statistical properties of various photon superposition states. Propagation of pulses, often solitons, through resonant material or matter with nonlinear response, engages attention. All of the diffractive phenomena of classical physical optics have counterparts in deBroglie waves of atoms, and advances in  experimental techniques are beginning to make these accessible.<P>
<H4>Summary</H4>

<BR>
Despite the maturation of this 35 year old conference, there is no visible decline in the robustness and vigor of the research. There is no  dearth of ideas for new directions for research, involving new and novel  concepts at the frontier where optics and quantum theory meet.<P>

The Main Lines of Action
</H2><HR>
<P><STRONG>
Jaroslav Nadrachal from Prague who chairs the EPS East-West Task Force reports that the task force met on two occasions with the<A HREF="../ene_feb96_presidents_text.html"> Presidents of physical societies from east and central Europe</A> during the EPS-10 General Conference (Seville; 9-13 September 1996). An Action Plan has been drafted and is now being discussed. While it is too early to say how it will look in its final form, the main lines of action that will be proposed are essentially agreed and can be summarised.
</STRONG>
<P>
It is proposed that the EPS <A HREF="../../dir/exg/tgew.html">East-West Task Force</A> (EWTF) consist of delegates of national societies in east and central Europe (E&amp;CE) and three members nominated by the EPS Executive Committee. Communication within the task force will mostly be via e-mail or ordinary mail, although a few personal contacts between members are envisaged. 
<P>
It is felt that one of the task force's responsibilities should be to recommend people whose participation at conferences organized by the Society could be supported by EPS grants. The most important criteria proposed for the grants are: based on a proposal which is endorsed by a National Member Society; applicants preferably less than 35 years of age; active participation at the conference (<I>e.g.</I>, an accepted contribution).
<P>
Regarding the question of E&amp;CE membership of the Boards of EPS Divisions and Interdivisional Groups, <I>etc.</I>, it is noted that active participation by people from the region is often difficult owing to financial constraints. This is the main reason for their reluctance to become Board members. The task force will recommend that EPS Divisions and Groups use their funds to support participation on Boards and suchlike.
<P>
Governments and scientific institutions in E&amp;CE formerly cooperated on a multilateral basis. This stopped after the recent political changes, so scientists and teachers from the region now in fact often find it easier to collaborate with colleagues in western Europe. There are probably few opportunities and no need to renew multilateral cooperation, but the organization of bilateral cooperation within E&amp;CE should be supported wherever a need is felt, or conditions are good. It will be suggested that the EWTF encourage these cooperation agreements, and in the event that it proposes a grant to support this type of activity, the task force will refer the proposal to the Executive Committee.
<P>
Another proposed area of action is to initiate and enhance the official basis for relations between E&amp;CE scientists and large-scale facilities in Europe. The aim will be to support special activities that move in this direction. 
<P>
Scientists from E&amp;CE travelling abroad are in some cases subject to restrictive conditions (visa requirements, limited lengths of stay, complex administrative procedures, <I>etc.</I>). These complicate efficient cooperation so it is suggested that the Society should be prepared to help by providing special guarantees. 
<P>
The task force believes that journals published by national physical societies should be offered to science libraries in E&amp;CE free-of-charge for a limited period of time, in much the same way as <I><A HREF="../../pub/index.html#epl">Europhysics Letters</A></I> has been distributed in the region. Arrangements should be based on national society recommendations, and the EPS may be asked to help cover some of the mailing expenses. 
<P>
Finally, institutes and physical societies in the west should be encouraged to disseminate information about old but usable equipment that could be made available, either free-of-charge or at a reduced price, to colleagues in E&amp;CE. <HR>

<P>
About 230 scientists from 27 countries attended the <I>13th Europhysics Sectional Conference on the Atomic and Molecular Physics of Ionized Gases (ESCAMPIG)</I> which was held in a pleasant town at the foot of the High Tatras mountains. ESCAMPIG, which focuses on the collisional and radiative aspects of atomic and molecular physics in ionized gases and plasmas, is approved by both the Atomic and Molecular Physics Division and the Plasma Physics Division of EPS.
<P>
The 13 invited talks, to be published in <I>Plasma Sources Science &amp; Technology</I>, covered the following topics: atomic and molecular processes in plasmas; particle energy distribution functions; discharge physics: sheaths, transport processes and modelling; plasma diagnostics; laser and beam assisted plasma processes; physical bases of plasma chemistry and plasma-surface interaction.
<P>
A special workshop with three invited speakers was organized under the title <I>Plasma and ecology - basic problems</I>. It was chaired by P. Luk&aacute;c from Comenius University, Bratislava, who also chaired the local organizing committee. About 250 contributions presented during the poster sessions are published in <I>Europhysics Conference Abstracts</I> <B>20E</B> (1996) in the form of two-page extended abstracts.
<P>
The next (14th) <I>ESCAMPIG</I> will be held in Malahide (near Dublin), Ireland on 25 - 28 August 1998. The local chairs will be Prof. Bill Graham, Physics Department, The Queen's University, Belfast BT7 1NN, Northern Ireland (+44-1232-438918; <a href=mailto:b.graham@qub.ac.uk>b.graham@qub.ac.uk</a>) and Dr. Mike Hopkins, Plasma Research Laboratory, School of Physical Sciences, City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland (+353-1-704-5951; <a href=mailto:hopkinsm@physics.dcu.ie>hopkinsm@physics.dcu.ie</a>).

<H2>The New Challenges for Physics and Physicists</H2>
<P><B>Herwig Schopper</B>
<P><CITE>President EPS, Geneva</CITE>
<P>
Talk presented at the Second international Conference on Research and Communications in Physics (RACIP2), Tokyo,18-22 September 1995.<HR>
<B>Changes and Challenges</B>
<P>
We are living in a world which is changing fast and physics being a part of it is also going through a rapid evolution in all its parts. New boundary conditions confront us with new challenges. One of the essential new elements is the end of the cold war between West and East which has changed the perspective of science in the minds of politicians and the public. During the cold war science and physics were seen as an essential ingredient for national security. Now major efforts in weapons development at previous levels are considered to be unnecessary and defence budgets which in some countries provided, directly or indirectly, large funds for physical and technical developments or even for fundamental physics, are being cut considerably. Changes become obvious even in countries like Germany and Japan where the funding of basic and applied research was in general not linked to defence research. Of course, in one way we should be happy about the reduction of defence spending, but on the other hand the consequences for science and technology are yet difficult to assess, a new equilibrium has to be found and in particular the role of physics in its relation to society has to be redetermined.
<P>
Certainly science and technology are recognized as an essential basis for economic competition and public welfare. If one asks politicians they will state that science and technology are very important but they will hesitate when it comes to funding questions. They are more often concerned with short term successes and the opinion, even if not always spelled out publicly, prevails that science cannot contribute to solve the burning problems of the day, e.g. unemployment or state deficits.
<P>
I am afraid in many parts of the world we are confronted even with a deeper problem. Since the Renaissance, since Descartes, Galilei and Newton, logical thinking and rationalism were viewed as the great achievements of the human spirit and the free search for truth were
<P>
considered as great values in themselves. Today we are confronted by growing and frightening anti-rationalist movements mixed with pseudoscientific beliefs. You only have to look into the newspapers where articles about astrology fill many more pages than scientific
 issues and emotional-based systems, strange sects, etc are much more in fashion than rational-based activities. Some media go as far as characterizing science as the incarnation of evil.
<P>
<B>Society Needs Science</B>
<P>
Any anti-science attitude is against the real interest of society and it is based partly on lack of information. We must therefore strengthen our efforts in explaining to society that science and technology changed the life of humanity to the better, not only with respect to material values. Only science and technology made it possible that slavery could be abandoned, life expectancy increased enormously and even democracy can only develop in societies where citizens have not to devote their whole time just to secure food and shelter. Due to the breath-taking technological development of the last 200 years a common citizen in developed counties has a better standard of living then the emperors of the holy Roman Empire or a shogun in Japan. The contributions of physics to this development were essential since apart from the direct results as inputs to new technologies, it played also a crucial role as interdisciplinary link by providing new methods of research and new experimental techniques which have influenced strongly other fields like chemistry, bio- and neuro-sciences and even parts of medicine. It had strong consequences on the way in which our way of reasoning developed. New social ideas may have been an essential ingredient for social progress but alone they certainly would not have been sufficient.
<P>
One of the main topics of this conference is communication. Communication between physicists is important, but I believe that communication with politicians and the general public is presently even more urgent, with the aim to explain that we are not lobbying for our own pleasure or benefit but that society needs science and with it physics. In doing so we must respect that most people rightly expect that the risk of scientific progress be kept small and that the antipathy of the large public against everything revolutionary new and unknown should be taken into account.
<P>
Unfortunately it is more difficult to demonstrate the usefulness of physics than that of some other scientific fields. Theology, jurisprudence, chemistry, medicine had their origins based
<P>
on immediate human needs. Physics on the other hand does not satisfy directly any requirements of society but only indirectly through technology. Everybody knows what a lawyer, a medical doctor or an engineer is doing, but what about a physicist? This lack of knowledge about physicists is partly due to the fact that there is no physics industry with the consequence that physics does often not obtain just credit for its achievements. The fact that many industries are ''physics based" (a term invented by the Institute of Physics in UK) is seldom recognized since the time it takes for a physics invention to get into the market is relatively long and requires an additional effort. Indeed to convert basic results into products requires about 10 to 15 time the effort which was needed to obtain the basic knowledge.
<P>
Nevertheless physics and technologies based thereupon will be essential to solve some of the urgent problems such as production, distribution and saving of energy, environmental issues, new materials, questions of climatic changes, communication and informatics, traffic and mobility and even health. We have to convince politicians and the public at large that society needs physics as much as physics needs society. In an ideal or at least more reasonable world it should not be the scientists who go begging for support but it should rather be to the politicians to formulate their requests to science and to provide the necessary means.
<P>
I believe we, i.e., Physical Societies, are still not doing enough to inform our fellow citizens about the important role of physics. We possibly make the mistake that we want to tell the public what we think it should know while not asking ourselves what it would perhaps like to know. Of course, these problems have to be approached in different parts of the world in specific ways but an exchange of ideas and experiences would be very useful.
<P>
<B>Public Relations with Honesty</B>
<P>
In this context the presentation of science in the media, in particular in television, deserves great attention. Meetings which had been organized by the German Physical Society and at CERN with top representatives of media were depressing since they showed how difficult it is to communicate with public. Even TV channels financed from public funds face the competition of private channels. This implies that great weight is given to the quota of viewers and since the interest for scientific programs is limited to about 6 % of spectators some predict that in several years there will practically be no scientific programs except those with animals and medicine. Special cultural channels may be installed but they will reach only a very limited number of people. Here we are faced with a difficult but enormously important task for learned Societies which will require a great effort and much patience.
<P>
We cannot put all the blame on the media which are certainly hungry for sensations instead of providing solid information. Partly it is our own fault. When popularising physics great care must be taken not to confuse the public with completely misleading or even dishonest statements. We all know examples in which scientists have contributed to create confusion, cold fusion being an outstanding case. In discussions with politicians and administrations we should remain honest. If a large project is defended by arguments like "research with particle accelerators has resulted and will result in plastics for medical use, solutions for DNA research and virus remedies7 maybe even for AIDS, soil erosion and down-water management...", we run an enormous danger of loosing all credibility. The absurdity is taken to the extreme if in some books the existence of extra-terrestials is explained in terms of particle physics string-theory (Der Stand der UFO-Forschung by 1. von Ludwiger, Zweitausendeins, 1992) or if theology is declared to be simply a sub-branch of physics which results in the explanation of immortality (The Physics of lmortality by F.J.Tipler, Doubleday, 1994). This is sheer hubris and I would even add the well-known statement of one of the most popular physicist "..for then we would know the mind of God". When misinformation of society by scientists is at stake learned societies should abandon their reservation and induce colleagues to modesty and honesty,
<P>
<B>New Challenges for Physics</B>
<P>
Not only society but physics itself is undergoing rapid changes. Breathtaking developments happened during the past decades on three main frontiers explaining the infinitely small (elementary particle and nuclear physics), studying the infinitely large (astrophysics and cosmology) and understanding the incredibly complex (atomic, solid state and plasma physics). The amalgamation of nuclear, particle and astrophysics provides completely new aspects for cosmology and is really fascinating. The idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Standard model of particle physics is the basis for the inflationary models of the universe and the structure of the vacuum provides a basis for all kinds of unification. Take the concept of renormalisation and the theory of phase transitions which provide a uniting bridge between solid state and nuclear-particle physics. It is this possibility to understand the incredible and confusing variety of phenomena on the basis of a few fundamental principles which makes physics so fascinating. The unification of physics, still imperfect and maybe never completed, provides us nevertheless with a new understanding a new "Wekbild ") of nature in which we are imbedded and contributes in a deep way to human culture.
<P>
On the other hand we are facing some problems inside physics which require new approaches. What can we do about the ever growing specialization: theory and experiment can hardly be handled anymore by one person, different fields of physics, like nuclear and subnuclear physics and the many departments of condensed matter and atomic physics, are separated when it comes to detailed questions, and instrumentation, computing and data evaluation are now special fields. We hear discussions about priorities for curiosity driven against applied research or large against small style research. How can we cope with the sociological problems in large collaborations which become necessary in ever more fields and what can we do about the isolation of individual physicists, e.g. in third world countries. What about the longer time scales of experiments or projects which are linked with the more sophisticated equipment and technologies in most parts of physics? We are faced with a number of scientific-sociological problems with centrifugal tendencies and it seems there is no easy answer to these questions. We should take them very serious and Physical Societies are challenged to contribute to the solution of these problems.
<P>
<B>Telecommunications and Electronic Publishing</B>
<P>
One of the areas where we are facing dramatic changes is scientific publications. Although this is one of the most pressing problems I shall limit myself to a few remarks since it will be dealt with at other occasions in this conference.
<P>
Some predict that in a few years most of the publishing will be done electronically, e.g. via Internet or WWW. This will revolutionize scientific communication creating completely new means of interactions between scientists. A number of problems have to be faced, however: standardisation, refereeing, access to data, commercial conditions, private or public organizations, archiving, etc. This is an exciting challenge for Physical Societies. They could be a neutral catalyst between  he different parties, the author, reader, libraries and publishers. I am somewhat worried that the introduction of different systems is being considered in different parts of the world. I hope that this conference could exert a strong pressure on introducing world-wide standards for telecommuncation since otherwise the dissemination of knowledge would be impeded. EPS is actively getting involved in these questions, in particular as far as electronic publishing is concerned.
<P>
Let me point in addition to one difficulty which does not get appropriate attention, the participation of the poorer counties. With delayed or nonexistent circulation of scientific
<P>
journals in developing counties, electronic communication can be a vital link in maintaining contact with peers, exchanging data sets and accessing the services of remote computers. A panel commissioned by Director General Federico Mayor of UNESCO suggested that scientists in all countries get full access to Internet at the lowest possible rates and encouraged a rapid shift to electronic publication of scientific research. It would be wonderful if such suggestions could be realized. Reality is sometimes quite sobering, however. A lesson can be learned from paper journals where sometimes the financial problems for the distribution cost are heavier then for subscribing to the journals. All efforts to obtain special PTT rates for scientific publications failed. What will happen if one day commercial rates will have to be payed for Internet lines? At present Internet leased lines are still relatively cheap, but some developing countries cannot afford them. Who will provide the necessary means in the future after commercialization has occurred and who will help to establish the whole infrastructure? But the problem is not only of financial nature. Training will be necessary, language problems and institutional difficulties will have to be overcome. If this help to developing countries cannot be provided there is danger that Internet might create two classes, the haves and the have-nots, where "have" means Internet access.
<P>
Access to telecommunication and electronic publishing should not be left to the market forces but they need high priority attention of learned societies, both in industrialized and developing countries.
<P>
<B>Jobs for Young Physicists</B>
<P>
Another area where the conditions have been changing rapidly is the job market for young physicists. This I consider as a most serious issue since physics would suffer even more from the absence of enthusiastic and gifted young scientists than from the limitations of funds. The chances for a physicist to find a job are quite different in various parts of the world and therefore this problem needs a differentiated consideration.
<P>
If I take the situation in Europe one must say that the golden times when practically all physicists found jobs without too much difficulty have gone. Most forecasts show the situation will not change in the near future, mainly because of the structural changes in industry where laboratory work is often replaced by software simulations. To improve the chances of physicists in the competition for jobs in industry or other professions it will be necessary to change the education at universities. The majority of students will not remain in research, be it academic or industrial, but will go to other professions. This is good since physicists have learnt besides physics itself many other things (e.g. how to tackle complex problems, model building, finding general principles underlying the phenomena) which can be extremely useful in other scientific or non-scientific professions, even in management and
<P>
politics. Because of this circumstance students will expect not only to get a good scientific education but they win require a formation of general human capabilities like leadership, working in teams or adjust themselves in an international environment. But they will also look for advice as to what the job situation is in different "markets".
<P>
Particularly in view of the large mobility of physicists across frontiers and to-day even from continent to continent statistical material about where jobs for physicists are and what their evolution will likely be would be very interesting for young physicists. Here is an extremely important role for learnt societies to provide the necessary material since a review of the world situation or even the European situation is still missing.
<P>
<B>Teaching of Physics</B>
<P>
I am sure we all agree that teaching of physics at all levels is an outstanding task for various reasons. Let me mention only two: i) Without good teaching there will be no bright, well trained young scientists who will "carry on the flag". ii) In the long run fundamental improvements in the relation between the public and science/technology including the suppression of some deep rooted misperceptions can only be achieved by a better education in natural sciences starting already at school. It is not sufficient to care only about the education of future physicists but it is essential to give the non-physicists ho might never again during their lives be exposed to scientific arguments already at school a better understanding of the method, results and future role of sciences. They should get a feeling of scientific rational arguing, of the beauty of understanding nature and at least of the principles underlying the technologies which determine largely our daily life. If an educated citizen does not understand in principle how his TV set functions a new kind of superstition will result. The lack of understanding the principles of technologies will determine the long-term tendencies and acceptance for technologies and it is there where teachers have to fulfil a crucial task. Learned societies should use all their influence to see that curricula at schools are in line with such needs and they can also help to improve the qualification and training of teachers at all levels.
<P>

<B>Financial Implications and Priorities</B>
<P>
Unfortunately many countries experience at present serious economic difficulties and therefore science in general and physics in particular are confronted with serious problems. The situation might still be different in some counties in the Far East where economy is growing fast. But in general we are confronted with a zero-sum game and consequently it will not be possible to realize all plans which are justified from a scientific point of view. Priorities will have to be set. difficult choices will have to be made and time scales might have to be stretched.
<P>
In the past is was often possible to present programs which contained all projects which were scientifically justified. In future it is certain that even some good projects will not obtain funds. In order to maintain a strong and vital physics research under these new boundary conditions it seems necessary that physicists themselves will have to agree on priorities and put forward integrated complementary programs. If this cannot be achieved the decisions on priorities will be taken at some administrative level with much less scientific competence. Learned societies should at least make an effort that the scientific community is involved in deliberations at the governmental level.
<P>
<B>Research in Industry</B>
<P>
Reduction or at least stagnation of funds does not only concern government funded research. I have the impression that also the reaction of industry to new challenges is often not
<P>
adequate. It may be understandable that in times of economic recession and under the pressure of short-term optimization large companies have to economize hitting also their R+D activities. Industrial developments, in particular in electrical and optical engineering, communication, air traffic and space activities, material science, medical diagnosis etc are mainly based on discoveries of basic physics research. Present-day technologies will sooner or later achieve a certain maturity, their economic exploitation will cease and hence new basic ideas originating from curiosity driven research will be needed. Hence in the long run it will be to the detriment of companies if they support only development which is directly coupled to new products or close to the market. They need in-house research if for nothing else as to be able to profit from technology transfer. I am convinced that the time will come when great effort will have be made to revive and re-establish industrial research activities in order to be competitive. The Japanese government has recognized this need and is increasing the support for inventive research, in particular at universities. 
<P>
<B>International Cooperation</B>
<P>
International cooperation has been an integral element of physics since a long time. Physics is particularly suited to foster international cooperation not only because the laws of natureare everywhere the same but also because it needs sometimes large facili ties which cannot be realized by a country or even a continent. Indeed physics has been spearheading international cooperation independent of the sometimes rapidly changing political climate at a given time.
<P>
Today international cooperation is more necessary then ever for different reasons:
<P>
1. In spite of the economic competition international cooperation is needed even in applied research since with common efforts total progress which is needed to overcome some of the major problems of mankind, will be sped up. Some activities request international collaboration by their intrinsic conditions, like the investigation of climatic changes, oceanography or earth sciences. Some other activities are simply too expensive to be realized and exploited by one large country or region, e.g. the fusion device ITER, the space station, the LHC project at CERN or future large accelerators.
<P>
2. East-West cooperation which has found considerable attention after the end of the cold war remains an important field of activities even after having gone through some disappointing phases.
<P>
3. North-South cooperation, not only with poor countries but also with evolving countries, e.g. the little tigers and China in the Far East or the Latin American countries, will become increasingly important. New countries are appearing in scientific cooperations.
<P>
4. Local conflicts are increasing at a frightening rate and one notices sometimes a sad backlash as far as tolerance and mutual understanding are concerned. I know of some physicists who
 a short time ago were friends and now do not speak to each other anymore.
<P>
Physics has a long tradition in pioneering international cooperation and has in many respects broken ground for other sciences and even politics. I cannot avoid mentioning CERN as an outstanding example which was founded after the last world war, not only to promote science but also with the aim to bring together European states. It has soon transgressed the limits of Europe and now about 6000 physicists from 73 countries work there peacefully together. I am particularly happy that Japan, by its decision to join the LHC project at CERN, has given an example for a new style of worldwide cooperation worthy of imitation.
<P>
International cooperation in physics has promoted in many ways the mutual understanding among people of different nations, cultures, political systems, race and religion and has thus contributed to the creation of confidence which is the basis for peaceful coexistence. This alone justifies the financial effort society is making for our field. To promote international cooperation for the benefit of science and better human relations remains a noble task for the future.
<P>
<B>EPS Activities</B>
<P>
Let me finally make a few remarks about the tasks and challenges which EPS is confronted with and about the activities we undertook to meet them. Of course, the situation in Europe is very peculiar, specially after the changes in Eastern Europe, but nevertheless some of our experiences could be useful for other regions of the world where counties with different cultures, languages and history have to work together. The 36 member societies of EPS range geographically from the Atlantic to the Ural, from the Mediterranian to the Arctic Sea and comprise small and big counties representing about 70000 physicists.
<P>
In the past EPS was a had of federation of national societies which in essence it still is. However. in order to strengthen it and increase its efficiency in actions a revision of its Constitution was recently adopted by the EPS Council which gives the possibility to all members of the National Societies to participate in all EPS-activities, whereas in the past some activities were reserved to Individual Ordinary Members. Now a new kind of membership was created, the National Society Member Category, which will enable in future all members of national societies to participate in divisional activities. I hope that this will give rise to an intensification of the activities of Divisions and their Section which are an essential part of the scientific activities of EPS. There are in total 21 Divisions and Sections, ranging from astrophysics. condensed matter, high energy and particle physics to history of physics.
<P>
It cannot be the purpose of this talk to review the traditional activities of EPS and I want to mention only some activities which I consider particularly important.
<P>
The EPS has paid great attention already in the past to improve the relations between academic research and activities in industry. The main instrument for this purpose is the recently created Interdivisional Group for Applied Physics and Physics in Industry. This Group has discussed at its regular meetings measures to improve the cooperation between university research and R+D in industry. It is organizing a series of Europhysics Industrial Workshops which ranged from Synchrotron Radiation for industrial research to ion-beam assisted deposition. Also the Interdivisional Group on Accelerators fosters the cooperation between basic and applied work. It organizes biannial conferences. The last two attracted more than 700 participants and the number of abstracts exceeded 1000. One of the objectives is to facilitate the use of accelerators and storage rings in industry and medicine. Synchrotron light sources which are an excellent example of an important spin-off from basic research remain a major theme. They profit not only from the original development of storage rings for elementary particle physics but the continuing accelerator development in many laboratories is essential for the performance of third generation light sources with their enormous brilliance. Accelerators for heavy particles with high beam intensities show a growing interest for applications in material testing or medical treatment. They point even to futuristic applications like the treatment of radioactive waste by high-intensity beams.
<P>
The construction of accelerators and storage rings for applied work are finding an increasing interest in developing countries in particular in the Far East and Latin America. EPS would
 be willing to make available any help or information asked for. Our experience in a multinational environment could be quite useful for other countries.
<P>
I mentioned the important problem of physics teaching. An Interdivisional Group for Physics Education has been created in 1993 with the objective to promote and improve the quality of physics teaching throughout Europe, the qualification and training of teachers at all levels and the coherence of curricula. Within this Interdivisional Group a Forum on Education has been set-up which will devote itself in particular to pre-university teaching and will make an effort to disseminate the experience made in one country to others, to establish better contacts between teachers and research and to take some influence on curricula. Inquiries have shown that there is a considerable interest in the Member States, both in Eastern and Western Europe, in working for the aims of the Forum. Hence I hope the Forum will be very active in the coming years.
<P>
One of the main concerns of EPS has been the help to Eastern and Central European countries. These EPS activities have gone through a certain evolution characterized both by success and disappointment. As a first step an East-West Task Force for Central Europe was established, later transformed into a East West Coordination Committee EWCC, which extended its activities to the counties of the former Soviet Union. At present we are reviewing the objectives and the organization of this committee to adapt our help to the evolving needs and to make it more efficient. Experience has shown that there is no specific "ideal" model which could generally be applied. One has to do with different national systems and one has to look for different frameworks to organize support. Some very successful programs could be realized by EPS.
<P>
One of them is the "Journals for the former Soviet Union" program which was initiated since in the Eastern countries exists a lack of Western journals. Subscriptions for 1994/95 of about 20 different journals were provided to 9 states for a cost of about 600.000 ECU financed by INTAS (International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union). The publishers supported this scheme by agreeing to price reductions of 50 % and more. The hope is that this programme can be continued and extended to other countries but to find the necessary funds seems not so easy.
<P>
One of the most successful activities of EPS is the European Mobility Scheme for Physics Students which was created in 1992 and is handled in a simple and flexible way. Although mainly financed by the EU programs (ERASMUS for EFTA countries and TEMPUS for east and central Europe) it is a genuine program of EPS which also makes financial contributions from its own budget and receives some funds from other sources (Soros Foundation). All universities in Europe that grant a degree in physics can adhere to this scheme. It aims to allow physics students to spend a period of study in another university and to ensure that this period will be recognized academically when the student returns to his home institution (this is not the case for the exchanges handled only by ERASMUS and TEMPUS). The exchange is mainly intended for undergraduate studies but mobility periods for more advanced studies are also possible. One of the main administrative tools is a publicly accessible database which contains extensive and up-to-date information about the universities and their curricula. This database might be useful also for other purposes. In the academic year 1994/95 232 students take part. An assessment of the program was made by sending questionnaires to the universities and the students who participated in the first year.
<P>
The outcome was very satisfactory with more than 80 % of the universities and students giving positive answers to the various questions. The hope is to continue this program, although the final decision on the SOCRATES program which will follow ERASMUS after 1995 has not yet been made.
<P>
I mentioned a few activities in which EPS has contributed to promote international cooperation in Europe, in particular in central and east Europe. These activities obtain priority since they satisfy needs of Member Societies. The promotion of the collaboration with evolving countries is, however, not forgotten. It is taken care of by the Interdivisional Group on Physics for Development. This Committee is organizing for example the Southern European School in cooperation with UNESCO and the EU. My hope is that we might get some new inputs from this conference to intensify our efforts in this respect.
<P>
The role of EPS is becoming more important also in a world wide context. Of course, many bilateral contacts exist between European National Physical Societies on one side and physical societies in other continents on the other side. However, in dealing with global problems it might be more efficient to deal with one European representative instead with a large number of national societies and indeed this is happening in some cases as in the UNESCO Physics Action Council.
<P>
Physical Societies cannot do many things themselves, e.g. research, but they can help to provide the necessary conditions for successful work. For science to flourish it needs reliable and foreseeable conditions. Hence it is one of our most important tasks to convince the public and the politicians in this respect. With the other examples given I wanted to show what learned societies could and should do, activities which go much beyond those of their traditional tasks. As in the past Physical Societies will continue to promote research and teaching in their field. but I think in the future they have an even more important task, i.e., to be an interface between science and society, at a time when a new basis for the relations between science and society has to be determined.

<strong>Upgraditis</strong>
</font>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size=-1>January 17, 1997</font><br>

<p>

<font face="Times">

"<a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a> giveth and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> taketh away." This formula
has served each side
well. In fact it has worked so well that it has created the industry's most
feared
duopoly: "Wintel." <P>

This is how it works: Approximately every 18 months, Intel, in keeping with
Moore's
Law, creates a market for faster chips, bigger hard drives, increased
memory. And Microsoft comes along and ships "bloatware" that uses it all
up--well most of it, anyway. <p>

<img height=82 width=138 border=0 src="/Images/Perspectives/Stories/01_97/per_giveth.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>
The end result is "upgraditis," the biannual ritual that drives
users--voluntarily or otherwise--to throw away their old wares and get
new stuff. Who wins? Compare the earnings reports of Microsoft-Intel and
the expense reports (new wares plus maintenance costs) of corporations and
you'll get the idea. <p>
 
This week's launch of <a
href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,7061,00.html">Office 97</a> is the
latest case in point.  It is here.
And as far as Microsoft is concerned users had better  prepare to adopt it.
Resistance will be futile. <p> 


Office will run on 486 PCs, so says Microsoft, but you will need Windows 95
or Windows NT, because it wont run on the older version of Windows. And
Microsoft just didn't decide on this on its own. It checked in with
customers. Honest.<p>

<img height=104 width=161 border=0 src="/Images/Perspectives/Stories/01_97/per_centerpiece.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
"Our investment in understanding the needs of customers and our continued
ability to deliver exciting enhancements are the cornerstone of Office's
ongoing success," said <a
href="http://www.news.com/Newsmakers/Gates/gates.html">Bill Gates</a> at
the launch event. "Customers will be
very pleased with the Internet integration, the new collaboration
capabilities of Outlook 97, and the IntelliSense technology featured in the
Office Assistant." <p>

What is not clear is if this "understanding" of the customers' needs
applied to the millions of Windows 3.1 users (some two-thirds of corporate PCs
still run on Win 3.1). If these users want to tap into the "exciting
enhancements" they have no choice but to upgrade. And not just to Office
97, but also to Windows 95 or NT. Now you understand why Microsoft is such a
brilliant marketer. <p>

<strong><a href="/Perspectives/Soapbox/nn1_3_97a.html">Government and the
Internet</strong></a>
<br>
Give me Bill Gates, his pretzel logic, and never-stop-swimming shark-like
business acumen to <i>any</i> government program any day, any time. Mr.
Newman proposes stronger Internet regulation by the same government that is
still fighting tooth and nail to preserve what it feels is its "right" to
monitor our digital transmissions.
<br>
The Internet has become commercially viable and <i>no</i> government
intervention is required.

Predictions</strong></a>
<br>
You didn't mention anything about high bandwidth. Will cable modems catch
on or will ASDL or XSDL technologies or 56-kbps modems be the winners?
Personally, I feel 56-kbps will dominate and ISDN will go the way of
5.25-inch floppies. I hope cable modems will also make an impact.

The highlight of my dead-tree reading this weekend was <i>
Time</i> magazine's cover story on 
Bill Gates. Between bites of Indian food and visits to Gates's $40 million 
Xanadu on Lake Washington, Walter Isaacson, Time's managing editor and occasional 
writer, gets about as close to The Bill as Bill will let him get. (January 13)

When it comes to tips, email is great. But nobody, not even a barber, beats a 
cabbie when it comes to handing down the 411. Anything you'd want to know can 
be found out by riding in a cab. The sleaziest bars, the finest restaurants, 
intrigue at City Hall, who's on strike--just ask a hack. But this week, I found 
myself giving instead of receiving, as the cabbie taking me to the 
Macworld Expo asked me for investment advice on Apple. "Buy now, sell 
later," I muttered and pulled my fedora down over my eyebrows. (January 10)

SAN FRANCISCO--Comdex may have 
Elvis and

Einstein impersonators, but, at Macworld this week, 

Apple didn't skimp on phony-baloney dead

celebs. The Mac-heads cranked out enough star power to light a small galaxy.

Too bad when Monday comes around everyone will have forgotten the Macworld

glitz, and Apple will have to get down to the dirty work of smacking its OS into

shape by the end of the year.

Whenever I'm tired of high-tech industry hype, I perk myself up with a
little light reading like a public company's 10-Q report. Often these
documents
are brutally honest. It's where a company lays its warts, wounds, and
worries out for all of its shareholders to examine.
This weekend, I amused myself by reading Apple's 10-Q, the one that got so much 
ink last week for
detailing the rivers of blood running from the company's coffers.

If there was a day when one could drink a steaming hot cup of coffee and

I'd come to think of my local coffee shop as the last refuge from
technology. Forget it.

I can't wait to get out of this damn penguin suit and back into my trusty
fedora. With New Year's parties coming up, I've spent the day being fitted
for a tuxedo, which of course makes me look even more like a secret agent.
The name's Dubaud, Skinny Dubaud. Shaken, not stirred. Hey, I'm beginning

	<font face="Arial", "Helvetica" size="+2"><strong>Welcome to NEWS.COM
</strong></font><br>
	<font face="Times">NEWS.COM is the technology news service from CNET: The Computer Network.
Throughout the day, NEWS.COM delivers more original technology news on the
Web than anyone else. All bylined news stories are written by the
NEWS.COM staff.<P>

You can use the navigation bar at the left-hand side of every page to move
around the site or visit other CNET sites.<P>

NEWS.COM is updated at least three times a day - in the morning, midday,
and late
afternoon.  Breaking stories are posted throughout the day.<P>

Top stories appear on the <A HREF="http://www.news.com/">Front Page</A>,
and additional breaking news appears in The Net, Computing, Intranets,
Business, Perspectives, CNET Radio, and Rumor Mill.<P>

In addition to top news stories, NEWS.COM also
links to important stories on CNET.COM and other news sites from around the
Web.<P>

You can't copy NEWS.COM stories to your Web page, but you can link to them.<P>

Tip: Are you seeing old pages on NEWS.COM even when you refresh the page?  If
you're using a company network, your proxy server may be caching the page.
Many proxy servers will bypass the cache and send you a fresh page if you
register as a NEWS.COM user.  Why does this happen? NEWS.COM will send a
code to your browser that identifies you uniquely.<P>

If you have any questions about the site, send email to <A

AOL's misery is turning into others' potential profits.
<p>
Class-action attorneys continue to descend upon a troubled <a
href="http://www.aol.com/">America Online</a> <a
href="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?source=blq/cnet&ticker=AOL">
(AOL)</a>; at least two more suits were filed today in Seattle and Detroit.
Meanwhile, other Internet service providers are taking advantage of the online king's crisis, inviting disgruntled AOL members to quit and sign up with them.
<p>
<a href="/Polling/Entry/0,11,69,00.html"><img border=0 align=right width=100 height=160 src="/Images/Netnews/1_97/aol_pollpromo.gif" hspace=5 vspace=5></a>
It's not like ISPs haven't done this before. Many have made cottage industries out of luring frustrated AOL members to their services, promising easy access, personalized customer service, and speedy Web access--all traditional rough spots for AOL.
<p>
Many are issuing press releases and calling members of the media in light of AOL's recent crisis to remind Netizens that AOL is not the only option out there. In fact, there are thousands of other ISPs from which to choose and several specialize in catering to beginners, the same group on which AOL focuses its marketing efforts.
<p> 
For instance: PerfectData announced today that it is launching a cheap ISP for $8.30 a month. "AOL customers can use the PerfectData service and select the AOL "Bring Your Own Access'' &#91;rate of $9.95/month&#93: and have unlimited access
to AOL for $18.25/month," the release says.
<p>
Attorneys also are lining up to file class action suits--which
can be extremely lucrative for lawyers even if they don't net large rewards per plaintiff. 
<p>
Two more suits  were  filed in Detroit and Seattle on behalf of angry AOL members, accusing the online company knowingly offering services it couldn't deliver--namely, online access.
<p>
Three similar suits have been filed in New York state, Los
Angeles and in Illinois--all in one week. 
<p>
Don't expect it to stop there.
<p>
Technology companies become targets for such suits when they disappoint investors with sagging stock prices. But as these companies become more mainstream, they are being targeted for disappointing consumers as well.
<p> 
There's a whole category of entrepreneurial lawyers who routinely file class-action suits against companies that look like ripe targets, said Jan Vetter, a law professor at Boalt Law School at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California
at Berkeley</a>.
<p>

Why? Lucrative fees that typically amount to 25 to 30 percent of the total settlement in class-action suits, according to Vetter. That could mean millions and millions of dollars, and lots of attorneys competing for a piece of the pie.
<p>
But with all the attorneys jumping into the frenzy, it's unclear how the pie
would get divvied up--if at all. That remains to be decided by the courts. The process promises to be cumbersome and messy, Vetter said.
<p>
AOL is no stranger to class-action suits. In fact, the company is still ironing out the details of a lawsuit that accused AOL of overcharging users and fighting another suit that alleged the way it instituted a new pricing plan was deceptive.
<p>
But the cases this week represent an issue that has the whole AOL community tied up. 
<p> 
Many AOL subscribers have been getting busy signals since AOL introduced an unlimited usage plan in December. Members who signed up for the new unlimited plan pay $19.95 a month for the right to log on AOL and stay on
as long as they want--that is, if they can get online to begin with.
<p>
Yesterday President and CEO Steve Case sent a long letter to members apologizing for the bad service, telling them the steps AOL was taking to improve service and once again asking them to limit their online time to off-peak hours.
<p>
AOL's image problem was compounded by an internal partial outage Wednesday afternoon.  AOL suffered the outage when technical problems shut down half of its system from 12:45 p.m. PT until about 4:30 p.m. PT. The problem involved a router device that manages the flow of data in a network, the company said.
<p>
"The system was able to accommodate 124,000 subscribers," an AOL spokeswoman
said. Normally, AOL can accommodate about 258,000 of its 7 million
subscribers simultaneously.
<p>
The spokeswoman said the outage was in no way related to skyrocketing member usage that has resulted from AOL's December price shift.
<p>
While AOL says most users are staying online only about ten minutes longer per session than they used to, many are being confronted with continual busy signals when they try to dial into the service, especially during peak hours.
<p>
AOL is working as fast as it can to increase its number of modems, the access point for dial-up users, according to David Gang, vice president of
product marketing. 
<p>
AOL will end up spending $350 million now through June to boost the network,
a plan that includes adding 30,000 modems a month. The goal, is to allow
400,000 of AOL's 8 million customers to log on at once: the system would
allow 350,000 dial-up users and another 50,000 people who log onto AOL from
another ISP.
<p>
But AOL's assurances that things will get better aren't pacifying
all its users.
<p>
On Monday, suits were filed in New York State Supreme Court and at the Superior Court of the state of California. The Los Angeles suit seeks damages, claiming America Online acted with "malice" and "fraud"--in violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act--by not putting enough hardware in place to handle the additional traffic before it
implemented the new pricing plan.
<p>
A similar suit also has been filed in Illinois.
<p>
News of the suits surfaced only one day after AOL was in court trying to
close another suit that alleged that AOL had overcharged its members. 
<p>
AOL settled the case when it agreed in September to give all AOL members one
free hour of service and to give members who had spent at least $300 on the
service an extra hour for every $300. AOL distributed the free hours before
its new pricing took effect, according to the company. 
<p> 
AOL had also agreed to pay members who had left the service the equivalent
of the hourly fee--$2.95--for every $300 they had spent on AOL. Those
members had until November 30 to file claims with AOL.
<p>
AOL had set aside $500,000 to pay those claims and $2.75 million to pay its
opponents' attorneys. Yesterday a judge agreed to transfer $300,000 of the
money slated for attorneys fees to the fund for heavy users.
<p>
If any money is left over from the fund, AOL has said it will donate it to
charity. San Francisco Superior Court Judge James Robertson said he would
oversee the distribution of the funds.
<p>
Monday AOL filed a motion to dismiss yet another suit filed by Stephen
DiLorenzo in New York Supreme Court. The user said AOL switched subscribers
from their $9.95 per month pricing plan the $19.95 unlimited access plan
without giving them fair notice.
<p> 
AOL also came under fire for that pricing plan from 19 attorneys general. It
settled the case with those states, agreeing to go back and offer the new
plan as an option to as many members as possible.

A surprising new study at the <a href="http://www.csun.edu/">California State University at Northridge</a> shows that students learning in a virtual classroom tested 20 percent better across the board than their counterparts who learned in a traditional classroom.
<p>
In his applied statistics course last year, Jerald Schutte, a professor at Northridge, randomly selected half of his students to be taught through traditional in-class lectures and pen-and-paper homework assignments while the rest learned through text posted online, email and newsgroups, real-time chat with their classmates, and electronic homework assignments.
<p>
The students in the virtual-learning group were given two in-class lectures to explain the technology they would be using
and then came to class again only for the midterm and the final exam.
<p>
There were no statistically significant differences between the sex, age, computer experience, or attitude toward the subject material of the two groups, Schutte said. Both were given identical tests that they took under the same conditions.
<p>
The results of the groundbreaking <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~hflrc007/wcp/">study</a>, obtained by CNET this evening, provide the first quantitative data to be collected on virtual education--a field that until now has largely subsisted on anecdotal data, despite huge amounts of money that universities are spending to establish themselves as leaders in online education.
<p>
Schutte said the unexpected results of the research can be explained by the online collaboration created in the virtual classroom.
<p>
"The students formed peer groups online as compensation for not having time in class to talk," he said. "I believe that as much of the results can be explained by collaboration as the technology."
<p>
In traditional educational theory, a professor is thought of as the mediator, the figure who encourages collaboration. Most people believe that this is the only way to learn, he said.
<p>
"But in fact there is a very subtle thing going on here. A classroom can be inhibiting, intimidating. &#91;In the classroom&#93; you think you are the only person who doesn't know the answer, so you don't talk. The very way classrooms are set up, with everyone facing forward, deters interaction."
<p>
In fact, according to the study, students in the virtual class spent about 50 percent more time working with each other than the people in the traditional classroom. And while the report acknowledges that the inability to talk to the professor was the cause of this interaction, the results show that the collaboration "manifests itself in better test score" as students formed study groups to "pick up the slack of not having a real classroom."
<p>
Other educational studies have discovered similar benefits to online student collaboration. 
<p>
"It is an effort to engage," said Jeff Stanzler, who directs a <a href="http://ics.soe.umich.edu/">University of Michigan program</a> that encourages high school students to share their poetry online. "Students need to have a certain mindset. This different than regular lessons and schools. They are encouraged to respond and work together and put those demands a little more front and center than they can in a classroom."
<p>
Online teaching won't solve all educational problems, however. Although the results of his study support much of the hype surrounding its future, Schutte points out that virtual learning may have its limits.
<p>
"You must distinguish between the form and the content," he said.  Virtual learning "may only be useful in the abstract, only for certain kinds of classes," he added.
<p>
For subjects where real-time interpersonal communication is required, such as philosophy and ethics, computer-mediated communications such as videoconferencing and supplemental online texts may be the answer.
<p>
This semester, Schutte plans further study with a sociology methods class. In an effort to discover whether the high levels of collaboration were a result of the particular group of students in the virtual class or the virtual experience itself, he will try single-subject replications.
<p>
That means that students will learn some modules in the classroom and some online. Schutte will test them after each module to see if performance levels are different.

Two Java vendors, <a href="http://www.dimensionx.com/">Dimension X</a> and
<a href="http://www.marimba.com/">Marimba</a>, will partner Monday to make it easier to design "pushed" Internet information.
<p> 
The companies plan to announce that Marimba will incorporate Dimension X's Liquid Motion Pro, a multimedia authoring tool, with its own Bongo development environment, Dimension X CEO Karl Jacob said.
<p>
The union of the two technologies could make it easier for artists and designers to create "channels" for Marimba's Castanet, a system for broadcasting information, such as news headlines and stock quotes, as well as software, to users' desktops on the Internet. 
<p> 
The deal is an important distribution deal for Dimension X's Liquid Motion Pro tool, which generates Java multimedia animations. But the pact could also help spawning more Castanet channels, a critical factor in raising the profile of Marimba's broadcasting among corporations and consumers. <a href="http://www.pointcast.com/">PointCast</a>, which pioneered the method of pushing--or automatically transmitting--information over the Net, has far more channels on its system. 
<p> 
Currently, Marimba's Bongo development environment allows developers to build user interfaces for an application easily, but it still requires Java programming skills to create multimedia content. In contrast, Liquid Motion Pro is a point-and-click tool that requires little or no programming experience, making it better suited for non-technical users. Bundled together, the tools will allow developers to publish a Castanet channel without doing any Java coding.
<p> 
"You can do the user interface in Bongo &#91;for applications&#93;, but you still have to do a lot of Java programming," Jacob said. "With Liquid Motion Pro, it's a point-and-click deal. Bongo doesn't really have any multimedia capabilities. It wasn't designed for that."
<p> 
Liquid Motion isn't the only multimedia authoring tool for creating Castanet channels though. <a
href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</a> has announced that developers can do the same with its Director tool, though Macromedia's tool requires additional programming when used with
Castanet.

If you're reading this now, then you can attend the presidential inauguration.
<p>
William
Jefferson Clinton's solemn oath will be carried live Monday on the Net courtesy of <a
href="http://www.sun.com">Sun
Microsystems</a><a
href="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?source=blq/cnet&ticker=SUNW"
>(SUNW)</a>, which is supplying the expertise, the servers and the Java software
for the <a href="http://www.inaugural97.org/">Inaugural Web Site</a>.
<p>
And that's just the beginning of what promises to be the highest-tech
Presidential nomination ever. If you happen to be in Washington, you can go to a
special tent on the mall and send email to the president or chat with other
Netizens about the inauguration via <a href="http://www.thepalace.com/">The
Palace</a>. The inaugural site also will feature what it's calling a
"Web-U-Mentary" featuring hourly updates of photos, footage and events from
D.C.
<p> 
The Inaugural site and accompanying events join a whole host of other major
events this year as an Internet first. The Internet is increasingly being
used as an alternative to television when it comes to live events, making
events available to anyone anywhere in the world with a computer, a modem
and Net access.
<p>
The inauguration also provides more evidence that the Net is being
increasingly used as a political vehicle. In fact, so many people logged
into the Internet last election day that many Web sites reported record-breaking traffic.
<p>
Officials running the Inauguration site expect 5,000 simultaneous audio and
video feeds.
<p>
The Webcast will broadcast live the swearing-in ceremony beginning at 11:30
a.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday January 20th from the West Front of the
U.S Capitol.
<p>
"The Internet has already proved an effective tool in making government more
accessible to people," wrote Anil Gadre, vice president of worldwide
marketing for Sun. "This is another great example of its power in bringing
citizens closer to the events which have an impact on their lives."
<p>
The real-time streaming technologies, developed by Graham Technology
Solutions, require no plug-ins and nothing on the client side other than
browser software.
<p>
Other technology companies also are using the inauguration to show off their
goods. For instance: <a href="http://www.digev.com">Digital Evolution</a>
will produce the Technology Playground-- a multimedia center on the
National--in Washington on Saturday and Sunday.
<p>
The exhibit will be housed in a 213-by-118-foot inflatable tent and will
include interactive exhibits and future technology demonstrations. Speakers
will also discuss their visions of how technology will enhance our lives in
the next millennium.
<p>
It also will allow people on- and off-site to send their personal messages and hopes and dreams for the future to President Clinton, Vice President Gore
and their families. Those messages will be displayed in a three-dimensional
interactive display. And users in the tent will be able to chat with
Netizens at The Palace.

The fourth quarter's sales results are in, and <a href="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</a> <a href="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?source=blq/cnet&ticker=CPQ">(CPQ)</a> is the number-one personal computer vendor, according to <a href="http://www.ci.zd.com/">Computer Intelligence</a> (CI), a computer and communications industry market research firm.
<P>
Without any significant new technology to draw consumers to stores, PC sales in the retail sector were not as strong as vendors had hoped. CI's survey shows, however, that corporate demand as well as second-time buyers helped total PC sales to reach 7.7 million units, a 15 percent increase over the same period in 1995. 
<P>
"PC makers who focused solely on the consumer market for the fourth quarter missed one of  the strongest growth segments of the year. The highest growth and strongest profits are now clearly in the corporate market," said Matt Sargent, senior analyst with CI, in a written statement.
<p>
<img border=0 height=206 width=310 src="/Images/Pcnews/1_97/top10pc.gif">
<p>
In both consumer and commercial markets, Compaq is the number-one PC vendor with a 14 percent market share. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> <a href="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?source=blq/cnet&ticker=IBM">(IBM)</a> placed second with a 9.6 percent market share on the strength of sales to large corporations, CI said. <a href="http://www.packardbell.com/">Packard Bell</a> was third with an 8.5 percent market share. 
<P>
Compaq strengthened its number-one position in the consumer market relative to Packard Bell, posting a 21 percent gain in market share over the same period a year ago, and now commands 23 percent of the retail market. Packard Bell's market share declined by 40 percent to 18 percent of the retail market, according to the survey.
<P>
It was in July of 1996 that Compaq first overtook Packard Bell as the top vendor in the overall retail market, which includes purchases at the PC superstores, consumer electronic stores, and office superstores where Packard Bell once ruled. At the time, CI's Sargent said that second-time buyers were driving purchases in the retail channel, and the most recent survey restated those opinions.
<P>
The only company to lose more market share than Packard Bell in the retail channel was <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> <a href="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?source=blq/cnet&ticker=AAPL">(AAPL)</a>. Sales of its Performa models slumped, and the company saw its share of the retail channel decline by 59 percent over the same period in 1995.
<P>
<a href="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba</a> made the largest strides in the retail channel, posting a 114 percent gain over last year's results. Toshiba now has an 18 percent market share in the retail sector and could overtake Packard Bell soon.
<P>
Toshiba's gains were due to the popularity the Infinia line of home computers that were introduced in the fall of 1996. The Infinias strongly diverge from the boxy design of most computers and have features such as a push-button panel with an LCD screen for displaying command options for using the built-in TV.  Another consumer convergence technology included is a built-in radio.
<P>
In the commercial sector, CI says that the migration to Windows NT helped drive sales, with small and medium-sized businesses (those with less than 500 employees) spurring sales early in the fourth quarter. Large firms with more than 500 employees tended to do their purchasing late in the quarter, the report said.
<P>
As measured in the dealer channel, which serves the commercial market, Compaq maintained its number-one position, posting 63 percent growth over last year, but its lead over IBM was actually trimmed somewhat. While Compaq now has 35 percent market share in the dealer channel, IBM has 29 percent, up from 19 percent a year ago.<P>

Web sites are targeting bookworms as evidenced by two upcoming online page turners.<p>

<a href="http://www.msn.com/">Microsoft Network</a> is giving subscribers rock 'n' roll in its deal to seize a piece of the online entertainment market. On Monday, MSN's <a href="http://musiccentral.msn.com/">Music Central</a> will launch an online serialization of Fred Goodman's book <i>The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen, and the Head-On Collision of Rock and Commerce.</i><p>

A lesser-known company, called <a href="http://www.webmovie.com/index.htm">WebMovie</a>, said today that it will launch four products that include the full text of novel, along with storyboard of images that change as the reader browses. A preview of one novel a sci-fi tale called <I>Generation War</I> is available now. Real actors, video, animation, sound, and music are used to create the multimedia version of the story. The site is supported by ads.<p>

Web entertainment is one of the most heavily invested areas of online development. Companies like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> are trying to rope in Netizens anyway they can, from spooling out nationwide <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sidewalk/">city entertainment calendars</a> to producing digital books like <I>Mansion on the Hill.</I><p>

Books are a given for the widely text-based Web, but short attention spans and weary eyes may keep people from downloading lengthy novels. That's why WebMovie and Microsoft are trying to enhance their books with multimedia.<p>

MSN is trying to capture the Net audience as well as its subscribers. Anyone can get a meaty synopsis of <I>Mansion on the Hill,</i> but only MSN members will be able to read the entire multimedia feature, a move designed to keep the online service's Net community at home as other entertainment offerings proliferate. Music Central will present the serial over four weeks and in archive for 30 days after the final installment.<p>

The rock 'n roll tip will also help MSN harness traffic. Goodman, who has covered music for 20 years and has been a magazine editor at <i>Billboard</i> and <i><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a>,</i> chronicles the rock 'n' roll scene from the 1960s to the present, including more than 200 interviews with musicians such as Bob Dylan and the Eagles. The book also looks at the evolution of the billion-dollar music business.<p>

Sam Sutherland, senior editor for Music Central, said visitors can expect to find the same amount of text from Goodman's book as they would in a traditional magazine excerpt: 8,000 to 10,000 words. The serial will also include artist biographies, song clips, and interview sound bites.<p>

Sutherland said the integrity of the book will not be overshadowed by the bells and whistles of the Net. "This is the first chance Music Central has had to honor the original text product and enhance it with multimedia. On the same token, we don't want to necessarily drown it in a multimedia experience that detracts from the actual content."<p>

Another Web site that builds on the popularity of books is <a href="http://www.thecase.com/thecase/">The Case</a>. It's a weekly murder mystery launched a year ago, but now it's part of the <a href="http://www.mysterynet.com/">Mystery Network</a> group of sites.<p>

The Case has sections such as Twist, a mystery with a shocking ending every Monday; Solve-it, a scenario sent to members via email where users who solve it get a prize; and Mysterious Photo, where viewers write a short mystery about a picture.<p>

<img src="/Graphics/feature.gif">Once every week, Bruce Koon, managing editor of the <i>San Jose Mercury News'</i> <a
href="http://www.sjmercury.com/">Mercury Center</a>, logs on a private company Web site to learn which stories people are reading in the company's online newspaper--and which ones they're not.
<p> 
Like editors at most online publications, Koon has access to precise measurements of reader response through the log files, or "hit counts," that are recorded on the Mercury Center's Web site. Each time a page is delivered to a reader, the results are automatically recorded in a computer file. Editors can know which stories get read, by whom, and even for how long. 
<p>
But as more people begin to receive news and other information online, some journalists and media watchers say hit counts could turn the Web into a ratings-driven mass medium similar to TV. And, they add, that could mean programming that relies on sensationalism instead of substance.
<p> 
"It's a tool that should help
us serve our customers," said Jon Katz, media critic for <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/">HotWired</a>. "If it becomes the well stone of what we create, it's a nightmare."
<p> 
The technology of the Internet has made newspaper editors privy to this kind of detailed reader feedback for the first time. Until now, besides focus groups about subscribers' interests and tastes, editors largely had to leave it up to faith that readers were actually reading the stories. 
<p> 
For television station managers, on the other hand, ratings are the name of the game. Such information gathered through systems like the <a
href="http://www.nielsen.com/home/new.htm">Nielsen ratings</a>, which also track audience response, serves as the very foundation for television programming. 
<p> 
But even TV programmers have never had access to the precise kinds of data now commonly available to editors of online publications. 
<p> 
That raises the question of whether online editors will respond to such statistics in the same way that TV stations often do: adapting their coverage to maximize hits by picking stories not because they are important but because they will attract the most clicks. The question is particularly disturbing for new media ombudsmen when applied to online publications, including CNET.
<p> 
This new breed of news vehicles rely on text like regular newspapers but can take advantage of Web technology to publish quickly and continuously and even use live formats like television. They can also incorporate multimedia such as video and audio clips. But while observers can make analogies to both television and newspapers, most online editors say they make their news decisions the same way any newspaper does: What is the most important story of the day?
<P> 
Koon and other online news editors say hit counts have some sway but do not determine their editorial coverage. They say the point of looking at the hit counts, along with email and discussion forums, is to keep editors and reporters in touch with their readership, not to influence decisions on what stories are printed and how they are played.
<p> 
Koon, for example, said hit counts and reader email have improved the Mercury Center's ability to know which stories are of interest to their readers, whether it's an article about <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple
Computer</a> or the <a href="http://www.sf49ers.com/">San Francisco 49ers</a>.
<p> 
"The Web is an interactive two-way communication between readers and journalists," Koon said. "Print journalism has in many ways become too isolated from readers. Between email and hit counts, journalists will have to pay attention to what the viewing public wants. But that doesnt mean &#91;journalists&#93; have to abrogate their responses on what is important."
<p> 
Journalists at online publications, from HotWired to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall
Street Journal Interactive</a> and <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN Interactive</a>, echoed Koon's sentiments. The consensus is that the interactivity of the Web can help close the gap between readers and the media, which often is criticized for being "out of touch." 
<p> 
"We still make our judgment based on the significance of the individual story. Is it interesting? How many people does it
affect?" said Jeff Garrard, executive producer of CNN Interactive.
