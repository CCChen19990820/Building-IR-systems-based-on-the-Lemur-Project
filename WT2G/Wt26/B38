<html><title>No Free Lunch for Lobbyists -- Heritage</title>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></center>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>September Insider : No Free Lunch for Lobbyists</h2><br></center>
  by Charles P. Griffin, Deputy House Liaison at the Heritage Foundation<p><hr><P>

The best-kept "dirty little secret" in Washington these days may be the millions of taxpayer dollars that are siphoned off each year to fund welfare for lobbyists. Over the past forty years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<P>
Almost every interest in America from agriculture to zoology has one or more organizations receiving government funding. Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar Association, which received $2.2 million. This subsidy forces the taxpayer to foot the bill for a range of ideologically driven organizations.<P>
The coercive power of the federal government should not be used to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or other government entities.Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. <P>
Every federal dollar frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives more than $70 million 96 percent of its funding from the federal government. While enjoying a generous federal subsidy, this proponent of big government actively engages in a broad range of overtly partisan political activity.<P>  
Unfortunately, the NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY 1994, 22 percent of its budget. In addition to opposing economic development nationwide, the Trust recently sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to "vote no" on a possible amendment in the House to reduce their taxpayer subsidy. It is no wonder that this nation has a multi-trillion dollar debt when federally-funded organizations can so blatantly lobby Congress for more money.<P>
Existing auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse. The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to curb current abuses:<P>
To solve this problem, no advocacy organization that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status. The consequences for violating the prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the standards. Under no circumstances should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions receive further federal funding.<P>
In addition, to shed more light on this "dirty little secret," witnesses testifying before Congress should be required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light<P>.
It's time for this Congress to end welfare for lobbyists. Taxpayers should no longer be forced to subsidize political activity with which they disagree. Thomas Jefferson anticipated this debate over two hundred years ago when he correctly stated, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."<P>
Mr. Jefferson must be spinning in his grave.<P>

<b>NATO's Role in European Stability</B>,edited by Stephen A. Cambone
<br>The Center for
Strategic & International Studies<p>

The Center for Strategic
and International Studies addresses the current political debate
over the redefinition and transformation of NATO, which dates
back to the very beginnings of the post-Cold War era. The report
examines the question of how to restructure the transatlantic
partnership in light of the recent discussions surrounding the
future membership of Eastern European nations into NATO. The report
also considers how NATO should have responded to the situation
in Bosnia. CSIS compiles the opinions of various academics and
foreign policy experts on the rightful course for NATO during
its transformation period. Walter Slocombe, US undersecretary
of defense for policy, lists four basic principles that must be
kept in mind during NATO's expansion: &quot;First, NATO is an
effective alliance, not a system of paper guarantees. Second,
it is an alliance of free nations and is committed to the principles
of liberty. Third, it works by consensus. Fourth, NATO is ultimately
a military organization.&quot; 67 pp. CONTACT: The Center for

<b>The
B-2 Bomber: Failure to Buy More Could Compromise Security in the
Next Century</B>, by Jim Courter and Loren Thompson
<br>Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution presents the
case for why the production of the B-2 bomber, popularly know
as the stealth bomber, should not be curtailed as it is essential
to the maintenance of US security. The report warns against terminating
the production of the B-2 after the government has committed over
$20 billion to its development since the last decade of the Cold
War. The study concludes that it would be more cost effective
to continue the production of the bomber, despite its high price
tag, because the cost of every available alternative that can
achieve future military objectives is considerably higher. Courter
and Thompson also espouse the belief that possession of the B2
is critical to US security in light of the trend towards the globalization
of advanced technologies; this suggests that the present generation
of US aircraft will be outdated by early next century. 53 pp.

<b>From
Shadows to Substance: an Action Plan for Transatlantic Defense
Cooperation</b><br>The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<p>

The
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies issues a conference
report from their February 1995 conference held to discuss the
prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation in today's political
environment. Policy makers, industrialists, and academics met
to investigate the possibilities of establishing cooperative measures
between the US and Europe in the areas of military research, development,
and production. In this report, CSIS attests to the positive gains
made toward establishing transatlantic partnerships for future
US defense programs, to enable more programs to come to fruition.
The conference did conclude, however, leaving some ambiguity:&quot;the
interoperability argument for transatlantic defense cooperation
has shifted from enabling allied forces to meet a possible joint
threat in a cohesive and efficient manner to enabling alliance
members to undertake multinational operations outside NATO's area.&quot;

<b>The Purposes of Russian Aid: Supporting Democratic
Capitalism</b>, by Ariel Cohen
<br><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1041.html">Backgrounder No. 1041</a>, The Heritage
Foundation<p>

Ariel Cohen, a Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, advocates re-examining the
aid that the US plans to give to Russia and the Newly Independent
States in FY 1996 and in FY 1997 which will be up for a vote in
the Senate shortly. Cohen points out that US-Russian cooperation
is ebbing due to the following: Russia's intervention in Chechnya,
Moscow's refusal to end the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran,
and the lack of free-market reforms that have been enacted, since
Gorbachev's perestroika began ten years ago. The author recommends
that the Senate preface the allocation of the aid based upon six
contingencies: &quot;1) demand that the Administration suspend
negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western
creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is
completed; 2) condition US support for IMF credits to the Russian
government on a cease-fire in Chechnya; 3) create an independent
board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS; 4) reprogram $225 million
to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities
Import Program and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program; 5)
make democratic development a top priority; 6) target grants directly
to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS.&quot; 13 pp.

<b>The United States and Future Bosnias</B>,
Jonathan G. Clarke
<br>Foreign Policy Briefing No. 36, Cato Institute<p>
Foreign
policy studies research fellow Jonathan Clarke of the Cato Institute
equates the importance of US foreign policy towards Bosnia as
setting the precedent for future policy towards other Eastern
European nations where conflict is erupting. Thus, according to
the author, the manner in which the US proceeds is paramount.
The author advocates a policy of nonintervention towards Bosnia
based on three main arguments: 1) the war in Bosnia is an intracommunal
dispute and is not an aberration from past, present, or future
conflicts that comprise Europe's history; 2) unlike Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union, conflicts such as Bosnia do not pose a threat
to US security; 3) intracommunal conflicts make it difficult for
the US to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Clarke
concludes that &quot;failure to draw the appropriate lessons from
the Bosnian debacle will cause the United States to end up repeating
the same mistakes elsewhere in Europe.&quot; 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<b>More Military Bases Need to be Closed</b>, Baker Spring
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/natsec/bg1042.html">Backgrounder
No. 1042, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Baker Springs, a senior policy
analyst at The Heritage Foundation, attests that more base closings
are still needed despite the latest round of base closing, which
insufficiently reduced the size of military forces, personnel,
and budgets down to the size recommended by the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission. The author explains that insufficient
base closings pose a very grave threat to US security; moneys
spent maintaining excessive bases only detract from vital military
readiness and modernization programs. Thus, the author advocates
extending the base closure process for another two rounds to ensure
that base infrastructure, which has only been reduced by 15 percent
since 1985, approaches the 25 percent cuts in military personnel
during the same time period. The paper also recommends that additional
oversight be made in any upcoming base closings so that the procedure
does not become politicized by the upcoming presidential race;
the electoral map and presidential politics should not influence
which bases are selected to be closed. 8 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Venezuela:
The Quiet Crisis Deepens</b>, by Mark Falcoff
<br>Latin American Outlook,
American Enterprise Institute
<p>Venezuela has long since passed its
days of economic prosperity that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 70s.
Mark Falcoff, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,
outlines the causes of  this collapse and the political, social,
and economic policies that continue to sabotage efforts to put
Venezuela back on track. The author reveals that President Caldera
has supported dangerous economic reforms that include the following:
1) price controls that will increase shortages of basic foodstuffs
and articles on necessity; 2) foreign exchange controls that hurt
businesses by creating shortages of needed raw materials and parts;
3) and finally, a deliberate effort to stall any effort that move
towards privatization. These policies do not bode well for the
Venezuelan economic crisis that continues to worsen, fostering
even more support for a military coup that could truncate Caldera's
presidency. 4 pp. Contact: American Enterprise Institute, 1150

<b>How to
Close Down the Department of Transportation</b>, by Ronald D. Utt
and Wendell Cox
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/bugettax/bg1048.html">Backgrounder No. 1048, The Heritage Foundation</a>
<P>
Ronald
Utt, visiting Heritage Fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state
policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council,
present the process through which the Department of Transportation,
created in 1966, has grown into the enormously inefficient bureaucracy
that exists today. Utt and Cox state that this fiscal year's budget
allocates $39 billion to the DOT, with nearly $19 billion going
to highways. According to this study, much of the department's
spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished
by the federal fuel tax paid by motorists at the gas pump, and
the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket
tax and several lesser aviation taxes. Utt and Cox demonstrate
that the DOT has remained mostly unchanged in its structure and
purpose since 1966; however both the Congress and the White House
now agree that major reform is necessary. Even modest reform proposals
have met opposition with House Republicans, but the Senate Republicans
have proven their commitment to fundamental reform, urging greater
privatization and federalism in transportation issues. This report
argues that the reforms emerging from conference are not enough,
further reforms in the following areas are necessary: surface
transportation; the end of federal mandates which have inflated
state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative,
low-cost transportation solutions; and urban mass transit. This
paper suggest the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration;
privatizing Amtrak; privatization of air traffic control and the
devolution of federal control to the states; and the transfer
of Coast Guard responsibilities to the Department of Justice.

<b>Five Hundred LifeSaving Interventions
and Their Cost Effectiveness</b>, by Tammy O. Tengs, Miriam E. Adams,
Joseph S. Pliskin, Dana Gelb Safran, Joanna E. Siegel, Milton
C. Weinstein, and John D. Graham<br>
Risk Analysis Vol. 15 No. 3, Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis<p>
The team of experts who produced this
important paper gathered information on the cost-effectiveness
of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly
available economic analyses. &quot;Life-saving interventions&quot;
were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategies
that reduce the possibility of premature death among a specified
target population. This paper defines cost effectiveness as the
net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved.
The 587 interventions identified in this work ranged from those
that saved more resources than they cost, to those costing more
than $10 billion per year of life saved. This paper finds the
median intervention costs $42,000 per lifeyear saved; the median
medical intervention costs $19,000 per life-year saved, the median
injury -eduction costs $48,000 per life-year, and toxin control
costs $2,800,000 per life-year saved. 21 pp. CONTACT: The Harvard

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the
Regulatory Smog</b>, by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
Policy Analysis
No. 233, Cato Institute<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting
Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental
studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, maintain that
the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided
because it fails to account for current pollution trends and is
based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This
misguided policy, according to this paper, has led to &quot;regulatory
overkill&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Jones and
Adler state that this particularly affects the Ozone Transport
Region, the twelve states from Virginia to Maine, imposing emissary
control strategies that are not only unnecessary, ineffective,
and expensive, but are also scientifically insupportable. The
authors write, &quot;control for control's sake pollution control
strategies pursued by the EPA and the OTC are largely inappropriate
because they are neither costeffective nor equitable means of
achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be
necessary.&quot; The authors conclude that legislative action
is necessary to alleviate unneeded and costly regulatory mandates.

This
paper, prepared by the staff of the Roe Institute for Economic
Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, recommends a substantial
package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate
economic growth as the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate
Finance Committee fill in the details of the $245 billion tax
relief plan. The Roe Institute staff suggests using the $354 billion
House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package,
including such items as: a $500 per child tax credit; a reduction
of the capital gains tax; and an IRAPlus plan. This paper demonstrates
why both tax and spending reductions are necessary to effectively
move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands

No. 178, Hudson Institute<p>

Alan Reynolds, the Hudson Institute's
director of economic research, has adapted his testimony before
the House Republican Joint Economic Committee and House Republican
Policy Committee Briefing on the Dollar to produce this paper.
Reynolds gives a &quot;graphic&quot; demonstration of how the
federal government's policies are driving the US economy toward
a new boat of stagflation. This paper compares the state of the
current economy with the conditions of 197475, 197982, and 199091.
Current actions by the federal government point towards stagflations:
America's increasingly hostile tax climate for domestic savings
and foreign investment. Reynolds suggests that the decline of
the dollar is not the result of budget deficit or the Federal
Reserve's interest rate; but that the steady decline may be halted
with appropriate tax and monetary policies, including tax incentives
for savings and investments. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

<p><b>Scale Back
the Earned Income Tax Credit</b>, by Marvin H. Kosters<br>
On the Issues
No. 28, American Enterprise Institute<p>
Marvin Kosters, resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, explains that, despite
the fact that the earned income tax credit (EITC) was designed
to help the working poor, the EITC has faced increased scrutiny
from both sides of the aisle as the Congress works to balance
the budget. Kosters suggests that, while a review is certainly
in order, a more comprehensive assessment of the EITC is needed.
Kosters argues that the program has not achieved the success its
supporters claim and that, instead of encouraging work, the EITC
discourages work for too many people who are too far up the income
ladder. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th

Christopher Good, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University,
seeks to explain the current and prospective state of Canada's
finances and how these finances affect Canada's &quot;public sector
economic maladies.&quot; The author uses a technique called generational
accounting to look at the future stream of government taxes, transfers,
and expenditures. The findings suggest that Canada's current fiscal
policies are unsustainable. Good explains why the Canadian government
sector, with enormously higher unfunded future liabilities is
overspending at a vastly greater rate than the US. The paper recommends
a &quot;freeze and growth through productivity&quot; policy, which
means that at each age, an individual's taxes are increased at
the rate of productivity, while his or her transfers and government
expenditures remain constant in real terms. 74 pp. CONTACT: The

care workers into purchasers and providers. NHS encouraged general
practitioners to become &quot;fundholders,&quot; managing budgets
to purchase services for their patients from provider hospitals
and consultants. This work reveals that the issue of the cost
of treatment began to figure more largely than had been the case
under the old priceless system, lowering overall costs. 87 pp.

<b>A Guide to Medicare Reform Proposals</b>,
by John C. Liu<br>
<a href="/library/categories/healthwel/fyi57.html">F.Y.I. No. 57, The Heritage Foundation</a><P>
Heritage policy
analyst John Liu describes the need for action in Medicare when
Congress returns from its summer recess. Liu writes, &quot;To
avoid the collapse of program, Congress has only two choices:
1) Do not change significantly the way Medicare is run by the
government, and assure future new revenues through higher payroll
taxes and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs;
or 2) Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run so that benefits
are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding future tax increases
or a diversion of money from other programs. This approach would
aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated to grow. This
paper assesses the proposals from the Clinton administration,
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, National Center for
Policy Analysis, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare, United Seniors Association, and major organizations
representing health care providers. Liu presents the approach
of the various groups' proposals, and shows how they address the
reforms necessary to change Medicare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Why
Serious Welfare Reform Must Include Serious Adoption Reform</b>, by
Patrick Fagan<br>
<a href="/library/catagories/healthwel/bg1046.html">Backgrounder No. 1027, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Patrick
Fagan, the William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and
Cultural Issues at The Heritage Foundation, argues that adoption
must be part of any plan to reform welfare. Fagan cites statistics
which show outofwedlock births reaching nearly 40 percent by the
year 2000 and 50 percent by the year 2012, and he questions why,
out of the 500,000 children in the foster care system, only 50,000
were cleared for adoption each year. Fagan suggests that adoption
addresses many of the current problems with the welfare system:
unwed mothers, children in abusive homes, children in foster care,
and costs to the state and federal governments. Fagan argues,
&quot;Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive
capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life
chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money
for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents.
It is good for all involved. Adoption works.&quot; 30 pp. CONTACT:

<b>Should
We Worry About Ozone</b>, by Jane S. Shaw and Richard L. Stroup<BR>
Policy
Report No. 191, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>Jane Shaw and
Richard Stroup, senior associates with the Political Economy Research
Center, challenge the theory held by some scientists that the
depletion of stratospheric ozone is substantial and will grow
to alarming levels unless the use of CFCs and some related chemical
compounds is eliminated. The authors argue that the theory of
largescale depletion caused by human use of these chemicals is
not yet supported by solid scientific evidence. This paper presents
five areas of unresolved issues regarding the ozone: 1) it is
not clear that stratospheric ozone is being significantly depleted
worldwide, or that any depletion that may have occurred is permanent;
2) if the ozone layer is being depleted, it is not clear that
CFCs are the major cause or that reducing their use now will stop
or even slow depletion; 3) it appears that the &quot;ozone hole&quot;
above Antarctica is caused by unique conditions, and it is uncertain
whether additional or reduced chlorine from CFCs would affected
it; 4) even if ozone depletion does occur, there is no reliable
evidence that it will represent a grave threat to living things
on earth; and 5) the cost of eliminating CFCs for refrigeration
and cooling are higher than most people realize, with estimates
reaching nearly $100 billion over the next 10 years in the United
States alone. The authors conclude that the Montreal Protocol
banning CFCs should be changed to make the phaseout more gradual,
and the costs (including such social costs as the loss of safety)
of halting CFC production should be weighed against the small
and uncertain benefits. 21 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

<B>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory
Reform</b>, by Kent Jeffries<BR>Policy Report No. 194, National Center
for Policy Analysis<P>

National Center for Policy Analysis senior
fellow Kent Jeffries suggests that any regulatory reform bill
approved by Congress will only be a first step toward removing
governmental abuses without sacrificing overall environmental
quality. Jeffries argues that Congress must still reauthorize
or review a host of environmental programs individually, including
Superfund, pesticide regulations, the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. This paper recommends
three guiding principles with which to examine these programs:
the federalism rule, which requires regulatory decisions to be
made by the smallest possible government entity; the costbenefit
rule, which considers whether the costs of a proposed regulation
reasonably reflect it benefits; and the compensation rule, under
which property owners are compensated for their losses if property
rights are taken or diminished by a regulation. Jeffries writes,
&quot;The regulatory reform bill is important, but if Congress
is to make the reform truly meaningful, it must define a role
for government in environmental regulation that gives people the
right incentives, that protects property rights, and that spends
the public money wisely.&quot; 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center

<B>Beyond the Grazing Fee: An Agenda for
Rangeland Reform</b>, by Karl Hess Jr. and Jerry L. Holecheck<BR>Policy
Analysis No. 234, Cato Institute<P>
Karl Hess, Cato senior fellow
in environmental studies, and Jerry Holecheck, professor of rangeland
studies at New Mexico State University, argue that the results
of more than a century of grazing on public land are testimony
to the failure of landuse socialism. This paper asserts that taxpayers
have paid for federally supervised and subsidized grazing, and
ranchers, the intended beneficiaries, have gained little except
debt, insecurity, and mountains of regulations, while environmental
quality has suffered. Hess and Holecheck address Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt's plan, arguing that &quot;it ignores the institutional
impediments that have made overgrazing and land abuse official
programs of the federal government, and it leaves unchanged the
federal policies that discourage rancher stewardship and pay stockmen
to overgraze and reward them for poor management practices.&quot;
This article presents four methods of reform: 1) placing the fiscal
burden of maintaining these lands on the ranchers; 2) opening
access to these lands for purposes other than grazing livestock;
3) decentralizing control over federal lands in selected areas
on a trial basis; and 4) extending the local control and opening
debate on partial or full divestiture of public rangelands. 27

<B>Securities Law Reform:
A Half Step in the Right Direction</b>, by William H. Lash III<br>
Contemporary
Issues No. 73, Center for the Study of American Business<P>
William
Lash, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business,
finds that Congress, fearing an &quot;economic apocalypse where
millions of fleeced investors withdraw from securities markets
that fail to adequately protect them&quot; is reluctant to pass
pending legislation that would provide some protection to companies
facing groundless securities litigation. Lash proposes six aspects
of reform: 1) institute a loser pays all court cost provision;
2) require a meaningful investment by plaintiffs in strike suits;
3) require specific allegations of actual fraud or recklessness;
4) abolish RICO liability for securities suits; 5) limit the number
of lawsuits that may be brought by professional plaintiffs to
five cases in a three year period; and 6) require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to adopt rules providing a &quot;safe
harbor&quot; for corporations making positive, forwardlooking
statements in their corporate reports, so that companies are not
forces to play down bright prospects to investors simply to protect
the firm from possible frivolous securities lawsuits. Lash concludes
that the constant specter of groundless securities litigation
deters many worthy individuals from joining corporate boards and
wastes corporate resources while rewarding a handful of unscrupulous
attorneys. 20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

review seems &quot;fundamentally inconsistent with republican
government under a written constitution. The solution to this
dilemma, the only way in which judicial review retains its legitimacy
and remains consistent with the political theory underlying our
form of government, lies in how judicial review is conducted.&quot;

<B>The
1995 Crime Bill: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?</b>,
by Jarett B. Decker<BR>
Policy Analysis No. 229, Cato Institute<P>
Jarett
Decker, a Minnesota attorney, accuses the new Republican Congress
of fighting crime by expanding federal power, just like past Democratic
Congresses. Decker argues that, despite the April 26 Supreme Court
ruling on the Lopez case, the 1995 GOP crime bill continue the
trends of recent years by making every local crime a federal crime.
According to this paper, federal prosecutors would be given even
more power under the GOP crime bills, while the rights of defendants
and the powers of judges would be curtailed. The authors demonstrates
that &quot;both the House and Senate bills give a green light
to government lawlessness,&quot; weakening constitutional protections
against invasions of private homes, raids on businesses, and detentions
of citizens in the course of criminal investigations. Decker concludes
that the 1995 crime bills are a step in the wrong direction, further
removing the US from constitutional checks and balances toward
a regime of unchecked power. 33 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000

<B>Orphanages:

Center

Economist Richard McKenzie presents
his preliminary findings from a survey of several hundred former
orphans, all of whom are now middleaged or older. Despite the
claims of child care professionals who condemn orphanages, the
survey found that when compared to their counterparts in the general
population, the orphans have: a lower divorce rate; a higher level
of education; a higher mean income; a far lower unemployment rate;
a far lower poverty rate; a minuscule rate of reliance on public
assistance; a minuscule arrest rate; a substantially lower rate
of mental and emotional disorders; and a higher rate of participation
in elections. McKenzie also reports that the majority of orphans
state that they prefer the way they grew up to the way they would
have grown up in foster care or in their own families. The author
contrasts the success of the orphans with the lowered expectations
of child care professionals for those growing up in orphanages.

<b>Cornell Professor
Sues Over Harassment Conviction</b><br>
The Center for Individual Rights
has filed a lawsuit against Cornell University on behalf of Professor
James B. Maas.  The lawsuit demands $1.5 million in damages for
Cornell's actions in finding Maas guilty of alleged &quot;sexual
harassment.&quot;<p>
Jim Maas, a professor of psychology, is one of
Cornell's most prominent faculty members.  He has a record of
31 years of distinguished service to the Cornell community.<P>
The
lawsuit, filed today in Tompkins County Supreme Court, demands
redress for a yearlong, ruinous witch hunt against Maas.  In a
proceeding over sexual harassment charges filed by former students
in May 1994, Maas was convicted as a &quot;sexual harasser&quot;
on stale and unproven charges; was subjected to an adjudicatory
&quot;process&quot; that was administered by fanatical faculty
members devoid of even the most basic elements of procedural fairness;
was forced to watch helplessly as unsubstantiated rumors and halftruths
were peddled to the local, national, and international press,
besmirching his reputation and severely damaging his ability to
function as a teacher and a scholar; and was ignored by Cornell's
feckless administrators when he protested the egregious violations
of Cornell's established procedures and of the confidentiality

<b>Oral
Arguments Made in Hopwood v. State of Texas</b><br>
On Tuesday, August
8, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments
in the case of Hopwood v. State of Texas.  The case was brought
by Cheryl Hopwood and three other unsuccessful applicants for
admission to the University of Texas Law School.  The plaintiffs,
who are white, claim that the law school discriminated against
them by maintaining a racebased admissions system that was intentionally
biased in favor of black and Mexican American applicants.<P>
The case
is an appeal from a decision handed down by US District Court
Judge Sam Sparks in August 1994.  The judge found that the Law
School had indeed operated a racially discriminatory admission
system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause, noting that the school had maintained separate admissions
committees to evaluate applications from members of different
racial groups.  The judge also observed that blacks and MexicanAmericans
were presumptively admitted with test scores and college grade
point averages lower than those set for the presumptive rejection
of whites.<P>
Nevertheless, Judge Sparks refused to order the plaintiffs'
admission to the law school because they failed to prove that
they would have been admitted except for the unconstitutional
program.  Moreover, the judge refused to award damages of more
than one dollar, finding that the law school had acted in &quot;good
faith&quot; when it violated the plaintiffs' rights.  And because
the judge found the law school's admission program no longer to
be in violation of the equal protection clausebecause it had discarded
the segregated admission tracks and separate admissions committees
by the time the case went to trialhe refused to order any change
in the school's admissions procedures.<P>
The law school, however,
has never disavowed the use of race as a factor in its admissions
process; indeed, it continues to treat an applicant's status as
black or MexicanAmerican as a &quot;plus.&quot;  Such preference
is given automatically, without regard to the applicant's socioeconomic
background, and to both Texas residents and nonresidents.<P>
During
the oral argument, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to order
the law school to offer them admission.  In addition, the plaintiffs
asked the appellate court to remand the case so that they may
seek an award of nontrivial monetary damages.  Most significantly,
however, the appeal asks that the law school be prevented from
using race as it currently does as a criterion in student admissions.
 In this respect, the case presents the Court of Appeals with
an opportunity to clarify the meaning of University of California
Regents v. Bakke, a 1978 Supreme Court ruling having to do with
the constitutionality of racebased admissions procedures at a
statesupported medical college.<P>

<b>Institute Files Amicus Opposing Civil Forfeiture<br></b>
The
Institute filed an amicus in Bennis v. State of Michigan, fighting
the government's ability to forfeit the property of wholly innocent
owners.  The state forfeited Ms. Bennis' interest in her automobile
because her husband used the car for prostitution.  Ms. Bennis
committed no wrong and had no knowledge of the illegal use of
her property.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan provides no
recourse for innocent owners.<P>
The Institute's brief critiques civil
forfeiture from a property rights perspective and argues that
forfeiture of property held by truly innocent owners is unduly
oppressive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  Furthermore, the law should not place affirmative
obligations on individuals to police the actions of third parties.
 Rather, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate
that an owner negligently entrusted property to another in order
to expose that individual to civil forfeiture.  The Institute
will also fight the forfeiture of Ms. Bennis' rights in the automobile
on the ground of taking of private property without just compensation.<p>

The Supreme Court of Virginia refused a petition for appeal
by National Football League Player Association (NFLPA) union officials
to overturn a lower court's ruling barring the NFLPA from seizing
forced dues from sixteen current and former Washington Redskins
players, National Right to Work Foundation attorneys announced
today.<p>
The ruling upheld a lower court decision by Loudoun County
Circuit Judge Thomas D. Horne.  Horne last year ruled that it
is a violation of Virginia's Right to Work law for NFLPA union
officials to force Redskin players to pay union dues as a condition
of employment.<p>
Horne's ruling permanently barred player union officials
from requiring former Redskins tight end Terry Orr and other players
to pay union dues.  Orr and fifteen former and current Redskins
players were represented in their legal action by attorneys from
the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.<p>
  &quot;This
is another enforcement action to guarantee employee rights under
Virginia's Right to Work law, &quot; said Foundation VicePresident
Timothy McConville.  He added, &quot;Every step of the way in
this case, we've prevailed and protected employees' right not
to pay compulsory union dues just to keep their jobs.&quot;<P>

In
December of 1993, NFLPA union officials nearly forced the Redskins
to forfeit their final regular season game by threatening to have
the players who exercised their Right to Work suspended.<p>
The union
claimed that the Redskins were employed in Washington, DC, where
they play their home games, and therefore not covered by Virginia
law.<p>
But the lower court declared that because the Redskins spend
the overwhelming majority of their work time at Redskins Park
in Loudoun County, Virginia, they are Virginia employees, protected
by the state's Right to Work law.<p>
In contrast, players typically
spend only 60 hours before, during, and after home games working
in the District of Columbia.<p>

<b>Supreme
Court Allows Student Initiated Graduation Prayer</b><br>
On June 26 the
Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in Harris v. Joint School District.  The court's decision
effectively upholds the right to studentinitiated prayer at public
high school graduations.  The Rutherford Institute represented
students in the case.<P>
The case began in 1991, when the ACLU filed
suit against the public high school in Grangeville, Idaho, for
allowing studentinitiated prayer at their graduation ceremony.
 The high school gave complete control over the ceremony to seniors
who voted to include a benediction and invocation.  Initially,
a federal district court ruled in favor of the school, but the
court of appeals reversed the decision, holding that graduation
prayer violated the first amendmentregardless of whether or not
the prayers were studentinitiated.  The Ninth Circuit's decision
was in direct conflict with an earlier decision from the Fifth
Circuit upholding student-initiated graduation prayer.<p>
&quot;The
Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case on the merits means that
the uncertainty over the legality of student-initiated prayer will
continue,&quot; said Rutherford staff attorney Mark Beutler. 
&quot;I am pleased nonetheless that the Court vacated the Ninth
Circuit's decision.  Now students in western states can once again
decide to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford
Sues California Superintendent Delaine Easton</b><br>
California State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Easton as well as a half dozen
other school superintendents have been named defendants in a lawsuit
against the state of California regarding administration of the
California Learning Assessment Systems (CLAS) test.  Despite Governor
Pete Wilson's veto on funding for the controversial CLAS tests,
schools continue to administer test materials without parental
consent or notice.<p>The complaint was amended on Monday, June 19,
to argue that the state violated not only parental rights guarded
by the Constitution, but also federal civil rights laws.  A court
date has been set for October 23, 1995.<p>The original suit, filed
April 21, 1994, sought a temporary restraining order to stop six
San Bernardino County School districts from giving the CLAS test.
 The test requires children to answer personal questions about
their family values, practices, and beliefs as well as questions
pertaining to their relationship with their parents.  Children's
answers may then be referred to Child Protective Services without
ever notifying parents how the test results are being used.  Not
only parents, but also state senators, school board members, and
teachers were denied the opportunity to examine the test before
it was administered.  The defendants in the lawsuit continue to
assert that they have done nothing wrong, insisting that parents
have no right to shield their children from questionable materials
found in public schools.<p>
&quot;This battle will not end until the
State Department of Education is forced to recognize the rights
of parents to guide the education of their children,&quot; said
Frank J. Mistretta, Jr., an attorney handling the case, adding,
&quot;Now is definitely not the time to drop the ball on defending
parents' rights.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford Institute Defends School Against
ACLU Suit</b><br>
On June 30, The Rutherford Institute filed a posttrial
brief on behalf of Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent
Lynn Westfall in response to a lawsuit brought against the school
by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The ACLU sued the
school administration for allowing a citizen group to place a
box of free Bibles for students on school property.<p>
The posttrial
brief filed by The Rutherford Institute requests the court to
rule in favor of the school.  The brief argues that the school
acted neutrally by permitting religious materials to be made available
on the same terms and under the same conditions as nonreligious
materials.<P>
The case began on December 6, 1994, when the school
board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses
to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on
February 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis.
 As a result, on February 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several
parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the
school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students
while the case was pending.<p>
&quot;We are hopeful that in light
of the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger and Pinette, the
court will not require the school to treat private religious speech
occurring during the school day differently than nonreligious
speech,&quot; said Dean Whitford, The Rutherford Institute attorney
handling the case, along with Attorney Michael D. Lorensen.<P>

<b>Employee Drug
Testing Supported in California Supreme Court</b><br>
WLF filed a brief
on behalf of itself and a group of California State Senators in
the California Supreme Court in support of the constitutionality
of an employee drug testing program adopted by the City of Glendale,
California.  The city adopted the program in response to the results
of a pilot project that showed 21 percent of job applicants tested
positive for drug use.  The program requires those who have received
job offers to undergo drug testing as a condition of taking the
job.<P>
<b>Supreme Court Asked To Review Decision on &quot;Green&quot;
Ad Ban</b><br>
WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
National Association of Manufacturers v. Lungren, a challenge
to a California law that virtually bans many types of truthful
environmental claims in advertising.  For example, no product
may be labeled or advertised as &quot;recyclable&quot; unless
convenient recycling facilities for the product exist in every
urban area of the state.  A federal appeals court upheld the ban.<P>

<b>Protection
of Civil Liberties In OSHA Investigations Sought</b><br>
A petition for
rulemaking filed by WLF with the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) argued that the agency should adopt procedures
for protecting the civil liberties of employers during inspections
and investigations.  The petition urged OSHA to provide a &quot;statement
of employers' rights and responsibilities&quot; prior to every
inspection.  Currently, OSHA does not require its inspectors to
inform employers of any of their rights.  WLF's proposed statement
explains employers' rights, including the right to refuse an inspection
that is not authorized by a warrant or its equivalent, to consult
one's legal counsel, and to accompany the inspector throughout
the inspection.  The petition is in response to the results of
WLF's research into OSHA inspection procedures, which disclosed
that OSHA lacks adequate regulations or internal rules for protecting
civil liberties.<p>
<b>Brief Seeks Dismissal of ACLU Prison Library Case</b>
In
Lewis v. Casey, WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court seeking
the reversal of an ACLU victory in the Ninth Circuit, which held
that the state of Arizona had violated the rights of incarcerated
felons by failing to provide (among other things) trained bilingual
legal assistants for illiterate and nonEnglishspeaking prisoners.
 WLF filed the brief on behalf of itself and the Arizona Constitutional
Defense Council, an independent board created by Arizona law to
protect the state from federal intrusion.<P>

<title> Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</i></b>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I>by Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</i>
<hr>
<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<b>Clinton's ABM Treaty Muddle,</b> by Kim R. Holmes and Baker Spring<br>
<i>Committee Brief No. 16</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p> 
Heritage vice president Kim Holmes and policy analyst Baker Spring focus on the inconsistencies in the Clinton administration's approach to the ABM Treaty. This brief, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 7, suggests five steps to overcome the confusion in the administration's policies: 1) Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces overseas, and their vital interests, will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world; 2) Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one; 3) Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation policy; 4) Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty; and 5) Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM Treaty. Holmes and Spring maintain that these steps will resolve the contradictions in the President's approach to the ABM Treaty. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>The Mystery of Japanese Growth,</b> by Ramesh Ponnuru<br>
<i>Rochester Paper No. 4,</i> Centre for Policy Studies and American Enterprise Institute
<p>
Ramesh Ponnuru, a student at Princeton University, examines the cause of Japan's economic strength and why, according to the author, America and Europe falsely believe this strength threatens their own economies. Ponnuru writes, "Neither a concern about trade imbalances nor fear of Japan's potential to surpass the economic might of other nations justify the adoption of self-destructive policies by those nations. America and Europe should refrain from raising their drawbridges against Japanese commerce, setting targets for trade in specific sectors, or indeed for overall trade balances, or forcing Japan to cut its savings rate." The author argues that many critics of Japan falsely credit Japan's success with the interventionist policies of its government. Ponnuru unequivocally believes that, on balance, interventions in the Japanese marketplace have hindered rather than helped Japan's economy. 47 pp. CONTACT: Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU, 071-828-1176.

<b>Soviet in Public, Azeri in Private: Gender, Islam, and Nationalism in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,</b> by Nayereh Tohidi<br>
<i>Working Papers No. I-95-9,</i> Hoover Institution
<p>
Nayareh Tohidi, research fellow and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, focuses on the intersection of gender, state socialism, nationality, and religion in Soviet and post-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The interplay between the Soviet state policy towards the "national question" and the "woman question" is demonstrated in the Muslim Azerbaijani context. It shows that, although Muslim Azeri women have accomplished an impressive level of emancipation, their overall status remains flawed with contradictions and duality. Similar to women of several other countries in the Muslim world confronting colonial domination or semi-colonial intrusion, Azeri women's liberation has been held hostage to their assigned responsibility as the primary repositories of tradition, ethnic, and national identity. In conclusion, gender dynamics of recent changes and a new search for national identity in the ethnically contested and war-stricken context of newly independent Azerbaijan is briefly explored. 30 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA 94305-6010, 415/723-3373.

<b>Keeping America Great: Toward a New Foreign Policy Doctrine,</b> by Malcolm Wallop<br>
<i>Heritage Lecture Series No. 526,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Former Senator from Wyoming and distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation Malcolm Wallop describes, in his remarks to Heritage's Annual Board Meeting in San Diego, how America, since the Bush presidency, has allowed her role as world leader to slip away. Wallop describes the effects of the "utter vacuum of [foreign] policy." The administration's focus on the economy led to further cuts in the military and lack of policy definition, and Wallop states, "No great nation can remain great, free, and prosperous without strength, purpose, and courage. Today America has the latter, some of the former, and none of the middle." To reconcile this situation, Wallop names six essential components of a new doctrine: "First, the safety of the homeland is the paramount obligation. Second, America has an interest in a world at peace, if only for economic reasons. Third, we are a trading nation needing markets as well as access to supplies. Fourth, we are a communicating nation, and that means access to space. Fifth, we are a nation of travelers and scholars. Sixth, we are a nation of conscience and freedomnot to impose it, but surely to support it." 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Do Sanctions Work? Economic Sanctions as a Tool of US Foreign Policy</b>
<i>Conference Summary,</i> American Enterprise Institute
<p>
This summary provides the comments of two separate panels, the first entitles "SanctionsImportant or Ineffective Tool of Foreign Policy." Shaun Donnely, deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions, and commodities for the US Department of State, described sanctions as the answer to situations where diplomatic initiatives are insufficient, but military action is not justified. Julius Katz, president of Hills & Company, points out that sanctions, in their historical context, have rarely worked. Zalmay Khalilzad, director of the Program for Strategy, Defense and Force Structure for RAND Project AIR FORCE, clearly regards sanctions (including the embargo of military technology) as an important instrument foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Richard Perle, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute uses the reasons to support sanctions which had been presented by Shaun Donnely and argues that they are exactly the reasons to oppose sanctions. Perle suggests that the US resorts to sanctions rather than a military effort is when it is not prepared to "bear the costs of real and effective action." The second panel, "The Efficacy of SanctionsThe Iraq, Iran, and Cuba Cases" examines the results of sanctions in these three countries. Micheal Eisenstadt, military fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; James Kinnear, former president and CEO of Texaco Inc.; and Otto Reich, director of the Brock Group offer their differing views. 8 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/862-5800.

<b>Commerce, Infrastructure & Regulation</b>
<b>Fair Lending Enforcement: How the Government Micromanages Banking,</b> by David J. McPherson<br>
Washington Legal Foundation
<p>
David McPherson, a banking and real estate attorney, argues that the recent fair lending enforcement campaign by the Department of Justice sets a disturbing precedent of the executive branch legislating by consent decree. This monograph discusses the legal basis for the Department of Justice enforcement actions and describes how, by prosecuting lending institutions for alleged discriminatory lending practices and forcing these institutions into consent decrees, the Justice Department has gone far beyond what is required by the federal fair lending laws and has confused sound lending practices with racial discrimination. McPherson advocates the cessation of attempts by the Justice Department to micromanage lending institutions and the encouragement in careful and consistent regulation and voluntary fair lending compliance by the lending community. 41 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<b>The Menace of Regulation,</b> by Michal Tosovsky<br>
Klub Mediator
<p>
Michal Tosovsky, president of the Czech Government Office for Standards, Metrology and Testing, defines the problems of regulation, focusing on Czech legislation since 1989, developments in the European Union, and experience gained from over-regulation in the United States. Tosovsky cites examples of excessive Czech legislation in the last five years: the Trading Act, Construction Act, Act on Authorized Architects and Engineers, Consumer Protection Act, Act on Czech Business Inspection Bureau, and the Act on State Testing. This paper examines these pieces of legislation and demonstrates the precedent they set for future increased regulation. The author concludes by recommending improvement of private legal mechanisms, implementation of EU regulations, coordination of deregulation measures and increased private deregulation initiatives. 23 pp. CONTACT: Klub Mediator, Box 115, 110 01 Praha 1, CZECH REPUBLIC, 42 2/539 568.

<b>The Myths and Realities of Trade Deficits,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1039</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Heritage policy analyst Bryan Johnson argues that the driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Johnson states that the administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits including: trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial; trade deficits cost jobs; Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies; since the US is unable to sell some goods and services in Japan, their markets must be closed; and trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs. Johnson challenges each of these assumptions and others, proving that trade retaliation, in most cases, has failed to open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b><i>Carolina Journal,</b></i> edited by John Hood<br>
June/July 1995, The John Locke Foundation
<p>
The cover story of this month's <i>Carolina Journal</i> by editor John Hood focuses on regulatory issues. The cover story, "Splitting Hairs", questions why North Carolina licenses so many occupations, ranging from barbers to veterinary technicians, without a sound public policy reason for doing so. Hood writes, "By lifting these onerous restrictions on enterprise, policy makers in North Carolina could help both producers and consumers by increasing competition, lowering prices, and fostering more economic opportunity for disadvantaged North Carolinians seeking a way out of poverty."

<b>Reinventing the Regulatory System: No Downsizing in Administration Plan,</b> by Melinda Warren and Barry Jones<br>
Occasional Paper No. 155, Center for the Study of American Business
<p>
Researchers Melinda Warren and Barry Jones question the administration's call for $16.6 billion in spending for regulatory programs in fiscal year 1996. Warren and Jones point out that this represents a 3.3 percent real increase, even after adjusting for inflation. This report also predicts that staffing figures will reach a new peak in 1996132,000 regulators. Warren and Jones conclude that the Clinton budget for 1996 appears to ignore the public's desire for less regulation and the administration's talk of reinventing government and streamlining the regulatory system has yet to be translated into action. 36 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Trade Policy Ahead: Three Tracks and One Question,</b> by Ernest H. Preeg<br>
Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>
Ernest Preeg, the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS, asserts that the structure of world trade has changed fundamentally in three ways since the early 1980s: 1) international trade in goods and services has become increasingly related to the international flow of capital, technology, and laborthe factors of production; 2)national economies and corporate strategies are increasingly dependent on international markets due largely to information-based technological change; 3)the polarization of the global industrialization process into three regions (Western Europe, North America, and East Asia) has intensified, one-half of world trade now takes place within these three regions. Preeg demonstrates that the changed structure has been reinforced by another change in the international trading systemfrom a multilateral yet, according to the author, narrowly drawn GATT to a system of multilateral commitments, regional free trade agreements, and selective bilateral accords.<i> Trade Policy Ahead </i>poses the question of how to manage the three tracks in a consistent, mutually reinforcing way toward broadly established goals. Preeg writes, "The time is finally ripe to include international investment policy within the framework of the multilateral trading system . . . and a central objective should be to launch negotiations for expansion of the WTO to a WTIOa World Trade and Investment Organization." 75 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, 202/887-0200.

<h3><i>Taxation and Budget</i></h3>
<p>
<b>The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<p>
Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business Survival Foundation, evaluates the current tax system and the leading proposals for reformthe flat tax, national retail sales tax, consumed-income tax, and the value-added tax (VAT). Each tax plan is analyzed according to eight criteria: ability to promote economic growth, rate of capital taxation, inflation factor, clarity of the tax system, simplicity, limits to bureaucracy and intrusiveness, minimized incentives for tax avoidance, and limitations to government spending. Keating offers a simple scoring system, assigning one point for each criteria fulfilled, a half point for each partially met, and zero points for those not met at all. From highest to lowest, the plans scored as follows: flat tax, national retail sales tax, VAT, consumed income tax, and the current income tax. The author concludes by recommending reducing the size of the federal government substantially and moving to a low, flat income tax of 10 percent, with no taxation of capital gains, dividends, interest from savings, or business income. Keating ultimately suggests repealing the 16th Amendment and replacing the income tax with a nation retail sales tax of less than 10 percent. 38 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th Street, NW, Suite 2000, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238, fax 202/822-8118.

<b>A Citizen's Guide to the State Budget Mess: A Menu of 217 Proposals to Reduce State Government Spending,</b> by Tom McClintock<br>
<i>Briefings</i>, The Claremont Institute
<p>
Former California Assemblyman Tom McClintock presents 217 specific reductions that could be made in the 1995-1996 California budget. Total savings from these proposals, which include contracting out services, abolishing obsolete agencies and programs, controlling the growth of the bureaucracy, and operation reforms, amount to more that $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items. This work breaks the budget down into ten areas, from state and consumer services to health and welfare to youth and adult corrections. The author identifies many of the smaller, less costly programs that often get "lost" in the process of compiling large budgets. The savings amount to 13 percent of all funds proposed to be spent in the Governor's budget, or 18 percent of General and Special Funds. These proposals would also eliminate $725 million in fees to California citizens. 51 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 2012 H St., Suite 101, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916/446-7924.

<b>What To Do About Medicare,</b> Stuart M. Butler, Robert E. Moffitt, and John C. Liu<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1038</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Stuart Butler, vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies, Bob Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies, and John Liu, policy analyst, demonstrate that for the Medicare system to achieve long-term actuarial balance without reform, the trust fund would require an immediate payroll tax increase of 3.52 percent, which would raise taxes by $711 billion over the next five years. This increase would only fund the hospital program, not the fund for physicians' services. This paper suggests, "Instead of trying to tighten current controls on deregulation, the proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits." Butler, Moffit, and Liu recommend offering the a plan modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The major difference between this and the current system is that the government would make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, rather that reimbursing Washington-approved service according to a fee schedule. This paper concludes that if Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in health service or working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes. Reform would provide a new Medicare system based on consumer choice, with security for both today and tomorrow's retirees. 22 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: Answering the Critics</b>, by Michael Tanner<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 228</i>, Cato Institute
<p>
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at Cato, seeks to answer the concerns of the critics of consumer-based health care. Tanner addresses four questions often raised by those who oppose MSAs: claims that health care has become so complex that consumers are unable to make cost-conscious decisions about their treatment; claims that consumers will forgo necessary or preventative care to save money in their medical savings accounts; claims that MSAs would attract the healthy, while the sick remain in conventional insurance programs; and claims that MSAs are regressive, providing benefits primarily to the wealthy. This paper provides the information that supporters of MSAs require to rebut the arguments of those opposing reform. The author admits that MSAs are not perfect, but maintains that they represent a significant step toward solving the cost and access problems of our health care system. 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>The Private-Sector Health Care Revolution: How It's Controlling Costs Across Florida and America,</b> by Melanie S. Tammen<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 16</i>, James Madison Institute
<p>
James Madison Institute research associate Melanie Tammen reveals that, despite the failure of Medicare and Medicaid, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and President Clinton continue to promote plans which will force more and more people into government-intermediated health care programs. This paper maintains that Chiles' Florida Health Security Plan would dramatically expand the scope of the state's 11 new regional purchasing alliances by having them sell government subsidized health plans to low and middle-income residents. Tammen recommends reforms that facilitate universal coverage and affordability in marketplace, rather than plans to provide universal coverage along with large, expensive, taxpayer-financed programs. Tammen encourages Florida legislators to oppose Florida's new health care bureaucracy, the Community Health Purchasing Alliances, and pursue measures to further development of private sector reform. 16 pp. CONTACT: The James Madison Institute for Public Policy Studies, P.O.

<b>Managing Doctors</b>, by Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill<br>
The David Hume Institute
<p>
Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill, both of Glasgow Caledonian University, focus on how health care moneys are to be managed and acknowledge the conflict between the managerial and clinical goals of the National Health Service in Scotland. This paper surveys opinions and beliefs of health managers and doctors in the West of Scotland. Bruce and Hill demonstrate that future reforms will require the input of both managers and doctors, in order to define a common agenda. This work begins the process of discovering the views of doctors, managers, and consultants towards research, management, medical direction, clinical direction, and training and preparation of doctors for management. The authors conclude by assessing the value of doctors as full-time managers, part-time managers, and as advisors. 49 pp. CONTACT: The David Hume Institute, 21 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, SCOTLAND, 0131/650-4633 or fax 0131/667-9111.

<b>Government in Health Care: Lessons from the UK</b>, by W. Duncan Reekie<br>
The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies
<p>
Duncan Reekie, the Bradlow Professor of Business Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, criticizes, as one who grew up under Britain's National Health Service (NHS), the Clinton administration's approach to health care. The proponents of NHS used the same arguments used by the Clintons, and the author investigates these arguments, revealing their flaws from 1948 and now. Reekie recognizes that the Clintons' plan is substantially different from the NHS and that most of the alternate plans in Congress are subject to market-based objections as well. The author discusses why he believes a Clinton health care program, like the NHS, would lead to a politicized health care system dominated by special interests, "fostering not trust but distrust between patient and physician." Reekie demonstrates that once a government-dominated health care system is in place, it is nearly impossible to abolish. This paper warns the American electorate of the perils of national health care and urges Americans to learn from the mistakes of the UK. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies, School of Business and Economics, California State University, Hayward, CA 94542, 510/885-3275, or fax 510/885-4442.

<b>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</b> by Cynthia Ramsay and Michael Walker
<i>Critical Issues Bulletin</i>, Fraser Forum
<p>
The current<i> Critical Issues Bulletin </i>attempts to document the extent to which lines are being used as a means of adapting to the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and potentially unlimited demand for free health care in the Canadian health system. Ramsay and Walker compiled data based on the waiting time in hospitals across Canada. The results suggest, based on the increased waiting times and the increased concern of the government to continue to supply the norm of health care services, that waiting lists have become an alternative to rising prices by restraining health care expenses in a system where prices have been systematically eliminated and neither physicians nor patients have any economic incentive to consider the costs of their decisions. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Fraser Institute, 626 Bute St., Vancouver, BC, CANADA V6E 3MI, 604/688-0221.

<b>Welfare Reform: Allow Welfare to Wither So Charities Can Bloom,</b> by Stuart Anderson<br>
<i>Issue Brief</i>, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
Stuart Anderson, policy director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, suggests that public policy analysts should pose two questions: in what areas are charitable organizations superior to the government in providing sevices to those less fortunate? and how can American society put more resources into the hands of charitable organizations to provide those services? This paper recommends that these decisions be made at a local level, and therefore the federal welfare system must give states flexibility to design their own approaches without interference from Washington. This study presents three significant findings: 1) the non-profit group Community for Creative Non-Violence spent $365,000 in 1992 to house 1400 homeless individuals on a nightly basis, while the DC government spent $26.4 million to house 2280 homeless people nightly in government shelters; 2) over a period of years, the city government paid the Pitts Hotel the $12.48 per person, per day for food, which amounted to 78 times the cost of three meals provided by the charity-run DC Central Kitchen (with donations and food purchased from local food banks, the DC Kitchen can serve meals at a cost of 16 cents per person.); and 3) advocates for the poor are restricted by regulations that  limit flexibility and creativity. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

<h3><i>Education</h3></i>
<p>
<b>Public Schools: Make Them Private,</b> by Milton Friedman<br>
<i>Briefing Papers No. 23,</i> Cato Institute
<p>
Milton Friedman addresses the immediate need to reconstruct the education system at both the elementary and secondary levels to offset the growing wage differential crisis in the United States. He recommends privatizing a large segment of the school system, allowing for the creation of a for-profit education industry. This plan would offer effective competition to public schools by creating a free-market for choice in education. The system he proposes enables parents to select the schools their children attend by means of a universal voucher system that would be sufficient to cover the costs of a high-quality education. 7 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>School Choice: Its Time Has Come,</b> by Allyson M. Tucker and William F. Lauber<br>

<p>
Allyson M. Tucker, policy council director at the National Policy Forum, and William F. Lauber aid to Representative Chris Cox (R-CA); both former Heritage Foundation analysts, report strong evidence that concludes that the school choice movement is gaining ground at the state level. Their argument originates from the strong results pro-school choice candidates had at the polls in the 1994 elections, indicating that 1995 could be the year that school choice legislation will make significant gains. Lisa Graham was elected for state superintendent of schools in Arizona, with 59 percent of the vote, on a platform centered on school choice. At the gubernatorial level, candidates such as George W. Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, and John Rowland of Connecticut won as advocates of school choice. Proponents of choice can also expect action from Congress in 1995. Debate is going on in both chambers on "how the federal government can help states implement choice." Discussion is expected to focus on using funds from Chapter One for vouchers. Chapter One is the largest federal aid program for poor elementary and secondary students. Other articles address the tax status of the NEA and deregulating schools. 3 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palantine, IL 60067-6516, 708/202-3060, or fax 708/202-9799.

The release of this issue is very timely in light of the events that have transpired since the initial objections raised against<i> Standards </i>last fall: 1) the National Center for History in the Schools, the group that issued<i> Standards,</i> sent a mailing to educators in February urging them to lobby their congressman in defense of<i> Standards;</i> 2) the National Center is launching an aggressive marketing campaign to sell <i>Standards</i> as solid material for teaching history to children in kindergartenindicating that the campaign is not only motivated by ideology, but also by profit; 3) and finally, three liberal foundations have recently put up $300,000 to form panels to review the <i>U.S. and World History Standards.</i> 95 pp. CONTACT: Young America's Foundation, F.M.

<b>School Choice: A Time and Place to Begin,</b> by J. Stanley Marshall<br>
Floridians for Educational Choice
<p>
J. Stanley Marshall, Chairman and CEO of The James Madison Institute, and Acting Director of Floridians for Educational Choice, provides another chapter in the fight for the school choice movement in America. Marshall advocates the theory that parents, as opposed to government bureaucrats, are more able to select the schools their children attend based upon: the values they embrace, the teachers they employ, and the curriculum they uphold. The author also provides an in-depth section in his paper devoted to rebutting the attacks school choice opponents most commonly use to halt the movement. He debunks fifteen myths surrounding the school choice debate, including: 1) school choice is unconstitutional at state and local levels; 2) choice carries a heavy price tag; 3) school choice will wipe out the gains made in desegregation; and 4) choice will relegate poor children to the worst schools. 52 pp. CONTACT: Floridians for Educational Choice, P.O.

<b>The Budgetary Implication of Eliminating the U.S. Department of Education,</b> by John E. Berthoud<br>
The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
John E. Berthoud, vice president of The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, presents his case for eliminating the U.S. Department for Education. While debate continues on the educational benefits of returning control of education to state and local governments, Berthoud's paper makes the case for the potential cost savings of such decentralization. Terminating the department would eliminate the cost of maintaining a separate bureaucracy and the interest group pressures to increase spending. Alexis de Tocqueville Institution also reported the following findings: 1) eliminating the U.S. Department of Education would save taxpayers $15.7 billion dollars over a five-year period; 2) since education became the 12th cabinet department in 1979, the department's spending has risen three times as fast as the non-defense discretionary budget; and 3) taxpayers would have saved 5 billion dollars since 1979, if federal education spending had grown at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending. 17pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

<b>Religion in the Classroom: What the Textbooks Tell Us,</b> by Gilbert T. Sewall<br>
American Textbook Council
<p>
Gilbert T. Sewall, Director of the American Textbook Council and author of the report, examines the controversy surrounding the lack of coverage religion receives in the classroom. The author argues that textbooks view the traditional Judeo-Christian conceptions with indifference. Moreover, history requirements have been replaced by classes such as personal awareness and self-esteem that promulgate these new moral credos. The author concludes, "Schools should become more sensitive to insinuations and attacksboth subtle and directthat diminish Judeo-Christian symbols, morals, traditions that many school clients hold sacred and look to as essential guides in raising their children." 33pp. CONTACT: The American Textbook Council, 475 Riverside Drive, Room 518, New York, NY 10115, 212/870-2760.

<b><i>Plowing Ground in Washington: The Political Economy of US Agriculture,</b></i> by B. Delworth Gardner<br>
Pacific Research Institute
<p>
B. Delworth Gardner, professor emeritus at Brigham Young University, explores the consequences and incentives of current agricultural policies. Gardner asserts that farm subsidies reduce the national standard of living and redistribute income from taxpayers and consumers to farmers and landowners. This book shows how consumers pay for agricultural products twice, first in taxes to provide subsidies and then in retail stores with higher prices caused by the subsidies. Gardner also focuses on the environmental damages caused by farms subsidies. The book concludes by recommending the elimination of the agricultural subsidy process and increasing the sale of American agriculture abroad. 348 pp. CONTACT: Pacific Research Institute, 755 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA 94111, 415/989-0833.

<b>Superfund: This Time Let's Get It Right,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 154,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>
Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at CSAB, acknowledges that Superfund, due to its perverse and conflicting incentives, encourages litigation and delay among conflicting parties rather than the clean up of Superfund sites. As Congress attempts to repair the damage of Superfund legislation, Mahoney suggests Ten Points of Resolution: retroactive liability should be retained as in the current law; insurance issues should be left to settlement by the parties involved; joint and several liability would be replaced by proportionate liability; the highest priority is the completion of Superfund's Emergency Removal program; no new additions should be made to the Superfund NPL list during the life of the Emergency Removal program; Superfund sites should be divided into two categories, those where containment is satisfactory and those whose future use is yet undetermined or unlikely to be industrial; a substantial amount of Superfund moneys would be allocated to proposals to develop cost-effective, neighbor-friendly permanent remediation; communities should be empowered and funded for full participation in the Superfund Trust; minor participants at sites should be relieved from all future liability upon payment of a nominal share; and minority and/or poor communities would receive preferential priority. Mahoney suggests that these Ten Points of Resolution represent an outline for Superfund reform and provide a basis for tradeoffs among the various parties' interests. 9 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

"Free Intraprising the Forest Service" reveals that, in the Forest Service's reinvention plan, a major innovation involves internal enterprise units. "Timber Sale Subsidies, But Who Gets Them?" reports that Forest Service's 1993 and 1994 returns to the Treasury were $800 million less than cost.

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the Regulatory Smog,</b> by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
<i><b>Policy Analysis No. 233</i></b>, Cato Institute
<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argue that the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided because it fails to account for current population trends and is based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This paper describes how this is particularly important in the Ozone Transport Region, the 12 states from Virginia to Maryland. The regulatory programs being proposed resemble the low-emission vehicle standards in California. The authors write, "The sort of control for control's sake' pollution control strategies pursued by the EPA and the Ozone Transportation Commission are largely inappropriate because they are neither cost-effective nor equitable means of achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be necessary." This paper recommends alleviating unneeded and costly regulatory mandates under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

Marshall Wittman, Heritage senior fellow in Congressional Affairs, and Charles P. Griffin, Heritage deputy House liaison, reveal that each year American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations which may use the money to advance their political agendas. They find that Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy. Wittman and Griffin write, "Taxpayer funding of advocacy groups is wrongfiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the people. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."

<b>Defenders Unclog Brace's Path to High Court</b><br>
Defenders of Property Rights has come to the aid of Pennsylvania farmer Bob Brace, who is being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He has been accused of violating federal wetlands statutes. Defenders has filed an amicus brief in support of Mr. Brace's petition to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The government claims Brace violated Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act when he upgraded his farm's drainage system in 1977. This improvement, which allowed him to farm thirty acres of land that was previously useful for little more than pasture, was cited as an unpermitted discharge of fill. The EPA ordered him to remove the drainage system to allow the land to return to its alleged "natural state" as a wetland. Failure to do so could subject him to fines as high as $25,000 a day.
Mr. Brace contends his changes to the property are permitted by the Clean Water Act. Section 404(f) states that discharge permits are not required for "normal farming activity," specifically stating "the maintenance of drainage ditches...is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under this section."<br>
Brace can expect word from the high court as to whether whey will hear his case sometime this fall.

The controversy began I May of 1991, when a female student initially accused Tonkovich of making "a pass" at her following a school party three years ago. He has vehemently denied the charge. Several months later, this accusation mushroomed into an allegation of sex and sexual harassment. The allegation was uncorroborated and was contradicted by other female students.

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Strikes Down Scheme that Raised Utility Costs
In a case in which the New England Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down an ordinance enacted by the city of Somerville which required utilities to pay a single contractor chosen by the city to do all excavation and paving work on city streets. The chosen contractor had used its government-created monopoly to charge utilities twice the rate it charged for such work in neighboring towns.<br>
The "City Contract Representative" was chosen by the city but paid by any utility that had to do street work. Bid specifications were so narrowly drawn that only one contractor qualified for the job. Utilities which refused to use the Representative were denied needed permits. The Representative had no incentive to work quickly nor, because its pay is based on the amount of asphalt used, efficiently. Because the city instructed the Representative to put the street into better condition than it was before being opened, it was able to make utilities and, ultimately, their customers pay for routine street work.<br>
An <i>amicus  </i>brief filed by NELF argued that the Somerville ordinance was not only unwise but that it exceeded the city's legal authority to maintain public streets and conflicted with state's supervisory power over utility regulation. In effect, NELF argued, Somerville had imposed an unauthorized and illegal tax on all utility customers. The Supreme Judicial Court has now agreed.

<b>NELF to File Brief in Connecticut Trespasser Tort Case</b><br>
In Hartford, Connecticut, a thief decided to steal from what appeared to be an abandoned electric switchbox, despite bold-faced warning signs posted in English and Spanish. When the thief was shocked and seriously injured, he sued the utility, claiming that it should have taken more care to protect potential thieves from possible injuries. A Superior Court judge in Connecticut threw out the case; the thief is appealing.<br>
NELF will file an<i> amicus </i>brief supporting the lower court. In this case, as in other recent Rhode Island and Vermont cases, NELF will argue that the traditional common law rule, that landowners are not obliged to spend money making their property safe for trespassers, is both good and sound public policy. Furthermore, NELF will argue that a state PUC rule, which requires utilities to take reasonable precautions to ensure that consumers and others are not endangered by company equipment, did not require anything more than the clear and visible warnings which the company did post.<br>

<b>Fighting Against Government Extortion</b><br>
<i>Ehrlich v. City of Culver City.</i> In June, PLF filed a friend of the court brief in the California Supreme Court in one of the most important "regulatory takings" cases to come before the state justices in 17 years. Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich's attempt to invalidate "mitigating" fees imposed on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing development.<br>
For several years, Mr. Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a town-house condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the building project on the condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts.<br>
PLF contends that the fee is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality test laid down last June by the U.S. Supreme Court in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard.</i> In<i> Dolan,</i> The Supreme Court invalidated a condition by the City of Tigard, Oregon, that a landowner give 10% of her property for public use in exchange for a permit to expand her plumbing supply store. Such conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exaction must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community.<br>
PLF helped Mr. Ehrlich win an order from the U.S. Supreme Court that 1) vacated a Court of Appeal ruling upholding the city's fees, and 2) sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions to reconsider in light of the <i>Dolan</i> decision. The Court of Appeal affirmed that development fees must meet the high level of scrutiny required by <i>Dolan.</i> Unfortunately, it misapplied the<i> Dolan </i>test to the facts of this case and held that the fee was related to the impacts caused by a change in land use designation needed for the construction of the condominiums.<br>
PLF also will assist Mr. Ehrlich's attorney in preparing for oral argument before the state Supreme Court.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down Congressional Ballot Access Restrictions</b><br>
<i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton.</i> In a major setback for term limit proponents, the U.S. Supreme Court held on May 22, that voter-enacted ballot access restrictions on members of Congress are unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Justices held that the qualifications for congressional services set forth in the Constitution are "fixed" in that they may not be supplemented by Congress or the states. PLF, on behalf of Citizens for Term Limits filed friend of the court briefs in the case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case and arguing in support of Arkansas' ballot access measure, Amendment 73.<br>
Amendment 73, an amendment to Arkansas' constitution, prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for Congress form appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. That person could run as a write-in candidate, however. PLF attorneys argued, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution permits states to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of elections. They asserted that measures like Amendment 73 do not bar anyone from running for office, but only restrict ballot access in certain circumstances.<br>
The High Court ruled that the Constitution is the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress and that states may not add qualifications. Even though Amendment 73 allows congressional candidates to run as "write-in" candidates and serve if elected, the Court nevertheless considered this to be an indirect attempt at evading the Qualifications Clause's requirements.
The ruling has absolutely nothing to do with term limits on state officeholders. But according to recent news stories some term limit opponents are claiming the decision may open the door to a renewed challenge to term limits imposed on state legislators and constitutional officers. PLF successfully represented the proponents of California's Proposition 140 (state term limits) before the California and United Sates Supreme Courts. Any attempt to relitigate and overturn that settled victory will be met by a forceful defense by PLF attorneys.

<b>Important Rent Control Victory in New York Upheld</b><br>
<i>Manocherian v. Lenox Hill Hospital</i>. Late May, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review and let stand a key property rights decision by New York's highest court. Last October, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the state's rent control law relating to the subleasing of rent-stabilized apartments as applied to nonprofit hospitals. PLF filed a friend of the court brief in support of the property owner.<br>
Lenox Hill Hospital leases rent-stabilized apartments in New York and subleases them to its nurses as an employee benefit. Ten years ago, Lenox Hill Secured passage of a law that required apartment owners who lease apartments to the hospital to offer lease renewals directly to Lenox Hill rather than to the individual nurses who occupy the apartments. Because Lenox Hill has a perpetual corporate existence, this law has the effect of denying the owners any expectation of being able to reoccupy their property, as they could if their primary tenant was a natural person. <br>
New York's highest court declared the law to be unconstitutional for "not substantially advancing a closely and legitimately connected State interest."<br>
In its majority opinion, the Court of Appeals returned again and again to <i>Nollan's </i>requirement that property regulations be closely related to the advancement of a legitimate governmental interest. <i>Nollan </i>and other recent Supreme Court cases are seen to lay down "a constitutional minimum floor of protection which this Court lacks authority to diminish under the Supremacy Clause."<br>

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent Lynn Westfall because they agreed to allow a citizen group to place a box of free Bibles for students on school property. The Rutherford Institute represented the school board and the superintendent in the case tried before U.S. District Court Judge Irene M. Keeley.<br>
The case began on Dec. 6, 1994 when the school board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on Feb. 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis. As a result, on Feb. 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students while the case was pending.<br>
The Rutherford Institute asked the court to recognize that a public school's decision to permit outside groups to make free written materials available to students does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because the outside group chooses the Bible as the material to make available.

DeSoto, Texas, May 22, 1995--Late yesterday, the DeSoto Independent School District agreed to allow valedictorian Shannon Leigh Welch to deliver an unedited graduation speech containing references to God and to religion. Gregory P. Gorman, a participating attorney with The Rutherford Institute, represented Welch. <br>
On May 18, 1995, Welch submitted her speech to the school's English Department for grammatical editing. As a result, school officials informed Welch that school policy required her to remove religious references and the words "God" and "Jesus Christ" from her speech. School officials also advised Welch to rewrite her speech.<br>
The Rutherford Institute, on May 21, 1995, hand delivered opinion letters to the school board, superintendent and principal, informing them that they were violating Welch's constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights by forcing her to remove religious references from her speech.

WLF filed a brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on behalf of itself; David Prosser, Jr., Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly; and a bipartisan group of federal and state legislators and Wisconsin citizens in support of a Wisconsin welfare reform measure in<i> V.C. v. Whitburn.</i> Under benefits for the first six months of their Wisconsin residence as if they were in their former state. WLF's brief opposes the suit brought by Legal Action of Wisconsin, which claims that the program violates the recipients' constitutional right to travel and that federal statutory and regulatory requirements governing research experiments on human subjects require Wisconsin to obtain the consent of all welfare recipients who are affected by the program.

<b>Constitutionality of "Official English" Defended in Ninth Circuit</b><br>
In <i>Yniguez v. State of Arizona, WLF </i>filed a brief on behalf of itself and the Center for Equal Opportunity in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of Arizona's "Official English" 1988 ballot measure, which amended the Arizona Constitution to require that the state and local governments of Arizona must act in English (with exceptions to protect public health or safety, to protect the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual education). Following passage of the measure, Arizona was sued by a state employee who claimed she has a First Amendment right to continue to practice conversing with Spanish-speaking malpractice claimants in Spanish and to continue filling out release-of claim forms in Spanish--a language that her supervisor did not understand, leaving him unable to review the forms. WLF's brief was filed before the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc, which will review the panel decision that accepted the employee's position and struck down the amendment in its entirety.<br>

<p><b>Retreat or Reform? Russia's Struggle for Democracy,</b> by Robert Halfon<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 62,</I> Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<p>Robert Halfon, director of research at Market Access International, a leading public affairs consultancy in the UK, points out that the re-emergence of hardline communism as a significant political force is a matter of great concern. He suggests that the real danger lies in the way in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic party justify Russian "sabre-rattling" in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, for the purpose of intimidating the West into accepting policies which may prove detrimental to its interests. Halfon cites the military-industrial complex and the former KGB leaders as other areas where communists still present an obstacle to liberalization. Therefore, the author concludes, western democracies have a crucial role to play in identifying and promoting Russian democratic groups and leaders and encouraging their political programs. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, ENGLAND, W1P 3FP, 0171/637-2152, or fax 0171/637-2155.

This paper questions the ability of the military to deal effectively with the New World disorder, in light of recent cutbacks. Gold also explores why increased spending will be necessary in certain technological areas. The author argues that, in the long run, the proper course is not to spend more but to spend more wisely.

<p><b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act: Helping to Create a Free and Prosperous Cuba,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 208,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson examines the possible effects of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which is currently before the Senate. He encourages the Senate to take this opportunity to strengthen the bill which passed the House by including several measures: 1) strengthen the provision prohibiting international financial institutions from providing loans and guarantees to Castro's Cuba; 2) create a provision designating as a hostile act any move by Castro to unleash a mass exodus of illegal emigrants; 3) restore Cuba's share of US sugar import quotas to near its 1958 level once Castro is gone and a democratic transition government is in place; 4) eliminate language authorizing the President to provide government-subsidized financing and other programs to a post-Castro Cuba; 5) direct the President to seek a free trade area agreement with a post-Castro Cuba; and 6) require that the President begin processing the 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo for controlled entry into the US. Johnson proposes that these measures will tighten the existing embargo and help end Castro's 40 year nightmare in Cuba. 10 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>NATO and US Interests, </b>by W. Bruce Weinrod<br>
<i>Commonsense, Vol. 2 No. 1,</i> National Policy Forum
<p>W. Bruce Weinrod, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy in the Bush administration, outlines and addresses the serious questions being raised about the relevance and future of NATO. As the United States and its European allies enter a new era in international politics, NATO must decide how its role and membership reflect this new era. Weinrod writes, "The best way for NATO to help assure a Europe 'whole and free' is to bring the democratic nations of Europe closer to NATO, with the objective of making them members." In order to clarify these decisions for NATO, the US must first clarify many of the foggy points of its own foreign policy, and the current administration must be willing to exert its leadership over this process. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Policy Forum, 229<P8M><$E1/2><P255D> Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-2900.

<p><b>Do We Need the IMF and the World Bank?,</b> by Sir Alan Walters<br>
<i>Current Controversies No. 10,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Before embarking on any new initiatives for either the IMF or the World Bank, Walters suggests, these two powerful institutions are overdue for a performance re-examination. Walters, having formerly served as an economic advisor to the Prime Minister, points out that attempts to downsize the Fund and the Bank always end up making them larger. The author also acknowledges that both institutions, besides outgrowing their original purposes, have become increasingly political particularly in the case of Russia, where normal conditions have been relaxed. Walters concludes, "ideally the Bank and the Fund should be abolished. If central banks want a central bankers' bank they (not governments) should control it."

<p><b>About-Turn in Hungarian Foreign Policy,1990-1994, </b>by Ivn Bba<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 2,</i> Windsor Klub
<p>Once known as the Happiest Barracks in the Camp, Hungary did more than any other ex-Warsaw Pact state after 1989 to undo the legacy of the international order created by the Cold War. Guided by the statesmanlike vision of Prime Minister Jzsef Antall, Hungarian foreign policy between 1990 and 1994 consistently pursued the aims of Euro-Atlantic integration and regional co-operation. Despite the break-up of no less than three neighboring countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union), Hungary remained an important source of stability and pro-Western resolve. In this study, the deputy state secretary at the foreign ministry for these years assesses the successes and failures of his country's policies and considers the impact that last year's electoral victory by the Socialist Party will have on Hungary's acceding to such institutions as NATO and the EU. 29 pp. CONTACT: Johnathan Sunley, Windsor Klub, Falk Miksa utca 12.I.1a, Budapest 1055, HUNGARY, 361/112-3701

<p><b>Red Tape In America: Stories From The Front Line,</b> by Craig E. Richardson and Geoff C. Ziebart, The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Heritage Foundation's report on American bureaucracy reveals the horror stories that result from a regulatory system that has become not merely ineffective but harmful. This study begins by reviewing the general impact of government regulation and then examines specific federal agencies and statutes. Among these are the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, the Internal Revenue Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Americans with Disability Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The cases documented in this report provide irrefutable proof of the degree to which government regulation has harmed both individuals and businesses, stifling creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. 110 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Fixing the Roads: A Blueprint for Michigan Transportation Infrastructure Policy,</B> by John C. Taylor<br>
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy 
<p>This comprehensive analysis of Michigan's transportation argues that policy makers must fundamentally reinvent the planning, funding, construction, and maintenance procedures for the state's roads. The federal government returns to Michigan about half the revenues the state sends to Washington from the federal fuel tax. The author projects a savings of over $170 million in the state's department of transportation budget if the state adopted various reforms, including more privatization, tort reform, and relaxation of unrealistic environmental regulations. This study will prove useful to transportation analysts in most other states, as well. 40 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<p><b>The Minimum Wage: No Way to Help the Poor,</b> by Deepak Lal<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 95,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Deepak Lal, a professor of International Development Studies at UCLA, examines the controversy among economists about the effects of a minimum wage. Despite the many recent studies which apparently support the views of politicians in Britain and the US, minimum wages would have widespread effects on labor markets: they would, for example, reduce human capital formations because they would compress the wage structure and undermine incentives to acquire skills. Thus, support for a minimum wage is "at odds with the desire to promote skill accumulation by unskilled workers particularly the young and females. The author suggests that those who fear a situation where workers do not properly market their skills should still be wary of the minimum wage since "there is not obvious technocratic solution which would be better than that discovered by the market." 38 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London, England  SW1P 3LB, 071/799-3745.

<p><b>A Higher Standard of Living in Right-to Work States,</b> by James T. Bennett<br>
National Institute for Labor Relations Research
<p>James Bennett's study reveals that residents of Right-to-Work states have higher real incomes on average than the residents of states where workers are forced to pay union dues. In his report Bennett shows that after adjusting for state and local taxes and inflation, the average family in a Right-to-Work state has $2,852 more in purchasing power than a family in a forced-unionism state. The author writes, "In states without Right-to-Work laws high taxes and the high cost of living erode the purchasing power of income so much that families in states with Right-to-Work laws are, on average, better off." This study compares 1993 state and local taxes, as well as the cost of living, in those metropolitan areas in Right-to-Work states to those in forced-unionism states. 12 pp. CONTACT: National Institute for Labor Relations Research, 8001 Braddock Rd., Suite 510, Springfield, VA 22160, 703/321-9606, fax 703/321-7342.

<p><b>The Urgent Need to Finish Farm Trade Reform,</b> by Thomas J. Duesterberg<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 177,</i> Hudson Institute 
<p>Senior Fellow and Director of the Competitiveness Center Thomas Duesterberg demonstrates that the developing world is experiencing a tremendous growth in demand for bulk foodstuffs and processed foods, as the economies of these countries continue to prosper. Duesterberg forecasts that the US agricultural industry is one of the few in the world that can meet this growing demand in an environmentally friendly way. Despite considerable obstacles in much of the developing world including outright bans on many Asian countries, severe restraints, and high tariffs US agricultural exports achieved record sales in 1994. This paper concludes that the US, in order to take advantage of the coming increase in worldwide food demand, must unshackle US producers, and US trade negotiators must take aggressive steps to remove barriers to worldwide trade in bulk and processed agricultural products. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Redesigning CERCLA Liability: An Analysis of the Issues,</b> by Kathleen Segerson<br>
Policy Study No. 187, Reason Foundation
<p>This policy study, prepared by University of Connecticut economics professor Kathleen Segerson, examines reform options for Superfund liability. Segerson explores strict liability, joint and several liability, and retroactive liability as they function in current Superfund law and suggests that the present system does not allocate risks and costs effectively or fairly. She concludes that in cases of retroactive application, strict liability should be eliminated and a negligence-based rule should be adopted for both care and mitigation; and in cases of prospective application, strict liability should be retained, and joint and several liability should be eliminated, except when the parties have a contractual relationship. 20 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>A Report Card on the Pressler Telecommunications Plan (S. 652),</b> by Adam D. Thierer<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 209,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Adam Thierer, Walker Fellow in Economic Policy examines why the leading telecommunications deregulation bill in the Senate misses the opportunity to benefit consumers by opening the industry to real competition. This paper explains that the Senate must make several major changes to the current bill, since it currently does not address several issues: some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect; foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of US industry and could be enforced retroactively after repeal; no serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the agency; no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to encourage increased wireless competition; and the current bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that discourage industry competition. 17 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><h3><i>Taxation and Budget</h3></i>

<b><p>Jobs, Growth, Freedom and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax,</b> by Daniel J. Mitchell<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1035,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Armey flat tax proposal has been wildly popular with American taxpayers, not only due to its simplicity but also because of its fairness and potential for producing economic growth. But many taxpayers are not aware of other positive effects of the flat tax: 1) the flat tax would boost national wealth by $1 trillion, since investments would be guided by profitability rather than tax status. 2) a flat tax would treat people equally, no longer penalizing taxpayers based on success or income. 3) Armey's plan would end micromanagement and political favoritism, ridding the tax code of all deduction, loopholes, credits, and special preferences. 4) the flat tax would increase civil liberties by increasing the rights of a taxpayer under IRS investigation. 5) the flat tax would increase tax collections from the wealthy, since the proposal includes incentives to earn and report taxable income. Mitchell concludes that the most important benefit from the flat tax proposal is the reduction of the power of the federal government in taxpayers' lives and businesses. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Who Really Gains from the Capital Gains Tax?,</b> by Alan Reynolds<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 175,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Director of Economic Research Alan Reynolds demonstrates why the capital gains tax is an extremely inefficient method of raising revenue. Reynolds claims that  the capital gains tax is easy to avoid, and reporting and monitoring costs are high. The paper reveals that an even worse effect is that the tax decreases the market value of investments and real estate and hinders the economy's allocation of capital assets to their most effective uses. The paper contends that reducing the captial gains tax to to no more than 15 percent, and indexing the basis, would make many people better off (particularly workers) without making anyone worse off. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Why You Can't Trust the IRS,</b> by Daniel J. Pilla<br>
Policy Analysis No. 222, Cato Institute
<p>Daniel Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, forecasts that some 40 million Americans will have had an adversarial confrontation with the IRS by the end of this year. In a rising number of cases, the taxpayer is right, and the IRS is wrong. This study finds that despite a doubling of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering and enforcing the nation's tax law. This report cites several reasons the IRS can no longer be trusted, including: 1) the IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5 million Americans the wrong answers to even the most basic inquiries about tax laws; 2) this year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion in fines and penalties about half of these notices will be wrong; 3) about 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties in 1993 taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion; and 4) a General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence; the IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation. Pilla reasons that since the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability that it imposes on the citizenry, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to police American businesses and taxpayers. 32 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>The Coming Taxpayer Bailout of Social Security,</b> by Gary and Aldona Robbins<br>
<i>IPI Policy Report No. 130,</i> The Institute for Policy Innovation
<p>This study argues that the disappearance of the Social Security Trust fund is due to two factors. First, the US economy has performed more poorly than expected. The last recession, combined with expectations of slower future growth, has caused almost one-quarter of the payroll tax base to evaporate. Second, the Social Security program is making promises it cannot keep, committing to replacing about 42 percent of the average worker's salary in retirement, as contrasted with the one-third of salary replacement promised during Social Security's first three decades. Meanwhile, Medicare benefits are also growing at an even more alarming rate. The authors point out that the revenues necessary to support this rapid growth in Social Security and Medicare will claim almost 15 percent of the US economy within the next 35 years, giving the federal government even greater control over the productive resources of Americans than it already has. The report states that the only way to secure the retirement of the baby boomers is to boost US economic growth and slow the rate of benefit growth. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

<p><b>The Pension Funds Bail-Out: The Biggest Boondoggle Ever,</B> by Steven Plaut<br>
<i>Policy View No. 12,</i> The Shalem Center
<p>Plaut, a professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of Haifa, analyses the Israeli government's proposed bail-out of the Histadrut Labor Federation's collapsed pension funds and how to solve the problem. Plaut asserts that passage of the deal would be an unprecedented blow to the Israeli economy: the price tag is estimated at $33 billion, about 40 percent of Israel's annual GDP. This is roughly 15 times the size (proportionally) of the American saving and loan bailout of the 1980s. This study shows that the worst part of the bail-out is the plan's inability to address the causes of the crisis. The bail-out leaves the management of the pension funds in the hands of the very people who oversaw the creation of the present actuarial deficits. It does nothing to change the monopolistic, uncompetitive structure of the pension industry in Israel, nor does it address the lack of independent supervision of the pension industry. Plaut recommends that free entry and competition should be allowed among pension plans; issuing subsidized government bonds to the pension funds must end at once; actuarial solvency must be made mandatory, and an independent supervisory body must be established to shut down plans not in compliance. 17 pp. CONTACT: The Shalem Center National Policy Institute, 5 Eliash St., Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 02/254-185, or fax 02/256-720.

<p>This paper examines the ramifications of excise taxes for Indiana. John Berthoud, Adjunct Scholar at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, outlines the role of excise taxes in the state budget and questions the economic consequences on Indiana. Berthoud discusses why, despite the myth that excise taxes are "painless," they cause states such as Indiana substantial and widespread economic harm.

This lecture describes the costs and benefits of several different types of welfare reform currently under consideration and analyzes them based on their ability to reduce the welfare system.

<p><b>Integrated Systems in Frontier Health Care Delivery: The Unique Needs of Wyoming,</b> 
edited by Sheryl R. Fox and Alexander T. Hunt<br>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>This report provides an overview of frontier health care delivery issues from varying perspectives and suggests possible technological and structural solutions to reform health care delivery systems in rural and frontier states. Specifically, the report examines the potential for telemedicine to improve rural health care systems and assesses both the economic implications of telemedicine for health care providers as well as obstacles to its implementation. Contributors raise several key points: First, national health care reform, by its very nature, will be anti-rural, transferring rural wealth to urban areas through whatever taxes are used to extend coverage to the uninsured. Second, in reforming health care, states like Wyoming will most likely need to develop networks based on providers to maximize access to health services. Third, telemedicine, the transmission of image and data via communications technology used by health care providers for treatment, diagnosis, and education of patients irrespective of distance, offers a way to bridge the health care gap in frontier states. This report is the summary of the CSIS Health Care Forum Series. 39 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20006, 202/887-0200.

<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts: A Building Block for Sound Health Care,</b> by Stephen Barchet<br>
The Evergreen Freedom Foundation
<p>Stephen Barchet, chairman of the Washington Medical Savings Account Project, presents his findings from a study to evaluate whether Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are a viable health care alternative. The study was completed through on-site investigations of companies using MSAs, and their research revealed the following facts: 1) reduced health care expenditures to both the sponsor/employer and employees; 2) wiser use of health services by consumers; 3) greater use of preventative services; 4) increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; and 5) strong employee participation and satisfaction. Barchet also finds that the sick and poor are better served than in many "managed-care" programs, since they have the same access to health care as everyone else. This study confirms that people controlling their own health care dollars with MSAs do not need huge central bureaucracies to make intimate health care decisions for them. MSAs allow patient choice, high quality medical service, and lower spending all of the benefits government plans promise without the costly, inefficient invasion of a centrally run bureaucracy. 54 pp. CONTACT: The Evergreen Freedom Foundation, P.O.

<p><b>SSI: The Black Hole of the Welfare State,</b> by Christopher M. Wright<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 224,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Christopher Wright examines why the current reforms of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program fall far short of the dramatic overhaul that the open-ended entitlement program needs. The author states that the ultimate goal should be to privatize disability insurance programs. In the meantime, any serious attempts to reform the system, according to Wright, should include the following: 1) ending automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 2) eliminating retroactive lump sum payments; 3) abolishing all SSI assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics; 4) establishing an enrollment cap for SSI. This study concludes that unless the program's costs are brought under control, by the year 2000 SSI will be larger than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized housing, the earned income tax credit, and all other forms of public assistance except Medicaid. Major reform, and ultimately privatization, are needed to rein in this costly and corrupt entitlement program. 35 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p>This report is the compilation of the recommendations of the Neighborhood Leadership Task Force on Grassroots Alternatives for Public Policy. This task force breaks new ground, bringing to the fore people who have demonstrated that they know how to reduce violence, reduce teen pregnancy, and provide compassionate care for children. This report call for a departure in the way America administers its social welfare programs, stating that what most poor people want are opportunities and responsibilities, not just rights and entitlements. As a result of their findings, the task force has found three principles fundamental to turning the tide of poverty: first, funding and authority for designing and providing services to the poor should be devolved not just from the federal government to the state level, but to the community-based organizations that demonstrate success in dealing with the problems of poverty. Second, individuals and communities must be empowered to create their own solutions through policies that emphasize personal and financial asset development. Third, the present maintenance-focused welfare system must be replaced by policies that promote strong families and emphasize personal responsibility and the development of self-sufficiency. 25 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1367 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1103.

<p><b>Government Contracts Reform: A Critical Analysis of the Administration's Proposal, </b>
by Jed L. Babbin and Thomas Earl Patton<br>
<i>Critical Legal Issues: Working Paper Series No. 63,</i> Washington Legal Foundation
<p>This working paper argues that the Clinton Administration's bid protest reform proposal is flawed in its reliance on faulty statistical analysis and its failure to recognize the importance of bid protests in the government procurement process. The authors demonstrate how the flaws in the data underlying the administration's recommendations include overstatement of the number of contract awards actually protested and exaggeration of the amount of time protested contracts are delayed. This paper claims that the Administration's opposition to these recommendations overlooks the General Services board of Contract Appeals process, which allows judges dealing with a complex information technology protest to be experienced in technical issues, providing a suspension mechanism to compel and agency to stop performance of the contract during the protest period. The authors suggest some solutions to bid protest problems, including the imposition of liability for frivolous protests, disallowing protest costs for protests that are not granted in their overhead pools, and requiring alternative dispute resolution before proceeding with protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals or the General Accounting Office. 23 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<p><b>The Case for Fundamental Tort Reform,</b> by Michael J. Horowitz<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 176,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Horowitz maintains that the lawyers' monopoly of access to the courts allows them to impose a 33.33 to 40 percent toll charge on all damage recoveries, even in cases in which defendants are willing to pay on a rapid, no-dispute basis. Contingency fees, the near-uniform means of compensating tort claim attorneys, can provide risk-free windfall of profits to lawyers while harming defendants, plaintiffs, and the economy as a whole. Horowitz demonstrates that true reform of the US tort system should include early offer reforms, which seek to ensure the settlement of large numbers of cases before expensive trials and pretrial proceedings, and contingency fee reform, which protects clients from having to pay their attorneys windfall fees far out of proportion to the work performed and the risks assumed in taking a case. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Punitive Damages: Once Is Enough,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 150,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at the Center for the Study of American Business, states that, under certain limited conditions, granting punitive damages can have merit. However, the author warns, the current practice of allowing punitive damages to be awarded over and over again to different plaintiffs against the same defendant for essentially the same issues is illogical. Mahoney presents the results of an informal survey conducted among a large group of American firms: a representative group of 43 large corporations reported that in the past five years a total of $4.4 billion was involved in settlements driven by punitive damages. Mahoney suggests the most practical answer available is legislation at the federal level, like the Hatch bill, that would forbid the repeated award of punitive damages for the same issue. In addition, in order to protect potential claimants against a single punitive award foreclosing a later, larger amount, judges would be empowered to permit punitive damages a second time if the first award was held to be an "insufficient deterrent." 14 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, One Brooking Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5682.

Decker states that the 1995 GOP crime bills introduced in the House and Senate promise more of the same, but with unprecedented provisions what would threaten freedom and undermine the fair administration of justice: the Senate bill includes a provision that would exempt federal prosecutors from the rules of legal ethics; both the Senate and House crime bills would enable federal agents to invade homes, raid businesses, and conduct humiliating body searches without legal justification, while reaping the benefits of evidence collected through such illegal searches; and the Senate bill would enable federal agents to detain citizens, hold them incommunicado, interrogate them for day, weeks or months, and use any of their statements in any subsequent prosecution. 41 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p>New Jersey Family Cap Found Constitutional</b><br>
On May 4, 1995, a federal judge ruled in favor of New Jersey's family cap welfare reform experiment.  The lawsuit filed in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the grounds that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and consitutional rights. The judge stated in his decision that the cap "does not violate any statutory or constitutional mandate," thus upholding the validity of the federal waiver and the program.

<p>Foundation Sues Clinton to Enjoin Strike Order</b><br>
National Right to Work attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt enforcement of a Clinton executive order prohibiting federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strke. The order enacted the policies of the so-called "Anti-Striker Replacement" legislation which Congress has twice rejected.
"The President trampled on the rights of workers by unilaterally enacting policies to punish workers who choose to work during a strike. He's sweeping the Constitution under the rug so he can please his Big Labor friends," said National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Timothy McConville.
Attorneys from the Foundation filed the suit in US District Court in Washington, DC, on behalf of Representatives John Doolittle (CA), David Funderburk (NC), Ernest Istook (OK), and Harris Fawell (IL). The complaint charges that by issuing the executive order, President Clinton has usurped the constitutional authority soley vested in the Congress to make laws and regulate commerce.
"Most observers agree the result will be more strikes, McConville said. "Union officials would call any strike they want and win every strike they call as easily as pushing a button. With more strike powers, the union officials will have more power to force workers to pay union dues, busting holes in state Right to Work laws."

<b><p>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>NELF Coalition Wins Complete Victory in RI Tidal Land Litigation</b><br>
Four years ago the Rhode Island Supreme Court released an opinion which implied that land ever below the median high tide mark ("tidal land") might be subject to a "public trust." That decision raised the threat that the state might be allowed to charge fees or impose public access requirements for use of such land. Because the commercial heart of Providence is tidal land, the implications of the court's decision on the state's economy were troubling. Title insurance and mortgage for this land became difficult to purchase.
NELF responded to this challenge over the next four years by organizing a coalition of the state's major landowners. The coalition decided that the best way to resolve the uncertainty brought about by the court decision was to initiate a second, test case which would give the court a chance to clarify and, hopefully, minimize the scope of the public trust. NELF helped prepare the test plaintiff's brief and filed its own amicus brief on behalf of a number of major Providence landowners.
The first major development in the case came last year when the state conceded that the most important part of the Providence tidal land, the "cove," was free from trust. Last month the Rhode Island Supreme Court decided the remaining issue, the status of the remaining "harbor line" tidal lands. This final decision is a complete victory landowners. The court held that all land which a landowner has filled out to a legislatively established harbor line becomes completely free from any trust. Downtown Providence's landowners have now been confirmed in the full ownership rights they thought they had possessed all along.

NELF, CBIA, and the Council argued that the ban violated the first amendment rights of not only the local telephone company, Southern New Telecommunications, but it also unconstitutionally limited the television choices that should be coming available to consumers. As the entertainment and communication industries grown ever closer, NELF intends to work to ensure that local telephone companies can become major sources of innovation and competition in the telecommunications industry.
<p><b>NELF to Enter Massachusetts Employment Sex Harassment Case</b><br>
NELF will file an amicus brief in the Massachusetts Appeals Court supporting the dismissal of an employee's sex harassment case. The case was dismissed because of the plaintiff's failure to have used the comprehensive procedures of the Massachusetts employment discrimination act, Mass. G.L. c. 151B. A Superior Court judge held that this failure precludes her suing her employer on any "corollary claim" arising out of the same facts. In this case that meant that the employee's claims of statutory sexual harassment, violation of equal rights, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were all barred. the court's reasoning followed closely two Massachusetts Supreme Judiciial Court cases in which NELF was involved last year.

<p><b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>Supreme Court Lets WLF Civil Rights Victory Stand</b><br>
On May 22, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the pathbreaking Fourth Circuit decision in favor of WLF's client, a Hispanic student, in his suit against the University of Maryland's black-only scholarship program.  The Court had been urged by the Clinton Administration and more than 60 interest groups and universities to reverse WLF's victory, which calls into question the legality of race-based scholarship programs at public universities across the country.  The suit was part of WLF's effort to oppose government programs that classify citizens by race.

<p><b>WLF Appeals in Challenge to Texas IOLTA Program</b><br>
WLF has asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas's Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, which requires attorneys to turn over interest generated by their clients' trust accounts to fund legal services organizations.  In 1992, more than $150 million was raised by IOLTA programs nationwide, nearly $10 million in Texas alone.  WLF argued that the program violates the First Amendment by forcing Texans to associate with political causes with which they disagree and that it violates the Fifth Amendment by taking their property without just compensation.  WLF's suit, now on appeal, was rejected by a federal district judge in January.

<p><b>WLF Supports Virginia Against EPA</b><br>
WLF has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit supporting Virginia's lawsuit against the EPA over the agency's requirement that Virginia change its rules for standing in its state courts.  The EPA has ordered Virginia to allow third parties the right to obtain judicial review of emissions permit approvals, whether or not the parties would have standing to sue under state law.  The EPA's position, if upheld, would enable groups such as the Sierra Club to impede the expansion or modernization of plants even where the state has given its approval.  WLF argued that Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to require this radical expansion of the availability of third-party standing in state courts.

<b><p>WLF Brief Opposes Racial Gerrymandering</b><br>
WLF, representing Congressman Gary Franks, urged the Supreme Court in Miller v. Johnson to strike down Georgia's redistricting plan on the grounds that it improperly drew lines so as to segregate black and white voters into separate congressional districts.  Under pressure from the Justice Department, the Georgia legislature created a district in 1992 with a strange layout, having uninhabited "land bridges" as little as a mile wide to connect black sections of urban areas.  WLF argued that such racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional and also pointed out that black candidates such as Rep. Franks have won elections in majority-white districts.

<b><p>WLF Urges Court to Recognize Constitutional Limits On Punitive Damages</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Court should strike down an Alabama court's $2 million punitive damages award against BMW.  The suit was brought by a physician who learned that BMW had refinished the car to repair slight paint defects incurred during shipment to the United States. WLF argued that the award, which was 500 times the amount of the economic damage suffered by the car buyer, was clearly excessive and violated due process.<br>

<b>The Return of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights<br>
Hadley Arkes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994)
</b>
<P>
   Conventional histories of the Supreme Court
describe George Sutherland, who was seated at the Court from 1922
to 1938, as a mainstay of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
 a sinister reactionary whose blunt, ideological dissents were
blindly devoted to business interests but failed to engage or
accept the emerging reality of the New Deal constitutional revolution.
Hadley Arkes's remarkable intellectual history, "The Return
of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights,"
reveals a far more subtle and textured portrait of Sutherland:
a sophisticated political thinker who was able to intellectually
outflank his philosophical adversaries and was willing to follow
the logic of his principles even when they drove him outside of
the respectable opinion of his day. Arkes's book is a compelling
portrait of a life animated by ideas, ideas that inspired Sutherland,
at the age of twenty, to copy paragraphs of natural rights theory
into his commonplace book (one of its pages is reproduced as Arkes's
frontispiece) and, at a more advanced age, to import its abstractions
into the often dry details of the law.     But the law, and the
controversies that it raises, are anything but dry when Arkes
describes them. He discusses a hidden Sutherland, one who led
the fight in the Senate for women's suffrage by making Lincolnesque
arguments about natural rights. On the Court, Sutherland reading
the categorical language of the First Amendment argued that the
Constitution categorically barred Congress from placing any limits
on the freedom of the press. In short, for a reactionary, he was
surprisingly progressive even, in some respects, radical.    
<P>
 Arkes sketches a compelling profile of Sutherland and the philosophical
tradition that he represents, demonstrating how the opinions of
the preRoosevelt Court that are generally held to embody a reactionary,
probusiness agenda turn out to benefit employees and the general
public as much or more than they benefit employers. The Old Court
struck down Arizona's law requiring that 80% of a business's workers
be nativeborn; without Court action, Mike Raich  an Austrian immigrant
 would have been out of a job. Sutherland's opinion, in a case
in which a minimum wage for women (but not for men) was struck
down, permitted women to hold onto their jobs, rather than being
displaced by men legally empowered to work for less money. But
the key to understanding Sutherland's jurisprudence is precisely
that he avoided making judgments of constitutionality on utilitarian
grounds, insisting that a coherent theory of natural rights would
lead to a compelling constitutional vision. Sutherland steadfastly
refused to take judicial notice of the happy coincidence that
his constitutional theories would also benefit the public.   
<P> Arkes, through his examination of Sutherland, makes plain what
the reserved language of Sutherland's judicial opinions are sometimes
only able to hint at: that the intellectual foundations of the
modern welfare state rest only on thin air. The knowledge of the
details of complex commercial enterprises that its regulations
presume are rarely to be found in those who would draft them.
The justice of the benefits and burdens that price regulation
attaches arbitrarily to various activities is difficult to justify
or discern. Arkes's description of Brandeisian jurisprudence,
an almost perfect foil to Sutherland's work, is penetrating, even
withering, especially when Arkes sketches how painfully oblivious
Brandeis is to contrary arguments.
  <P>
   Arkes also demonstrates
how Sutherland's fidelity to the bounded nature of the concepts
and texts judges must work with determines his decisions in the
cases before him. Sutherland's strict attention to the history
and meaning of such terms of constitutional art as "commerce,"
"delegation," and "general welfare" and, more
generally, to the necessary implications of the structure of the
Constitution guards against an interpretive slippage that leads
to unlimited government discretion. His method is a refreshing
change from much constitutional law today, which uses crucially
unmoored concepts like "dignity" to get the Court where
its judges want it to go. A problem with this approach  one which
Sutherland's more formal approach solves  is that, without careful
attention to the meaning and limits of words in the law, they
function much like Rorschach inkblots, revealing more about the
way their witnesses think and what they want to do than anything
else.
<P>
      Arkes's book makes a persuasive case that we need more
of Justice Sutherland's radicalism in the world today  a radicalism
that Arkes sets against both the common law's remnants of sympathy
for regulation as well as its continuation in the modern New Deal
state. It is a radicalism that should find many sympathizers.
Those who are deemed unfit to provide for themselves and for their
families because of the terrifying dangers of unregulated taxicabs,
haircuts, and shoeshine stands  as well as other victims of the
regulatory state would likely be sympathetic to Sutherland's views
that people have natural rights to occupational freedom.  
<P>
   It
is difficult in a brief review to give more than a glimpse of
this powerful book, but its fascinating mixture of political theory
and constitutional law provides an intellectual drama that is
rarely seen in books about the Court. Those who seek a model to
get today's Court back on track and in philosophical trim will
benefit from Arkes's readable study.

<b>It Takes a Village To Have an Abortion</b><br>
It crops up all the time in discussions of abortion, this notion that the choice is best left to "a woman, her doctor, her conscience, and her God." That last was Colin Powell's formulation, but other variants are common. In Garry Wills's New York Post column today, for instance, he writes that most Americans "want the decision to be made by the women involved, with the help, ideally, of family and doctors and religious pastors." It never seems to occur to people who talk this way-and who are always accusing pro-lifers of being unrealistic-that this description is otherworldly. People don't generally go to their family doctors for abortions; they go to abortionists with whom they have no prior relationship and who have a direct financial interest in the abortion taking place. (By the way, if consultation is such a great idea, why do "pro-choicers" oppose waiting periods and counseling and informed-consent laws, no matter how mild?)
<P>
For a measure of Wills's intellectual integrity in this matter, consider that he refers to "late-term abortions in emergency cases-the procedure shrewdly but misleadingly labeled 'partial-birth abortion' by its opponents." He's also prone to making highly suspect empirical claims with no evidentiary support. "Even those who disapprove of abortion in general do not consider it murder," he writes. "And those who oppose late-term abortions do not consider them infanticide." How does Wills know this? (Polls actually suggest the reverse of his first claim: more people consider abortion murder than want to prohibit it.) He also writes that 'more people of genuine belief and piety do not consider abortion, no matter how wrong, to be murder." Perhaps Wills is using a circular definition of 'people genuine belief and piety" to mean those people who agree with him on the wisdom of liberal abortion laws. But on any plausible reading of the phrase, the claim is almost certainly untrue.
<P>
<b>As the Book World Turns</b><br>
In yesterday's <I>Washington Post</I> Book World, Charles Murray's new book was reviewed by a liberal (historian Michael Kazin), and former Planned Parenthood head Faye Wattleton's new autobiography was reviewed. . . that's right, by a liberal (whose name we won't mention because the review was so embarrassingly admiring, and besides we forget it).

<b>Truer Words Were Never Spoken</b><br> 


The Washington Post today editorializes against tax cuts. Clinton's "would give an indiscriminate and costly children's credit to the middle class; we can think of better uses of the money." We'll bet they can.
<P>
Come to think of it, we can think of better ways for the Post to spend its money too.

<b>They're Back!</b><br> 
The Harvard freshman orientation seminar is back alive and kicking. In 1994 the Heritage Foundation had succeeded in killing it off with its own alternative orientation for freshmen Republicans. Encouraged by the new House leadership, enough freshmen opted for Heritage over Harvard that Ivy League school canceled its event altogether. At the time, it was good riddance. Going to Harvard right after becoming a congressman was always exactly the wrong way to get started, enduring huge doses of goo-goo liberal good government and stern lectures about working together and bi-partisanship right off the bat. But now, in another sign of the return to "normalcy" in Washington and American politics, Harvard is back. The good news is that most Republican freshmen are still staying away: 35 Democrats and six Republicans attended the Harvard event. They heard from such luminaries as former Dole chief of staff Sheila Burke (now the executive dean of the Kennedy School), outgoing Clinton flack and media darling George Stephanopoulos, and former Bush policy advisor Roger Porter who best captured the spirit of the hapless Bush Administration and would allegedly judge applicants for White House policy jobs on the basis of their tennis games. Anyone who learns about Washington from this crew may never recover. The six Republicans who attended, according to a Harvard list, were: Merrill Cook (Utah), James Gibbons (Nevada), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Charles Pickering (Mississippi), Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania) and John Sununu (N.H. ). Count it as one strike against them.

<b>Media Bias Revisited</B><br>
A while back we discussed William Powers's maiden effort as <I>The New Republic</I>'s media critic. We complained that liberals who acknowledge the existence of anti-conservative media bias feel that they must simultaneously slam conservatives for having a crude , conspiratorial view of that bias. In fact, we observed, most conservative press critics understand the sociological reasons for media bias and accept that it is generally not deliberate or orchestrated. One of our readers kindly passed along an article  from <I>NR</I>'s special issue on the press (June 21, 1993)  that nicely makes the point. Ted J. Smith III wrote: "In short, by any reasonable standard, the case for widespread bias in reporting has been made. This does not imply, as some members of the press seem to imagine, that journalists have been found guilty of consciously slanting the news to make it conform with their ideological perspectives. While this may occur on occasion, what is more commonand more insidiousis the sort of bias that reflects the  unconscious assumptions of the writer. This emerges in such things as the kind of adjectives he employs, the kind of 'experts' he quotes, the kind of organizations he considers authoritative, and the kind of issues he thinks important." . . . And while we 're on the subject: Brent Bozell's Media Research Center Awards for the worst quotes of 1996 will be out by the end of the week. Our own Kate O'Beirne was one of the judges.

<b>Musical RNC Chairs</b><br>
The race for RNC chairman is getting more crowded. Texas GOP chairman Tom Pauken has announced his candidacy, which is being promoted by the conservative weekly <I>Human Events</I>. Pauken is smart, principled, and in Texas he has successfully knit together the  social and economic wings of the conservative movement. Announcing his candidacy, Pauken said: "Under my leadership the RNC will be a member-driven organization with an increased emphasis on rebuilding the grassroots Reagan coalition of economic and social  conservatives. By reactivating the Reagan coalition as well as forming other coalitions with those who believe in economic liberty, limited government, and the traditional American values that made our country great, the Republican Party will be able to  retain and increase its control of Congress in 1998 and make a unified effort to reclaim the presidency." Also entering the race is ex-RNC co-chair Jeanie Austin, who flirted with the interesting idea of running on a joint ticket with Rep. J. C. Watts, but  Watts declined. Austin will appeal to those convinced the party needs more high-profile women to combat its "gender gap" problem. Austin says that's not why she's running, but noted: "I have devoted a good part of my career in the Republican Party, recruiting women into the party, and getting women elected to office. I think our party needs to pay closer attention to what women are saying, and we need to listen to their ideas and concerns." The Christian Coalition has flagged Pauken, ex-New Hampshire Gov. Steve  Merrill, and California GOP chairman John Herrington as its preferred candidates. At this point the race is wide open, but the RNC insiders who will be doing the voting at the winter meeting on Jan. 17 are likely to favor one of their own, a fellow insider. This certainly spells trouble for Pauken and Merrill.

<b>Cohen-Head</b>
The cabinet pick Republicans should be happiest about (at least from a cynical political perspective) is probably Bill Cohen at Secretary of Defensealthough not for the reasons the Clinton Administration thinks. The bi-partisan bounce Clinton will get from this pick will last about two weeks; as soon as Cohen is confirmed the honeymoon ends. Then Clinton gets to deal with side of Cohen Republicans are so familiar withthat is his unreliable, disloyal side. The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen recently provided a run-down of his record: Cohen broke with other Republicans during Watergate to vote to send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the House floor; during the Reagan Administration he constantly undercut the Administration's position on Nicaragua; he was skeptical of the Gulf War and at one point told Bush: "We visited the Kuwaitis, we saw the Kuwaitis, and we realized that Kuwaitis are willing to fightuntil every U.S. soldier has dropped." Cohen reportedly got the job on the strength of his interview with the President. But he has no management experience and beginning today all his cachet with Republicans is shot; Clinton is about to learn the limits of a pleasant conversationalist as Secretary of Defense.

<b>Fourth-Floor, Hardcore</b><br>
Hard-core House conservatives have made a concerted effort to get office space together on the fourth floor of the Cannon House office building, the better to coordinate their strategy in the next session of Congress. Get a load of this: on one corridor of the fourth floor of the Cannon building the line-up is John Hostettler (Ind.), John Shadegg (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Todd Tiahrt (Kan.), Steve Largent (Okla.), Gil Gutknecht (Minn.), Zach Wamp (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Mark Souder (Ind.), Steve Stockman (Tex.), Mark Neumann (Wisc.), Jon Christensen (Neb.), John Ensign (Nev.), and, right around the corner, Ed Bryant (Tenn.). Whew! Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett was briefly angling for space on Cannon's fourth floor, but when he realized who surrounded him he gave it up. Look for New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, plopped down in the middle of this right-wing real estate, to begin to look for new accommodations soon too (or maybe he'll convert). The House leadership, not eager to face pressure from the Right, can't like the idea of having all these guys together. Says one House aide: "They're going to post sentries, I think, on either end of the hallway."
<P>
<b>Tidbits and Outrages</b><br>
<I>The Washington Monthly</I> has a soporific reputation. It's concentrated for the last several years on nuts-and-bolts policy analysis - more nuts than bolts, if you ask us. Now the magazine has embarrassed itself by giving its monthly journalism award to Donald Barlett and James Steele for their interminable <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> series "America: Who Stole the Dream?" which has now, inevitably, been released as a book. It's been hooted by columnists right and center for its ludicrous and often self-contradictory arguments, its primitive "analysis," and its ignorance of basic economicsthemes that, alas, run through Barlett and Steele's work. <I>The Washington Monthly</I>, however, not only gave B&S an award, but excerpt their book in the same issue. This odd sort of self-dealing appears to be a pattern at the monthly: in his section of the magazine, editor Charlie Peters takes the <I>California Journal</I>'s side in a legal dispute with the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; later in the magazine, the <I>California Journal</I>'s managing editor has a long article.

<b>The Senate's Only Democratic Committee Chairman</b><br>
Bad news for conservatives in the Senate. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats has decided not to challenge Vermont Senator James Jeffords for chairmanship of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The committee has always been a trouble spot, featuring some of the Democrats' most liberal Senators and some of the Republicans' most accommodating members. Retiring "Clueless in Kansas" Sen. Nancy Kassebaum was the last chairman, and with Jeffords taking over for her, if anything, the panel will get worse. Jeffords was the only Republican sponsor of the Clinton health care bill. His AFLCIO rating (45 per cent) is nearly as high as his U.S. Chamber of Commerce rating (55 per cent). In short, he's just the type of legislator who helped make the U.S. Senate a graveyard for House initiatives over the last two years. But disloyalty apparently has its rewardnow he's going to be chairman of one of the Senate's most important committees.

<b>Bias Squared</b><br>
"What every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal," writes William Powers in the cover story of this week's <I>New Republic</I>. ". . . When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held they're mostly unconscious." It's nice, we guess, to get another admission of liberal media bias by a non-conservative. But somehow such admissions always come wrapped in layers of condescension. No serious conservative press criticcertainly not L. Brent Bozell and his colleagues at the Media Research Center, perhaps the most prolificmaintains that reporters are "constantly plotting to slant coverage." (Notice, by the way, the pejorative choice of verb, "huff," which is a standard <I>TNR</I> technique for parroting an observation and slamming the observer simultaneously.) Most conservatives think that for a variety of sociological reasons journalists tend to be liberal, and this fact affects their coverage. Evidently Powers agrees. Couldn't he just say that on this point, conservatives are unambiguously right?

<P>
<b>Sin Tax Sins</b><br>
Libertarian <I>Washington Post<I/> columnist James Glassman today defends liquor companies' right to advertise their product. Guardians of the public health, he suggests, ought to try to raise beer taxes instead. He writes that "we don't tax beer nearly enough. Currently, the United States earns"surely he means "takes"?as much in excise taxes from a single bottle of scotch as it does from 39 cans of beer, according to Congressional Budget Office figures." Say it ain't so, Jim! Repeat after us: Beer isn't undertaxed; scotch is overtaxed.

Jeff Rosen's gargantuan cover story in the <I>New Republic</I> on "O.J. Simpson, critical race theory, American law, and the triumph of color over justice" is attracting a lot of attention. Hilton Kramer and Maureen Dowd have both called it "brilliant." We're fans of Rosen, but this time we must demur. The essay's critique of critical race theory is neither novel nor sufficiently pointed. The article's only original insight is the linkage between that theory and the Simpson trial, which is sort of obvious. Finally, his critique is more aesthetic than intellectual or moral. He uses the word "crude" more often than "wrong" to describe arguments. . . . 
<P>
In the same issue, Jacob Heilbrunnthe only person who has identified himself as one of the folks who joined Michael Lind's alleged exodus of intellectuals from the Righthas a shoddier article on "a startling new species: fellow travelers on the right" who apologize for anti-democratic regimes like Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. Some of the examples are howlers: outgoing Sen. William Cohen ("R.," Me.) can hardly be described as part of the Right. A more glaring weakness is that Heilbrunn's proposed parallelism between the leftist attachment to Marxist regimes and revolutionaries and the right's alleged embrace of "Asian values" ignores the distinctioncentral to conservative foreign-policy thought for a decade and a halfbetween authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Some conservatives may defend dictatorships on grounds that amount "to a relativistic multiculturalism." But a much older tradition of conservatism looks askance at the notion that there is one best set of political arrangements that works everywherenot because sound values vary from place to place, but because circumstances do. And lastly, Heilbrunn should have noted that plenty of conservatives have criticized Singapore's regime. Its censorship of reporter Christopher Lingle, an incident Heilbrunn mentions, was, for instance, the subject of a story in <I>National Review</I>.

<b>Investment Advice</b><br>
Jim Glassman's "Your Money" column in the Sunday <I>Washington Post</I> focuses on Jim Grant's bearish views. Grant says the stock market has entered its "absurd phase." Yields on dividend-paying stocks have fallen to 2.2 per cent, "even below their level just before the October 1987 crash." The average Standard & Poor p/e ratio recently hit 20, where it was only 15 last year. (Glassman doesn't note that some analysts think structural changes in the economy are raising the trendline p/e ratio.) And then Glassman adds a cute point: "Another danger is that nearly all market advisers think that stocks will keep rising. That's proven to be a negative sign in the past." Grant "believes a decline in the market is imminent, and, if it occurs, investors will not ride it out. They'll sell their funds. Managers will have to dump shares to meet the redemptions, driving prices down further." Glassman thinks, on the other hand, that investors should hold on to their stocks but not buy any new ones.

<b>Boys Will Be Boys</b><br>
For some reason, <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Wesley Pruden delights in sexual slurs against his assorted enemies: "They're not real men" is his constant theme, even when he's discussing women. Normally this is harmless enough. But it takes a particularly ugly twist in today's column, "Trashy talk can have its rewards." Pruden writes, "Only this week a court in Eau Claire, Wis., awarded a 21-year-old man a million dollars for 'pains and slights' suffered at the hands of his high-school chums, who razzed him because he was a homosexual who prefers lads to lassies. Such a deal. An award of a million dollars just to be the butt of a joke is enough to make anyone cheerful, if not gay. This kind of stuff could be catching, and there's even a government agency to make whiners feel good about themselves." Pruden's version of events is misleading on several counts. The award was $900,000; and it was an out-of-court settlement. But the real distortion is his out-of-context use of the phrase "'pains and slights'" and his own words "razzed" and "whiners." The man in this casea boy at the time, let's rememberwasn't just "razzed." He was shoved, spat upon, beaten, and urinated on. He was kicked in the abdomen so many times he required surgery. A good case can be made that awards and settlements shouldn't be this generous. But Pruden doesn't advance that case. Nor does he do a service to those conservatives who harbor moral objections to homosexual behavior and are unjustly accused of vile bigotry.

<b>Affirmative Distraction</b><br>
The latest <I>New Yorker</I> includes an essay by Alan Wolfe on affirmative action. Like a lot of writing on the subject, it focuses on race preferences to the exclusion of gender preferenceswhich is odd, since the latter is far more significant by many measures. The article has its insights, but it is marred by conceptual confusions and ignorance of the conservative movement. 
<P>
Most of the article is devoted to exploring the alleged implications of corporate America's attachment to racial preferences. He writes that "the right doesn't want to admit that affirmative action has the blessing of the marketplace." "In fact, there are no conservative arguments against the most effective and prevalent forms of affirmative action in America, those implemented by companies." This is, at the very least, muddled. It is simply erroneous to assume that all practices in the private sector are necessarily free-market phenomena: like HMOs, race preferences are at least partly an adaptation to an environment created by the government. Quotas, that is, prevent lawsuits alleging the infringement of state-created "rights." Quite a few conservatives would not have (political) objections to truly voluntary affirmative action, which would be neither required nor encouraged by the government. Clint Bolick, a leading libertarian foe of preferences whom Wolfe never mentions, has said as much; Dinesh D'Souza incorporated an argument along those lines in the conclusion of his much-excoriated <I>The End of Racism</I>.
<P> 
Wolfe's argument becomes slippery when he writes that "conservatives have only two choices: to become liberals if they are to reject affirmative action in the private sector, or to accept such affirmative action if they are to remain conservatives. So why haven't more conservatives endorsed affirmative action? One answer is that a surprising number of them haveor, at least, did. Even the Reagan Administration, for all its professed opposition to affirmative action, adopted the practice of 'race-norming'; that is, raising the scores of minorities on standardized tests to make them more comparable with the scores of whites." He then writes about the Nixon Administration's role in fostering preferences, which he says conservatives don't like to admit. This entire passage is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The practice of "race-norming" is not the sort of "affirmative action in the private-sector" that conservatives are supposedly obligated to support; and conservatives, who have no love for Nixon's domestic politics, almost always mention his role in the history of race preferences when they write about the subject.
<P> 
Wolfe's thesis collapses at the finish line. "Without governmental enforcement," he writes, "some private companies may indeed drop their enthusiasm for diversity and retreat to 'birds of a feather' hiring policies." If that's the case, how can it be said that affirmative action "has the blessing of the marketplace"? Plenty of conservatives, though not all of us, would have no problem with Wolfe's conclusion that "while it makes sense for government to aspire to color blindness in order to underscore the importance of universality, companies and private universities ought to be free to take race into account for reasons of pluralism." Here is what <I>NR</I> said about the subject in its August 14, 1995 issue: "Conservatives may argue among themselves over whether purely voluntary, private affirmative action should be banned (as adherence to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would require), but market forces would probably minimize such discrimination once [government regulations encouraging it were eliminated]." Wolfe is clearly the type of liberal who likes to think that ideas that complex never occur to conservatives.

<b>Ominous News</b><br>
American Enterprise Institute pollster Karlyn Bowman isn't sure what to make of the trend, but it appears that public opinion toward government is softening. This could be, she says, a "prosperity effect": people tend to worry less about runaway government during good times. But might it also suggest a general flabbiness in Republicans' pressing the limited-government case these days?
<P>
<b>For Worse</b><br>
The <I>Washington Post</I> Style section today carries a front-page story on a wedding, titled "Every Girl's Dream." That ought to be enough information for our readers to figure out that the wedding concerned pairs two lesbians. (Heterosexual marriages don't warrant Style treatment unless they involve celebrities.) One woman's family plans to attend; the other woman's family is torn between, guess what, love and prejudice. You could, in other words, write the article half-asleep. ABC's <I>20/20</I> did a segment on same-sex marriages, cleverly titled "For Better or Worse," a few weeks ago. ABC at least allowed family members opposed to same-sex marriage to have a say; but of course, none of them were articulate. Under no circumstances is an articulate traditionalist case allowed on the air. Since it looks like the gay-rights side is going to win in a matter of years anyway, why not say conservatives surrender now, and spare ourselves an endless stream of saccharine documentaries?
<P>
<B>Word to the Wise</b><br>
<I>National Review</I> is sponsoring a forum at the Heritage Foundation next Tuesday, 24 p.m., on the politics of abortion. Does the Republican Party's pro-life stance hurt its political prospects, as is often claimed? Ann Stone, head of Republicans for Choice, and Jim Pinkerton will argue that it does and should be changed. Columnist Maggie Gallagher and Frank Cannon, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, will argue the contrary position. Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute will walk us through poll data on the subject. And <I>NR</I>'s own Kate O'Beirne will moderate. Come one, come all.

<B>TNR Notes</B><br>

The latest <I>New Republic</I> includes an inaugural "TRB" column from its new editor, Michael Kelly, fresh from the <I>New Yorker</I>. It's as well written as ever, but more pointed and open in its political position: that of a chastened, centrist liberal. . . . We've had fun with Michael Walzer's effusions in the <I>New Republic</I>'s "The Hard Questions" column before. This week's isn't particularly amusing; it's just daft. Walzer argues that "the right way out of the 'culture wars'" is to provide government funding for groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and black Baptist nursery schools, in order to make these institutions as strong as groups like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Ministries, the expressions of an older "multiculturalism." Where to begin ticking off the conceptual problems here? Making independent organizations as government-dependent as Catholic Charities is a recipe not for a vibrant civil society but a neutered and standardized one. Moreover, diversity of "religion, ethnicity, race, and region" is not the same as multiculturalism and has never been so considered by its prominent latter-day critics. Catholics never demanded separatist group rights or their own language; Farrakhanites and Hispanic lobbies do. For them to demand state funds is to ask a polity to fund its own dissolution. And lastly, the phrase "culture wars" most importantly denotes conflicts over competing visions of justice, morality, human personhood, and their implications for such practices as abortion. Converting the Federal Government into a large Ford Foundation isn't going to make those conflicts disappear.

<B>The Bi-Partisan Trap</B><br>
Newt Gingrich and Dick Gephardt held a joint press conference over the weekend that was full of talk of reconciliation, and completing the people's work, and bi-partisanship. Which is fine as far as it goes. There is no need for Republicans to be gratuitously partisan or confrontational with the Administration. But Republicans should also keep in mind that President Clinton built his political recovery on smart, well-managed partisan confrontation on the issues of his choosing: Medicare, the balanced budget, the government shut-downs. People hate partisan conflict in theory, but will endorse it in practice as long as it is marshaled against something they oppose (like the Clinton health-care bill back in 1993). Republicans might want to apply this lesson to the President's proposed intervention in Zaire. There is no national interest at stake, nor is it clear what goals U.S. troops would have in a mission there. Over the weekend the Administration had to re-consider the mission when Rwandan refugee began departing refugee camps in Zairewithout U.S. helpto head back to Rwanda; helping them make this trek was one of the goals of the U.S. intervention. The deeper problem in Zaire is that the government there is essentially non-existent, and if any intervention is going to have any long-term impact it will have to involve perilous and difficult "nation building." But that clearly is more than the American people will support; anything less thought is just a band aid. So why are American troops going to Zaire? And why aren't Republicans vocally opposing the idea?

<b>Newt: Should He Stay or Should He Go?</b><br>
	


The hot controversy inside Washington today was sparked by Kate O'Beirne's column in the current issue of <I>National Review</I> suggesting that perhaps it might be in the best interests of the Speaker Gingrich to temporarily step down from his leadership post, and if he did so a good replacement would be Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde. The column made ABC News, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the newspaper <I>Roll Call</I>,  and prompted remarks by Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) that it might indeed be advisable for Newt to take a hiatus. Feelings against Gingrich do seem to run high among Republican freshmen who feel they were led astray by Gingrich over the last two years (many of them were shot at with bullets with Newt's name on them in the just-completed campaign). Also, the feeling that Gingrich has become a liability runs high among GOP opinion-makers in Washington, but until now has gone unspoken. The Gingrich forces were so worried about the stir that they reportedly called Hyde's office to see if he was collecting 
votes to challenge Gingrich in next week's internal Republican leadership elections. Such a challenge won't be forthcoming from Hyde, or anyone else for that matter. If Gingrich is going to go, he would indeed have to step aside voluntarily. But the Speaker is still in a precarious position. Yesterday liberal Republican Rep. Chris Shay (Conn.) announced he won't vote for Gingrich for Speaker in Januarythe public, official voteif the ethics committee report on Gingrich has not yet been made public. It seems a sensible demandbut, then again, Gingrich allies suggest this will only give Democrats on the committee reason to stall. Whatever happens, it will be a much reduced Speaker Newt Gingrich come the start of the new Congress, and Republicans have to be willing to think about the possibility in a few months of there being no Speaker Gingrich at all.

<b>Spare the Rod</b><br>
	
Conservative activist and strategist Jeff Bell's Parental Rights Amendment, which some social conservatives think of as a silver bullet, was tested in battle in Colorado on Tuesday. It lost, big. Bell explains that the PRA was unable to win any support from Colorado elites, including conservative elites. The Rocky Mountain News, Vincent Carroll, and Bill Armstrong all came out against it. Nobody with authority was willing to counter the canard that the PRA would license child abuse. (Although there really isn't any doubt on that score: previous legal findings of parental rights have had no problems distinguishing between legitimate parental authority and abuse.) Undecided voters tend to break against ballot initiatives; this conservative instinct was mobilized against a conservative reform. Still, Bell isn't too discouraged. He notes that term limits lost its first test, when Washington voters rejected it after a similarly alarmist and misleading campaign. (Washington was supposedly going to lose the benefits of seniority, and then California's delegation would take all its water rights away.) In any case, the point of the PRA campaign is not to win and generate litigation as much as it is to educate the public about the depredations of modern liberalism. The campaign, in other words, is the point. And the campaign continues

<b>NR Washington's Election Predictions</b><br>
	Pundits all around the country are weighing in with their election predictions, here is NR Washington's Stab at Prognostication:
<P>
	The Presidency: Bill Clinton, of course, wins in a walk, but a closer walk than people think. The president will be held below 50 per centprobably the 4748 rangedealing a blow to his plans to claim an election mandate (the press may well give him one anyway). Dole has been closing in recent days thanks to the Indonesian scandals. The word is that Dole internal polls have him within 6 points in California, which he must win if he is going to pull off his electoral-vote inside straight. But it's too late for him to win there. The campaign has also been taking heart from the Reuters/Zogby poll which has Dole down by just 4 point nationally. But most other tracking polls have Clinton up by 9-16 points, and with the President leading in Republican states like Arizona and Florida he is assured a very pleasant election evening. The Senate: Republicans gain two or three seats. Republicans will pick up seats in the South; they will certainly win the open Howell Heflin seat in Alabama, are likely to win the David Pryor seat in Louisiana, and have a chance to win Democratic open seats in Georgia (Republican Guy Millner has pulled even with Max Cleland) and Louisiana (Republican Woody Jenkins is tied with Mary Landrieu). Meanwhile, the only Republican incumbent who will lose is Sen. Larry Pressler who is trailing in South Dakota. Sen. Bob Smith will pull it out in New Hampshire, and Sen. Jesse Helms will be fine in North Carolina. Get ready for some more troops for Trent Lott (and they'll be more conservative too). The House: Republicans lose 5-7 seats tops and could even make some gains. The tide has clearly shifted the Republicans' way at the congressional level, thanks in part to a huge barrage of negative advertising against the Democrats. There are only 10 or so Republican freshmen who seem sure to lose. There are another nearly 30 seats where the Democrats have a chance, but these potential Democratic gains are easily offset by 10 Democratic seats where the GOP seems likely to make pick-ups and another roughly 20 where the Republicans have a chance. When all the dust settles the situation in the House will look much the way it does nowwith one important exception. By early summer, one way or another, Newt Gingrich will no longer be Speaker.

<b>"California Pandering"</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I>'s latest insult to the intelligence of its readers was Thursday's editorial denouncing California's Proposition 209, the initiative to ban racial and gender preferences in state contracting, employment and university admissions. <I>The Times</I> complains that Bob Dole, "who voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and a stream of race-conscious Federal laws since then, could now be heard complaining that all of these efforts, including many he had supported, had turned out to be a 'blind alley.' " We will eat an entire edition of the <I>Times</I> if Mr. Dole can be proved to have repudiated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Notice also the slippery elision between that act and race-conscious laws that followed: some of the language, and the entire spirit, of Proposition 209 is borrowed from the 1964 act, which was a historic blow against "race consciousness." But it gets worse. The <I>Times</I> blasts Dole for having "tossed around code words like 'preferences' and 'quotas.' " Oh, so these things are figments of the right-wing imagination. (Have you noticed, by the way, that the word "liberal" increasingly appears in quote marks, as in "the 'liberal' Paul Wellstone," as if only a shameless partisan opponent would think to attach that label to moderates like the Senator from Minnesota?) Then we learn that "Proposition 209 is a retrograde measure that would deprive state authorities of what little leverage they have to promote true equality of opportunitya point President Clinton has grasped." These are the depths to which standards of argument have fallen at West 43rd St. Clinton is further congratulated for having "defused an angry national debate over affirmative action" with his " 'mend it, don't end it' policy." In fact, Clinton has done nothing to alter the practice of race and gender preferences, and his Justice Department has tried to extend them. "Mend it, don't end it" is a slogan, not a policy. But perhaps in the Clinton era, the <I>New York Times</I> can't tell the difference. 
<P>
<b>Affirmative Reaction</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I> is on to something, though. The political battle over the California Civil Rights Initiative has featured a veritable avalanche of sleaze and misinformationall coming from its opponents. Take the new ad campaign against it. One ad features Candace Bergen saying, "If 209 passes, we could lose maternity benefits. . . . 209 will cut funding for rape crisis centers." In another, Bruce Springsteen exhorts the "working men and women" of California to vote against the proposition because it "will legalize discrimination against women and girls in jobs, in education, and in sports." Ellen De Generes's ad makes a bizarre link between the initiative and "the anti-choice boys" of "the religious right." A. Woodard appears in yet another ad quoting Gloria Steinem: "209 could wipe out maternity benefits." All these claims have something in common: they are lies, deliberate and utter fabrications. Bubble-headed Hollywood types may not know any better, but the people who write their lines surely do . The campaign to preserve race and gender preferences ought to be ashamed of itself. Here's hoping California voters won't be fooled. But if they are, it will not be proof that preferences are popular; it will be proof that they can only be sustained by a campaign of vicious demagoguery and simple lies.

<b>Holding The House and Senate?</b>
All right: here's some (possible) good news for a change. As of yet there's no sign of a national Democratic tide that would sweep the party back into control of the Senate and House. Although Republicans are still warily eyeing Clinton's final all-out campaign push, they are encouraged by trends in Senate and House races. In Senate races in Nebraska, Montana, and Iowa Republicans have made big gains in the last week in seats being defended by the Democrats. Presumablyalthough no one can say anything for surethe trend would be the opposite if Clinton were building a national Democratic wave. In the House the trend is similar. The kind of freshmen Democrats will have to beat to regain the majority have built leads over their opponents in recent weeks: Phil English and Jon Fox in Pennsylvania and Bob Ney, Steve Chabot and Steven La Tourette in Ohio. Republicans think a number of factors are working in their favor as the campaign draws to a close. 1) The message that Bill Clinton shouldn't be given a "blank check" with a Democratic Congressthe National Republican Campaign Committee is running ads to this effect in 50 House racesseems to be taking hold. 2) The continuing high-profile Asian fundraising scandal increases uneasiness with Clinton and supports the idea he can't be trusted with a Democratic Congress. 3) The Republican national committees are finally unleashing a tide of spending across the country, the National Rifle Association is kicking in a late $1.5 million independent expenditure, and Republican candidates have tended to save their resources, until now, for the final push. 4) The Christian Coalition will presumably be turning out voters big-time in an election everyone agrees will hinge largely on turn-out. 5) Perot seems to be gaining ground, and if his voters show up at the polls they will tend to vote for GOP congressional candidates. But Republicans should hold their breath until they actually cross the finish line. What they all dread is a smashing Clinton victory in the East, trumpeted by the networks around 8 p.m. eastern-time or so, which keeps Republicans away from the polls everywhere else. If that happens, despite everything, it might be time to start saying "Speaker Gephardt." (Uh, that's the bad news.)

<I>Turning Ideas Into Actions</FONT></I></H2>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation's <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series of policy handbooks, launched in 1981, explains how to get things done in Washington.  This fourth in the series, "Turning Ideas Into Actions," is the first <I>Mandate</I> aimed primarily at Congress.  In 1994, the voters elected  a Congress that was more conservative and more committed to fundamental change in the way Washington operates.  But while important reforms were enacted, Congress was outmaneuvered in its efforts to achieve structural change in many important areas, such as Medicare. The task for the new 105<sup>th</sup> Congress will be not so much to identify a brand new agenda, but to develop a more effective strategy to implement a conservative agenda already endorsed by the American people in two elections.  

<P>

This <I>Mandate</I> is a lawmaker's handbook for achieving policy objectives.  Drawing on the experience of dozens of legislative specialists and former government officials -- the doers of the last 20 years -- it looks at the hard lessons learned and lays out a practical strategy to build bipartisan and public support for a reform agenda based on conservative principles.

<P>
The <I>Mandate</I> volumes played a major role in shaping policy during the Reagan-Bush era. <I>The Washington Post</I> called the first <I>Mandate</I> -- which was hand-delivered to the incoming Reagan Cabinet soon after the 1980 election -- "the bible of the Reagan transition."  <I>The New York Times</I> called <I>Mandate</I> "the hottest ticket in town."  And <I>National Review</I> described the policy tome as "an Owner's Manual for the Federal Government."  Trent Lott, then House Minority Whip said <I>Mandate</I> was "unparalleled in scope."

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h2><center><i>Internship Program</h2><br></i></center>
<b><i><center>1995-96 Information and Application Form</b><br></i>
<hr width=75%><br></center>
<P>
	The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 "to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense."   A non-partisan tax-exempt institution, it is now one of the largest and most influential research and educational foundations in the United States, providing national, state, and local decision-makers with information that is concise, timely, and relevant to the current policy debate.<p>

	In the early 1980s Ronald Reagan described Heritage as the "feisty new kid on the block." Today, according to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, "Heritage plays a major role in developing the ideas that are going to make America's success possible in the 21st century."<P>

	Located in the nation's capital, The Heritage Foundation offers both summer and academic year internships.

<b>The Heritage Foundation: Providing Practical Ideas for America's Future</b>
</center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the nation's leading think tank, The Heritage Foundation's impact on public policy is more pronounced than ever. As <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I> wrote recently, "No policy shop has more clout than the conservative Heritage 
Foundation."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, many of the 104th Congress' plans for balancing 
the budget and scaling back big government began at Heritage. By providing official Washington 
with timely research and analysis, Heritage has become a primary information source for America's 
lawmakers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Heritage's people are more than just well-informed and 
well-educated. Many have hands-on government experience. They are doers as well as thinkers.  
Players, not just spectators. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you need a thought-provoking, articulate expert to 
discuss today's important issues, The Heritage Foundation is the place to turn. Contact 
<a href="mailto:moebiusw@heritage.org">Wanda Moebius</a> at (202) 675-1761 to book a speaker.

Welcome to the Town Hall CyberPersonality site!  I can assure you that this is certainly a new venture for me.  I've heard of "talking heads" from the likes of "Capitol Gang," and what used to be "MacNeil-Lehrer," but an on-line Internet personality is one of newest ways The Heritage Foundation would like to get past the limited amount of media coverage of hot issues and tell you what is really happening in Washington, on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and in policy circles.
<P>
A little bit about me -- I'm <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a>, and I'm primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</a>, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank</a>. I also serve as a spokesman for the Foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.<p>


I'd like to tell you a little bit about what you can expect to see when you come to this site.  Of course, over the next several months, I'll be doing some fine-tuning to make this as interesting and informative as possible.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you'd like to see, and what would help you to keep on top of current issues. 
<p>
Twice a week -- on Tuesday and Friday -- I will be on-line to discuss hot topics on the Hill and elsewhere, and answer your questions.  I am also planning to post research materials, discuss what opinion leaders are saying, interview guests on politics and policy, and much more!  
<p>
What would you like to see? Please <a href="mailto:gabrona@heritage.org">email</a> your thoughts to me, or to <a href="mailto: gabrona@heritage.org">Andy Gabron</a>, who helps me with research
 for this page. I look forward to hearing from you!

Has American Judaism lost its roots?</CENTER>

<BR>
Modern American spirituality is a lot like Interstate Five. Everybody seems
to be on it. Nearly everybody's changing lanes. The road signs are large
but not always helpful. Entry and exit can be tricky. If you drive long
enough you end up in Canada &shyp; decent and pleasant, though not often
inspiring. But if you drive long enough the other way, you find yourself
in . . . well, California.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, American Judaism took to the interstates. Specifically, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), the major Reform organization,
began offering &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; outreach seminars, designed
for anyone with any kind of interest in the subject. Seattle was the 16th
city on the UAHC list. From March through May of this year, thirteen sessions
were conducted at area Reform temples.<BR>
<BR>
I became aware of the program through an ad in the EastsideWeek. <I>A  Three
Session </I>Journey &shyp; Come <I>Share</I>. The simple invitation accessed
some files I thought I'd deleted decades earlier. Not an entirely  pleasant
retrieval. Despite, or perhaps because of the discomfort, I made the phone
call. For the first time since 1973 (a bizarre Passover <I>seder</I> in
the Marines) I would enter a Jewish activity. Just to check up on the tribe,
I told myself. Just to see if  anything had changed.<BR>
<BR>
Nothing had. And, perhaps, everything. And, perhaps, much more than the
tribe was involved.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
To anyone over 40 with knowledge of the American Jewish experience &shyp;
my own background was Orthodox, intensely ethnic/Yiddish, and included yeshiva
time &shyp; the most striking aspect of the current situation is what's
no longer there. The old ethnicity: gone. This was, of course, inevitable.
The immigrant generations have passed, and with them their dialects, their
neighborhoods, their ways. And so have most of those who knew them well,
and who participated in American Jewry's version of the Eternal Triangle:
the three-generation struggle of immigrants, their conflicted, striving
children, and their affluent, baby-boomer-bratty grandkids to adapt and
succeed, yet  keep the faith available.<BR>
<BR>
Reform Judaism began in Europe two centuries ago as an avant-gardish, highly
intellectualized attempt to bring Judaism into the modern world, to offer
alternatives to the tradition-encrusted Orthodoxies of  the  ghetto and
the ghetto mentality. In the United States, Reform became a  pensive half-way
house for ambitious immigrant children, eager to shed their parents' ways
yet unwilling or unable to discard the old faith entirely. A Yiddish joke
tells of a conversation between an old Orthodox mother and her successful
Reform son. Do you still keep Kosher, Hymie? No, Mother. Do you still go
to <I>shul? </I>No, Mother. Do you date Jewish girls? No, Mother.<BR>
<BR>
So tell me, Hymie. Are you still circumcised?<BR>
<BR>
Beneath the humor, the anguish of  a past, no longer visible. Some one else's
war.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also, the Holocaust as an omnipresent, suffocating yet binding American
Jewish reality. The memory's been institutionalized and, to some extent,
denatured. It has to be to survive beyond the lives of those who knew it,
and of it, personally. There's the museum in Washington, D.C., its power
fittingly unspeakable. There's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and a healthy
academic and literary output. But the Holocaust  memory-as-solidarity is
different when the European branch of your family ended up in Auschwitz
and you learn the details from those who knew and mourn them. It's different
when the woman next door has a number on her arm that she neither conceals
nor talks about, and three houses up, the couple from Dachau  won't let
their kid out of their sight and on quiet nights you can hear their dream-screaming,
<I>Gangsters</I>! <I>Teuffeln!</I> and your street's more or less like the
rest of the neighborhood in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also: Israel &shyp; or, at least, the pre-1967, or pre-1982, or pre-1996
wide-eyed adoration and unquestioning support. &quot;Exodus,&quot; Leon
Uris' perennial seller about the creation of the Jewish state, used to be
dismissable as bad fiction. Now it's obscene.<BR>
<BR>
But, most of all, American Judaism no longer seems quite so special, American
Jews no longer quite so intriguing. Certainly, chunks of the old culture
have been mainstreamed. Jewish humor's everywhere; Yakov Smirnoff now works
The Nashville Network. There are probably more varieties of bagels in Seattle
than synagogues. But by the standards of the 1950s/1960s, when a confluence
of forces (Israel, the Holocaust, economic and intellectual success, the
waning of the more virulent anti-Semitisms) made Jews a fashionable minority,
it's over. And today, despite the well-hyped pronouncements of Mr. Farrakhan,
a few militia G-mo's, and some armed-and-ugly confrontations back east,
Jews don't get persecuted much anymore. Indeed, by the standards of the
1950s/1960s, most American Jews don't even seem all that interested in each
other, or themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Some years ago, the UAHC noticed this. Their sociological and statistical
researches showed that over half of all American Jews consider themselves
unaffiliated with any form of  organized Judaism. Over half of all Jews
now marry outside the faith. If present trends continue, American Jewry
could constitute less than one percent of the population within a couple
of decades.<BR>
<BR>
So the UAHC took the first step toward renaissance. They got a grant. Then
they put together &quot;A Taste of Judaism.&quot;  Kathryn Kahn, the national
program co-ordinator and assistant director of the UAHC's Commission on
Reform Jewish Outreach in New York, says that much of the material derived
from previous experiences working with lapsed Jews wandering home and interfaith
couples in which the Jewish partner wanted to cling to some part of the
tradition, but couldn't articulate why. &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; would
take it national.<BR>
<BR>
Says Kahn: &quot;We wanted to set up a barrier-free program. No cost. No
books. No homework. A minimal investment in time. We wanted to let Judaism
speak for itself. We started out with the three Jewish verities of God,
Torah, and Israel. But we felt that might be a little formidable, so we
changed it to Spirituality, Ethics, Community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Kahn, the program's success astonished even its creators. &quot;We
ran ads in secular publications. They weren't professionally done. People
said the ads just jumped off the page at them. Since 1994, we've had over
4000 people take the seminar. We're just starting to send out a major survey,
asking people at least six months out of the course, 'What Jewish choices
have you made?' We may never know the full impact. But we've had conversions,
temple joinings, many levels of response.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pam Waechter, the program's Seattle-area co-ordinator, says that the series
drew over 850 queries. 470 people took this year's offerings; there's a
waiting list for 1997. She adds that much of the interest here came from
adult children of interfaith marriages who'd been raised as Christians,
or in no tradition. <BR>
<BR>
So perhaps American Jews are still interested; all they need to re-up is
just some no-heavy-lifting spirituality. Or perhaps it's part of something
larger, a more general American returning to God and roots.<BR>
<BR>
In part, no doubt. But the most striking aspect of the &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot;
was that, within the context of Reform Judaism's oddly constricted view
of things, and beneath the back-to-faith patina, the class was doing something
of which it seemed utterly unaware. Of course, there was no way for them
to know that they were engaging in an ethical exercise of pagan origin which
could well provide the moral basis for 21st century American civilization,
Jewish, Christian, humanist, and a whole lot else.<BR>
<BR>
But first, let's  look at it the old-fashioned way.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Twenty-five people show up at Temple D'Hirsch Sinai on Pike Street. During
the obligatory self-introductions, more describe themselves as &quot;recovering
Catholics&quot; than wayward Jews. There's a cute little blonde who's pondering
conversion, some interfaith couples (one very pregnant), a Mercer Island
Episcopalian woman now dating a Jew, a black gentleman of the Ba'hai faith,
professing curiosity. A few others, Gentiles, mention curiosity; they either
 want to understand their Jewish friends, or have no Jewish friends but
want to understand, anyway. No one would mistake this crowd for refugees
from the club scene. They're older, serious, earnest.<BR>
<BR>
There's no strict curriculum. According to Kahn, the instructors were &quot;asked
to pick passages [from the Torah and other literature] that they feel passionate
about, and to talk on those.&quot; The temple provides the instructors:<BR>
<BR>
Associate Rabbi Beth Singer, one of those clergypersons who can't pronounce
her title without italicizing it and who, on ordination day, must have been
issued an inexhaustible supply of timed-release sincerity capsules. She'll
do Spirituality  (the session originally designated, &quot;God&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick, a retired public school teacher now working as the temple's
director of education. <I>(Gott i</I>n<I> Himme</I>l, he looks just like
my Uncle Milton). Chernick's the teacher everybody had once, if they were
lucky, the lively guy who humanized the course they dreaded taking. He was
also Chaucer's clerk in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; &shyp; &quot;Glad
would he teach, and gladly learn.&quot; He'll handle Ethics (formerly known
as &quot;Torah&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
Cantor Kenneth Koransky, a South African-emigre with an international reputation
and a passion for the people he sings for. He'll teach Community. Israel
receives mention as a place where Israelis do not follow the traditional
ways.<BR>
<BR>
The course is designed to entice people to Judaism,  not to confer advanced
degrees or conduct Talmudic disputations. But, almost immediately, two intellectual
weaknesses become apparent. One is an astonishing lack of basic knowledge
among the instructors, far in excess of the usual podium tongue-slippages.
One does not expect to hear from an ordained rabbi that King David built
the First Temple or that &quot;parts&quot; of the Hebrew Bible are found
in the Christian Old Testament. The class, properly more concerned with
impact than with trivia, says little about it. At one point in his session,
Koransky asks aloud why he keeps turning to me for answers, and muses that
I look like a rabbi, sent to spy on the proceedings. I'm not, I tell him.
I'm far worse. I'm a journalist.<BR>
<BR>
And don't mess with me, man. I been to<I> cheder</I>.<BR>
<BR>
The second flaw, and the second astonishment, concerns more substantive
matters. Reform has always tended toward a certain self-satisfied  parochialism:
part 19th century social gospel, part anachronistic New Deal liberalism,
part 60s time warp, with PC aplenty for spice. The positions, and the posturing,
hadn't changed one iota in thirty years.  The great sin of the Pharisees
&shyp; the  pride-in-goodness which even Jesus found incorrigible &shyp;
still resides among those who've done their best, for centuries, to distance
themselves from the Pharisees' putative descendants.<BR>
<BR>
Rabbi Singer leads off. She assures the room that she will be &quot;nonjudgmental&quot;
and &quot;noncoercive.&quot; She flits over a selection of quotations compiled
by a Rabbi Rossove of Temple Israel, Hollywood, CA. She tells the class
that Judaism is &quot;experiential,&quot; that you don't have to believe
in God to be a good Jew, as long as you feel it. She calls Orthodox Jews
&quot;fundamentalists&quot; &shyp; the first time I've ever heard one Jew
apply that inappropriate epithet to another. She asserts that, as far as
the old ways go, &quot;We take what makes sense to us and skip over the
rest.&quot; Some things &shyp; homosexuality and women, for example, &quot;they
just didn't understand the way we do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Concludes Rabbi Singer: &quot;Sometimes I wish I could go through the Torah
with a bottle of White-Out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Then &shyp; wink/wink, giggle/giggle &shyp; &quot;Don't quote me on that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I decide to write. After class,  I identify myself to her as a journalist
and ask for a one-on-one follow-up interview to discuss her teachings. She
tells me how busy she is. A few weeks later, I leave another request on
her voice mail. Two days after, a woman from the temple calls. Rabbi Singer
wants to investigate my background before &quot;granting an interview.&quot;
The next day, another woman checks in. Rabbi Singer will be unable to schedule
anything, but I am authorized to write that she &quot;enjoyed teaching the
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reform seminaries, if they do not already do so, might consider offering
instruction in media relations.<BR>
<BR>
(Author's note: Before sending this article off into cyberspace, Rabbi Singer
received a third interview request. She did not respond.)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick takes Ethics. He's excellent on expounding Jewish notions of
the sacralized life. You can sleep with your girl friend and it's not a
sin. But it's better if you do it married. You can eat your food without
a blessing, but it's better to say a little grace. No, you don't have to
believe in God, or in any particular conception of God, but we do insist
on monotheism and we do these things because God commands them.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming God exists.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick teaches with fervor that the essence of Jewish ethics is how
we treat each other, and how we work to bring on the Messianic Age that
may or may not require a physical Messiah.<I> Tikku</I>n<I> Ola</I>m. Repair
of the world. We must do this for the poor. We must do that for the environment.
I ask him if this ethic mandates any particular political ideology or action.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You bet it does. We don't have to get into the details here, but everybody
knows what they are. We have an obligation to insist that our government
reach where we can't. We have to be sure that our government is acting as
ethically as we are. If we're going to be holy, we have to use every venue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I don't respond that Jerry Falwell couldn't have put it any better. A few
days later, at lunch, I ask him to elaborate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, if caring about other people means you're a liberal, then I'm
a liberal. If not caring means you're a conservative . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Does caring require fealty to any particular bureaucracy or way of doing
things?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, obviously not . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OK. This guy's sincere. In Jewish ethics, civility comes before scoring
points.<BR>
<BR>
Koransky, in class and on the phone later, proves the most challenging.
&quot;A Jew can eat a ham sandwich on Yom Kippur,&quot; he says, &quot;and
still be a Jew. Not a good Jew, but a Jew. You can disbelieve in God and
still be a Jew. But you can't be a Jew by yourself. Without the synagogue,
what does the Jew have?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I ask him whether a Jew can acknowledge his identity and heritage and believe
in God, but not care for the company of his fellows.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jewish self-hatred is an old thing. So is social-climbing. So is disagreement.
Once, two Jews were stranded on a desert island. A few years later, a ship
happened by and rescued them. One of their rescuers noticed that they'd
built three synagogues. He asked why. 'Well,' one of the Jews said. 'That's
the synagogue I attend. That's the synagogue he attends. And that's the
synagogue neither of us would be caught dead in.'<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The unaffiliated Jew,&quot; he concludes, &quot;just hasn't come home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
No exceptions?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't be a Jew in a vacuum.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Still, there are vacuums and vacuums. Solitude is not the worst. Far more
vacuous (forgive the pun) is so much of what passes for modern American
religious questing &shyp; the endless shopping down at the spiritual supermall,
looking for just the right accessories for just the right spiritual life-style,
and for that perfect, nonjudgmental, noncoercive, get-the-White-Out deity.
 Seen in this sense, Reform Judaism's just one more boutique.<BR>
<BR>
Yet seen in another, exactly the opposite is true. Throughout this century,
the Orthodox Jewish rap against Reform was that they wanted to be Jews without
doing the hard Jewish work, indeed, to be Jews without being anything Jewish
in particular.  The yeshiva boys might drive you crazy, but at least you
knew where to find them. Reform wasn't Judaism. It was warm-and-fuzzy, feel-good
religion; it was an accommodation of convenience for life among the<I> goyim</I>.
In the end, to borrow a phrase, there was no &quot;there&quot; there.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick disagrees vehemently. The people he deals with, especially
in his adult education classes, aren't dilettantes. They're determined to
find a way to make Judaism a real presence in their real lives. Their what
to leave in/what to leave out decisions are based on personal and family
needs, not fashion or whim. I got the same sense with the people in the
seminar &shyp; that the question on their minds was neither what's hot nor
what's not, but<I> How shall I liv</I>e?<BR>
<BR>
And therein lies the possible ethical future of this land.<BR>
<BR>
To explain:<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the only civilization in history to adopt, as its de
facto official value-system, &quot;How do I feel, especially about myself?&quot;
No other culture has ever elevated feeling &shyp; emotion beyond all external
validation or linkage to the outer world --  to the status of an absolute.
Most would have considered it insane. It doesn't work. The wreckage of the
attempt lies all about us: failed marriages and relationships, failed politics,
the culture of anarcho-banality, the endless immersion in the formulaic
pornographies of violated flesh and spirit.<BR>
<BR>
But for those who wish to move beyond the failed American psychobondage,
modern ethics offers only two alternatives, neither really workable. One
is submission to some external authority, technically known as the deontological
approach. What does the Pope say? What does the Torah say? What does the
Party say? How would Dan Quayle, or Hillary Clinton, handle this situation?
What would Arnold Schwarzenegger think of me?<BR>
<BR>
What is the law?<BR>
<BR>
Some folks need to submit. Others choose to do so, often in the belief that
they're returning to &quot;tradition.&quot; or doing it for the sake of
the kids, or just to structure their lives. But a multicultural, essentially
libertarian society doesn't have this option. As far as the rules go, one
size no longer fits all.<BR>
<BR>
The other modern ethical alternative is to live by trying to predict the
results of one's actions. But consequentialism doesn't work much better.
No one can know all the implications, or control all the results. Should
I marry Jack or Jill? If I give this street person money, will she use it
for food or drugs? At the political level, consequentialism leads from inept,
intrusive social engineering to the tyrannies of  &quot;the greatest good
for the greatest number.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there is a third alternative, slowly emerging from centuries of obscurity.
Its technical moniker is &quot;virtue-ethics&quot;.  It first regained general
notice in the 1970s, with the publication of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre's<I>
After Virtu</I>e. Since then, its most effective expositors have been classicists
and philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum <I> (The Therap</I>y<I> of Desire</I>)
 and Julia Anna<I>s (The Morality of Happiness)</I> &shyp; women writing
for a general audience, but also seeking  an ethic for women of the post-feminist
era. During the Vietnam War, virtue-ethics were practiced by the American
prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton. Admiral James Stockdale, who won the Medal
of Honor for his prison leadership and who once described himself as &quot;the
lawgiver of an autonomous colony of Americans who happened to be located
in a Hanoi prison,&quot; had studied virtue-ethics in graduate school. His
extensive writings on how he and his comrades adapted and applied them in
prison were totally ignored by the media during  and after Stockdale's painful
performance in the 1992 vice-presidential debates. (For the record: Jim
Stockdale introduced me to the field, first in his writings, then in a series
of personal conversations and letters in the 1980s. Everybody should have
the opportunity to get to know a great man or woman, at least once.)  <I>
</I><BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, the relevant question is neither &quot;What are the rules?&quot;
nor &quot;What are the consequences?&quot; It is certainly not, &quot;How
do I feel?&quot; Nor does it have much to do with the currently fashionable
&quot;Books of Virtues&quot; available in the bibliotherapy section of your
local bookstore. The vital question is &quot;How should I live?&quot; Rules,
emotions, consequences all matter, but only as guides. The North Vietnamese,
for example, did not want to torture their prisoners. They wanted information,
propaganda statements, help in breaking other prisoners. The torture decision
was American. Knowing full well that, in the torture room, they would ultimately
submit, they nonetheless decided that<I> their live</I>s required them to
take torture before surrender . . . and then to start the whole hideous
process again the next time.<BR>
<BR>
Virtue-ethics is a Hellenistic creation. It dominated the final centuries
of antiquity. It comes in many forms, among them the Aristotelian, Epicurean,
Stoic. It leaves many concepts vague. Virtue-ethics provides no answers
to the question it poses: How shall I live? It does offer ways of finding
answers.<BR>
<BR>
An Aristotelian might hold that virtue is the &quot;golden mean,&quot; that
midpoint between excess and defect in any character trait. Courage, for
example, would be the mean between cowardice and rashness. The wise woman
would then apply this trait to the situations of her life. An Epicurean
might hold that, since the world is a meaningless jumble of atoms and random
events, and since the gods either don't know we're around or else don't
give a damn, the wise person maximizes his or her own pleasure &shyp; but
only in ways that don't cause painful and anxious dependence on that pleasure.
 Curiously, the virtue-ethic most appropriate to a libertarian, multicultural
society &shyp; a society desperately trying to amend its materialistic,
planet-trashing ways &shyp; might well be an updated Stoicism.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism today connotes little more than heroism in the dentist's chair,
or taking the bad news in a certain way, on maybe Mr. Spock on the bridge
of the Enterprise. In reality, it's far more subtle.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism was founded in the third century, BC by Zeno, a native of Cyprus,
an  island with a large Jewish community. The doctrine received its name
from the Stoa, or colonnade in Athens, where he held forth. Its most famous
expositors were a Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and a Greek slave, Epictetus.
Stoicism, the most popular of the philosophies of late antiquity, filled
that half-millennium gap between the waning of the pagan gods and the rise
of Christianity. Many of its concepts were, in fact, taken into the new
faith. And many of its concepts have an oddly Jewish intinction.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism holds that there is indeed deity in the universe. Most often that
deity is pantheistic, present throughout creation but with no separate existence.
Yet Stoicism also allows for other gods, capable of suffusing human affairs.
 Stoic cosmology bears an eerie likeness to the current Big Bang theory.
And the Stoic insistence that the universe is an inter-related whole, with
that condition conferring ineluctable responsibilities on humanity, anticipates
modern deep ecology by two thousand years.<BR>
<BR>
But what matters here is the Stoic answer to the question, &quot;How shall
I live?&quot; Stoicism doesn't say, &quot;Be rid of your feelings.&quot;
It does say, &quot;Don't let your feelings &shyp; especially certain kinds
of feelings &shyp; jerk you around.&quot; Stoicism holds that the only thing
we can truly call our own is our will (or, if you prefer, intellect or spirit).
All else is beyond our control, and therefore, in technical terms, &quot;indifferent.&quot;
But some indifferents are clearly to be preferred to others, because we
are creatures inextricably involved with our fellows,, with the environment,
with deity. What form those relationships take depends on chance and circumstance.
Stoicism, for example, would never say, &quot;Get married. Have kids.&quot;
It would say, &quot;Whatever you choose, you cannot escape the responsibilities
to yourself and others inherent in that choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Epictetus put it, &quot;Let whatever seems to you the best, be to you
an inviolable rule.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Or Marcus Aurelius, writing his own creed: &quot;The man who values a soul
that is rational and universal and social no longer cares for anything else,
but aims solely at keeping the temper of his own soul and all its activities
rational and social, and works together with his fellows to this end. .
. . I have a city and I have a country; as Marcus I have Rome, and as a
human being I have the universe; and consequently what is beneficial to
these communities is the sole good for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But only Epictetus could decide what was the inviolable rule for Epictetus,
and only Marcus could make the final decision in what Marcus would do about
it.      <BR>
<BR>
In this sense, Reform Judaism is a something of a Stoic virtue-ethic. God
remains vague. A Jew can accept anything from a personal deity to a suffusion
of the universe with ethical implications. Laws and traditions offer guidance
only, even if their origin is taken as divine. The sovereign individual
reasons, asks,<I> listen</I>s, and decides. And &shyp; a fundamental tenet
of nearly all virtue-based systems -- this sovereign deciding leads the
individual, in the end, to the conclusion that others, and community, and
planet, and deity, make legitimate claims.<BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, you can't be  sovereign &shyp; or human &shyp; in a vacuum.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot; people see themselves as participating
in, and encouraging, a return to tradition. Perhaps it would be more accurate
to say that they're returning to a blending of traditions. Or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that all ages blend traditions, whether they
care it admit it or not. We live amid a mingling of strange gods. But then,
so did Abraham, and Moses, and Aristotle, and Jesus. As for virtue-ethics,
you don't have to be pagan to understand, or practice it.<BR>
<BR>
You also don't have to be Jewish.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Military as Metaphor</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>The United States defense establishment is approaching the verge
of open rebellion and internal collapse. If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, it
will probably happen in 1997. If Mr. Dole wins, it might take a little longer.
At this point, perhaps the only thing that can avert it is getting the American
people involved. The most pressing defense issue in this country is now
the need for a new covenant between the people and the military they support
with their treasure, their lives, and their blood.<BR>
<BR>
The revolt will begin over money. It no longer matters whose figures you
play with; the money to sustain and modernize the armed forces, in their
present configuration, simply isn't there. After the 1997-1999 projected
cuts, an additional twenty percent force reduction (personnel, weaponry,
readiness) may be inevitable. &quot;Rationing the poverty&quot; among the
services is no longer an option. Nor should it be, given the long-acknowledged
and long-ignored need to restructure for the 21st century.<BR>
<BR>
The rebellion could begin with a single service, reminiscent of the 1949
&quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; after cancellation of the &quot;supercarrier&quot;
that eventually evolved into the modern aircraft carrier. It could easily
erupt into open and vicious inter-service rivalry and turf battles, with
each service protecting its favored systems, and the roles and missions
that justify them. (One of the great technological truths of 20th century
warfare is that, while weapons systems have proliferated, effects have converged.
It is now possible to do things in many different ways: a fact studiously
ignored when it points to the need for major changes in service tasks.)
The revolt may also have an intense - and intensely public -- reserve aspect,
as the services attempt to siphon dollars to the active forces. However
it happens, it won't be pretty.<BR>
<BR>
The internal collapse will come about - indeed, it's already underway -
because of money, and because of the continuing subjection of the military
to civilian social and cultural agendas and experiments, and the continuing
refusal of the senior leadership to (as the beer commercial has it), &quot;know
when to say when,&quot; even at the cost of their careers.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Webb, decorated Marine veteran and former Navy secretary, made the point
loud and clear in his recent speech at the Naval Academy. But Jim Webb can't
do it alone. It's time for the American people to get loud and be clear
about what they expect from their military.<BR>
<BR>
A new covenant between people and military might sound something like this.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Listen up, Pentagon. You too, Commander-in-Chief (assuming that you
happen to be on active duty). You've got three primary missions. The first
is to defend We the People against that which threatens us the most. Currently,
that's weapons of mass destruction, especially small numbers of crude weapons
in the hands of small, crude nations and unlovely subnational groups. Deterrence
can't do it all. We expect to be defended, even if it means interfering
with some of your bureaucratic priorities. It's doable. Just do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your second task is to maintain conventional forces strong enough
to deter conventional aggressors, or whup them handily. This doesn't mean
large standing forces. It means restructuring to take maximum advantage
of U.S. technological superiority (especially in aerospace), and making
maximum use of the reserves and National Guard. Mobilizing the reserves
is We the People's de facto veto on going to war. If you don't have the
political support to invite us along, don't go.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your third task is to conduct (from time to time) humanitarian and
short-of-war operations, such as Bosnia, also with maximum use of the Guard
and reserves. We don't want to be the world's policeman; we'd rather not
be the world's nanny, guru, or sociopolitical therapist. But sometimes we'll
need to use a little muscle, just to remind the planetary DINGOs (Disturbers
of International Good Order) that we're capable of it.<BR>
&quot;Now, regarding who serves, and how, and why.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get two things straight. (And pay attention, federal government, because
we're demanding some major policy and legislative changes here.) First,
nobody has a right to serve. Second, nobody should be excluded from service
simply because somebody else doesn't like his, or her kind messing up the
club. As a society, we're dedicated to equality. But equality doesn't mean
sameness. And equality of opportunity includes the right to honest failure.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Minorities, women, and gays are in the military to stay. They should
have exactly the same rights, and be held to the same standards, as all
others in their positions. It's no disgrace for a woman not to be able to
fly an F-14; few people can. (By the same token, the Air Force has no need
of white male pilots; women and minorities can provide adequate numbers
and skill levels.) It's no disgrace for most women to be weaker than men.
But it is a disgrace for people to be recruited or promoted according to
quotas or &quot;guidelines.&quot; It is a danger for people to fly airplanes
they're not qualified to pilot. And it is preposterous when the Army, for
example, evaluates co-ed basic training on the basis of &quot;equality of
effort,&quot; not equality of results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are no gender-normed battlefields.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And speaking of battlefields, let's talk about sex. When homosexuality
is practiced within a unit, that unit becomes vulnerable to collapse. Ditto
heterosexuality. Sex within the same chain of command compromises that chain.
Sexual harassment is abhorrent. Zero tolerance. But the criterion for action
against offenders should be behavior, not gender or inclination It certainly
should not be unsubstantiated and anonymous allegations, the Tailhook Transgression
(guilty by virtue of just being there), or a single slip of the tongue,
no matter how boorish.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Finally, we're going to help you do all this in two ways. First, we'll
give you about a quarter-trillion a year to play with. More when you're
out there doin' it for fair. That should be enough, if you get your priorities
in order and use it right. Second, we're going to lessen the social and
cultural pressures upon you by severely limiting your vulnerability to lawsuits
from the civilian sector. Your minorities, your women, and your gays are,
by and large, competent and dedicated. But many of their self-styled civilian
defenders are more interested in scoring points - and wrecking institutions
- than in providing for the common defense. They impose their agendas on
you, whose reason for being is to defend us, not submit to their demands.
We want you to be free of endless predatory litigation and threat of litigation
while you're figuring out how to function in this post Cold War world and
this post racist, post patriarchal, post homophobic society that We the
People - fine People that we are - have become.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there is no reason to believe that, short of national emergency,
the American people will devote much thought to their military. They rarely
have before, and for that reason, many worry about the military becoming
a world too-apart. Yet perhaps the opposite is happening. In many ways,
the military has become a metaphor for the larger civilization - the loss
of purpose to peripheral concerns; the surrender to intimidation and expediency;
the vicious, wanton destruction of reputations, careers, and life. Why should
Americans think about the military now? Because it's like looking into a
mirror.<BR>
<BR>
Do we like what we see?

NEW AGE CHANNELLING FOR RIGHT-WING WONKS</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Dr. Philip Gold<BR>
Discovery Institute Senior Fellow</B></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Got a grant to write a culture book. Started reading New Age stuff (Know
Thy Enemy). Unbidden, the question arose: Can conservatives also recover
past lives? I asked a very liberal, very Buddhist lady friend. She replied
that conservatives could not recover past lives until they acquired present
ones. That made it personal. I decided to attempt Recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a dark and stormy night. I sat on the porch with the necessary meditation
aids -- scotch 4 soda, good cigars, meat-based munchies, and a yellow legal
pad to record the results. Trees howled. Wind swayed back and forth. And
when I accessed my first prior life -- Betakh-Betakh, senior fellow _ King
Solomon's think tank, the Center for_ Proverbial Wisdom -- I knew that the
Foundation would soon be getting its money's worth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fourteen other lives were recovered that night. Names have been omitted
when unverifiable and *** indicates possible false recovery.<BR>

<BR>
In sum, the Recovery was an unqualified success. Only problem is, the book's
getting impossible to write. Everybody has their ideas, wants their input,
needs to share. Except for Hiddekel, Perpetua, and Sir Hamilton. They just
edit.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Apollo Covenant beyond the Oscars</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
by <A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold</A></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
     &quot;Apollo 13&quot; did well at the box-office last year. A few nights
ago, it garnered _______ Academy Awards, for ___________. (Or: A few nights
ago, it didn't do quite so well at the Academy Awards, going zero for seven.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The movie was a hit for three reasons. Two are obvious. The third pertains
to the national crisis of soul, although not in a comfortable manner. Because
of this discomfort (actually, more of an existential bad faith), the real
significance of the film remains only dimly and squirmily acknowledged.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Dramatically, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a natural: a fast-paced technothriller
about a business-as-usual moon mission that went terribly wrong, then heroically
right. It was also a natural because it happened to be true. Technothriller
fused with nostalgia, for those years of hope and aspiration before JFK
got his sex life deconstructed and the Cold War's end deprived us of the
folks who, alone of all the powers on earth, could determine whether we
were Ahead or Behind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     But in a larger sense, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is about civilization
itself, and what it takes to sustain it. Seen this way, the movie teaches
some lessons that this country and its politicians and pundits -- for all
the glib-and-gushy verbiage about &quot;restoring trust and civil society&quot;
-- still haven't taken to heart.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The U.S. space effort of those years was, in essence, a set of three
covenants. One was between the government and the people, in accordance
with the constitutional requirement to provide for the common defense and
promote the general welfare. The Apollo project went forward to acquire
knowledge and opportunities, and as part of the global confrontation with
the USSR. That the knowledge and opportunities never materialized, and that
the Cold War aspect now seems questionable, does not negate the constitutional
validity of the covenant. The state, on behalf the the people and with broad
popular support, did what was deemed necessary at the time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second covenant was between the state and the men and women of
the space program itself, to make possible and sustain their success. This
the government honored as long as convenient. In a sense, the space program
met the same fate as Vietnam: not defeat, but abandonment. Perhaps, had
the government honored its commitment to exploration more steadfastly, greater
benefits might have been derived.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      But the most important covenant here was between the men and women
in the civil society of the space program, mutually pledging, if not their
fortunes, certainly their lives and sacred honor in the common endeavor.
In the film, Tom Hanks (playing astronaut Jim Lovell) tells his wife about
the first moon landing: &quot;It wasn't a miracle. We just decided to go.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    But the Apollo Covenant would have been quixotic without three human
virtues, each developed to near-perfection by the covenantors.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
   The first is hard-earned competence. After astronaut Ken Mattingly aces
a surprise simulator emergency, he waves off the praise and asks to work
the problem again because his performance hadn't been perfect. Lovell's
response: &quot;Let's get it right.&quot; When Mattingly's last-minute replacement,
Jack Swigert, muffs a similar drill, crewmate Fred Haise exudes a contempt
that doesn't abate until Swigert's final-hours display of skill and endurance
in preparing the command module for re-entry. &quot;Way to go, Jack&quot;
-- followed by Swigert's stoic, silent, and eloquent acknowledgement of
a covenant kept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Perhaps those who teach that self-esteem derives from psychobabble,
or that respect need not be earned, should include this film in their curricula.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second virtue is trust. Not touchy-feely emotion, but confidence
based upon experience of each other's competence and character. When flight
director Gene Kranz receives the devastating recommendations that they must
shut down the fuel cells (thereby &quot;losing the moon&quot;) and later
must power down the lunar module-lifeboat, his resistance fades before his
reasoned trust. When Swigert doubts that Houston can concoct a re-entry
procedure, Lovell assures him that &quot;they've got half the Ph.Ds on the
planet working on it.&quot; But near the end, when the crew almost believes
they're doomed, Deke Slayton tells them that &quot;Ken Mattingly's in the
simulator.&quot; Lovell's face and voice radiate relief.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Ken's working on it . . .&quot; One man they know and trust, worth
more at that moment than half the Ph.Ds on the planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The third virtue is courage, in Plato's definition: &quot;endurance
of the soul,&quot; in the face of both hardship and expediency. When Kranz
learns that President Nixon &quot;wants odds,&quot; presumably to prepare
for political damage control, Kranz replies: &quot;We're not losing those
men.&quot; When the &quot;Grumman guy&quot; starts hedging that his company
&quot;can't make any guarantees&quot; about the lunar lander's performance
in space,  Kranz first tries to stiffen him. &quot;I'm not interested in
what anything was designed to do. I'm interested in what it can do.&quot;
Later, he writes the guy off as beneath contempt. When he tells his flight
controllers, &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; he knows they understand
what he means, and they know he means it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Marilyn Lovell displays similar endurance, her circumstantial passivity
spiked by unwillingess to tolerate anything less than honesty from NASA
and her abhorrence of media ghoulishness. Indeed, among the Apollo convenantors,
those on the ground displayed endurance of the soul equal to those in the
space craft. It was fitting, if no doubt unintentional, that the film's
two nominations for acting excellence went to Ed Harris, who played Gene
Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     In sum, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a morality play. Its moral: You can
have your civilization, your accomplishments, your greatness. But it isn't
free and it isn't safe and it isn't easy. And, unless you're committed to
doing what it takes, one day failure will become an option.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     And then a fact.<BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>The awful case of Commander Stumpf</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B><I>From the Seattle Times Friday, January 26, 1996<BR></I></B><H1><CENTER>UNWRITTEN LAWS GROUND <BR>STAR NAVY PILOT</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>By <BR><I>Philip Gold </I></CENTER></H3><HR><BR><BR>The Romans had a proverb. Of all our laws, some are written and some arenot. <BR><BR><BR>As is often the case with proverbs, their surface simplicity conceals deepertruths. In this instance, at least two. <BR><BR><BR>First, written law can't do it all. There must be other sources of valueand discipline and mercy: religion, morality, honor, tradition and commonsense. <BR><BR><BR>Second, these &quot;unwritten laws&quot; are just that - laws. They toocan become unjust, oppressive, insane. <BR><BR><BR>Latest American example: The case of Commander Robert E. Stumpf, UnitedStates Navy. The particulars concern his career. But his situation shouldbe a warning, a clear signal that the &quot;unwritten laws&quot; of thecivilian political processes are corrupting the military, just as they'vetainted politics. And the growing bipartisan support for Cmdr. Stumpf shouldalso be read as a sign. The American people are beginning to say, enough.Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf is, by all standard measurements, a man on the fast track to thestars. An accomplished fighter pilot, he flew with distinction in the GulfWar, commanded the Navy's elite Blue Angels precision flying team and enjoysa fine reputation within the service. The Navy selected him for promotionto captain in 1994; the Senate confirmed him. He was then selected for futureassignment as an aircraft carrier group commander, perhaps the most covetedflying job in the Navy. <BR><BR><BR>Now, what's wrong with this picture? For starters, three things: Cmdr. Stumpf'spresence at the notorious Tailhook '91 convention; a Navy clerical error,and the judgment of some people in very high places. Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf attended Tailhook under orders to receive an award for the squadronhe commanded. He flew there in an F/A-18, logged as a training mission -a totally acceptable practice, when such training missions have to be flownanyway and other forms of transportation are either inconvenient or costly.Cmdr. Stumpf was present in one of the &quot;hospitality suites&quot; andwitnessed a hired stripper's performance; tacky, but hardly illegal. Heleft and retired for the night before some reprehensible but consensualactivities took place. No assaults occurred in this particular suite. .<BR><BR><BR>Stumpf was later investigated by the Navy, along with everybody else sweptup in that botched inquisitorial frenzy. He was completely exonerated andreturned to duty. <BR><BR><BR>His second ordeal began a few months ago, after the Senate had confirmedthe promotion list on which his name appeared. Apparently, the Navy hadviolated Senate instructions to &quot;flag&quot; the name of anyone connectedwith Tailhook. The Navy informed the Senate Armed Services Committee ofthe error. It seems senatorial pique at having been &quot;deceived&quot;coincided with an anonymous phone-accusation campaign directed at the committee.Last October, apparently at a non-quorum meeting, the committee voted tooppose the promotion. The result was a letter so indicating to Navy SecretaryJohn Dalton, signed by committee chairman Strom Thurmond and ranking DemocratSam Nunn. The letter noted that, since, the full Senate had already acted,rescinding the promotion was the Navy's job. <BR><BR><BR>Secretary Dalton complied. <BR><BR><BR>As of this writing Cmdr. Stumpf has been informed neither of the &quot;accusation&quot;against him nor the identity of his &quot;accusers.&quot; He has been refusedpermission to meet with the committee, or to defend himself in writing.Mr. Dalton defends the reversal by citing the need to maintain the &quot;integrityof the process.&quot; Also as of this writing, the Navy is considering anew policy to let promotion boards view &quot;potentially adverse&quot;information on officers that would not be contained in an individual's officialfile - such as anonymous accusations. The Marines have already adopted thispolicy. <BR><BR><BR>Let's dispose of the obvious first. Tailhook was abhorrent. So was the Navy'sresponse. The guilty walked. The innocent bled. The service humiliated itselftwice over. <BR><BR><BR>Also obvious is the fact that the Navy needs to change its &quot;unwrittenlaws&quot; governing treatment of female service members, perhaps its attitudetoward women in general. However, the Navy and the Pentagon, need to startstanding up to the shrill minority of feminists for whom no sacrificialexpiation will ever be enough. How ironic it is that service women havemore in common with their male &quot;oppressors&quot; than with their anti-military&quot;defenders&quot; in The Sisterhood. And how sad it is that militarywomen now complain that they can't get the kind of counseling and mentoringthey need from their male superiors. The guys are afraid to be alone withthem. <BR><BR><BR>Now to the less obvious but vital fact. The handling of Cmdr. Stumpf's casereflects what is now the unwritten law of the United States. While the &quot;written&quot;legal system stands ready to excuse almost anything (remember O.J.?), theunwritten system is always ready to convict. Accusation now equates to guilt,perpetual guilt. Punishment is automatic and severe. And those who are persecutedbecome not deterrent examples of evil, but warnings to &quot;good people&quot;to stay away. <BR><BR><BR>Men and women are leaving the service in disgust, their numbers lost amidthe statistics of the personnel drawdown. Others, whose names will neverbe known, are simply refusing to enter. The same is happening in civilianpublic life. <BR><BR><BR>Who needs it? When a hero's career can be destroyed for simply being ina room where somebody else later did something; when a woman can lose aCabinet appointment because she didn't pay her nanny's Social Security;when a man can win a Supreme Court seat yet remain pilloried for life onthe basis of He Said/She Said, this is no longer a partisan issue. Thisis not the upholding of any moral standard remotely related to reality.This is a vicious, pharisaical, ex post facto, pseudo-moral McCarthyism,and worse. <BR><BR><BR>Cmdr. Stumpf should be the symbol around which can rally everyone - Democrat,Republican, civilian, military, male, female - who wants this way of doingthings stopped. <BR><BR>Let the inquisitions end here. <BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospace studiesat the Seattle-based Discovery Institute and a lecturer at Georgetown University.</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Psychobabble Rising</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><I>Insight magazine December 18, 1995<BR></I></H3><H1><CENTER>Psychobabble Rising, but we <I>Feel the Pain</I> </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I><A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold </A></I></CENTER></H3><BR><HR>Bill and Hillary. The president who feels your pain. The presidentialpartner (n&eacute;e first lady) who informs you that you know your lifeis empty and touts the Politics of Meaning as therapy. The couple who consideropposition to their caring policies as mean-spirited, unfeeling and paranoid,and who take to the airwaves to instruct the republic on how to talk tothe kids about everything from cigarettes to the Oklahoma City bombing.<BR><BR><BR>Ever since the Clintons first entered our collective consciousness (andcollective unconscious?) both the pundits and the people have noted theirpenchant for psychologized discourse. Columnist Suzanne Fields recentlysuggested that Clinton seems to aspire to a role nowhere mentioned in theConstitution or other legislation: therapist-in-chief. Most Americans probablyhave not viewed this as anything to get paranoid, neurotic, obsessed orborderline-disordered about. After all, psychobabble is everywhere. <BR><BR><BR>And that's the problem. Psychobabble-the reduction of personal and politicaldiscourse to minimal psychologized vocabularies-is no passing fad. It is,instead, the culmination of a century-long process. And, in many ways, Clinton-aman who seems to have neither core nor anchor, and scant sensibility savefor his image of others' image of him-is an appropriate president for anation in the final stages of psychologized dysfunction. <BR><BR><HR><H3><CENTER>***Psychobabble-discourse in psychologized vocabularies-is nopassing fad.*** </CENTER></H3><HR>A little history tells a lot. <BR><BR><BR>A century or so ago, this country experienced a deep cultural crisis. Comfortableold spiritual verities were yielding to the domineering, irrefutable truthsof materialistic science. As the cities filled with the new middle classesof the corporate workforce and with millions of immigrants, once-stablesocial patterns and traditions deteriorated. America seemed destined tobecome a multicultural, amoral mess. Divorce rates were rising. Crime wasrampant. Not everybody read, or even worse, respected the same books. Allthe little issues seemed to combine into one big issue that no one couldquite define, let alone solve. <BR><BR><BR>Enter the shrinks. <BR><BR><BR>One of the salient characteristics of the so-called Progressive Era (roughlyTeddy Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson) was the bipartisan deification of expertiseand the professionalization of just about every human activity that couldbe professionalized. Psychiatry was a profession, albeit a poorly regardedand remunerated one. Psychiatrists worked at the margins of medicine andsocial relevance, mostly in state and charitable mental hospitals and asylums.Meanwhile, in the ruts and grooves of academe, psychology was strugglingto establish itself as a separate and independent branch of human knowledge,i.e., as university departments with their own budgets and as an organizedbody of practitioners with lots of dull journals to read and pompous conventionsto attend. <BR><BR><BR>Both groups decided that respectability and affluence could be attainedby expanding their purview. Psychiatry, with a nudge or two from Freud andhis claque, decided that the whole world was sick and in need of its ministrations,whether it knew it or not. Ditto psychology, and that strange amalgam, psychotherapy,was born. <BR><BR><BR>(Scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as psychotherapy, onlya melange of competing theories and practices. Imagine a chemistry thatcontained 50 different definitions of a molecule.)<BR><BR><BR><BR>The therapists also decided that they could be of inestimable value by insertingthemselves and their notions into the workings of every aspect of the stateand on behalf of causes that appealed to them personally. So these new expertson the human spirit began peddling their wares everywhere they could findcustomers. <BR><BR><BR>And find them they did-in social work, the juvenile- and criminal-justicesystems, in education and the other disciplines, among the clergy, the literati,the artistes. Some worked out of universities; other found employment withthe government or the private sector, teaching corporations how to manufacturedocile workers and ardent consumers, helping the government hype its warsand policies and generally convincing the populace that theirs was the kingdomand the truth. <BR><BR><BR>By the 1950s, few Americans could find a mate, raise their kids, confronttheir troubles or know what to feel without seeking, or being affected by,these experts. In the 1960s, politics itself became psychologized-protestbecame a form of growth and fulfillment and the issue protested matteredless than the protest. Jimmy Carter probably was the first president whosemajor attractiveness was his therapeutic value. Feminism devolved into the-personal-is-politicalschtick of consciousness-raising and if-I-feel-oppressed-I-must-be. Nukeshad to go because they upset the kids. Welfare is good because it's caringand compassionate. Ecological legislation will help restore our global consciousnessand that is the primary goal, regardless of the real-world effects. <BR><BR><BR>Then came the talk shows. And the recovery books. And the &quot;abuse excuse&quot;in law. And the Clintons, who, like so many of their generational and politicalconfreres, insist on judging policies by their intent and not their results,and who attack their opponents' emotions, not their ideas. Thomas Sowellsees this as the fundamental characteristic-and perhaps weakness-of theliberal self-anointed. <BR><BR><BR>Psychologized discourse has been around for a century. It has had a centuryto prove that it can't deliver. It's not just that if heart surgeons hadthe same success rate as psychotherapists, they'd all be in prison. It'sthat a civilization in thrall to the psychological can't work. It createspeople who can conceive of themselves only as isolated units with the outerworld important only as a source of frustration or gratification. It createsa politics in which emotions become the goal, not the fuel. It makes rationaldiscourse impossible. <BR><BR><BR>And Bill Clinton represents the final stage of this deterioration. It isreported that, in his latest incarnation, he intends to campaign in 1996by portraying the Republicans as &quot;heartless.&quot; <BR><BR><BR>Democrat or Republican-do you like this form of governance? <BR><BR><BR>In your politics? In your courts? In your culture? In your private lives?And in your souls? <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a lecturer at Georgetown University. </I></B></CENTER><P><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Homee</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Gold Inquiry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H2></H2><H2><CENTER>1995 Discovery Inquiry Vol. III, #1</CENTER></H2><H2><HR></H2><H1><CENTER><BR>What does a 21st century defense require?</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Philip Gold</I></CENTER></H3><BR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Americans favor a strong defense. But a nation can bestrong in the wrong ways. Since the 1994 election, there has been a growingdebate over the condition of the American military. Unfortunately, it isthe wrong debate, leading to the wrong conclusion-that America's defenseproblems can be solved by money alone. In reality, the present defense establishmentis an Industrial Age organization struggling to adapt to two new worlds:that of the post-Cold War disorder and that of the microchip. This year,the American people will devote well over a quarter-trillion dollars tothis increasingly obsolescent military structure. Because of mistakes duringthe post-Cold War builddown, some small selective, short-term increaseswill be necessary. But in the long run, the proper course is not to spendmore. The proper course is to spend smarter. This Discovery Inquiry offersa conceptual tool for thinking about such change. </I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><H4>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </H4><BR><BR>The current debate over national defense exhibits a curious sterility. Onthe surface, much of it involves the impassioned swapping of clich&eacute;s.Yes, we will always need somebody with a rifle on the ground; yes, aircraftcarriers can do things land-based aviation can't; yes, land-based airpowercan do things carriers can't; yes, redundancy of capabilities is important.Such statements have a &quot;true but not very helpful&quot; quality, sincethey say nothing about the proper mix of forces, or how to prepare and employthem. And, rather often, the clich&eacute;-mongers turn out to be thosewith special interests to protect. <BR><BR><BR>Beneath the bromides, the debate centers on two issues. One is readiness:real and perceived current inadequacies and the perhaps imminent dangerof a hollow force, unable to accomplish its missions, due to lack of training,equipment, and supply. The other is the capability of the current force,even if fully prepared, to handle the two &quot;nearly simultaneous majorregional conflicts&quot; posited as the strategic baseline in the Clintonadministration's Bottom-Up Review. <BR><BR><BR>So far, much of this debate has been an exercise in bean-counting, i.e.,quantitative assessments of how many billions spent, how many ships, divisions,and planes available, how many training days missed. These dry statisticsare often counterpointed by what might be termed &quot;analysis-by-anecdote&quot;-amelange of uncritically collected and repeated horror stories. <BR><BR><BR>The problem with this approach is twofold. First, readiness, like education,is a difficult condition to quantify. Statistics are easily manipulated,and readiness itself means nothing without asking: &quot;Readiness for what?&quot;For example, not everybody goes to war at once. If a division requires onemonth to prepare for deployment, but transportation won't be available forthree, high readiness is actually wasteful. Further, the services are stilldownsizing; it makes no sense to lavish resources on units slated for abolition.Many of the readiness horror stories appear to come out of lower-priorityunits. <BR><BR><BR>But more importantly, indices of readiness say nothing about what kindsof forces the U.S. ought to have. The analogy may be extreme but, in 1939,the Poles had the most ready cavalry in Europe. It is true that, short-term,the present force must be maintained at adequate, perhaps unprecedentedlyhigh levels. And, in fact, there is evidence that shortages have begun toaffect higher-priority units. But it is also true that the current forceis simply too large to be maintained at such readiness on any politicallyconceivable peacetime budget. Thus, the very attempt to maintain too largea force actually decreases overall readiness. A smaller force, differentlystructured and postured, is the logical alternative. <BR><BR><BR>Not surprisingly, the same bean-counting mentality that decrees the presentforce unready also calls for larger forces if the strategic requirementsof the Bottom-Up Review-the Clinton administration's conventional defensestrategy-are to be met. But the fundamental problem with the Bottom-Up Reviewis not that the forces available are inadequate. The problem with the Bottom-UpReview is that it's conceptually inadequate, and should be treated as such.<BR><BR><BR>The Bottom-Up Review posits the need to win two more-or-less simultaneousconflicts, presumably one in the Persian Gulf and one in Korea. The rationaleis that, should the U.S. find itself immersed in one war, another regionalpredator might be tempted to take advantage of the fact and start a second.Whether this might happen is speculative, at best. Less speculative is thefact that such a situation would be a national emergency unparalleled sincePearl Harbor (especially if an Iranian-Iraqi alliance ever materializes).Yet the Bottom-Up Review counts only active forces. In a two-front, perhapsa two-continent war, early and massive reserve mobilization would be unavoidable.<BR><BR><BR>Further, the Review accepts-indeed, effectively mandates-an operationalconcept guaranteed to produce maximum U.S. casualties and minimum results.In both wars, the U.S. would permit the aggressor to strike cross-borderfirst. U.S. forces would then &quot;stabilize the front,&quot; await reinforcements,counterattack and restore the status quo ante. Some of these forces, mostnotably heavy bombers and Marines, would &quot;swing&quot; between warsin a process lasting several months. This &quot;wait-get-hit-stabilize-reinforce-and-restore&quot;approach, itself a legacy of NATO planning for a Soviet invasion, workedin Desert Shield/Desert Storm largely because of Saddam Hussein's acquiescence.It must be doubted that the U.S. will ever again find so breathtakinglyco-operative an adversary. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, the Bottom-Up Review is far from the first U.S. strategy to sufferfrom a bad case of what is known at the Pentagon as the &quot;plans/realitymismatch.&quot; In the 1960s, Mr. McNamara and his Whiz Kids produced the&quot;2 1/2 War Strategy&quot;-simultaneous combat with the Soviets, theCommunist Chinese, and somebody else in a little war somewhere. (That 1/2war turned out to be Vietnam, which nearly wrecked the defense establishment.)Under Nixon, it became the &quot;1 1/2 War Strategy.&quot; During the Carteradministration, a &quot;Swing Strategy&quot;-moving hollow forces from warto war-enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame, and, mercifully, zero momentsof employment. <BR><BR><BR>In this sense, the Bottom-Up Review is not much different from its predecessors,and proof once again of General Eisenhower's dictum that &quot;Planningis essential; plans are useless.&quot; Or perhaps the Bottom-Up Review shouldbe regarded as merely a particularly inept transitional document, somethingto stick in the drawer until the world situation clarifies. But it mightnot be a bad idea if that drawer were to remain empty for a while. If theUnited States cannot currently produce a serious military strategy, perhapsit makes more sense to concentrate on the resources first. Then, with thattask underway, it might be useful to rewrite the brochure. <BR><H4>FORCE STRUCTURE, ROLES AND MISSIONS </H4><BR><BR>The military capabilities of any defense establishment are embedded in itsforce structure. Creating this structure is both art and science. Structuringentails an endless series of decisions and trade-offs: what to leave in,what to leave out, how to achieve the necessary combat synergies. Forcestructure is everything from how many divisions in the Army (and whetherdivisions are still a useful kind of organization) to how many riflemenin a squad and who will carry the grenade launchers and machine guns; howmany ships in the fleet and of what types; how many heavy bombers and whatkinds of munitions they will carry. <BR><BR><BR>Theoretically, and usually in practice, a nation's force structure is determinedby its geographical position and strategic needs. Historically, for mostnations, necessity requires that one service or form of power dominate;the others support. In the 20th century, for example, Germany and Russiawere land powers. Both got into serious strategic and economic trouble whenthey started acquiring navies they didn't need, but that threatened maritimepowers. Conversely, Great Britain was primarily a naval power; extendedland combat in two world wars devastated the country. Israel is a land power,although its situation dictates a very strong Air Force. Other countries-NorthVietnam comes to mind-succeed with little besides ground forces. <BR><BR><BR>Further, a country's force structure will be determined by whether its warsare fought at or close to home, or far away. Expeditionary forces cost muchmore than equivalent territorial forces, since they require sea and airlift,resupply, and, often, foreign basing. Expeditionary forces also tend tobe professional and available for duties short of all-out war. Often, theiruse does not signal long-term commitment. Territorial forces, on the otherhand, are often filled by conscripts, and-in the democracies-usually limitedto home defense or foreign wars fully supported by the population. <BR><BR><BR>But America's strategic needs are unique, and its military exhibits characteristicsof both territorial and expeditionary forces. <BR><BR>U.S. forces are, virtually by definition, expeditionary. They are also professional.But they operate under the severe political limitations characteristic ofdemocracies, not the least of which is the requirement that victory be rapidand relatively bloodless. U.S. force structure is also unique. No nationhas ever amassed the same mix: the normal array of land, sea, and air capabilitiesplus: <UL><LI>a fleet of large-deck aircraft carriers <LI>the world's largest Marine Corps <LI>long-range stealthy bombers <LI>an incomparable C3I (command, control, communications, intelligence)capability. </UL><BR><BR>America's mix of normal and unique, territorial and expeditionary capabilitieshas evolved throughout the 20th century. However, for a variety of reasons-fromchanging threats to technological revolutions and the popular insistenceon short, perhaps impossibly &quot;clean&quot; wars-the present structureis no longer adequate. The mix must change. <BR><BR><BR>Prior to the First World War, things were simple. If it happened on land,the Army tended to it; the Navy pursued its activities at sea. There were,of course, a few overlaps. The Army maintained coastal fortifications andartillery. The Navy might occasionally bombard a shore or land small partiesof Marines. But neither service could do, or take, the other's job. <BR><BR><BR>The airplane blurred this tidy division of labor. So did the mixing andmatching of hitherto unrelated systems. In World War II, carrier aviationroutinely struck ground targets. Land-based planes could take on fleets,provide convoy protection, etc. Simultaneously, a plethora of new capabilitiesdeveloped: armor, paratroops, submarines, large-scale amphibious forces,and strategic bombers, to name a few. Later came helicopters, missile-firingsubmarines, and the precision-guidance revolution. <BR><BR><BR><I>The result is that today, while military technologies and systems haveproliferated, their effects have converged</I>. It is now possible to fightin many different ways. For example, it used to be axiomatic that the bestanti-tank weapon was another (preferably larger) tank. But today, thereare easily over twenty different ways to destroy tanks: other tanks, infantryanti-armor weapons, special artillery munitions, helicopter gunships, attackaircraft, various mines. Conceivably, in a few years, submarines will beable to fire cruise missiles carrying anti-tank submunitions, each guidedto its target by internal sensors or by satellites. When ships underwaterfight tanks well-inland with the aid of systems in space, clearly, the conductof war could use some sustained rethinking. <BR><BR><BR>But there is another aspect to this proliferation and convergence of technologiesand systems. Capabilities that once were unique or clearly complementarycan begin to seem redundant, especially in an era of nebulous threats andconstrained resources. For example, once aircraft carriers and Marines couldgo where land-based aircraft and paratroop couldn't; ships had longer rangesand more staying power than planes, and that was that. They still do, butsuch staying power may not always be a relevant characteristic. Today, AirForce heavy bombers operating from only three bases (in the United States,Guam, and on Diego Garcia) can strike anywhere on earth within eighteenhours of alert. Paratroops out of North Carolina can reach, say, Beirut,faster than Marines steaming through Gibraltar. Thus, there are now at leasttwo ways to perform long-distance &quot;get-in-and-get-out&quot; air andground operations. <BR><BR><BR>This is not to say, of course, that carriers and Marines are obsolete. Farfrom it: Each service still possesses unique core competencies. Nor is itto suggest that redundancy is undesirable; in war, redundancy is vital.But it is to suggest that the current structure and mix of forces can bereconfigured to make maximum use of this new array of capabilities in anaffordable manner-even if this involves some alteration of each service'straditional roles and missions. <BR><BR><BR>From time to time, the Pentagon's internal struggle over roles and missions(technically, roles, missions, and functions) enters public consciousness.The subject can seem arcane. In reality, though, it's as simple as it issignificant. Imagine a theater company. Its mission is to stage &quot;Hamlet.&quot;To do this, it requires an on-stage cast. Each member plays a role. Somemay play, or prepare to play, more than one. Finally, the troupe needs alarge number of supporting functions: lights, tickets, PR, etc. <BR><BR><BR>At the highest military levels, joint and unified commanders (the GeneralSchwarzkopfs) receive missions. They draw their cast of characters and supportingspecialists from the individual services and from the larger defense establishment.Obviously, the needs of the combatant commands should determine what theservices purchase and train for. Indeed, the unified commanders and thePentagon's Joint Resources Oversight Council have achieved significant influenceover the process. But the individual services still write their own budgets,in accordance with roles and requirements carved into law decades ago. Andthe legal and bureaucratic history of this assignment process has been,in large measure, the history of making sure that the services get whatthey want. <BR><BR><BR>But today, the problem is how to make the new array of capabilities relevantto the myriad challenges of the 21st century. And one of the great hindrancesto a new force structure is the old division of labor. <BR><BR><BR>What follows is not so much a detailed list of recommendations for reallocationof roles, missions, and functions as it is a way of thinking about suchreallocations. <BR><BR><BR>To repeat: The problem is not money. This country can defend itself on abit less than three hundred billion dollars a year. But the establishmentmust be restructured. Less-of-the-same no longer avails. <BR><BR><BR>And neither does more-of-the-same. <BR><H4>GUIDING CONCEPTS FOR A NEW DEFENSE</H4><BR><BR>The following points provide a conceptual framework for restructuring defense.Full implementation would probably require changes to Title 10, USC, andto Department of Defense Directive 5100.1, the basic legal and tasking documents.For present purposes, such specific changes need not be addressed. <OL><LI><B>1) We're in an asymmetrical arms race. </B>It is obvious that thepost-Cold War world offers a variety of threats, from heavily armed aggressorstates to terrorist splinter groups. Less obvious is the fact that thereis an arms race going on-an historically unique arms race, in that it isthoroughly asymmetrical. The United States is, for practical purposes, outof the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) business. Development and productionof precision-guidance weapons and systems are now primary. Meanwhile, theplanetary predators develop or purchase nuclear, chemical, and/or biologicalweapons, along with crude but serviceable delivery systems. Thus, the fundamentaltask is to make U.S. power effective against both conventional forces andweapons of mass destruction. <LI><B>2) Culture constrains combat.</B> The American people, for reasonsranging from innate decency to media hype and hysteria, will not acceptprotracted land combat or heavy casualties. This means that, politicallyas well as militarily, it is vital to deter aggression or, failing that,to win rapidly and decisively. This is especially true because future aggressorsmay well try to create conditions in which the United States deters itselffrom responding to aggression. This can be done by initiating conflict inwhich protracted fighting and heavy casualties will be inevitable, or bystriking so quickly and successfully that response becomes pointless orcounterproductive. To avoid these situations, conventional deterrence mustbe overwhelmingly credible. Should deterrence fail, the rapid use of overwhelmingforce will be imperative. <LI><B>3) The U.S. is an aerospace power</B>. This overwhelming force hasa special character. Militarily, the United States is neither a land nora sea power, as these terms have traditionally been understood. The U.S.neither defends its territory against invasion nor covets the lands of others;there are few pieces of real estate anywhere for which this country wouldfight. Nor is there an enemy fleet to seek out and destroy, or sea lanesmenaced by raiders. The United States is, instead, an aerospace power: thefirst and only one in history. Aerospace power, in all its aspects, is thegreat American comparative advantage. Aerospace does not mean exclusively,or even primarily, &quot;Air Force.&quot; It centers on the Air Force, butalso includes naval aviation, Army capabilities, and-of great importance-precision-guidedweaponry and C3I systems. True, aerospace power will not be relevant toevery situation. But, since it is the great U.S. advantage, and since theAmerican people abhor bloody ground combat, as a general rule: Whatevercan be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. <LI><B>4) Aerospace forces come first.</B> It is time to recognize thatthe precision-guidance revolution, coupled with long-range and stealthydelivery platforms (submarines as well as aircraft) has the potential tochange the nature of conventional combat. For millennia, it has seemed axiomaticthat, since people live on land, wars must ultimately be settled on land,i.e., by the taking and holding of territory. However, as Clausewitz pointedout, war is a political act, intended to compel the enemy to do our will.In any given situation, territory may be a vital element of victory; itmay also be irrelevant. Terrorist groups or rogue states may or may notpossess territorial ambitions. Still, it has remained taken-for-grantedthat, in conventional war, the land campaign must be the centerpiece. Allelse supports the ground war. <BR>But in Desert Storm, land combat didn't win the war. Land combat finishedit. In the future, presidents and commanders may wish to repeat the DesertStorm sequence: a devastating air war followed by a relatively easy groundcampaign. Alternatively, they may decide, or be forced to decide, that theland campaign must be central. But they should have the aerospace option.This means that the Air Force's unique capabilities-global range, stealth,advanced precision weaponry-should not be tied, doctrinally or operationally,to the ground campaign. It also means that the air components of the otherservices should be kept strong and employed creatively within their ownrealms. <BR><BR><LI><B>5) Force structure must reflect reality.</B> From this it followsthat U.S. structuring priorities should be:<BR><BR>  <UL>  <LI>Aerospace power in its many aspects   <LI>Rapid response Marine and Army forces possessing substantial combatpower. This includes a Marine Corps of about 175,000 and a selection ofArmy paratroop, air-mobile, and light infantry units at battalion/ brigadelevel, plus other (Ranger, Special Forces, etc.) units.   <LI>Heavier Army units at brigade/division/light corps level capable ofrapid deployment and employment.   </UL></OL><BR><BR>For the Army, this entails both continuation of a post-Vietnam trend anda radical rethinking. In the 1970s, the Defense Department chose, for budgetaryand political reasons, to adopt and seriously implement the &quot;TotalForce Policy,&quot; declaring the reserves equal to the regular forces forplanning and employment purposes. This meant, among other things, that theArmy couldn't engage in protracted war without reserve mobilization. TheArmy wisely accepted this policy, recognizing that reserve mobilizationprovided a crucial test of popular support and national commitment. In the1990s, this policy should be pursued with renewed vigor. <I>Militarily aswell as politically, the capability to wage sustained ground warfare shouldreside with the people</I>. Today, the Army is a force of over a million,when reserve and National Guard units are counted: certainly an adequatenumber, if properly structured and prepared. <BR><BR><BR>Two principles follow. First, if a threat is not worth mobilizing the reservesto counter, or if the reserves can't be mobilized for political reasons,it's probably not wise to get into a major war. And, second, If large unitscan't be ready to fight in a very few weeks, they probably belong in thereserves. <BR><BR><BR>As a practical matter, this means that the Army must reconsider the natureof its larger active-force units. The old division and corps structure,with its many layers of command and staff, and its ponderous logistical&quot;tail&quot; may well be obsolete; future forces might better be a flexiblemix of brigades tailored into light corps, with reduced staffs and supportunits. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, not every active unit, regardless of size, can be ready all thetime. But large unready active units are a waste of money. The Army is themost labor-intensive of the services, and there are significant cost savingsin cutting personnel. Since World War II, the Army has been structured forexpansion as well as for immediate employment. World War II demonstratedthat, while a lieutenant or a private might be turned out in a few months,competent senior officers and non-commissioned officers took many yearsto develop. In effect, the Army stockpiled these people on active duty againstsome future mobilization requirement, finding them employment in bloatedstaffs, unnecessary organizations, and endless schools. But the days ofIndustrial Age warfare-of protracted mass mobilization-are gone. The activeArmy needs to downsize even more, modernize, and capitalize. And, in fact,the Army is moving toward these goals in a variety of experimental programs,although there is a certain reluctance to admit it too openly. This trendshould continue. <OL><LI><B>6) Structure determines spending priorities.</B> Defense spendingshould accord with these priorities. And, for the next few years, one ofthe top priorities should be acquisition of ample precision-guided munitionsand supporting systems, plus stockpiling of critical parts in the eventof a &quot;surge&quot; production requirement. The United States is indeedan aerospace power, but that doesn't mean that, just because something haswings, the Pentagon has to buy it. There must be rational trade-offs betweenplatforms and munitions. </OL><BR>The best example here is the B-2 stealth bomber. At over $800 million percopy for the 20 already on order, and at $20,000 per hour to operate, theplane is simply too expensive. Nor are next-generation fighter and attackaircraft an urgent priority; upgraded current models will serve for thenext few years. True, sometime after 2000, new aircraft will be required,and development should proceed aggressively. Air superiority is not a God-givenAmerican right; it must be maintained. But, for the next few years, themunitions will be more important than the platforms that launch them. Whenthe price of a B-2 bomber is also the cost of more than 800 Tomahawk cruisemissiles, for the Navy and the Air Force, the correct choice is obvious.<BR><BR><BR>Other high priorities include aggressive development of next generationsystems and ample funding for the Army's experimental programs. R&amp;Dis future readiness; it should not be sacrificed to maintain the presentforce at the present size. A final priority: airlift and fast sealift. Themost powerful military on earth is useless if it can't get to the war, orsustain itself once there. <BR><OL><LI><B>7) Presence and peacekeeping options expand</B>. In recent years,two activities short-of-war have consumed enormous resources. One is theso-called &quot;presence mission,&quot; i.e., keeping combat-ready forcesin and around various global hot spots. The most effective presence is,obviously, permanently overseas-based, combat-capable forces. But, for betteror worse, U.S. forces are coming home. The next-best presence forces aredeployed aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine amphibious ready groups;these units are mobile, operate in international waters, and have significantcombat power and sustainability. They are also vital during the transitionfrom crisis to war, and as the &quot;enabling&quot; force that permits theArmy and Air Force to get ashore. But they are also expensive, and presencemay now be defined as more than the up-close-and-personal. </OL><BR><BR>To the extent that presence is a condition in the mind of would-be aggressors-theknowledge that the stealth fighters and bombers and the Tomahawk-firingsubmarines and the paratroops are also out there-these capabilities mayaugment, and sometimes replace, more traditional forces. It's not a perfecttrade-off, but one that is both available and reasonable. The trade-offcan also lead to the conclusion that the constant deployment of carrierbattle groups may no longer be necessary in certain areas. The Navy hasrecognized this for years. Its efforts and experiments in &quot;adaptiveforce packaging&quot;-sending out presence forces without the large-deckcarriers-should continue. Marine amphibious carriers and surface ships armedwith precision-guided weaponry may not be as powerful or versatile as thebig-deck battle groups, but the option is valuable. <BR><BR><BR>The other major short-of-war activity consists of peace-keeping and humanitarianoperations. These are expensive, exhausting, and demoralizing. They alsowreak havoc with operating schedules and tempos, especially when a crisiserupts and the Joint Chiefs call on whatever units might be available. Aspecial Army peacekeeping division might not be a bad idea; if established,it should not count against Army end strength, or be funded out of Armyappropriations. <BR><OL><LI><B>8) Home defense belongs in the structure.</B> Finally, defense, likecharity, begins at home. Although the United States is not vulnerable toinvasion, it is entirely open to attack by weapons of mass destruction.Too often, the debate over continental defense comes down to a spuriouseither/or. &quot;Why build defenses when bombs can be smuggled in?&quot;and equivalent arguments. But it's not either/or. And, in fact, many ofthe battlefield and theater weapons now coming into the hands of potentialpredators could be used against the continental United States. Launchinga crude cruise or ballistic missile from a yacht or merchant ship on thehigh seas may well be easier than assembling and emplacing so-called &quot;suitcasebombs.&quot; These weapons can now be targeted with the aid of commerciallyavailable satellite navigation systems. </OL><BR><BR>And the United States is not alone in facing this problem. Many other nationshave a vital interest in defense against limited attacks. Russia, especially.It is therefore imperative that the United States begin a serious home defenseprogram, based upon maximum use of available and developing battlefieldand theater defenses, and in concert with other nations, whenever possible.What will it cost? Less, no doubt, than someday pondering the crater whereManhattan once stood, or the million bloated corpses that used to be thegood people of Puget Sound. <BR><H3>Conclusion </H3><BR><BR>The preceding has dealt with the conceptual framework for defense restructuringin a transitional era. Today, there is no defining threat. There is, however,a defining opportunity, created by changing technologies and world politics.These require a new force structure. But unnecessary defense spending is,domestically as well as internationally, a clear and present danger. Evenduring the coldest days of the Cold War, President Eisenhower could warnthat it was possible to spend too much on defense, and to spend it wrongly.His admonition is still apt. <BR><BR><BR><HR><H4>Dr. Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and directorof the Institute's Aerospace 2010 Project.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

<H3>The Looming Crisis</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is your financial future at risk? Do you worry that your stnadard
of living is threatened? Does it concern you that for the first time in
America's history young adults today do not believe they will exceed the
achievements of their parents' generation?<BR>
<BR>
If you answered yes you are not alone. Millions of us -- Baby Boomers and
Gen Xers -- have lost faith in America's twin promises of retirment security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Saving Social Security</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think we can shore up the failing Social Security
system by pouring billions more tax dollars into a system basically unchanged
since President Roosevelt introduced in in 1935. Others say it should be
scrapped altogether, that we should break the promises ratified by every
US President since Roosevelt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Mission</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Economic Security 2000 is committed to reviving the Roosevelet
committment to retirment security and restoring economic opportunity to
millioins of Americans, many workings tow and three jobs without getting
ahead.<BR>
<BR>
We have time to transform Social Security, but we must act quickly -- before
the year 2000. America's third cnetury can be an era of security, ownership,
growth, savings, investment, and unprecedented prosperity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Economic Security 2000 presents a blueprint for restoring the American
Dream. This is your call to action. Together let's begin a national debate.<BR>
<BR>
We cannot continue a pay-as-you-go Social Security System that will require
staggering tax increases and huge cuts in benefits.<BR>
<BR>
We cannton abandon Social Security and Roosevelt promise of a safety net
for retirees, non-wage earners, and the disabled.<BR>
<BR>
Let's take the sensible approach and capitalize the system and save Social
Security.</H4>

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.
<BR>
<BR>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER>F<B>or more than a century, science attempted to explain all
human behaviour as the subrational product of unbending chemical, genetic,
or environmental forces. The spiritual side of human nature was ignored,
if not denied outright. <BR>
<BR>
This rigid scientific materialism infected all other areas of human knowledge,
laying the foundations for much of modern psychology, sociology, economics,
and political science. Yet today new developments in biology, physics, and
artificial intelligence are raising serious doubts about scientific materialism
and re-opening the case for the supernatural. <BR>
<BR>
What do these exciting developments mean for the social sciences that were
built upon the foundation of materialism? This project brings together leading
scholars from the natural sciences and those from the humanities and social
sciences in order to explore what the demise of materialism means for reviving
the various disciplines</B></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Discovery Institute fellows submit their analysis and proposals
for dialogue through seminars, conferences, and debates; they produce reports,
articles, books, Congressional testimony, films and an interactive Internet
website that helps spread the knowledge of the Institute's idea. They also
consult with elected and appointive officials, business people, academics,
media and the general public to show how 21st century humanity can benefit
from the principles, policies, and practices advocated by the Institute.<BR>
<BR>
The point of view Discovery brings to its work includes a belief in God-given
reason and the permanency of human nature; the principles of representative
democracy and public service expounded by the American Founders; free market
economics domestically and internationally; the social requirement to balance
personal liberty with reposnsibility; the spirit of voluntarism crucial
to civil society; the continuing validity of American international leadership;
and the potential of science and technology to promote an improved future
for individuals, families and communities.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="fellows.html">Fellows</A>, members, board, advisors and staff of
Discovery constitute a distributive public policy community, connected through
cyberspace, with headquarters in Seattle and an office in Washington, D.C.
Fellows are multi-disciplinary in background and approach. A research and
advocacy project is selected when it is in harmony with Discovery's mission,
when the Institute can make an original and significant contribution to
the issue's development and when it is within the Insitute's resources.
Most <A HREF="current.html">issues selected</A> are of national or international
scope and fall in the fields of science, technology, environment and economy,
international affairs, culture, defense, legal reform, religion and public
life, transportation, and institutions of reprsentative democracy, as well
as bi-national cooperation in the international Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Financially, the institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded
by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions
and the dues of institute members. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

<BR>
Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta

<A HREF="perelman.html">Lewis Perelman</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Properly enabled, new technology is a still unimagined boon. In books such
as <I><A HREF="books.html">MICROCOSM</A>, <A HREF="schlsout.html">SCHOOL'S

<I>TELECOSM</I>, Gilder and other Discovery Fellows are defining the issues,
as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

<B>How to protect the natural environment without sacrificing the human
environment is one of the most difficult, and divisive, issues of recent
times. Bureaucratic approahces to environmental protectiona have failed,
and the program seeks new solutions that heed economic and social consequences
while providing positive incentives to engage in environmentally sound behavior.

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the groups philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nations fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.    
<p>
<center>
<img alt="NCSC Annual Revenue Graph" src="1040img.gif">
</center>
<p>
The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIOs toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnsons in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With Americas welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The groups president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
unions own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nations 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>

Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organizations resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ARENT WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administrations attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congresss intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employees] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups employees will sometimes proselytize the 
programs beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.
<P>
<b>Top Ten Federal Programs That Actively Subsidize Politics and

<b>Total&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $1.8 billion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.
<BR>

<P>
<b>1. AmeriCorps&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $427 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<P>
<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b1.html">February 7</a>

entail for them. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b2.html">February 14</a>
<dd>This show celebrated Valentine's Day with a new slant on what many consider to 
be true romance: abstinence. Saving sex for marriage seems to be an increasing 
trend, and this show introduced some people who explained this 
not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b3.html">February 21</a>
<dd>This show discussed one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b4.html">February 28</a>
<dd>This week's episode discussed how the media influences 
society today. From television to movies to music to the Internet, 
we are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see, hear, 
and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make. Does the media take 
such a responsibility seriously?

<dd>This show brought you a unique discussion about the 
diverse strategies to combat our Nation's war against drugs, and the 
experts who joined in the discussion range from a former lieutenant colonel 
in the U.S. Army, a psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical and 
policy areas of drug addiction, and a former state drug czar.

<dd>This show took a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing 
and life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. 
If adoption is viewed as the best alternative to unwed 
pregnancy by the majority of Americans, why is it so hard for 
couples to adopt children in our own country?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c4.html">March 27</a>
<dd>This week's show brought you clips from the

the government to come, and how America's schools are affected.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d2.html">April 10</a>

and family as we know it by redefining marriage to include gay
unions.

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d3.html">April 17</a>
<dd>This show presented some insider information from those 
who attended the recent 1996 National Education Summit. Will 
the solutions that came out of it help your children?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d4.html">April 24</a>
<dd>This show discussed an issue not often seen in secular news 
coverage: religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world. It showed how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?

<dd>This episode took you to the Stand for 
Children rally, whose name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children. But the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f3.html">June 19</a>
<dd>Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the revered 
position it once held in our national culture. This episode 
dealt with the harsh reality that thousands upon thousands 
of America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f4.html">June 26</a>
<dd>Parental rights have slowly diminished in our schools and 
our culture. This episode helped us to understand why parents 
are fighting for their inherent rights to lovingly guide their 
own children.

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g1.html">July 3</a>
<dd>In this episode, we alerted parents to a new affront
against America's children as a recent court case was discussed 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g2.html">July 10</a>
<dd>This episode shared some key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g3.html">July 17</a>
<dd>This show presented more experts who brought
their well-researched insights into the defense of marriage, 
and there was personal testimony from a former 
homosexual man who now helps homosexuals who wish to leave 
that lifestyle.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g4.html">July 24</a>
<dd>This episode presented a completely different 
marriage tragedy, its possible collapse, as seen by author 
Maggie Gallagher, who wrote the recent best seller, 
<i>Abolition of Marriage</i>. Has our country discarded this 
founding union?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g5.html">July 31</a>
<dd>This show discussed RU-486, the abortion pill, and how 
this abortion method could lead to severe physical, emotional, 
psychological and legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.

BROADCAST PARTICIPANTS:
<p><ul>
Kristi Hamrick - Moderator<br>
Ambassador Alan Keyes - Chairman, The Declaration Foundation<br>
Marjorie Dannenfelser - President, The Susan B. Anthony List<br>
Marty Dannenfelser - Assistant to the President for Government Relations, 
Family Research Council<br>
</ul>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<b>Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging 
Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments
<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(3) the smaller conventional forces likely resulting from the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration will be too small to fulfill the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(4) the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met by fielding conventional forces capable of fighting and winning one major regional conflict, roughly the size of the Persian Gulf War, and one minor regional conflict, roughly the size of the 1989 invasion of Panama, simultaneously, as opposed to the two major regional conflicts called for by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
(5) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States requires the United States to contribute military forces to peacekeeping missions only when doing so will serve to protect the vital interests of the United States;
<p>
(6) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met with conventional military forces roughly of the size proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, which include the equivalent of 15 total divisions in the Army (10 active divisions), twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 aircraft carrier battle groups (active) in the Navy; and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps, provided these forces are both combat ready and fully modernized;
<p>
(7) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be achieved with a total military manpower endstrength similar to that proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, some 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
(8)  Congress should provide the funds required for the forces recommended by this resolution, even though they will likely be substantially more than what the Clinton Administration has budgeted for defense over the next six years. </blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>WHY DO SO FEW UNMARRIED<br>
PREGNANT WOMEN MAKE<br>
ADOPTION PLANS?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

A glaring discrepancy exists between what Americans believe and
how they behave regarding adoption as a positive response to crisis
pregnancies. Consider the following data:

<p>

<li>Many Americans believe that adoption is the best response
to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. A 1995 Family Research Council
survey of 1,000 Americans found that, when presented with four
options to resolve out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies, 29 percent
of respondents thought it best to &quot;have the child and put
it up for adoption;&quot; 24 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to marry the child's father and have the child;&quot; 11
percent thought it best for the mother &quot;to have the child
and raise it by herself;&quot; and only 8 percent thought it best
for her to have an abortion.[1]

<p>

However, in reality, 46 percent of all the nonmarital pregnancies
in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent ended in miscarriage,
and 44 percent were carried to term, of which only 2 percent were
placed for adoption.[2] (It is not known whether the mother eventually
married the child's father or chose to raise the child by herself
in the remaining 98 percent of &quot;live birth&quot; cases.)

<p>

<li>Many young, unmarried pregnant women also hold favorable attitudes
toward those who choose adoption. A survey of such women staying
in maternity homes found that the majority, regardless of whether
they were choosing adoption or single parenthood, hold positive
attitudes toward mothers who place their children for adoption.
The respondents believe that a woman who places her baby for adoption
loves the baby, wants the best for the baby, is being a good parent
in a special way, is being responsible, and is neither selfish
nor abandoning the baby.[3] Nevertheless, many of these same unmarried
pregnant women had never considered adoption as an option for
their children.

<p>

Why do so few unmarried women choose adoption in reality when
both they and the general American public hold favorable attitudes
toward adoption? Also, what accounts for the decline of adoptions 
over time? Before 1973, about one in five non-marital births to white 
women was placed for adoption. By the late 1970s, this proportion had 
shrunk to less than one in 10, and by the late 1980s, to one in 30.[4]

<p>

The answer may lie less in the fact that public opinion towards
adoption has changed than in the fact that other options have
overshadowed adoption, making adoption less visible as an alternative.

<p>

The impact of three major social trends during the last two to
three decades may provide some clues to this phenomenon:

<p>

(1) <b>Increasing Social Acceptance of Single Parenthood</b> --
The sheer prevalence of single-parent families has increased the
social acceptability of single motherhood. For example, in 1970,
13 percent of all families with children were single-parent families.
By 1994, more than 30 percent of all families with children were
headed by a single parent.[5]

<p>

The trend towards single parenthood began with the liberalizing
of divorce laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the subsequent
divorce epidemic. Indeed, the number of divorces per year tripled
between 1960 and 1990.[6] But when divorce began to level off in
the 1980s, the growth in illegitimacy continued the trend. In
1970, 11 percent of all births were to unmarried women; in 1980,
18 percent of all births were nonmarital; and by 1991, an astounding
30 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock.[7] Yet, even more significant
than the rise in nonmarital births is the even faster growth in
the <I>visibility</I> of illegitimacy. Adoption helps to mask
the visibility of illegitimacy because the child born out-of-wedlock
is immediately placed in a two-parent home. However, the proportion
of unmarried women choosing adoption dramatically declined during
the same time period that illegitimacy rates rose.

<p>

It is this high visibility of single-parent families that has
made single parenting normative in today's society. Thus, there
is more precedent for young unmarried women to choose single parenthood
and comparatively less incentive for them to place their children
in adoptive homes.

<p>

(2) <b>The Legalization of Abortion</b> -- The introduction of
abortion has greatly diminished the likelihood of choosing adoption
because it has altered the thought processes by which both the
pregnant woman and her counselors approach an unintended pregnancy.

<p>

Before abortion was legalized, women facing a crisis pregnancy
had only to decide among three or four options: adoption, marrying
the father, raising the child herself and/or having her parent
raise the child. Among these options, adoption fared relatively
well as one in five white women chose adoption.

<p>

However, after abortion was legalized, a two-tiered thought process
replaced the previously one-tiered process. The preeminent question
was no longer &quot;Who shall raise this child?&quot; but rather,
&quot;Shall I have this child?&quot; And with that change in question
also came a change in focus from being child-centered to woman-centered.
Thus, it is not surprising that fewer women are choosing adoption
because adoption typically requires a child-centered focus.

<p>

Since the legalization of abortion, pregnancy counselors must
also spend much more time and effort addressing the first question
of &quot;Shall this pregnancy be carried to term or aborted?&quot;
And while this must be the first question addressed, too often
counselors give short shrift to the second question of &quot;Who
shall raise this child?&quot; One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors failed to include adoption as an option
in their counseling. Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. Some
even failed to present adoption as an option because they thought
the girls would not want to hear about it.[8]

<p>

(3) <b>Increasing Availability and Use of Welfare Benefits</b>
-- To the degree financial considerations play a role in whether
a woman chooses to marry, place for adoption, or raise the child
herself, the increasing availability and use of welfare benefits
add weight to the single-parenting option. Beginning in the late
1960s, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid
benefits for pregnant, single mothers became well-established
and well-used. Both AFDC and Medicaid have grown tremendously
over the last two decades as more and more unwed mothers have
chosen single parenthood. Knowing that they have this &quot;safety
net&quot; on which to fall back, many unmarried women choose to
raise their infants rather than make adoption plans.

<p>

In conclusion, despite the fact that most Americans favorably
view adoption, several major social trends have altered the course
of the discussion and made the adoption option less visible. However,
there is a growing counter-movement to change the terms of discourse
once again and combat the social trends that lead not only to
fewer adoptions, but also to greater numbers of out-of-wedlock
births, abortions, and welfare recipients. During the mid-1980s,
a &quot;new wave&quot; of adoption and maternity services agencies
began opening up in the United States. These include more private
adoption agencies, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, maternity
homes, and private charitable organizations. The degree to which
these institutions grow more visible and flourish is the degree
to which adoption can grow, narrowing the gap between public opinion
and reality.

<title>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</title>

<p>

<h2>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES<br>
RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Two military homosexual cases are now competing for a Supreme
Court hearing. Both cases have already been heard at the appellate
court level, and decisions are expected by the summer.

<p>

These cases are complicated by major differences between the congressional
law concerning homosexuality in the armed forces (Defense Authorization
Act of 1994, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654) and the regulations issued
by the Clinton administration to implement this law (DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30).[1]

<p>

These differences include:

<p><ul>

<li>As passed by Congress, the law forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals and drop the principled and unambiguous statement
that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
propensity to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation. In addition, the Clinton
regulations hinder military criminal investigators from investigating
private consensual sexual misconduct (sodomy and adultery).

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons.
But contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. Information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without permission
from high-level political appointees.

</ul><p>

<center><h3><i>ABEL ET AL. V. U.S.A.</i></h3></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the first federal challenge to the military's homosexual policy.[2]
The case involves six avowed homosexuals who allege that the military's
policy violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights.

<p>

This case was filed in 1994 shortly after the congressional law
took effect. The plaintiffs skirted the military's normal administrative
process and went straight to federal court seeking a preliminary
injunction (PI) barring the military from discharging them until
their constitutional challenge was resolved. The government sought
relief from the PI via the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d Circuit,
and was granted that motion, forcing the lower court to hurry
up the hearing.

<p>

In March, 1995, <I>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</I> was heard by Judge
Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York. Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union
represented the homosexual service members. They called six 
&quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's claim of a 
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals. Curiously, Clinton Justice 
Department lawyers did not counter any of these witnesses with expert 
testimony from defenders of the ban.

<p>

In addition, the Justice Department failed to:[3]

<p><ul>

<li>Present well-documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.

<p>

<li>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.

<p>

<li>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence
that homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military.

</ul><p>

The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them based on their
homosexuality. The government argued that this is not a First
Amendment issue because the law and the policy are directed solely
at the prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to
rebut the presumption of misconduct. However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct. In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.

<p>

The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively. Judge Nickerson
found for the plaintiffs.[4] He labeled the discrimination unjustified
and noted key differences between the congressional law and the
Clinton policy:

<p><ul>

<li>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and
orientation at the point of admission, the Clinton administration
has rejected such questions. The judge labeled this as unusual.
On one hand the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not
making homosexuality part of a pre-induction litmus test) and
then insists that the homosexual remain secretive about his 
&quot;status.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the policy permits
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct. This creates a
status/conduct dichotomy. The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian&quot; because the government failed to show
a connection between a declaration of homosexuality and misconduct.
The judge understandably concluded &quot;that the admission of
homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would
commit acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order, and 
discipline....&quot;

</ul><p>

Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine the constitutionality
of the policy [read law] adopted by Congress, not its morality.&quot;
He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to think it demeaning
and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy [read law] on
pretense rather than on truth.&quot;

<p>

Nickerson's decision was appealed by the government to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. The hearing
was set for December 19 but was postponed due to unusual circumstances.

<p>

The night before the hearing, a letter was faxed to one of the
judges from the Justice Department. It reminded Judge Guido Calabresi
that back in March 1993 he had signed a letter to Congress maintaining
that legislation banning homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional.
At the time he co-signed the letter with 118 other lawyers, Judge
Calabresi was the dean of the Yale Law School. He was appointed
by President Clinton to the federal bench in 1994.

<p>

Calabresi's letter says, &quot;The ban on military service by
lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans violates the most basic premise
of equal protection law: that all similarly situated persons should
be treated alike.&quot;[5]

<p>

The judge recused himself from the case the morning of the scheduled
hearing. The case was rescheduled with a new panel and heard on
January 16, 1996.

<p>

At that hearing, Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., a Bush appointee,
demonstrated an understanding of the law's intent. &quot;If you
say you're a homosexual,&quot; Walker said, &quot;in order to
rebut the presumption, you can't be a homosexual. A person is
either joking, mistaken, lying or expressing vague desires, as
opposed to propensity.&quot;[6]

<p>

Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler urged the court to &quot;rely
on the policy,&quot; which rationally allows a superior to address
an issue. He noted that the policy works and explained that seven
avowed homosexuals have already rebutted the presumption of conduct
and have been allowed to continue serving. Finally, he recommended
overturning the lower court's decision because the homosexual
members failed to exhaust administrative challenges before taking
their case to court.[7]

<p>

Matthew A. Coles, of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued
that the military has no right to ban either homosexual acts or
their speech. He also challenged the reasoning behind the idea
that homosexuals should have to rebut the presumption that they
will engage in homosexual acts.[8]

<p>

Judge Pierre Leval asked Coles to respond to a parallel situation.
Leval posed the question, what would the military do if someone
declared himself a white supremacist? Coles said the military
would do nothing. But the judge argued that at least the military
would investigate to determine whether the individual intended
to act on his beliefs.[9]

<p>

<center><h3><i>THOMASSON V. PERRY</i></h3></center>

<p>

FRC had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the Fourth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>.[10] Lt. Paul G. Thomasson is an avowed
homosexual who petitioned the court to declare the military's
ban unconstitutional. FRC defended the law while the Justice Department
hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty policy.

<p>

This case has followed an unusual track. It began on March 2,
1994, the day Thomasson wrote a letter to his boss at the Bureau
of Naval Personnel in Arlington, Virginia. The letter contained
the declaration, &quot;I am gay.&quot; A Navy administrative board
discharged him June 15,1994 for homosexuality. Thomasson never
admitted to homosexual conduct and failed to rebut the presumption
of misconduct.[11]

<p>

He subsequently filed a motion for relief with the U.S. Federal
Court for the Eastern District of New York asking the court to
declare the military's policy unconstitutional. U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the policy was constitutional
upholding Thomasson's honorable discharge. Thomasson's appeal
of that decision was then heard by a three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Alexandria, Virginia.[12]

<p>

On September 12, 1995, at the appeals court hearing, one of the
judges said the Clinton administration has a &quot;problem&quot;
in defending its &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on homosexuals.
It does not match the intent of Congress.[13]

<p>

Judge J. Michael Luttig told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler,
who argued that the Clinton policy is constitutional, &quot;I
think you've got a problem in the government's case.&quot; He
accused the administration of using the policy to make an &quot;end
run&quot; around the Congress.[14]

<p>

All three judges roundly criticized the policy scheme, in particular
the attempted distinction between &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;propensity.&quot;[15]

<p>

Allan Moore, Lt. Thomasson's attorney, told the court that the
policy and law violate the constitution's guarantees of free speech
and equal protection. Moore labeled the policy &quot;an Orwellian
concept.&quot; He rejects the notion that the statement, &quot;I
am gay,&quot; presumes misconduct. He argued that the statement
is nothing more than an admission of identity or status.[16]

<p>

Judge Luttig posed a hypothetical case to Mr. Kneedler. What if
I claim to be a communist? Can I rebut the government's presumption
that I will engage in communist activities? The judge then skipped
to the homosexual case. &quot;Okay to think, 'I'm gay,' but can't
say so. But if I say it, I must persuade the decision-maker that
I won't do gay things.&quot; The relationship between &quot;status&quot;
and &quot;propensity&quot; consumed most of the oral argument.[17]

<p>

After the hearing, the three judges signed an order saying they
wanted the full court to rehear the case. At this point, FRC filed
a motion to make oral arguments and, in an unusual move, the court
granted that motion.[18]

<p>

On December 5, the 13 judges of the U.S. Appeals Court for the
Fourth Circuit reheard the case in Richmond, Va. Once again, Judge
Luttig took a conservative stance. He said, &quot;It seems to
me...the Navy is concerned with conduct and not speech.&quot;
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer joined in, &quot;I'm just wondering why
this is a speech case at all.&quot;[19]

<p>

Judge Harvie Wilkinson III said, &quot;Don't we have here a case
where statements are used for evidentiary value, and the First
Amendment never prohibits statements for whatever evidentiary
value they may have?&quot;[20]

<p>

Professor William Woodruff, the Army's former chief of litigation
and now a law professor at Campbell University in North Carolina,
argued for FRC. He explained that the Clinton regulations are
inconsistent with the law. He also pointed out that the old policy
was codified in the new law and declared that the intent of the
law was a classwide bar, that is, homosexuals cannot legally serve.
He called for a faithful execution of the law.

<p>

A decision favorable to conservatives is expected by late spring.
That decision will be in competition with <i>Abel</i> for an appeal to
the Supreme Court this summer.

<p>

<center><h3>RELATED ISSUES</h3></center>

<p>

Other homosexual cases are winding their way through the federal
court system. However, either <I>Thomasson</I> or <I>Abel</I>
will most likely be heard by the high court. That decision will
become a landmark for future homosexual litigation such as the
rising tide of homosexual marriage and adoption cases.

<p>

Meanwhile, in August, 1995, Defense Department general counsel
Judith Miller wrote a memo to the military services which spells
out what to do with those service members who say they are homosexual
and what they must do to remain on active duty.[21] This memo followed
the publicized case of Navy Lieutenant Commander Maria Z. Dunning,
who successfully rebutted the presumption by promising not to
engage in homosexual misconduct.[22]

<p>

The memo gave confused commanders better guidance on proceeding
through the homosexual policy thicket. In spite of the latest
clarification, the number of homosexual discharges are up. From
October 1994 to September 1995, the military services discharged
722 members for homosexuality, a 21 percent increase from the
1994 figure of 597 discharges.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

No matter which case or combination of cases reaches the Supreme
Court, FRC will file a friend-of-the-court brief and a motion
to make oral argument before the justices. Given past history,
it's reasonable to expect the Clinton Justice Department to under-argue
the case that goes to the high court and, hopefully, FRC's clear
voice defending the law will be heard.

<p>

Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and
murder dropped 12 percent. This was the largest drop in the murder
rate in years and six times larger than the drop the year prior.[1]

<p>

Some experts attribute the decline to a combination of the aging
of baby boomers, police anti-drug gang efforts and the stabilization
of drug-related turf battles. Alfred Blumstein, a professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, observes, &quot;In large
cities, the [drug] markets are most mature. Drug markets started
later in smaller cities, later still in rural areas.&quot;[2] Drug-related
violence may now be shifting to suburbia.

<p>

Thus, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics
&quot;will give us a false sense of security.&quot;[3] He's not alone.

<p>

Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, &quot;We...have absolutely
no idea why we are experiencing such a precipitous drop [in the
murder rate].&quot;[4] There were 26 percent fewer murders in the
first half of 1995 than the same period the prior year. New York
City's crime rate registered its steepest drop in 23 years.[5]

<p>

Amidst the good news, FBI Director Louis Freeh notes that violent
crime involving young people, both as perpetrators and victims,
is on the rise. &quot;The number of juveniles arrested for weapons
offenses has more than doubled over the past decade,&quot; Freeh
said.[6]

<p>

On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder.[7] A profile of Justice Department
murder arrest rates by age provides a sobering story. In 1965,
23-year-olds were arrested more often for murder than any other
age group, and their rate was 33 per 100,000 23-year-olds. In
1992, 18-year-olds were arrested more often for murder and their
rate was 97 per 100,000 18-year-olds. That's a 467 percent increase
in murder arrests for 18-year-olds.[8] The trend is toward younger
offenders and higher arrest rates.

<p>

In addition, many experts believe that within the next decade
America will experience an unprecedented surge in youth crime.[9]
According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children
killing will only worsen because demographics show the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.[10]

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UPSURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG MURDERERS?</h3></center>

<p>

Social scientists cannot show cause-and-effect relationships for
murder. But they can demonstrate that certain conditions highly
correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.

<p>

<li><b>Parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.</b>

<p>

As out-of-wedlock birth has risen, so has the crime rate. Forty-three
percent of all inmates grew up in a single-parent household. Nearly
a third had parents who abused either alcohol or drugs, and more
than a third had at least one family member who was ever incarcerated.[11]

<p>

Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, &quot;A one-percentage-point
increase in births to single mothers appears to increase the violent
crime rate about 1.7 percent.&quot;[12] And a 1990 study by June O'Neill,
a professor with Baruch College of the City University of New
York, shows that men from single-parent families are twice as
likely to commit crimes compared to men from two-parent families.[13]

<p>

Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago,
notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization within a community. &quot;There are higher crime
rates in places where communities are not characterized by strong
families,&quot; Sampson said. &quot;The research has been fairly
consistent showing a small-to-moderate positive relationship between
individual delinquency and family breakdown.&quot;[14]

<p>

Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs. About 31 million children
under age 15 live with 19 million mothers employed outside the
home. Mothers who work full-time outside the home are four times
more likely to have unsupervised (latchkey) children than moms
who work part-time.[15] This is important, according to a Justice
Department study. It concluded that parental supervision, attachment
to family, and consistency of discipline were the most important
barriers to delinquency and drug abuse.[16]

<p>

Likewise, a study in <I>Child Development</I> found that the fundamental
causes of delinquency are consistent across time and rooted in
generic family processes such as supervision, attachment, and
discipline. This study also found that teenagers whose mothers
who are employed outside the home are more likely to become delinquent
than teenagers whose mothers who are not employed outside the
home. Most adolescents in the low-supervision category (83 percent)
were delinquent compared to 10 percent of those in the high-supervision
category.[17]

<p>

Another study in the <I>Journal of Social Work</I> entitled, &quot;Parenting
in Poverty,&quot; found that for children growing up in very disadvantaged
and violent neighborhoods, the one factor that seems to protect
the child from growing up to be violent is having a parent who
supervises the child very strictly.[18]

<p>

The National Institute of Justice found that being neglected as
a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile, as an
adult, and for violent crime.[19] This was especially true for juvenile
girls. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
20 percent of male and female runaways marked parental neglect
as a primary factor for their leaving home.[20]

<p>

Metropolitan Life's 1993 national survey found that teachers (71
percent) and law enforcement officials (90 percent) agree that
the lack of parental supervision at home is a major contributing
factor to violence in schools.[21]

<p>

<li><b>Drug use is highly correlated with delinquent behavior,
and use among adolescents is on the rise.</b>

<p>

A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that the rate of marijuana use among eighth-graders rose from
6 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994. A similar trend is evident
among 10th- and 12th-graders. Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack,
heroin, and LSD is also rising.[22]

<p>

Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former
NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>,
&quot;There is...an undeniable relationship between crime and
drugs. Drug addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders
and spur them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
He argues that in spite of the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts
cannot conclude that drugs cause crime. In fact, drugs &quot;do
not ingest themselves.... Drugs reach their human hosts only after
being invited.&quot;[23]

<p>

A Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.[24] The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency. By
age 16, half of the youth surveyed were using alcohol regularly
and one-quarter were using marijuana.[25]

<p>

The study also found that delinquency starts early. Ten percent
of the 7-year-old boys surveyed reported having committed at least
one street offense. By age 9, the figure was 20 percent and by
17 years of age, 40 percent of the boys had committed at least
one crime.[26]

<p>

<li><b>Most Americans blame the pop culture for increases in youth
violence.</b>

<p>

According to the Family Research Council's 1995 nationwide poll
(conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Maryland-based pollster),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime at least a little.

<p>

Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees. He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;[27]

<p>

Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed McAffee's view, saying, &quot;Those
who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep
into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves
and ignoring reality.&quot;[28] He called for a boycott of Columbia's
film <I>Money Train</I> following a copycat incident where two
men sprayed flammable liquid through the slot of a Brooklyn subway
token booth, holding a match in the window and seriously burning
the agent inside. The man died several days later.

<p>

But many of Hollywood's elite deny the relationship. Only 30 percent
of media's elite told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> that
violence in the media contributes to the level of violence in
America.[29] For example, Richard Jewell, a professor in the School
of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California,
says that Dole's attack is unfair. &quot;The biggest difficulty
with politicians like Dole is that they oversimplify things to
such an extent that we lose sight of the real issues: drugs, families
coming apart, all sort of things that go far beyond media presentation,
Jewell said.&quot;[30]

<p>

But Joel Federman, research director for Mediascope, a Studio
City, Calif.-based public policy group isn't so defensive. He
acknowledges that television violence plays a small but significant
role in promoting more aggressive behavior.[31]

<p>

Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child psychologist, says
that the average child watches 100,000 acts of television violence
and witnesses 8,000 television murders before the end of elementary
school.[32] This much violence has an effect.[33]

<p>

According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, the
S.I. Newhouse Professor of Public Communication at Syracuse University,
says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can
be linked to television.[34]

<p>

Psychologist Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research has tracked the television viewing habits
of 650 New York children from 1960 to the present. Those who watched
the most violent programming grew up to be the most aggressive
and crime prone-adults.[35]

<p>

In 1995, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy reviewed numerous
television violence studies. The studies consistently found that
children who view media depictions of aggression became more violent
in their own behavior.[36]

<p>

The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness. Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot;[37]

<p>

Murder, which is defined by the FBI as &quot;the willful killing
of one human being by another,&quot; is an aspect of many television
films.[38] Consider these 1995 TV movie titles:

<p>

<I>Death in Small Doses</I> (ABC), <I>Deadline for Murder: From
the Files of Edna Buchanan</I> (CBS), <I>Fatal Vows</I> (CBS),
<I>A Killer Among Friends</I> (CBS), <I>Love Kills: Sweet Justice</I>
(NBC), <I>A Menu for Murder</I> (NBC), <I>The Moment of Truth:
Murder or Memory?</I> (NBC), <I>Marked for Death</I> (CBS), <I>Death
Becomes Her</I> (NBC), <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> (CBS),
and <I>Falling for You</I> (CBS).

<p>

While television impacts juvenile violence and murder, no one
knows precisely how much. But there are those willing to speculate.
For example, epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I>
that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders per
year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.[39]

<p>

The music industry shares some of the responsibility. Dr. Joseph
Stuessey, professor of music history at the University of Texas,
told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music affects behavior.
This simple fact has been known intuitively for centuries....In
the 20th century, especially in the last four decades, tons of
research has been done on the interrelationship of music and human
behavior....It affects our moods, our attitudes, our emotions,
and our behavior. It affects us psychologically and 
physiologically.&quot;[40]

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[41]

<p>

Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[42]

<p>

Pop culture's music is laden with violence. It has themes about
murder, maiming, raping, abusing, and destroying. Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence. Some examples of violence-promoting lyrics:

<p><ul>

<li>The Dead Kennedys sing &quot;I Kill Children.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;I kill children, I love to see them die. I kill
children to make their mothers cry.&quot;

<p>

<li>Rigor Mortis sings &quot;Bodily Dismemberment.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;My fetish is a crime....With five easy slices you're
in six lovely pieces. Bodily dismemberment as passion increases.&quot;

<p>

<li>Blood Feast has a song &quot;Kill for Pleasure&quot; and Motley
Crue has a song &quot;Bastard&quot; about killing someone with
a knife.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>COMING CRIME WAVE</h3></center>

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking stories of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens aged 15 to 19 will increase
by 23 percent and a larger proportion of these teens will be coming
from homes without fathers. Given the correlation between father
absence and crime, some experts estimate that violent crime like
murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year -- that's up
60 percent from the current toll.[43]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles and co-editor of the book <I>Crime</I>,
said, &quot;So we should expect, unless something changes dramatically,
that the [now lower] crime rate will go back up.&quot;[44]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Americans perceive that crime is getting worse. This may seem
out of line with recent crime statistics, but the changing face
of crime has made citizens feel less safe. Young thugs are now
the threat, and the danger is likely to increase. Defusing the
coming youth time bomb should be a major priority for all levels
of government.

<title>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO WAKE UP AMERICA</title>

<h2>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO<br>
WAKE UP AMERICA</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

A courageous soldier has become a pawn in a complex national debate
involving the constitutional separation of powers, foreign policy,
and military law. In the end, America must exercise great caution
when deciding these weighty issues.

<p>

Specialist Michael G. New, a former homeschooler and son of Christian
missionaries, refused to wear a blue beret and a United Nations
(U.N.) patch on his U.S. Army uniform because, he believes, it
violates Army uniform regulations and his enlistment oath which
was to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United
States,&quot; not the U.N.

<p>

Specialist New's unit, based in Germany, was alerted last summer
for a peacekeeping mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM). His commander ordered a pre-deployment inspection
which included the requirement for all soldiers to appear in formation
wearing their U.S. uniform augmented with a U.N. shoulder patch
and a blue beret. New contends this was an illegal order.

<p>

In August, New told his sergeant that he would disobey an order
to wear the U.N. accouterments on his uniform. After consulting
with his military legal counsel, a chaplain, he flew home from
Germany to discuss his alternatives with his father, his civilian
attorney and congressional representatives. As a result of these
discussions, he decided to disobey the order.

<p>

Specialist New knows that soldiers are expected to obey lawful
orders, and an order to report to duty in a prescribed uniform
is generally a lawful order. However, the government and New disagree
about the Army's authority to prescribe a uniform that includes
the U.N. accouterments.

<p>

In October, after failing to appear in the prescribed uniform,
New was charged with failure to obey an order and offered non-judicial
punishment. Because of his deep conviction on this issue, New
refused non-judicial punishment and asked for a court-martial,
even though this subjected him to potentially much severer punishment
if convicted.

<p>

Specialist New has chosen to fall on his sword to propel onto
the national scene the debate over America's involvement in U.N.-sponsored
peacekeeping missions. This debate ought to be waged by politicians
rather than depending on the martyrdom of an individual soldier.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.S. MISSION IN MACEDONIA</h3></center>

<p>

Some question the legality of the Macedonian mission. Their concern
centers around the interpretation of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. Senate consented to ratify on July 28, 1945 and which was
signed by President Harry Truman on October 31, 1945.

<p>

U.S. Army forces have participated in the ongoing United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in FYROM as &quot;Task
Force Able Sentry&quot; since July 1993. President Clinton argues
that the Macedonian mission is authorized by Section 2, Clause
1, Article II of the U.S. Constitution which establishes the President
of the United States as the Commander in Chief of the Army and
Navy. In fact, he vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, in
part, because of his belief that Congress was trying to infringe
upon his authority as Commander in Chief to &quot;assign U.S.
Armed Forces under United Nations operational or tactical 
control.&quot;[1]

<p>

The President has both the constitutional and statutory authority
to employ the armed forces in order to &quot;further U.S. national
interests.&quot; By statute -- Section 7 of the United Nations
Participation Act (22 US Code 287d-1) -- the President may detail
U.S. military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations under
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter to serve as observers, guards,
or in any other noncombatant capacity. Further, under Section
628 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, upon appropriate presidential
determination, U.S. personnel may be assigned or detailed to international
organizations to serve with the international staff of such organizations
or to provide technical, scientific, or professional services
to them.

<p>

The Clinton administration argues that the UNPREDEP was established
as a peacekeeping operation under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement
of Disputes) of the U.N. Charter, which would mean that the presence
of U.S. troops serving in FYROM is authorized by law. Specialist
New and numerous members of Congress disagree with the administration's
analysis. They contend that this is a Chapter VII (Action with
Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression) mission and is illegal because it was not approved
by Congress.

<p>

On October 6, 1995, 44 members of Congress signed a letter citing
New's case to President Clinton, seeking answers to questions
about America's involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations. They
asked whether U.S. intervention is in the &quot;national interest,&quot;
if constitutional procedures were respected in the decision to
deploy American troops, and if Americans will be under the command
of foreign officers.[2]

<p>

This politically charged debate illustrates a classic separation
of powers dispute and must be resolved before more Americans are
assigned to U.N. missions.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.N. IS BECOMING MILITARIZED</h3></center>

<p>

The U.N. has experienced a renaissance with the precipitous fall
of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early 1980s
to worldwide peacemaker in 1995. This transition has been marked
both by a change in operational philosophy and the expansion of
a blue-helmeted legion of peace-enforcers.

<p>

There is little doubt that the U.N. would not exist today if it
were not for U.S. membership and support. The American taxpayer
has paid a disproportionate part of the U.N. budget. The recent
surge in U.N. military operations should concern American policymakers.

<p>

The U.N. operational philosophy and military role have radically
changed. In the U.N.'s first five years, it launched only two
peacekeeping missions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
U.N. has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000 blue-helmeted
soldiers. Last year these operations cost $3.6 billion. Of this,
the U.S. was directly assessed $1.2 billion by the U.N., and the
Clinton administration spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military
participation in U.N. missions. Today, thousands of American soldiers
wear U.N. blue helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon
to the former Yugoslav republics.

<p>

The U.N. has dramatically expanded its use of military forces
in peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350 with a modern
situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked electronically
to all U.N. hot spots. It has a standby system to tap troops and
equipment from 185 member nations, and it has established a storage
base in Italy to stockpile equipment such as armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.[3]

<p>

The United States Senate has the constitutional authority and
obligation to determine whether continued American membership
in the U.N. serves a useful purpose. A significant question is
whether the militarization of the U.N. is in this country's best
interests.

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LIKES THE U.N.</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, the Clinton administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive 25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
U.N. Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in U.N. operations.&quot;

<p>

Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry
has said that President Clinton supports America's continued U.N.
involvement[4] and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the U.N. system.&quot;[5]

<p>

The Clinton administration has supported the U.N.'s radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share this optimism. Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said, &quot;It is high time we rein
in U.N. peacekeeping, which is out of control.&quot; Senator Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) has called the U.N. &quot;the nemesis of millions
of Americans.&quot;[6]

<p>

These are early warning signs that must not be ignored. History
teaches that the acquisition of military power traditionally has
been the first step toward establishing governance over a territory.
Coupling the U.N.'s changing military strength with the new operational
philosophy favoring individual over state sovereignty sends a
warning shot across the bow of free people around the world.

<p>

<center><h3>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT RISK</h3></center>

<p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the U.N. dealing with traditional
interstate aggression rather than the types of internal conflict
that now dominate. But the 50-year-old organization is transitioning
to the &quot;new world order.&quot; That change is echoed by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has issued <I>An
Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly expanded U.N. peacemaking
role. He endorses the principle of &quot;universal sovereignty&quot;:
&quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and the rights of
peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty that resides in
all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate involvement
in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction U.N. efforts in
Somalia, saying, &quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.&quot; Thus, he justified
the world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation. The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<p>

Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
U.N. It was a case of aggression in which the armies of one state
crossed international borders to invade another. Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to reject the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. The subsequent 1991 U.N.-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force in the strictly internal affairs of a member
state. Thus began a potentially dangerous new era for U.N. 
&quot;peacemaking.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Loose constructionists of the U.N. Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding U.N. jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest. Is this what we want to do? Someone
had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;[7]

<p>

But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries. He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
Apparently, then, outside forces do have a right to trump national
sovereignty. Does this, then, mean or imply that true sovereignty
resides with the U.N., individual nationhood be damned?

<p>

The U.N.'s implied &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign
affairs of a country leaves all member countries vulnerable including
the U.S. For example, the next time Korean-Americans bear the
brunt of a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could
ask the U.N. to intervene to protect its citizens' rights. It
couldn't happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally
and militarily. But it could happen in the future, especially
if the U.N. has a standing military governed by a liberal world
elite.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The national debate fostered by Specialist New's case is important.
It comes at a time when American troops are involved in peacekeeping
missions around the world. It has taken the courageous act of
one soldier to highlight an issue that deserves serious debate
and resolution.

<title>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</title>

<p>

<h2>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE<br>
MILITARY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

One of Bill Clinton's first acts as president was to try to pry
open the military to service by homosexuals. That effort met with
great opposition and led to a Democratic Congress codifying the
military's long-standing ban on homosexual service. But the Clinton
administration did an end run around that law and wrote implementing
regulations that are inconsistent with the law and that have caused
considerable confusion.

<p>

The second anniversary of the implementation of these regulations
was used to expose that confusion. On February 27, 1996, the Washington-based
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy organization
for homosexuals in the military, claimed to have documented 363
cases in the last year in which military officials violated the
Clinton administration's homosexual regulations by directly asking
members about their sexual orientation or harassing members suspected
of being homosexual. As evidence, it cited rising discharges for
homosexuality.[1]

<p>

The Pentagon discharged 722 homosexual service members in fiscal
1995, compared with 597 in 1994. The Pentagon attributes the 17
percent increase to a different reporting method by the Air Force.
There were 949 discharges for homosexuality in 1991, 708 in 1992
and 682 in 1993.[2]

<p>

Prior to 1994 the Air Force, when it found homosexual activity
during basic training, discharged that person for &quot;fraudulent
enlistment&quot; rather than for homosexuality. This procedure
changed in 1994, and that's why there is an increase in the number
of homosexual discharges in 1995. Discounting 163 Air Force discharges
that fit this category, the Pentagon's 1995 figure would be 559,
the lowest in many years.[3]

<p>

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has accused military
officials of overstepping their bounds to conduct &quot;witch
hunts&quot; to find evidence to discharge service members for
homosexuality. It cited the case of an Army woman who charged
that several drunken male soldiers had attempted to rape her.
She reported the incident, but her commander dismissed it. She
alleges the men then started rumors that she was a
lesbian and that this led to an investigation. The Army says it
dropped the case against the woman and is investigating whether
the commander went too far.[4]

<p>

Military investigators and commanders are also accused of pursuing
wide-ranging inquiries aimed at identifying homosexual members.
But the Pentagon dismisses the allegations of abuse. It claims
to have &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; them to ensure fair
application of the policy.

<p>

The confusion about homosexual service is prompted by the stark
differences between Clinton's regulations and the law which is
a codified version of the military's long-standing ban. The Clinton
administration's regulations are contrary to the law passed by
Congress and signed by the President on November 30, 1993. Consider
the major differences:

<p><ul>

<li>The Clinton regulations [DOD Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30]
drop the principled statement that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible
with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law [10 U.S.C. &#167; 654] forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals.

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a &quot;propensity&quot;
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
&quot;propensity&quot; to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.

<p>

<li>The Clinton regulations prevent military criminal investigators
from investigating adult private consensual sexual misconduct
(sodomy and adultery). The law relies on commander discretion
to initiate investigations.

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons,
but, contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. And information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without high-level
political permission.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>STATUS OF FEDERAL COURT CASES</h3></center>

<p>

Confusion on the issue of homosexuals in the military is amplified
by the many pending federal court cases. There are five military
homosexual cases now pending at the federal appellate court level
and three cases at the district court level.[5] Most of these cases
involve servicemembers complaining that their constitutional rights
have been violated by Clinton's regulations and sidestep a frontal
attack on the law which clearly denies service by homosexuals.

<p><ul>

<li><I>Abel v. Perry</I> was heard on January 16, 1996 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This case
involves six servicemembers who won at the district court level,
claiming that the Pentagon violated their First and Fifth Amendment
rights. This case contests Clinton's regulations and avoids the
plain meaning of the law. A decision is expected this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> was heard on December 5, 1995 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It
involves a Naval officer who complains that his discharge for
homosexuality violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The
government won at the trial court level. A decision is expected
this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Selland v. Department of Defense</I> was decided at the
district court level for the government on October 31, 1995. The
case was brought by a Naval officer dismissed for declaring himself
a homosexual. The plaintiff has indicated he will appeal, but
that appeal will be delayed until a decision is announced in the
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> case.

<p>

<li><I>Phillips v. Perry </I>will be heard on March 4, 1996 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This
case involves a sailor who claims his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy was swayed by his admission
of misconduct. He also claims there are sexual acts that are guaranteed
protection within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
He lost his complaint at the trial court level. A decision is
expected this summer.

<p>

<li><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I> will be heard this spring in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This Air
Force officer was discharged for homosexuality and lost at the
trial court level.

<p>

<li>Three cases are pending at the federal district court level.
They are: <I>Thorne v. Department of Defense</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; brought by a Naval
officer); <I>Holmes v. California National Guard</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California; brought by a National
Guardsman); and <I>Watson v. Perry</I> (U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Washington; brought by a Naval officer).

</ul><p>

The Family Research Council has participated as an amicus (friend
of the court) in the five appellate cases. It was granted the
unusual opportunity to make oral argument in <I>Thomasson v. Perry,</I>
where FRC defended the law and the Clinton Justice Department
defended the faulty regulations. It will closely monitor the progress
of the three district court cases.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

A Justice Department attorney announced during the <I>Abel v.
Perry</I> hearing that seven avowed homosexuals have rebutted
the presumption that they will engage in illicit conduct. They
now serve uncontested. This is a flagrant violation of the law
but has been allowed because of the faulty Clinton regulations.
Unless these regulations are changed, more avowed homosexuals
will serve, despite clear congressional intent to the contrary.

<p>

The intent of the law has always been to deny service to homosexuals.
It is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress under Article
1, Section 8 to write the rules and regulations for the military.
After exhaustive hearings in 1993, the Congress by a large majority
codified the military's long-standing ban on homosexual service.
The law denies service to all homosexuals, both those in and those
out of the closet.

<p>

It is hoped that Congress or a future administration will right
the Clinton administration's faulty regulations. The regulations
must be rewritten to echo the intent of the law. Meanwhile, it
is expected that either the <I>Abel</I> or <I>Thomasson</I> case
will be appealed to the Supreme Court this summer. FRC will file
a motion to argue as an amicus in that case to defend the law
which is based on the will of the American people and the findings
of the 1993 Congressional hearings on the issue of homosexuals
in the military.

<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE</title>

<p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS<br>
ABOUT THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

<b>Q: In restricting marriage to one man and one woman, aren't
you imposing your beliefs on others?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life. Those who are trying to
radically redefine it for their own purposes are the ones who
are trying to impose their values on the rest of the population.
Ordinary people did not pick this fight. They are not the aggressors.
They are merely defending the basic morality that has sustained
the culture for everyone against a radical attack.

<p>

<b>Q: Oh, come on. Whom does it really hurt if a same-sex couple
want to get married?</b>

<p>

A: When homosexual couples seek state approval and all the benefits
that the state reserves for married couples, they impose the law
on everyone. According non-marital relationships the same status
as marriage would mean that millions of people would be disenfranchised
by their own governments. The state would be telling them that
their beliefs are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights
laws into a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Business men and women would be required to provide &quot;family&quot;
health benefits to homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Children would be taught in schools that homosexual sex is
the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would facilitiate the adoption
of children by homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Sex-based distinctions in the law would be removed (as was
proposed in the rejected Equal Rights Amendment).

</ul><p>

Law is not a suggestion, but, as George Washington observed, it
is force. Official state sanction of same-sex relationships as
&quot;marriage&quot; would bring the full apparatus of the state
against those who believe that marriage is between one man and
one woman. Traditional morality would, in effect, be outlawed.

<p>

<b>Q: But if two people -- any two people -- love each other,
why not let them marry?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage is not just a matter of feelings. It is the specifically
defined legal, social, economic and spiritual union of a man and
a woman. The two sexes must be present for it to be marriage.
If that definition is radically altered based on the &quot;feelings&quot;
of those in other relationships, then the sky is the limit. There
is no logical reason for not letting several people marry, or
for gutting other requirements, such as minimum age, blood relative
status or even the limitation of the relationship to human beings.

<p>

<b>Q: Don't morals change? Haven't we heard all these tired phrases
used in defense of not letting women vote or even in defense of
slavery?</b>

<p>

A: Various social movements have succeeded because they were in
accord with natural law and the basic precepts of the moral code.
Homosexuality has never been considered morally good, and it is
a quantum leap from ending slavery to saying that homosexuality
must now be considered good, healthy and worthy of state-protected
benefits. Homosexuals enjoy all the rights every other citizen
already has -- they can vote, own property, etc.-- but they cannot
claim special treatment beyond those rights. Anytime they achieve
that, they threaten the civil rights of those who disagree with
them.

<p>

<b>Q: For years, in some Southern states, blacks and whites were
prevented from marrying by anti-miscegenation laws. Eventually,
the courts overturned these laws. Aren't same-sex couples being
similarly discriminated against? Isn't it only a matter of time
before these repressive laws are also overturned?</b>

<p>

A: As Colin Powell has observed, skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different. The first is a benign, inborn characteristic
that has no bearing on conduct or character; the second is behaviorally-based
and has everything to do with character, morality and society's
basic rules of conduct. If the civil rights laws begin deviating
into behavior and away from race, ethnic origin, place of birth
or other immutable characteristics, there is no stopping point.
New laws would have to be coined almost daily to accommodate the
flood of claims based on behavior (smokers, compulsive gamblers,
pornography fanatics, sex addicts and pedophiles could all claim
new &quot;rights&quot; to protection against discrimination).
One non-immutable characteristic that does get protection is religion,
because that is enshrined in the Constitution. But there is no
constitutional right to engage in sodomy (see <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>)[1]
and demand that the state elevate it into protected status.

<p>

<b>Q: But studies show that homosexuals are born that way. How
then can you blame them for their condition?</b>

<p>

A: Nobody is &quot;blaming&quot; anyone for having homosexual
desires. The &quot;genetic&quot; studies that have been publicized
have been conducted by self-styled homosexual activists or have
been misrepresented in the media. The studies themselves typically
have tiny sample sizes, biased selection, and other major methodological
flaws, and are not replicated by reputable scientists.[2] By contrast,
70 years of therapeutic counseling and case studies show a remarkable
consistency concerning the origins of the homosexual impulse as
an uncompleted gender identity seeking after its own sex to replace
what was not fully developed.[3] Do homosexuals choose to be gay?
Mostly, no, but they can choose their behavior, and they can change
their orientation,[4] as researchers Masters and Johnson showed in
their landmark studies[5] and as numerous examples of successful
personal transformation testify.[6]

<p>

<b>Q: Isn't the traditional view of marriage religious in nature?
And if so, doesn't the restriction of marriage to one man and
one woman violate the religious beliefs of those who disagree?</b>

<p>

A: Although marriage does indeed arise from religious traditions,
most notably the Bible, it is an independently quantifiable good
for society. Hence, the state has an interest in preserving and
protecting the special status of marriage, regardless of religious
beliefs. A society can get along just fine without any homosexuality,
but no society can get along without marriage. That is why the
state encourages marriage. In 1885, the Supreme Court felt so
strongly that marriage was to be protected that it declared it
as a requirement for admission of new states to the Union. Any
prospective state, the court said, had to have law resting &quot;on
the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing
from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot;[7]

<p>

<b>Q: What about childless couples? Since you say that marriage
must be protected partly because of its importance in forming
families, does this mean that heterosexual couples who do not
have children shouldn't get marriage licenses?</b>

<p>

A: Of course not. Although most people marry with the intention
of someday starting families, the married couples who do not have
children still have the potential for becoming mothers and fathers,
either biologically or through adoption. Marriage is a societal
good even without children, as husbands and wives serve as role
models for children in their neighborhoods. Procreation is an
important aspect of society's high regard for marriage, but it
is not the only reason marriage is protected. Children do not
benefit when homosexuality is presented as a neutral or positive
lifestyle choice.

<p>

<b>Q: But with the threat of AIDS and other diseases among promiscuous,
homosexual men, wouldn't it be a societal good to encourage homosexual
monogamy?</b>

<p>

A: In cities where homosexual monogamy is already being encouraged,
AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases are skyrocketing.[8]
It is not &quot;homophobia&quot; that is causing this, but the
behavior itself, which is destructive emotionally, physically
and morally to individuals, families and societies. That is why
it has been discouraged in all successful cultures. Socrates and
Plato wrote that homosexuality was harmful to individuals and
society and should be discouraged. Even in &quot;steady&quot;
homosexual relationships, dangerous sex occurs, since the defining
homosexual sex act is patently unhealthy by any standard. State
sanction of homosexuality in any form is an invitation to the
young to experiment with something that may prove deadly. Any
public health benefits available by discouraging promiscuous homosexual
activity can be achieved without redefining traditional marriage,
which is per se a profoundly important public health measure.

<p>

Besides, homosexual literature acknowledges that homosexual 
&quot;monogamy&quot; is largely fictional. Most homosexual relationships 
are fleeting. Those that endure more than a few years do so because of an 
agreement to have outside partners. As <I>New Republic</I> editor Andrew
Sullivan, a homosexual, writes in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I>,
&quot;the openness of the contract&quot; of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
reflects &quot;greater understanding of the need for extramarital
outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.&quot;
In other words, the homosexual concept of &quot;monogamy&quot;
is non-monogamous. Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile
frankly admits that the goal of homosexual activists is to &quot;fight
for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted,
redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the
right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes
but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic 
institution....&quot;[9]

<p>

<b>Q: Don't most people want homosexuals to be treated fairly?</b>

<p>

A: Yes. Most people have no ill will toward homosexuals, but this
does not mean that a tiny segment of the population (less than
2 percent) should be allowed to radically redefine society's moral
code. Even in liberal Hawaii, recent polls show that more than
70 percent of residents oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot;
and national polls show that about two-thirds of respondents oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; This is not about tolerance, but
about a tiny group seeking to use the law to impose its version
of morality on everyone else.

<p>

<b>Q: Still, don't homosexuals suffer discrimination when they
can't marry?</b>

<p>

A: No. Homosexuals have precisely the same right to marry as anyone
else. Marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes. That
is the whole point. To enter marriage, you must meet its qualifications.
Any attempt to get around the rules that everyone else plays by
is an attempt to have special rights, not equal rights. Eliminating
an entire sex from the picture and then calling it &quot;marriage&quot;
is not a mere expansion of an institution, but rather the destruction
of a principle.

<p>

<b>Q: What about domestic partnerships? If you won't go along
with same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; why not at least allow committed
same-sex couples to get some benefits?</b>

<p>

A: The state should never be in the business of encouraging unhealthy
behavior by granting special benefits for it. A homosexual life
does not offer the richness of the complementary relationship
that men and women find in marriage and family life. People should
not be written off as if they can do no better than be mired in
an unhealthy, unnatural behavior. The more that homosexuality
is encouraged, the more damage will be wreaked among individuals,
families and society. This is not compassion but its opposite:
a ruthless social Darwinism that devalues people as impulse-driven
incorrigibles. Each human soul is of inestimable worth, and homosexuals
are no different from anyone else. They deserve the truth, not
an officially sanctioned lie.

<h2>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A<br>
COMEBACK</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A 1960s-era designer drug is making a dramatic comeback and may
do to the 1990s what cocaine did to the 1980s. The use of methamphetamine,
known on the street as speed, ice, crank, crystal meth or the
&quot;poor man's coke,&quot; is rising dramatically.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is a synthetic central-nervous system stimulant of the amphetamine
family. It was discovered by a Japanese chemist in 1919, and was
used extensively by all sides during World War II to fight fatigue
and enhance performance.

<p>

In small doses, meth has been used by combat pilots to keep alert,
and by astronauts to be ready for critical decisions at the end
of long missions. A <I>USA Today</I> story last fall claimed President
John F. Kennedy used small quantities, and that German dictator
Adolph Hitler was known to be a meth abuser.[1]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW DOES METH AFFECT THE USER?</h3></center>

<p>

Larry Lewman, Oregon State Examiner, said, &quot;It's not as lethal
[as crack], but it's cheaper. And it causes a toxic psychosis
and (users) can be absolutely irrational for days.&quot;[2]

<p>

Meth can have a bizarre effect on some. While high on meth, Eric
Smith thought his 14-year-old son was demon-possessed. He murdered
his son, cut off the boy's head, and tossed it out of the window
of his van.[3]

<p>

Such irrational and often violent behavior is common among meth
abusers. According to Dr. Alex Stalcup, former medical director
of the Haight-Asbury free clinic, &quot;I have [meth] patients
come in with as much as 19 to 20 days of no sleep. They are very
dangerous, paranoid, talking weapons. Some hold themselves in
a house, take hostages and begin shooting out the windows.&quot;[4]

<p>

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA school of medicine,
said of meth users, &quot;They're wired to be alert, on guard
and primed for action.&quot;[5]

<p>

The downside of meth's euphoria is an amphetamine psychosis. It
can last for months. The person becomes agitated, on edge and
paranoid. A meth crash can be deadly for children, spouses and
friends of the user.

<p>

The signs of meth abuse are: weight loss, irritability, excitability,
paranoia, wandering attention, sleeplessness for days and then
sleeping for 24 to 36 hours straight.[6]

<p>

<center><h3>WHERE DOES METH COME FROM?</h3></center>

<p>

In the late 1980s, traffickers and clandestine laboratory operators
discovered that ma huang, an extract from the ephedra plant, the
world's oldest known cultivated plant, could be used to produce
methamphetamine. This discovery prompted the U.S. government to
impose controls on ephedrine.

<p>

The ephedra plant is grown in China, India, the Czech Republic
and, at one time, was sown as a ground cover in the western U.S.
by the Bureau of Plant Industry. Frontier Americans called ephedrine
&quot;Mormon tea&quot; because it was drunk by Mormons in lieu
of regular coffee and tea, which are off-limits. It was also called
&quot;whorehouse tea&quot; because settlers believed it cured
venereal disease.[7]

<p>

Although ephedrine is not sold in large quantities for fear it
will be used to produce meth, it is legally available as a treatment
for asthma. Pseudoephedrine is readily available as a nasal decongestant.
Ephedrine tablets are also sold as an herbal supplement under
such names as &quot;Trim Easy,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and 
&quot;Bliss&quot; at rock concerts or hip clothing boutiques and 
&quot;Ephedra&quot; in health food stores.[8] It can be found in some new 
herbal sodas. Bodybuilders also use it for short-term energy boosts.

<p>

In 1988, Congress passed the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act, which imposed controls on bulk ephedrine powder. Thereafter,
meth producers sought international sources and began to switch
to pseudoephedrine as their source chemical.

<p>

Meth can be &quot;cooked&quot; by amateurs with a few simple chemicals
in makeshift labs. Some of these labs can produce up to 100 pounds
at a time. In February 1995, Mexican authorities seized a lab
that could produce 2,640 pounds of meth a month.[9]

<p>

Even a makeshift lab can take $4,000 in raw ingredients and produce
eight pounds of meth worth more than $50,000 on the street.[10] Besides
the danger of arrest for producing illegal substances, lab mistakes
can be catastrophic.

<p>

On Christmas Day, 1995, a mobile home near Aguanga, California
burst into flames. Three children died and an out-of-control meth
kitchen was blamed.[11]

<p>

Authorities busted 419 clandestine labs in California in 1994,
and the deadly environmental residue from these labs cost that
state more than $1 million in clean-up.[12] Although the number of
meth lab seizures rose to 683 in 1989, they dramatically declined
with new laws restricting ephedrine's availability.[13] Today, the
number of labs is rising once again as alternative ephedrine sources
have been found.

<p>

<center><h3>WHO USES METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is tailor-made for the fast-paced 1990s. It helps suppress
the appetite, gives self-confidence, provides an extended feeling
of euphoria, and provides &quot;Energizer&quot; levels of get-up-and-go.

<p>

Kathy Paddock, a services coordinator for Terros, an Arizona-based
drug and mental health rehabilitation center, said, &quot;We're
seeing young people in their teens, young adults, everyone. It's
the drug of the '90s. People are needing to go fast -- alter their
moods. The meths are replacing crack.&quot;[14]

<p>

One study found that 75 percent of meth users were employed white
men between the ages 25 and 35.[15] Robert Booth, a psychiatry professor
at Colorado University's medical school, says meth attracts middle-class
housewives with too much to do.[16] <I>The U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
describes meth users as white, 18-to-34-year-old working class
people, &quot;some of them gay and many of them women.&quot;[17]

<p>

Ed Mayer, head of the narcotics enforcement team in Jackson County,
Oregon, says meth is &quot;cheaper [than cocaine] and it gives
people a longer high.&quot;[18] That's why it is growing in popularity,
especially among adolescent girls who want to lose weight and
boys who use it as a sexual stimulant.[19]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NEW METH EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

Just how bad is the meth &quot;epidemic&quot; and what are the
consequences? Consider:

<p><ul>

<li>The Department of Justice reports that meth abuse has risen
between 500 and 800 percent among young adults over the past five
years.[20]

<p>

<li>The nation's medical examiners report a 144 percent rise in
meth-related deaths from 1992 to 1994.[21] There were 1,816 meth-related
deaths reported from 1991 to 1994.[22] Eighty percent of these were
reported in just <i>four</i> big western cities.[23]

<p>

<li>Meth-related hospital emergency room admissions have risen
366 percent over the last 10 years in California.[24] In some local
areas they have risen 1,742 percent.[25] The problem is so bad that
in one California hospital meth babies now outnumber crack babies
by as much as seven to one.[26]

<p>

<li>In Phoenix, meth-related crimes have jumped 400 percent in
the last three years.[27] Officials believe meth is largely responsible
for a 40 percent jump in Phoenix's 1994 homicide rate. Phoenix's
law enforcement authorities also report spending 60 percent of
their time working on cases involving meth.[28]

<p>

<li>In Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, police say that
meth was involved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.[29] San Diego
County reports that meth detections among arrestees rose from
23 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1994.[30]

<p>

<li>Authorities in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area report
nearly 3,000 admissions to treatment programs for meth. This is
up from only 600 in 1988.[31]

<p>

<li>Meth is making inroads elsewhere. Of 100 women recently booked
into the Minneapolis jail, 75 had meth traces in their urine.[32]
In Tacoma, Washington, police report that meth-related homicides
are on the rise.[33]

</ul><p>

Recognizing the critical nature of the coming tidal wave of meth
abuse, on March 12, 1996, Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced
legislation aimed at curbing the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has bipartisan
support, tightens federal regulation and reporting requirements
for the chemicals used to produce meth, and increases criminal
penalties for possession of the relevant chemicals or equipment
with the intent to manufacture the drug.

<p>

Public officials are nearly unanimous in condemning meth and warning
Americans about its likely impact. Attorney General Janet Reno
warned, &quot;There should be no question...in anybody's mind
that methamphetamine poses a real and serious threat to the citizens
of our nation.&quot;[34]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration head Thomas A. Constantine told
a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee: &quot;I am concerned that
this coming epidemic could not happen at a worse time. Our nation
has not yet fully recovered from our cocaine experience, and powerful
traffickers in Mexico are seeking to make their mark on history
in much the same way the Cali Mafia did.&quot;[35]

<p>

Dr. Andrew Mecca with the California Alcohol and Drug Programs
participated in a meth study which found &quot;that we have got
a dramatic rise or epidemic level of occurrence.&quot;[36]

<p>

John Coonce, the meth task force chief for the DEA, said, &quot;We're
seeing more [meth] labs in middle American. It's an epidemic that's
getting worse.&quot;[37]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TRAFFICKERS FIND METH BETTER THAN CRACK</h3></center>

<p>

Today, meth is available in large quantities. Last year about
170 tons of ephedrine was converted into 136 tons of meth, which
was sold on U.S. streets for about $3.2 billion. That's enough
meth to supply 12.4 million abusers with three 10-milligram doses
a day for 365 days a year.[38]

<p>

Meth production and distribution have become a big business. In
the 1970s, meth was largely the province of motorcycle gangs.
But in the 1980s making meth from ephedrine became an easy and
lucrative alternative to processing and selling cocaine. It became
attractive because domestic traffickers could cut out middlemen
like the Colombian cartels.

<p>

There are three categories of meth traffickers. Those who traffic
in the raw materials -- primarily ephedrine or pseudoephedrine
-- to producers, those who peddle the finished product, and those
who do both.

<p>

The raw material traffickers either operate domestically or internationally.
The domestic operators divert legal ephedrine to meth lab operators.
For example, Clifton Pharmaceuticals in western Pennsylvania imported
large quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine powder last
year. From the powder they made pills, which were then sold through
three mail order firms located in Florida and Kentucky. The DEA
routinely seized these products in clandestine meth labs in California.[39]

<p>

Ephedrine tablets were sold through mail order distributors in
100 and 1,000-count bottles through magazines like <I>Cosmopolitan,
High Times</I> and <I>Hustler</I>.[40] They were advertised as 
bronchodilators, energy boosters or diet aids. This practice has now been 
slowed by the 1990 Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act, because the
DEA can now deny registration to companies whose actions are deemed
to pose an imminent threat to public health and safety. Unfortunately,
the Food and Drug Administration has yet to reclassify pseudoephedrine
as a controlled substance.

<p>

Mexican drug organizations are the primary traffickers in raw
ephedrine. They ship large quantities of ephedrine from India,
China and the Czech Republic into Mexico and then either make
meth at local labs or smuggle it into the U.S. For example, in
1994, 3.4 tons of ephedrine traveling from Zurich to Mexico City
was seized by the customs service at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.[41]

<p>

Mexican finished-product traffickers have so saturated the Western
meth market as to depress its street value. In 1991, a pound of
meth cost $6,000, but today the price has been cut in half.[42] That
makes meth a real psychedelic bargain when compared to crack cocaine.
For example, $20 can buy a quarter gram of meth or one-tenth of
a gram of crack or one-sixteenth of a gram of heroin.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW TO HEAD OFF THE COMING EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

This country needs a three-part, balanced strategy to stop the
meth epidemic. This strategy must include strong enforcement,
prevention, and effective meth-abuse treatment with accountability.
Enforcement begins with the right laws. Congress already has laws
that tightly control the sale of ephedrine powder, but should
consider more restrictions on the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine
tablets. Feinstein's proposal closes a loophole in the Controlled
Substances Act by removing an exemption for pseudoephedrine. It
also adds needed restrictions on other chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine. Meth producers can now make cash purchases of
large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas
-- chemicals used to make meth. There are no uniform reporting
requirements or quantity limitations for these chemicals.[44]

<p>

The pending bill would restrict access to these chemicals and
impose a civil &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; law for
companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make
meth. It will also increase the maximum criminal penalty for those
who possess equipment used to manufacture meth.

<p>

The second part of an effective meth-abuse prevention strategy
is to reduce demand through more effective education about the
drug's ruinous effects, which include hallucinations, addiction,
depression, paranoia and violent rages. This effort should be
spearheaded by private, non-profit groups involved in drug education
at both the national and grass-roots levels.

<p>

Finally, the strategy must include effective treatment. Treatment
funds must be controlled at the point of delivery where local
officials best understand the problem. These programs must last
long enough to give the addicts a fighting chance to recover,
and addicts must be held strictly accountable for their progress.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The methamphetamine epidemic is poised to become much worse than
the crack epidemic. Meth is cheaper, can be domestically produced
and gives the abuser a higher high that lasts much longer than
crack cocaine. Meth's downside is that it can make the abuser
incredibly violent, thus further fueling the nation's crime epidemic.
Now is the time for parents, school teachers, citizen groups,
law enforcement, government officials, church leaders and others
to act in concert to ward off this scourge before it accelerates
into overdrive, leaving millions of devastated citizens in its
wake.

<title>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</title>

<h2>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS<br>
TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert Knight and Ken Ervin</i></center>

<p>

Under the guise of &quot;condemning hate speech,&quot; a homosexual
activist group, Parents, Friends &amp; Families of Lesbians And
Gays (PFLAG) has launched a TV and newspaper advertising campaign
designed to smear and silence opponents of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

Back when it was formed in 1981, the Washington, D.C.-based PFLAG
was a small, obscure group of parental activists. In recent years,
it has become a major player to promote homosexuality as normal
and healthy. PFLAG's mission statement focuses on three areas:

<p><ul>

<li>Support - chapter groups meet in various cities to offer support
and plan strategies;

<p>

<li>Advocacy - testifying and lobbying on both state and federal
levels in favor of homosexual-friendly legislation;

<p>

<li>Education - through the publishing of various &quot;fact&quot;
sheets, audio workshops, conferences and seminars.

</ul><p>

PFLAG's goal in educating society is to &quot;dispel myths, report
on scientific research, [and] explain religious teachings.&quot;[1]
However, the group has disseminated much inaccurate and misleading
information concerning homosexuality. For example, in its brochure
<I>Why Is My Child Gay?</I>, the reader is told that &quot;about
10 percent of the population is gay.&quot; This inflated figure
is based on the discredited works of Alfred Kinsey, author of
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>. The brochure also leads
the reader to believe that scientists have found evidence that
homosexuality is a biological predisposition, but no credible
evidence exists for this assertion.[2]

<p>

PFLAG has amassed considerable financial backing to launch its
latest campaign against opponents of the homosexual agenda. The
$1 million effort follows one of the many blueprints for propaganda
warfare set forth in the book <I>After the Ball: How America Will
Conquer Its Fear of Gays in the 90's</I>.[3]

<p>

PFLAG has chosen a tactic called &quot;Bracketing,&quot; which
is best described by <I>After the Ball</I> authors Marshall Kirk
and Hunter Madsen:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The best way to make homohatred look bad is to vilify those
who victimize gays. The public should be shown images of ranting 
homohaters whose associated traits and attitudes appall and anger 
Middle America. . . .In TV and print, images of victimizers
can be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
call 'bracket technique.' For example, for several seconds an unctuous
beady-eyed Southern preacher is shown pounding the pulpit in rage against
'those perverted, abominable creatures.' While his tirade continues over 
the soundtrack, the picture switches to heart-rending photos of badly 
beaten persons, or of gays who look decent, harmless, and likable; and 
then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher. The contrast 
speaks for itself. The viewer will ordinarily recoil from these images 
of victimizers, thinking automatically: 'I don't like those maniacs,
don't want to be like them, and would be ashamed if others thought I was 
like them. Surely I'm more compassionate and sophisticated, because I 
don't share their irrational hatred of gays.' Every time a viewer runs 
through this comparative self-appraisal, he reinforces a self-definition 
that consciously rejects homohatred and validates sympathy for gay 
victims. Exactly what we want.&quot;</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And apparently that is exactly what PFLAG wants, because they've
followed Kirk and Madsen's game plan almost to the letter.

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;One of the two 30-second [TV] spots dramatizes gay-bashing,
where a young man is chased by a group and then beaten; the other depicts 
a young woman holding a gun as she considers suicide. Visuals then cut 
to TV comments from the Rev. [Pat] Robertson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

The PFLAG campaign, Project Open Mind, is expected to run for
the next two to five years. It is currently being marketed in
Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma. New stations
are being sought in five Midwest and Pacific Northwest markets.
The PFLAG effort coincides with a major effort to press the homosexual
agenda on several fronts:

<p><ul>

<li>Homosexuals in the military - the effort to force the inclusion
of open homosexuals in all branches of the U.S. military;

<p>

<li>Homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; - the campaign to accord marital
status to same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Homosexual adoption - the drive to sanction custody and adoption
of children by same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Civil rights for homosexuals - the wide-ranging campaign to
bully the U.S. legal system into granting special rights and privileges
to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuals qualify for 
&quot;minority&quot; status.

</ul><p>

Coming under increasingly shrill attack from PFLAG and other homosexual
activist groups are orthodox Christianity and &quot;organized
religion.&quot; On this battleground, however, the homosexual
community seems fragmented over the best way to attack. One segment
of activists believes the best course of action is blatant, 
&quot;in-your-face&quot; defiance. This consists of staged, eye-catching 
media events like gay pride parades. During the June 25, 1995 New York 
City parade, activists, some in nun's habits and others in various 
stages of undress, once again marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral 
carrying signs with such slogans as &quot;Hatred is not sacred.&quot;

<p>

The belief of another faction is that this kind of activism has
damaged the homosexual cause politically and intellectually. During
the visit of Pope John Paul II to New York City, six men unfurled
a banner from a sixth-floor window in Saks Fifth Avenue facing
St. Patrick's Cathedral. The banner, which read &quot;Condoms
Save Lives,&quot; was removed and the men were arrested. Citing
this botched effort, lesbian writer Camille Paglia calls for homosexual
activists to turn from attacks on the church and concentrate more
on intellectual discourse. Yet the author, near the end of her
argument for a more intellectual approach, still can't resist
the urge to take pot-shots at religion:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Mottos I would have liked to see fly on violet satin over
St. Patrick's: Penis Power; Long Live Gay Love; Paradise Now; Sympathy 
for the Devil; Flesh and Fantasy; There Is No God; Eat of My Body; Sex 
Is Sacred; Art, Pleasure, Sex; Dionysus Lives; Bring Back Babylon; 
Pagans Unite; Disobey Authority; Free Your Mind.&quot;</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

Another group has chosen to carry out its attacks by infiltrating
church hierarchy. Episcopal Bishop John Spong appeared as keynote
speaker at a November 10, 1995 symposium hosted by PFLAG and held
at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. (currently
attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton and, until early 1995, by
Bob and Elizabeth Dole). According to an eyewitness account by
Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, Bishop
Spong's address ridiculed the Christmas story, praised homosexual
&quot;marriage,&quot; declared the Ten Commandments &quot;immoral,&quot;
and referred to the Apostle Paul as a &quot;self-hating, gay man.&quot;

<p>

Increasingly, opponents of the homosexual cause are being labeled
as &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;haters&quot; by mainstream journalists.
For example, the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Richard Cohen recently
queried, &quot;Where is the Republican who will look certain conservative
Christians in the eye and call them the bigots they are? Where
are the Christian clergymen, like those of the civil rights era,
who will condemn ignorance and bigotry, and exalt tolerance and
understanding? Who in the GOP field will assert that homophobia
is not a family value?&quot;[7]

<p>

Even while homosexuals continue their media assault, few major
political figures dare to evince any criticism of the gay agenda.
Part of this is due to a wholesale media blitz. As syndicated
columnist Cal Thomas has remarked, &quot;Evidence of this compromise
is everywhere, from the open recruitment of 'gay journalists'
to a convention of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
meeting in Washington last month. A copy of the program shows
that not only were representatives of major press organizations
in attendance as participants, they also contributed substantially
to the cost of the event.&quot;[8] These companies included ABC,
NBC, CBS, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I> and the
Associated Press, which recruited homosexuals and openly sided
with the partisan homosexual agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activists have cultivated a relationship with the press
to such a degree that its ability to report fairly and objectively
on the issues has been seriously impaired. At one PFLAG meeting
in Maryland on Nov. 21, 1993, according to an eyewitness account
by Peter LaBarbera, homosexual researcher Dean Hamer told the
audience that he was pleased with media coverage. Hamer, a geneticist
with the National Cancer Institute who is under investigation
for fraud in connection with the first of two gay gene studies
he authored, said, &quot;If you tell the press what to write about
a scientific study, they'll write it.&quot;[9] He added that he told
reporters that his study's findings show that sexual orientation
is like being &quot;left-handed,&quot; and that they obliged him:
&quot;That's what I told them to say, and they said it.&quot;[10]

<p>

Liberal politicians are increasingly looking to groups like PFLAG
for support in their efforts to restructure and realign both government
and society. &quot;PFLAG is writing the final chapter in the
nation's 200-year-old struggle for civil rights. I don't know
if you realize how important you are,&quot; says Rep. Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.).[11]

<p>

PFLAG's campaign is by no means an arbitrary attack. It's just
one small piece of a much larger battle plan. The goal is to silence
all opponents of the homosexual agenda, and harness government
and corporate power to enforce it.

<title>PRISONER LAWSUITS: A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR OBSTRUCTION?</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">

<p>

<h2>PRISONER LAWSUITS:<br>
A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR<br>
OBSTRUCTION?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Lawsuits brought by prisoners cost Americans millions of dollars
and make a mockery of the justice system. One murderer sued more
than 300 times, claiming he caught a cold from eating off of paper
plates and wasn't given enough fruit juice. A serial killer on
California's death row who sexually assaulted, tortured and mutilated
five teenage girls, sued prison officials for &quot;cruel and
unusual punishment&quot; because they served him soggy sandwiches.
A Missouri rapist, robber and kidnapper sued to have prisoners
treated to salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays.[1]

<p>

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
is promoting an inmate lawsuit reform bill. In his words, &quot;It's
high time to stop this outrage against taxpayers. It must not
continue any longer.&quot;[2]

<p>

Lawmakers also want to halt inmate litigation which delays executions
and overturns state court decisions via federal habeas corpus
petitions. Reforming the federal habeas corpus review process
will help repair the sagging credibility of our criminal justice
system.

<p>

Our system is supposed to serve victims and criminals by ensuring
that offenders receive appropriate and swift punishments which
act as deterrence to future crime. Unfortunately, habeas corpus
petitions, which may be well intended, delay justice and therefore
damage law enforcement's credibility. This must change.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS HABEAS CORPUS?</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus petitions allege that the prisoner's federal constitutional
rights were violated. State and federal prisoners can challenge
the validity of their convictions and the appropriateness of their
sentences by filing these petitions in a federal court. If a federal
judge agrees, he can issue writs ordering the prisoner's freedom,
reducing his sentence or having his case remanded for retrial
or resentencing.

<p>

Habeas corpus is Latin for &quot;you have the body.&quot; It requires
the prison warden to produce a prisoner to determine whether or
not the inmate is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should
be released from custody. A state prisoner who has exhausted normal
state appeals may continue to litigate his conviction or sentence
by applying for habeas corpus in a federal district court.

<p>

A growing number of Americans view such appeals as judicial obstruction.
After all, in spite of overwhelming evidence, many are filed by
death row criminals who litigate solely to delay their execution.
For example:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1974, Mitchell Blazak was convicted and sentenced to death
on two counts of murder. Between 1977 and 1988 he filed five unsuccessful
petitions with Arizona courts. In 1988, he successfully persuaded
a federal district court to vacate his 1974 trial because it failed
to consider his mental competence at the time. Crucial evidence
was lost by the federal court during the habeas corpus evidentiary
hearing, and as a result the state could not retry him and settled
for a negotiated plea agreement. Because Blazak had his presentence
credit of more than 19 years, he was returned to prison for less
than six months and released.[3]

<p>

<li>In 1977, Clarence Allen was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison. From prison he arranged for the murder of three people
who testified against him for which he was then convicted and
sentenced to death. Six years later, the California Supreme Court
affirmed the death sentence. Over the next two years, his federal
habeas corpus petitions were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review his case. But on September 2, 1988 a sympathetic
federal district judge issued a stay of execution which remains
in effect today -- 22 years after his first murder.[4]

<p>

<li>William Bonin was convicted and sentenced to death for the
1979 murders of 14 boys he lured inside his van, sexually assaulted
and then strangled. After nearly two decades of delays, Bonin
and 31 other Orange County, California death-row inmates have
exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution.[5]

<p>

<li>In 1982, Robert Buell kidnapped, brutally raped and strangled
an 11-year-old Ohio girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. Over a period of 12 years, he filed eight separate judicial
actions involving 36 judges. He recently filed papers in federal
court seeking yet another hearing.[6]

</ul><p>

Although 77 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for murderers,
they don't want the system to act in undue haste and execute innocent
people who may have been wrongly convicted.[7] Thus, the courts and
legislative bodies have carefully crafted a system of checks and
balances which includes federal habeas corpus petitions. The system
has saved some innocent people from execution and from the effects
of judicial errors.

<p>

Lloyd Schlup was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for
helping to kill a fellow inmate in the Missouri State Penitentiary.
Schlup's jury didn't hear from the 20 prisoners who witnessed
the murder and who later testified that Schlup wasn't the killer.
Neither did they see a surveillance videotape that showed Schlup
elsewhere at the time of the murder. Finally, at the insistence
of Schlup's fifth court-appointed lawyer, the evidence was heard.
The federal judge, after seeing the evidence, said, &quot;No reasonable
juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;[8]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas corpus reform such as the &quot;Emergency
Committee to Save Habeas Corpus&quot; often cite the case of Roger
Coleman. In 1981, Coleman was convicted and sentenced to death
for murdering and raping his sister-in-law although no one could
place him at the scene of the crime, and four independent witnesses
corroborated his near-perfect alibi. He was allegedly denied an
opportunity to present new evidence 10 years after sentencing
because his lawyer missed a filing date by three days. Coleman
was executed.[9]

<p>

The pro-reform Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF) provides
the rest of the story. Coleman's case went to the Supreme Court
twice on federal habeas corpus petitions. He claimed that new
evidence proved his innocence but in fact, according to a federal
judge, the forensic evidence done at Coleman's request &quot;significantly
bolster[ed] the jury's finding of guilt.&quot;[10]

<p>

Another case used to defend habeas corpus review involves Cornelius
Singleton, a black man, who was executed in Alabama in November,
1992, for murdering a nun in a cemetery by smothering her with
rocks. His court-appointed lawyer refused to meet with his client,
failed to object when the prosecutor struck all blacks from the
jury pool, and neglected to tell the jury that Singleton was mentally
retarded. The court-appointed attorney was disbarred. The attorney's
mistakes were wrong, but do not negate the facts in the case which
compelled a jury to find Singleton guilty of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>HISTORY OF HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus originated in Great Britain, where it was a 16th
century constitutional remedy against the tyranny of the crown.
It is found in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
safety may require it.&quot; Only once has the writ been suspended.
In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did so
by proclamation.

<p>

Traditionally habeas corpus was a pre-trial remedy which guarded
against federal oppression. The right to habeas corpus under the
constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 limited federal government
power but didn't apply to those detained by the states.[12] The Act
gave federal courts authority to issue the writ only for federal
prisoners. In 1833, Congress made an exception for state prisoners
in cases where states were interfering with federal officers enforcing
the Fugitive Slave Act.[13]

<p>

In 1867, Congress created an enlarged statutory habeas corpus.
The intent was to help former slaves held in involuntary servitude
in violation of the 13th Amendment. This change permitted any
prisoner convicted in a state court to have the constitutionality
of his conviction or his sentence reviewed by federal courts.[14]

<p>

This change was not frequently used. For example, in 1941, state
prisoners filed 127 petitions in federal courts.[15] But after the
creation of a &quot;quasi-appellate federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
by judicial decisions of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; the number
of petitions increased dramatically.[16] In 1994, state prisoners
filed 11,918 such petitions.[17]

<p>

The 1953 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v. Allen</I> transformed
federal habeas corpus into a general appellate jurisdiction of
the lower federal courts over criminal judgments.[18] The Court eliminated
conventional limitations on the scope of habeas review by expanding
the federal rights of state defendants.

<p>

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has since
imposed some limitations on writs of habeas corpus. It has narrowed
the range of claims that can be raised by prisoners who have pled
guilty. It has also restricted claims that were not properly raised
before state courts and barred rehearing of 4th Amendment claims
where state proceedings provide a &quot;full and fair opportunity&quot;
to litigate such claims.[19]

<p>

In a 1989 decision, the high court said that federal courts can't
consider habeas claims based on &quot;new rules of law&quot; that
were not in effect at the time of conviction.[20] A 1991 decision
further limits death row prisoners to one federal habeas petition
unless there is good reason why any constitutional claim was not
raised in the first instance.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>PROFILE OF THOSE WHO USE HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Most of the 13,359 federal and state inmates who filed federal
habeas corpus petitions in 1994 had been convicted of serious,
violent offenses. A 1987 U.S. Attorney General study found that
40 percent were filed five years after conviction, and delays
of more than 50 years were found.[22]

<p>

Anti-reform advocates like Yale Law School scholar Libby Lewis
cite myths to defend habeas corpus review. Lewis wrote in <I>The
Baltimore Sun</I>, &quot;Federal courts have found reversible
constitutional error in 40 percent of the death-penalty cases
reviewed under habeas corpus since 1976 -- after state courts
found no such error.&quot;[23]

<p>

A comprehensive analysis of federal habeas corpus reviews in capital
cases by the pro-reform CJLF labels Lewis's 40 percent statistic
&quot;out of date.&quot; The Foundation says the overall number
is around 15 percent, and for guilty verdicts the rate is only
5 percent.[24]

<p>

The Justice Department's 1995 review of federal habeas corpus
cases provides an interesting profile. It found that four of five
habeas petitioners had been convicted after trial and had their
cases reviewed by state appellate courts. Nearly half pursued
collateral remedies in state courts, and a third had filed at
least one previous federal petition.[25]

<p>

The Justice Department found that one-quarter of petitioners allege
ineffective assistance of counsel. Others cite trial court errors,
prosecutorial misconduct and violations of the 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th and 14th Amendments.[26] Roughly one-third of the petitions address
a single issue and more than 10 percent cite four or more issues.[27]

<p>

Federal courts dispose of most habeas cases quickly. Almost all
cases (98 percent) are either dismissed or denied on the merits,
while 1 percent are granted on the merits, leaving only 1 percent
to be returned to state courts for follow-up action.[28] Almost two-thirds
are dismissed due to either plaintiff's failure to exhaust state
remedies or procedural errors. Three of every four cases are settled
in about a year, but one out of every 10 cases lasts longer than
two years.[29]

<p>

Of course, the more issues involved, the longer the case. Multiple-issue
petitions average about 925 days to resolve while single-issue
cases are resolved in 224 days. The type of issue also dictates
the length of the period for resolution. For example, petitions
which allege prosecutorial misconduct take on the average 608
days, and trial court error issues take 559 days.[30]

<p>

On December 31, 1994, the Justice Department found there were
2,890 prisoners under sentence of death. During the period from
1977 to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons entered state and federal
prisons under sentences of death, and 1,790 of them have been
removed as a result of resentencing, retrial, commutation or death
while awaiting execution.[31]

<p>

In 1989, CJLF studied 100 capital habeas corpus cases from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It found that
40 percent of the court's final judgments resulted in relief.
Anti-reform advocates use this as evidence that habeas reviews
identify systemic deficiencies in state courts. But on closer
examination of each case, the states reached a reasonable decision.
The cases that gained federal relief came because the law had
changed, the claim was never properly presented to the state courts,
or because the courts simply disagreed with state jurists.[32]

<p>

A 1994 study by the National Center for State Courts came to a
similar conclusion. It found that the success rate for capital
habeas petitioners was &quot;vastly overstated.&quot; It found
that federal courts gave relief in 15 percent of capital cases
examined.[33]

<p>

<center><h3>WHY NOT CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in 1992 that there
is no case in which &quot;a state court's incorrect legal determination
has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. . .
. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have
an independent obligation to say what the law is.&quot;[34]

<p>

Habeas provides a mechanism to protect a criminal's constitutional
rights from abusive state courts. In 1982, a police officer in
Houston, Texas was gunned down during a routine traffic stop.
Police killed one of the assailants and charged the other with
the officer's murder. A jury convicted the man and sentenced him
to death. Texas denied him a rehearing. The man, an illegal alien,
filed a habeas petition. The federal judge found that prosecutors
had threatened witnesses, failed to disclose evidence that showed
the man's innocence and used false evidence at trial. The man's
life was saved.[35]

<p>

Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and an authority on
the death penalty, defends habeas, saying, &quot;It's absolutely
critical if we're going to have a death penalty system that we
provide adequate safeguards lest we make an irreversible, catastrophic
mistake. And we know that mistakes are constantly made.&quot;[36]

<p>

Leigh Dingerson, with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, also defends habeas corpus petitions. The &quot;real&quot;
implication of the habeas reform effort, according to Dingerson,
is that &quot;we'll see cases with significant constitutional
error slide through the courts without review. . . . Most death
row inmates were very poorly represented by trial counsel. . .
. So the more we limit the appeals process, the more we risk executing
defendants simply because they had a lousy lawyer.&quot;[37]

<p>

&quot;Without a review process conducted by a federal judge sitting
for life,&quot; said Michael Knoll, head of the Death Penalty
Information Center, &quot;you are going to see a lot more errors
go through -- errors that will lead to executions.&quot;[38]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas reform explain that state judges, who
may be elected [this is true in seven of the 50 states], and who
sometimes are former prosecutors, are subject to local political
pressures which could influence their trial decisions. This is
why federal courts are run by judges who are appointed for life
and are immune to many of the same pressures.

<p>

Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur England supports
federal review of state decisions. &quot;We've had instances in
Florida where innocent people came very close to being executed,&quot;
but they were saved by federal review.[39]

<p>

Former president of the American Bar Association, John Curtin,
Jr., supports habeas review of state decisions. &quot;Miscarriages
of justice cannot be tolerated in a civilized society.&quot;[40] Habeas
review acts as a responsible check on the system.

<p>

<center><h3>WHY CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Jerri Davis, whose son was viciously murdered in 1979 by a killer
who has delayed his execution for 17 years, argues, &quot;As long
as he's sitting up there, there's resentment. He has his life.
He has his card games, his exercise, his TV. We're feeding him.
We're clothing him. It's not fair.&quot;[41]

<p>

Death-row inmates like the killer of Davis's son have manipulated
the courts. They have nothing to lose, and the taxpayer picks
up the tab. Even Justice O'Connor cautions federal courts to be
&quot;fair to the states, in not disrupting the states' enforcement
of their criminal laws.&quot;[42]

<p>

&quot;There are some crimes that are so brutal that society expects
and demands the death penalty,&quot; says Michael Capizzi, an
Orange County, California district attorney. &quot;If you take
a quick snapshot of the devastation to human beings you understand
why an overwhelming majority of the people in the state favor
the death penalty.&quot;[43]

<p>

An ABA report shows that even the simplest cases, where relief
is denied at every stage, will still go to the high court at least
three times and to federal district and appellate courts twice.
That's after all state-level options are exhausted.[44]

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the death
penalty appeals process. &quot;The state has, as noted, a strong
interest in executing its duly acquired judgment.&quot; Referring
to a convicted murderer who has delayed his execution via the
appeals process for 15 years, he says his &quot;interest . . .is
entirely indeterminate, and for all we know non-existent. He seeks
additional time not in order to elaborate on a known claim, but
in order to develop a claim.&quot; Judge Scalia fears that the
current process allows executions to be &quot;stayed 
indefinitely.&quot;[45]

<p>

Paul Kamenar, director of the Washington Legal Foundation, says
that reforming habeas corpus and the 1976 revival of the death
penalty will improve criminal justice. But he warns, &quot;The
deterrent effect of any punishment depends on how swiftly the
punishment is applied.&quot;[46] Given the long delays for appeals
between sentencing and execution, many citizens have grown disillusioned
with the justice system.

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Crime
Subcommittee, wants to limit habeas corpus appeals. &quot;It sends
the message of swiftness and certainty of punishment that has
been missing from our criminal justice system for some time, and
it goes a long way to restoring deterrence to the criminal justice
system.&quot;[47]

<p>

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) supports changing the appeals process
&quot;because of the length of time that people remain on death
row at taxpayer expense. The people in this country are sick and
tired of paying for cable TV and . . . for food and lawyers for
those who have killed innocent people.&quot;[48]

<p>

John Collins, with the Springfield, Va., Citizens for Law and
Order, expresses a widely held belief that &quot;with repeated
review, there's never any finality, and there is continued victimization
of families.&quot; He asked, &quot;If you have federal review
after you've had full and fair state court consideration, why
have the state courts at all?&quot;[49]

<p>

Reform advocates contend that death-row inmates intentionally
withhold claims and wait until the last minute to petition federal
courts to gain execution delays. William Kopney, an Orange County
appellate attorney, said, &quot;Don't underestimate the ingenuity
of the people who are struggling 24 hours a day to save someone's
life when they believe the trial wasn't fair, or there's a miscarriage
of justice . . . . It's common for 11th-hour requests to strike
some responsive chord.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>LEGISLATION TO REFORM HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Many Americans want Congress to do something to reverse what they
perceive to be the abuse of the justice system by inmates. Americans
are also cynical about a liberal judiciary that appears to place
criminals' rights before victims' rights.

<p>

That's the impetus for legislative action to curb habeas corpus
abuse. In 1983, then-Attorney General William French Smith suggested
enactment of legislation abolishing federal habeas corpus as a
post-conviction remedy for state inmates.[51] Although Attorney General
Edwin Meese III agreed, Congress failed to act.[52] More recent attorneys
general echo agreement.

<p>

Following the April, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton
called for &quot;swift justice&quot; and gave his support to an
anti-terrorism bill. In both the Senate and House versions, that
bill includes habeas corpus reform.

<p>

The Senate version (S. 735, &quot;Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995&quot;) requires that a prisoner show that his conviction
or sentence violated &quot;clearly established federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the U.S.&quot;[53]

<p>

The House version (H.R. 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty
and Public Safety Act&quot;) incorporates habeas corpus reform
that establishes a six-month statute of limitations during which
a prisoner must file paperwork to receive an appeal hearing in
capital offense cases. Non-capital defendants have one year in
which to file appeal paperwork. Once the appeal has been filed,
the federal court must hear the case within four months. If the
petitioner loses at the district court, he may appeal only if:
(1) newly discovered evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly
that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant
guilty in his original trial, and (2) a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, is issued which was
previously unavailable.

<p>

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget criticize the
proposed changes. In their view, the proposed reform will &quot;subject
[the law] to potentially meritorious constitutional challenge.&quot;[54]
OMB says the proposal presumes to instruct federal courts on the
decisions those courts should reach on the meaning of the Constitution.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The battle over habeas corpus reform will become a constitutional
confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. Congress
can make law, but the high court has sway over issues of constitutionality.

<p>

The issue of protracted appeals by convicted criminals touches
deep emotions, especially among victims and their families. It
costs taxpayers millions of dollars to support inmate litigation
and sustain the judicial system. While appeals are in process
the friends and family of the victims suffer because they believe
justice has not been served. After almost every execution, the
victim's family says something to the effect of, &quot;At least
I can rest. Justice has been served.&quot;

<p>

It's time for habeas corpus reform that balances constitutional
rights and ensures justice. Any change must equally address three
tenets: swift punishment means better deterrence; limitless and
meritless appeals deny justice and displace taxpayer funds from
other programs; and hasty punishment may result in injustice to
those wrongly convicted.

<p>

Americans want to protect civil liberties, but they also want
to avoid freeing violent criminals on technicalities while ensuring
that police officers do not abuse their authority. Striking
this delicate balance is the subject of a national debate that
centers on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures[.]&quot;  To protect this right,
the modern judiciary created the exclusionary rule, which says
that prosecutors may not use evidence gathered illegally by the
police.  The rule is intended to keep law enforcement honest.

<p>

Policemen must obtain a warrant prior to searching and seizing.
Otherwise, evidence obtained at a crime scene may be ruled inadmissible
in court.  Judges routinely exclude such &quot;illegally&quot;
obtained evidence and allow criminals to go free. For example:

<p><ul>

<li>Charles Rathbun was arrested for the November 1995 murder
of model Linda Sobek.  He allegedly took Sobek into the California
hills, where he murdered her and buried her body.  During questioning,
Rathbun confessed to the crime and led officials to Sobek's grave.
A California court, however, ruled Rathbun's confession inadmissible
because police had not read him his rights prior to questioning.[1]
He may go free.

<p>

<li>Gary Gauger confessed to the gruesome murder of his parents
in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal,
an Illinois court ruled that his confession was inadmissible because
it, too, was illegally obtained.[2] He may go free.

<p>

<li>In 1984, Alfio Ferro was arrested for a fur robbery and murder.
While in custody, Ferro refused to speak with police.  One of
the detectives laid some furs in front of Ferro's cell.  Ferro,
thinking the police had information about the crime, made statements
which were later used against him.  A New York appeals court overturned
his murder conviction, contending that the placing of furs in
front of Ferro's cell amounted to coercion.  Ferro was freed.[3]

</ul><p>

Pending legislation which will alter the exclusionary rule might
have kept these murderers behind bars.

<p>

<center><h3>GROWING NATIONAL INTOLERANCE FOR LEGAL ABUSES</h3></center>

<p>

According to Steven Wagner of Luntz Research, a Republican polling
firm, there is a widespread feeling that the criminal justice
system has broken down and that the breakdown is &quot;the most
visible symbol of the declining moral character of American 
society.&quot;[4] Consider evidence of a wayward justice system.

<p>

In January 1996, at 5 a.m., a New York police officer patrolling
a high-crime area saw four young men loading duffel bags into
the trunk of an out-of-state car.  The men fled when they saw
the officer.  The officer found $4 million worth of cocaine and
heroin in the bags.[5]

<p>

Initially, federal District Court Judge Harold Baer found the
officer's explanation &quot;incredible&quot; and threw out the
trafficker's videotaped confession, saying the arrested driver
could have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.[6]
He denied that the police had &quot;probable cause&quot; for
searching the car.  The judge also said the men fled because of
the police department's reputation for being brutal.  Only after
a buildup of political pressure (including from President Clinton,
who had appointed the judge) did Baer reverse the finding.[7]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on President Clinton to admit
he had made mistakes in appointing judges &quot;who find technicalities
to release drug dealers and dangerous criminals.&quot;[8] Others
accused Baer of favoring the rights of criminals over public safety.

<p>

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see why some Americans are
suspicious of law enforcement.  Tales of police corruption, rogue
cops and evidence &quot;planting&quot; fill the media.  Testimony
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial by former Los Angeles detective
Mark Fuhrman eroded confidence in all policemen.  Fuhrman gave
the country a startling example of police brutality and racism.
Fuhrman bragged on tape about police abuses:  &quot;We basically
tortured them. . . .We broke'em.  Their faces were just mush.&quot;[9]

<p>

The widely-publicized Rodney King beating and the recent videotape
of two white deputies clubbing Mexicans near Los Angeles have
revived fears of rogue cops.  The &quot;Good Ol' Boys Roundup&quot;
in eastern Tennessee, where law enforcement agents took part in
racist acts, also add to the public's negative perception of law
enforcement.

<p>

Although these scenes do not represent the hundreds of thousands
of law enforcement officers who do their job well and faithfully
every day, they have undermined public confidence in the justice
and law enforcement systems and have chilled the exclusionary
rule debate.  Americans are confused about calls to reform the
rule.  Should lawmakers leave the rule alone or give police more
authority? Both options have liabilities.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN HISTORY</h3></center>

<p>

The exclusionary rule was created by the courts to implement the
Fourth Amendment.  It dates back to colonial times when British
troops broke down doors of homes seeking criminal evidence.  The
framers of America's Bill of Rights had one specific incident
in mind.

<p>

The 1763 case of <I>Wilkes v. Wood</I> clearly illustrates the
need for the Fourth Amendment. British troops, acting without
a warrant, broke into Wilkes' home and seized his private diaries.
Wilkes won his damage action against the colonial government.
His case steeled the Constitution's framers with a desire to
preclude future abuses.

<p>

Although the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees
to all persons the right to be secure from &quot;unreasonable&quot;
searches and seizures, it does not specify a remedy for violations
of this protection.  This is where the Supreme Court has sought
clarity.

<p>

In the 1820s, an attorney argued before the high court that the
Constitution provided for the exclusion of evidence.  Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Story denied that the Bill of Rights included
the concept of excluding evidence.  Story wrote, &quot;The right
of using evidence does not depend, nor, as far as I have any recollection,
has ever been supposed to depend, upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness
of the mode by which it is obtained.&quot;[10]

<p>

In 1886, however, the high court took the first steps toward creating
the modern exclusionary rule.  In <I>Boyd v. United States</I>,
the Supreme Court decided that using a man's diary or personal
papers as evidence against him in a criminal case would force
him &quot;to be a witness against himself.&quot;[11] Under these
circumstances, the court opined, the use of such evidence could
be denied.

<p>

In 1914, the exclusionary rule was officially created by the <I>Weeks
v. United States</I> decision. The high court determined that
evidence seized illegally had to be excluded.   The court reasoned
that the temptation to make unlawful searches and seizures could
not be checked by the threat of a civil lawsuit alone, and that
forcing law enforcement officials to get proper warrants would
force them to act with restraint. The court also reasoned that
denying police the fruits of unrestrained searches was an appropriate
defense of civil liberties.

<p>

As in the 1949 <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> case, the high court resisted
forcing the rule on state courts. But in 1961, Chief Justice
Earl Warren led the Supreme Court in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> to expand
the rule's application to all jurisdictions.  In 1984, it was
modified with <I>Leon v. United States</I>. In this case police
conducted a search pursuant to a search warrant that later was
found to have been defective.  The Supreme Court said that because
the officers believed they were acting properly, denying the evidence
would not deter future misconduct.  This has become known as the
&quot;good-faith&quot; exception.

<p>

The &quot;good-faith&quot; exception has also been applied in
situations where police gathered evidence without a search warrant
but in the reasonable belief that their actions were proper.

<p>

Now that the exclusionary rule has been tried for 80 years, it
has earned both supporters and detractors.  Professor William
Gangi of St. John's University told the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&quot;I see Americans growing increasingly cynical about our criminal
justice system, making derogatory references to 'technicalities'
or to criminals having more rights than their victims. And we
have to ask ourselves, 'Why?'&quot;[12]

<p>

<center><h3>HANDS-OFF THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

Defenders of the exclusionary rule claim it keeps lawmen honest.

<p>

Alan Dershowtiz, Harvard law professor and civil liberties advocate,
cautions that expanding the defendant's rights using the exclusionary
rule is the best way to protect the public from police abuses.[13]

<p>

James Fyfe, a former New York policeman and specialist on police
behavior, warns that &quot;...like some soldiers in a no-win war,
they [policemen] commit atrocities.&quot;[14]

<p>

This warning is not without substance.  The 1994 New York City
Mollen Commission investigated police corruption.  It found the
Department plagued with misconduct.  The Commission also found
that the Department's internal affairs &quot;often minimized and
even concealed corruption rather than rooted it out.&quot;  In
March 1994, 50 cops were arrested on charges of drug trafficking,
extortion, brutality and civil rights violations.[15]

<p>

Recently, Philadelphia had a similar police scandal.  Six rogue
cops pleaded guilty to charges that they framed people, lied to
obtain search warrants and stole money.  At least 42 criminal
convictions have been overturned as a result of these disclosures.[16]

<p>

Some key members of Congress support the exclusionary rule as
a check on police corruption.  On March 7, 1995, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;The
exclusionary rule enforces the Fourth Amendment by providing a
powerful disincentive to illegal searches by law enforcement
officials. . . .The rule has given prosecutors' offices and police
departments an institutional stake in thorough, lawful police
work.&quot;[17] Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. Bobby
Rush (D-Ill.) both claim to have been victimized by warrantless
federal searches.[18]

<p>

The American Bar Association also supports the rule.  Michael
McCann, an elected district attorney of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin,
spoke for the ABA at the same Senate Judiciary crime control hearing.
&quot;The rule has worked. . . .It has contributed to substantial
law reform by federal authorities.  It has increased the professionalism
of federal law enforcement officers.  It has vastly enhanced the
integrity of the federal judicial process.&quot;[19]

<p>

Rule supporters point out that complaints of abuse are often unfounded.
They cite four studies that show that the rule is seldom used
to toss out evidence.  A 1979 General Accounting Office report
found that motions to suppress evidence were granted in only 1.3
percent of federal cases.  A 1982 National Institute of Justice
study found that only 0.79 percent of all California felony cases
between 1976-79 rejected evidence because of the rule.  A study
of three midwestern states found the rule was used in less than
half of 1 percent of all cases.  Finally, Professor Wayne LaFave of the
University of Illinois College of Law found, &quot;The most careful
and balanced assessment of all available empirical data show [sic]
that. . .the cumulative loss in felony cases because of prosecutor
screening, police releases and court dismissals attributable to
the acquisition of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is from 0.6 percent to 2.35 percent.&quot;[20]

<p>

Even some peace officers support the rule.  Myron Orfield Jr.,
writing in the <I>University of Chicago Law Review</I>, quotes
the head of the narcotics section of the Organized Crime Division
of the Chicago Police Department:  &quot;In my personal opinion
[the exclusionary rule] is not a detriment to police work.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  It makes the police department more
professional.&quot;[21]

<p>

FBI director Louis Freeh said, &quot;My sense and my experience
have been that over the years, the exclusionary rule has not been
an obstacle to the FBI.&quot;[22]

<p>

John Dawes, a Cobb County, Georgia, homicide detective said, &quot;It's
been my experience that it's better to have a legal search warrant
issued by a judge.  That way, when you're entering, you know that
you're legally entering and legally gathering evidence.&quot;[23]

<p>

Justice Louis Brandeis endorsed placing constraints on law enforcers.
He wrote for the high court in the 1928 case <I>Olmstead v. United
States</I>: &quot;Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by
its example. . . .If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds
contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself;
it invites anarchy.&quot;[24]

<p>

Harvard law professor Carol Steiker echoed Brandeis's views to
the Senate Judiciary Committee at the March 7, 1995 hearing. 
She traced the expansion in the size and strength of our modern
police forces and said, &quot;Today's citizens are much more likely
to face well-trained and well-equipped police than they are to
encounter the anonymous blundering constable [who was once blamed
for making illegal searches]. . . .&quot;  She argues that modern
police are &quot;measured not by fidelity to procedural niceties
but rather by their ability to ferret out as much crime as possible.
In this respect, the Fourth Amendment's warrant clause and the
exclusionary rule are eminently realistic constitutional commands:
each counterbalances the natural incentive to fight crime at
any cost.&quot;[25]

<p>

She cited Justice Brandeis: &quot;To declare that in the administration
of the criminal law the end justifies the means -- to declare
that the government would commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution.&quot;[26]

<p>

Steiker says the exclusionary rule protects the most vulnerable
citizens from police over-reaching.  Specifically, she contends,
racial minorities are discriminated against by law enforcement
because too often race and class act as proxies for criminality
and too often police subject minority communities to the most
intrusive and offensive law enforcement tactics.[27]

<p>

She further argues that the rule encourages prosecutors and law
enforcement to communicate during the early stages of investigations
so as to develop evidence that can be used in court. Finally,
Steiker believes it protects the judicial process by preventing
government from being implicated in legitimizing unlawful conduct.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</h3></center>

<p>

On the other hand, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, disputes the notion that the exclusionary
rule deters police misconduct.  He argues that there is &quot;little
reliable empirical evidence that police misconduct has been deterred
by the rule.&quot;[29]

<p>

Judge Harold Rothwax, former vice chairman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union during the 1960s says, &quot;The pendulum has
now swung to the point that it unfairly favors the defendant 
[criminal].&quot;[30]

<p>

Judge Rothwax warns, &quot;What's happened is we've really departed
from common sense. . . . The system today seems incomprehensible to 
the average citizen.&quot;[31]

<p>

Steven Brill, editor-in-chief of <I>Court TV</I> and <I>The American
Lawyer</I>, agrees. &quot;There's no doubt that lots and lots
of people of good faith -- who aren't anti-civil liberties and
aren't right-wing zealots -- are increasingly frustrated.&quot;[32]

<p>

Professor Gangi told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;I call
it a disgrace.  Not only has the exclusionary rule failed to work
the magic its proponents promised, but it has eroded citizen confidence
in the competency of government.  And, in my opinion, it also
has thoroughly undermined the nobility of the role once played
by defense counsel.&quot;[33]

<p>

Paul Robinson, a professor at Northwestern University School of
Law, writes in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, &quot;The exclusionary
rule...suggests a system less strongly committed to doing justice
than to discouraging overreaching by the police.&quot;  He suggests
that police misconduct can be controlled by making offending officers
liable or by helping victims to get compensation from municipalities.
He says, &quot;If limiting overreaching by the police is such
an important goal, why not attack it head-on rather than 'punishing'
the offending officers by letting the criminal go free -- which
punishes society rather than the officers?&quot;[34]

<p>

<center><h3>PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

The Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666) would expand
the so-called &quot;good-faith&quot; exception to certain federal
searches without a warrant.  Evidence would be admissible as long
as trial judges determine that police had reason to believe that
their actions were proper.  The bill would not overturn prior
Supreme Court decisions specifying when a warrant must be obtained
prior to conducting a search.

<p>

Professor Steiker admits that this bill would not eliminate the
exclusionary rule but proposes it would admit unconstitutionally
seized evidence when law enforcement agents have a belief in the
legitimacy of their conduct.  She argues that this change ignores
the importance of the rule in the maintenance of judicial integrity
and fails to provide equally effective deterrence of unconstitutional
conduct. Further, she believes it will encourage police overreaching.[35]

<p>

Thomas Davies, professor at the University of Tennessee College
of Law, agrees with Steiker.  He believes H.R. 666 would provide
short-term gains, &quot;but the rule plays a vital role in reaffirming
the rule of law.  [The exclusionary rule and Mirander Waiver rules]
tell police officers that citizen's rights matter.  They allow
honest police officers to respect themselves as upstanding citizens
also.&quot;[36]

<p>

Senator Hatch's legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Improvement Act of 1995 (S.3), would eliminate the
rule entirely and establish in its place a civil tort remedy designed
to benefit citizens whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.

<p>

Hatch argues, the &quot;rule is not compelled by the Constitution.
. . .It is time to revisit this judicially-created remedy.&quot;[37]
He wants to strike the delicate balance between protecting the
rights of the accused from police misconduct while ensuring that
relevant evidence comes before the jury -- so as to put the truly
guilty in jail and achieve justice.
Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee  that the Hatch bill &quot;restores coherence
to our constitutional structure.  It takes the Fourth Amendment
out of criminal procedure, where it does not fit, and puts it
back where it belongs: in constitutional law.&quot;[38] He also
said, &quot;Suppose the bill increases convictions of guilty defendants
by 1 percent.  That's a lot of guilty rapists, murderers, and
robbers, and a lot of victims of crime who can sleep easier.&quot;[39]

<p>

The Hatch bill is not without its opponents.  Senator Kennedy
said that enactment of the Hatch bill &quot;would invite drastically
reduced compliance with the Constitution.&quot;[40]

<p>

Professor Steiker believes that removing the rule would fail to
provide the required deterrent effect and that the tort alternative
is misdirected.  Victims of illegal searches would not bring suit
against police misconduct either because lawyers would be reluctant
to take such cases or the likely awards would be insufficiently
enticing.[41]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

There are competing concepts in the exclusionary rule debate 
-- freedom from police misconduct and justice for the guilty.
We must find a balance.

<p>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his Birmingham, Alabama
jail cell, &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor,
it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;[42] Most citizens would
agree with Dr. King.

<p>

Today, there is ample evidence that some lawmen and judges are
over-stepping their bounds.  This must change.  Congress should
modify the law to simultaneously deny freedom to the guilty, give
incentives for police professionalism and protect civil liberties.
It can start by changing the court-created exclusionary rule.

<p>

If a bill before the House makes its way into law, the federal
government would have to make the switch from uprooting and destroying
marijuana crops to growing its own fields of plants for large-scale
distribution.

<p>

Once again, pro-drug groups are trying to convince America that
marijuana must be considered a legitimate medicine. Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618 last November, which would
&quot;provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]

<p>

The specified illnesses are to be limited to glaucoma, AIDS wasting
syndrome, nausea resulting from chemotherapy, and spasticity resulting
from multiple sclerosis (MS), paraplegia, and quadriplegia. However,
the bill does leave room for those with other illnesses to apply
for marijuana use through the Food and Drug Administration.[2]

<p>

Basically, the bill is another effort to reclassify marijuana.
Currently, marijuana is under Schedule I, meaning it is unable
to be prescribed, has a high potential for abuse, is not currently
accepted for medicinal use, and has a lack of safety. Rescheduling
marijuana would place it under Schedule II, which includes drugs
currently accepted for medical use that have a high potential
for abuse, but are still able to be prescribed.[3] Cocaine is an
example of a Schedule II drug.

<p>

The bill calls for an Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs to be established under the Department of Health
and Human Services. That office would be responsible for making
sure there is an adequate supply of the drug for &quot;legitimate
medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United
States.&quot; This supply would come from bidders or, if there
weren't enough domestic growers, from direct importation.

<p>

The office would provide the seeds to those whose bids to grow
marijuana are accepted. Those seeds, in turn, would be obtained
as follows: &quot;[L]egitimate commercial producers of marijuana
or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
the Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement Administration,
or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Secretary with
an adequate supply of seeds capable of germination.&quot;

<p>

The marijuana would be distributed to doctors who have said they
intend to use the drug only on consenting patients with one of
the aforementioned illnesses. The doctors would be approved by
sending in applications which the office would approve or deny
within 30 days. According to the bill, if the office does not
respond within that time, doctors could consider themselves approved.

<p>

The use of marijuana as medicine has stirred considerable controversy.
Marijuana advocates insist it carries valuable medical benefits
and claim it is actually more harmful to prohibit the sick from
smoking it. Most of the medical community sees it differently,
however. Few doubt that marijuana (cannabis) does have a certain
degree of medical effect. The problem is the marked disadvantages
crude marijuana carries with it. Smoked marijuana has too many
negative side-effects to warrant its use as a drug.

<p>

Of course, the utility of marijuana as a true medicine too often
takes a back seat to other interests. The pro-marijuana movement,
led by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), certainly has a
well-known ulterior motive for pushing marijuana as a medicine.
Dr. Janet Lapey, a pathologist who is now president of Concerned
Citizens for Drug Prevention, said members of NORML have frequently
cited the medicinal marijuana issue as a red herring to gain a
toehold in legalizing all marijuana use.[4] (In fact, the pro-drug
<I>High Times</I> magazine characterized drug proposals like 
marijuana-as-medicine as being mere first steps that were &quot;far 
short of the DPF's ultimate goals, which include decriminalization of 
all illegal drugs.&quot;[5])

<p>

Marijuana simply is not the equal of other therapeutic drugs already
on the market. In fact, the American Medical Association, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
the American Cancer Society, and the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society all deny that marijuana should be construed as medicine.[6]
After the DEA reviewed a petition for the possible rescheduling
of marijuana, Robert Bonner, the Administrator of Drug Enforcement
at the time, wrote, &quot;Relying on the same scientific standards
used to judge all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected
marijuana for medical use.&quot;[7]

<p>

The active medical and psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is
delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A synthetic THC called
dronabinol has been marketed as the drug Marinol since 1985.[8] Thus,
what medical good there is in marijuana has already been separated
from the problematic vegetable tissue of the cannabis plant. However,
even this purified and tested drug is not well received because
of its serious side-effects. Dr. Eric A.Voth is an assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Kansas and chairman of the International
Drug Strategy Institute. He has treated drug addicts for 10 years,
and recently testified at a congressional hearing on the legalization
of marijuana. Voth asserts, &quot;The negative side-effect profile
for marijuana, even dronabinol (Marinol), far exceeds most of
the other effective agents available.&quot;[9] Voth backs this assertion
by citing a study which ranked non-inhalant THC as only sixth
in preference among oncologists for the treatment of severe nausea,
and only ninth for mild nausea.[10]

<p>

Crude marijuana has even less to recommend it. First, no approved
drug is smoked. In the same way that tobacco is known to induce
lung cancer, smoking marijuana increases chances of cancer, too.
Billy Martin, a professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University's
medical college, said, &quot;There is good scientific evidence
showing adverse effects of smoking marijuana. Certainly it has
much higher tar content than cigarettes.&quot;[11] One study found
that marijuana smoking resulted in up to four times the respiratory
burden of an equivalent amount of tobacco smoking.[12] A September,
1993, National Institute on Drug Abuse update reported, &quot;Daily
use of one to three marijuana joints appears to produce approximately
the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking five
times as many cigarettes.&quot;[13]

<p>

When marijuana supporters advocate smoking the drug for the rest
of a patient's life (for conditions like MS or glaucoma), it seems
strange to promote a &quot;treatment&quot; that could very well
promote disease and hasten death. Moreover, at a time when tobacco
products are roundly criticized, legalizing a similar product
for supposedly medicinal purposes would be hypocritical.

<p>

Besides the adverse effects of smoking, marijuana use is related
to amotivation syndrome in chronic users, characterized by a loss
of energy, general apathy, and impairment of concentration. Sedation
and lethargy are very common. Acute negative psychological effects
could include flashbacks, panic attacks, and disorientation.[14]

<p>

Additionally, for each of the diseases listed in Frank's bill,
scientific studies and the vast majority of doctors cast doubts
on marijuana's usefulness compared to currently approved drugs.

<p>

Simply put, glaucoma is gradual blindness caused when fluid pressure
inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is too high. Crude marijuana,
like alcohol ingestion, can reduce that pressure. But to arrest
glaucoma's progress, marijuana would have to be ingested chronically
-- every day of a patient's life -- in order to be effective.
On the topic of glaucoma, a 1994 Drug Enforcement Administration
manual cited Dr. Keith Green. Green has served on the boards of
eight ophthalmological journals, and performed extensive research
on the relationship between marijuana and glaucoma. According
to the manual, Dr. Green &quot;suggests that in order to decrease
intraocular pressure, one would have to smoke the equivalent of
six joints a day.&quot;[15]

<p>

In studies analyzing the effect of marijuana on glaucoma, heavy
doses were needed to reach the point at which intraocular pressure
was reduced. In some studies, the effect of the necessary dosage
of marijuana caused patients to become quite drowsy. Researchers
reported, &quot;Our subjects were sometimes too sleepy to permit
measurement of intraocular pressures. . . three hours after 
intoxication.&quot;[16]

<p>

A 1994 Drug Watch publication entitled, &quot;Glaucoma: Is Marijuana
a Safe and Effective Treatment?&quot; reported that &quot;the
country's leading ophthalmologists are 'chagrined' and 'disturbed'
to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana as a treatment
for glaucoma.&quot;[17]

<p>

Vomiting because of chemotherapy treatment is a serious concern
of cancer patients and their doctors. While smoked marijuana has
some ability to control vomiting, doctors still say it is not
as effective as other, safer drugs. In an overview of antiemetic
(anti-vomiting) drugs in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>,
the authors addressed cannabis derivatives that were used as antiemetics.
Dronabinol usage entailed serious side-effects, including &quot;dysphoria,
hallucinations, sedation, vertigo, dry mouth, and disorientation,
and are therefore seldom used as first-line antiemetic therapy.&quot;
The authors do find hope in cannabinoids, though: &quot;Synthetic
cannabinoids with no psychotropic activity have antiemetic 
activity.&quot;[18] Thus, cannabinoids could lead to anti-vomiting drugs 
in the future that don't have the mindbending effects that marijuana and 
its active ingredients have. This does not mean, of course, that crude
marijuana is that hope. Scientific studies have shown that marijuana
is not preferable to Marinol, which is itself not preferable to
other anti-vomiting drugs.[19]

<p>

Neither should marijuana be used as a treatment for spasticity
resulting from neurological disorders. The DEA manual, written
by Tom Pool, claimed, &quot;Experts on MS absolutely reject this
proposition.&quot;[20] Pool quotes Dr. Donald Silberberg, the Chair
of the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine: &quot;The use of (marijuana), especially for
long-term treatment. . . would be worse than the original disease
itself.&quot;[21]

<p>

Of course, some MS sufferers adamantly claim marijuana helps control
their spasticity. These subjective anecdotes, unfortunately, have
not been borne out in clinical studies. One recent study indicated
that even while MS patients thought they were being helped by
smoking marijuana, their actual balance and coordination were
made worse.[22]

<p>

Using marijuana for treating AIDS patients brings more concerns.

<p>

Pool wrote, &quot;First, studies conducted at the Virginia Medical
College suggest that the THC in marijuana damages the immune system,
making the patient more susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza
while at the same time increasing the severity of any illnesses
that the patient has. Clearly, the last thing that a patient with
AIDS needs is to have his or her immune system weakened. Second,
the marijuana smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients.&quot;[23]

<p>

Advocates of medicinal marijuana continually make claims that
might lead the unsuspecting to believe that marijuana is actually
a miracle drug. For example, one pamphlet published by the Colorado
Hemp Initiative Project stated, &quot;Cannabis is two to three
times as effective as are currently legal medicines for reducing
Intra-Ocular Pressure, without toxic side-effects or damage to
liver and kidneys associated with presently approved drugs.&quot;[24]
Yet, in an evaluation of glaucoma treatment published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, marijuana isn't even mentioned
-- odd, if it is indeed two to three times as effective as any
other drug.[25]

<p>

Voth summarized the issue by noting, &quot;The pro-drug lobby
would have the public and policy makers incorrectly believe that
crude marijuana is the only treatment alternative for masses of
cancer sufferers who are going untreated for the nausea associated
with chemotherapy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other 
ailments.&quot;[26]

<p>

Pro-marijuana arguments heavily rely on anecdotal evidence instead
of controlled studies. Many people make the claim that marijuana
use has helped control aspects of various diseases. However, anecdotes
are notoriously inaccurate or statistically misleading.

<p>

Robert Peterson, the director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control
Policy from 1991-1995, wrote, &quot;One must look closely at anecdotal
evidence. In some of the most celebrated cases, the individual
smoked pot before he or she ever got ill. Marijuana is addictive
and addicts tend to feel better when they receive their drug.
. . . There is no doubt that using a euphoric drug such as marijuana,
alcohol, cocaine or heroin will make a sick person feel better.
That does not make a drug a medicine.&quot;[27]

<p>

The DEA petition echoes Peterson. &quot;Sick people are not objective
scientific observers, especially when it comes to their own health.
We all have heard of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency
to respond to drugs as they believe is expected of them. . . Stories
of marijuana's benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.&quot;[28]

<p>

Legislators considering legalizing marijuana as a type of folk
medicine should also consider the secondary effects of that action.
Past experience has shown that it is not uncommon for drugs distributed
by doctors that are otherwise illegal to spread from the patient
to his or her acquaintances and friends. Also, public attitudes
toward marijuana as a recreational drug probably would begin to
change if medicinal uses were approved. Already, youth are beginning
to see marijuana as a benign or even beneficial drug due to some
highly successful propaganda by groups like NORML. If, as the
evidence suggests, marijuana will not add anything to the American
medicine cabinet, any increased collateral use and resulting damage
would have to be added to the cost of rescheduling crude marijuana.

<p>

Certainly, pro-marijuana groups have performed admirably in disseminating
their views. Now, the voices of the objective medical establishment
need to match their enthusiasm, and inform the public of the truth
about medicinal uses of marijuana and the motivations behind the
arguments.

<h2>WILL EXCHANGING NEEDLES<br>
SAVE AMERICA'S FUTURE?</h2>

<p>

A 1995 government-commissioned study claims that giving clean
needles to addicts will slow the spread of the AIDS virus without
encouraging drug abuse. While there is reason to question this
claim, even if the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users
(IDU) were slowed, this action would create some potentially undesirable
effects.

<p>

The fight to establish federally-funded needle exchange programs
(NEP) is being urged as a wedge issue to gain drug legalization.
Linking drug addiction with the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic
under the pro-drug umbrella called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
is good political strategy, but it's a bad idea that is gathering
momentum, and it must be countered.

<p>

Supporters of federally-funded NEPs are rallying around this issue.
Leading NEP researcher Peter Lurie, a professor with the Institute
for Health Policy Studies, University of California San Francisco,
says the 1995 study is &quot;a vindication for all of the needle
exchange workers around the country, as well as the scientists
who have been coming to these conclusions for years....[The government]
can no longer hide from the weight of scientific evidence....&quot;[1]

<p>

In response to the American needle study, the respected British
medical journal <I>Lancet</I> said, &quot;It is time for the U.S.
to catch up with so much of the world....Needle exchanges do not
increase drug use in programme [sic] participants. They do not
encourage or increase the number of drug users. They do not increase
the number of needles lying about; they do not destroy cities,
or towns or neighborhoods.&quot;[2]

<p>

Dr. Lincoln Moses, chairman of the 15-member panel that led the
government's NEP study, said, &quot;We must consider the reality
that people do use drugs and that HIV is transmitted in growing
numbers by injection drug use.&quot;[3]

<p>

Not everyone agrees with those who favor needle exchange. Donna
Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), has
doubts. Shalala told <I>CNN</I> that &quot;different experts disagree&quot;
as to the efficacy of needle exchange.[4] Philip Lee, Shalala's assistant and 
a former needle exchange researcher, called NEPs &quot;an extraordinarily
complex public policy strategy&quot;[5] and expressed concern that
NEPs &quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;[6]

<p>

Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said, &quot;It [needle exchange]
drags down the standards of all society.... It is an act born
of desperation.&quot;[7] Reverend Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, agrees. &quot;I am not in favor of cooperating
with evil,&quot; said Butts. &quot;If we give out needles now...the
next step will be to legalize crack and heroin.&quot;[8] This may
be the ultimate goal of proponents of these programs.

<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL BACKGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

In 1992, Congress ordered HHS to request a study of NEPs by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent, Congressionally-chartered,
non-government research agency. If the Academy found that NEPs
were shown to be effective in reducing HIV infection while not
encouraging drug use, then the Surgeon General could lift the
ban on federal financing for such programs, Congress said.

<p>

The Academy concluded its study in 1995 and reported that well-implemented
NEPs can be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
increase the use of illegal drugs. NAS recommended that &quot;[t]he
Surgeon General make the determination called for in Public Law
102-394, section 514, 1993, necessary to rescind the present prohibition
against applying any federal funds to support needle exchange
programs.&quot;[9]

<p>

While addicts can legally buy needles in all but nine states without
a medical prescription, 45 states have laws making it a crime
to carry a needle and syringe.[10] Police in these states argue that
the criminalization of drug paraphernalia helps successful drug
arrests and prosecutions.

<p>

In 1992, Connecticut modified its syringe law to permit the possession
and purchase of up to 10 needles without a prescription. But a
state-sponsored survey found that IDU needle sharing did not change
with the new law.[11]

<p>

Community NEPs do not slow illegal needle sales. Numerous studies
have found that even where NEPs operate and syringes are available
without prescription, IDUs remain dependent upon black market
sources for needles.[12]

<p>

<center><h3>THE BATTLEGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

Needle Exchange Programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among IDUs to reduce the risk of transmitting
the AIDS virus. Residual blood retained in a shared syringe can
be passed along to the next person using the syringe. This high-risk
behavior infects perhaps 20,000 Americans with the AIDS virus
every year.[13]

<p>

Providing addicts with clean needles may slow the spread of the
AIDS virus, but questions remain. Will it lead to more responsible
behavior? Will it lead addicts to seek drug treatment? Will this
practice encourage more drug abuse?

<p>

Researchers discovered that the bite of the infected female anopheles
mosquito transmitted malaria. To slow malaria's spread, researchers
theorized, the mosquito had to be destroyed. It worked. Dr. Lurie
argues that replacing tainted drug needles with clean ones would
be analogous to removing the malaria vector.[14]

<p>

Nationwide, almost one-third of all AIDS cases are associated
with IDUs. This includes almost 60 percent of children under age
13 who contracted the virus from mothers who were abusers or who
were sex partners of IDUs.[15] Today, shared needles are blamed for
more HIV infections than in the past.

<p>

In 1981, only 12 percent of AIDS victims contracted the virus
from needles but in 1993 that number had risen to 29 percent.[16]
During the same period the proportion of new cases of HIV transmission
due to sex between men declined from 74 percent to 47 percent.[17]

<p>

Most of the IDUs are found in the 96 largest metropolitan areas.
These areas also include 85 percent of all reported AIDS cases,
and nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of all IDUs are located in
just six cities: Boston, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C.[18]

<p>

The total number of IDUs is hard to predict. The U.S. Public Health
Service reports that the population exceeds one million.[19] The 1994
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 2,580,000 Americans
have used needles to inject illicit drugs in their lives and 257,000
have done so in the past year.[20] A 1994 CDC report estimates that
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas alone the IDU population
exceeds 1.5 million.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>WHO ARE THE ADDICTS?</h3></center>

<p>

Terri is a 29-year-old Hispanic mother of two and an IDU. She
said, &quot;In the beginning, it was fun. I felt like Superman....It
was like I had an 'S' on my chest and I had my mask on, and I
could conquer the world. The drugs took away the bad feelings.&quot;[22]

<p>

Terri, like many addicts, started injecting just to get high.
Soon she found that the drugs were causing more pain than relief.
To support her $200-a-day habit, Terri sold heroin, got caught,
and lost custody of her children.[23] There are more than 200,000
addicts like Terri in New York City alone.[24]

<p>

According to another addict, &quot;Shooting drugs is not a rational
act....I know what it's like to be scared of getting AIDS, but
I needed to get high so bad that I didn't think about the risk.&quot;[25]

<p>

Dr. Steven Koester, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver, explains why addicts share needles
in spite of the AIDS scare. &quot;The laws against having syringes
made it too risky to carry them on the way to get heroin. It created
an artificial scarcity. They were sharing because they had to
-- not because of some ritual for bonding.&quot; After buying
their dope, said Koester, addicts &quot;go to the closest place
where they can have privacy and get a syringe.&quot; This is typically
a &quot;shooting gallery&quot; where, for a small fee, they can
get privacy and a needle to use.[26]

<p>

It's difficult for an addict to stop injecting drugs because heroin
depletes key body chemicals. With these gone, the body experiences
intense drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant.
That's why a heroin addict may need four to six injections each
day, 120 to 180 times per month or 1,500 times per year. Frequent
injections with shared needles lead to increased chances of contracting
blood-borne diseases like HIV.[27]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW NEPS WORK</h3></center>

<p>

The typical NEP client is male, has been injecting between seven
and 20 years and is between 33 and 41 years old.[28] Racial/ethnic
distributions vary considerably depending upon location. One-third
to one-half of NEP clients have never been in drug treatment.[29]

<p>

The Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center [New York City] provides
numerous services. Addicts can get &quot;shooter's supplies&quot;
like alcohol pads, cotton balls, cookers, condoms, bottles of
bleach and clean water. The exchange hands out about 1,000 needles
an hour[30] or between 15,000 and 20,000 each week.[31]

<p>

The exchange also helps addicts get into treatment programs, solves
housing problems, gives lessons on safer ways of shooting drugs,
and keeps tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. Warnings
about bad heroin are identified by their street names on a chalkboard
hung inside the center.[32]

<p>

Mark Gerse, the center's director, said, &quot;We've become an
information clearinghouse. If we didn't get the word out, it would
take a series of deaths to get people's attention.&quot;[33]

<p>

Terri uses the Lower East Side needle exchange which operates
out of a storefront in a residential area populated by working
poor. She explains, &quot;This place gives me hope and it makes
me feel loved....This place keeps you from hurting yourself until
you're able to make a choice to straighten yourself out.&quot;[34]

<p>

Another addict who has been mainlining for more than a decade,
said, &quot;It's good to know that there's someone actually looking
after us because the truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves
with bad dope.&quot;[35]

<p>

There are approximately 75 NEPs in 55 U.S. cities.[36] They operate
either from fixed sites (stationary van, storefront, street, and
health facility) or mobile sites (walk route, deliveries and roving
vans) operating a median 10 hours per week. They are staffed with
a combination of paid employees and volunteers who may provide
a variety of services in addition to exchanging needles, such
as HIV testing/counseling, tuberculosis screening, screening for
sexually transmitted diseases, primary medical care and substance
abuse treatment.[37]

<p>

<center><h3>THE SWISS NEEDLE EXPERIMENT</h3></center>

<p>

In 1986, to counter the drug problem, the Swiss began experimenting
with NEPs. The first step was to make syringes available in every
pharmacy. Switzerland also legalized syringe sales via public
vending machines. For three francs or about $2.43, anyone can
buy two syringes, extra needles, alcohol, swabs, gauze, and a
condom packaged in a cigarette-sized pack labeled &quot;Flash.&quot;[38]

<p>

In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened for free needle distribution.
Up to 300 syringes were given away each day. The original aim
had been to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for Zurich's own addicts.
But before long, the city was flooded with foreign addicts. The
number of needles exchanged grew to 12,000 per day before the
park was closed in 1992.[39]

<p>

After police closed Platzpitz, thousands of addicts relocated
a half-mile away to an abandoned railway station called &quot;Letten&quot;
where the Swiss experiment evolved into a grotesque spectacle.
Needle exchanges grew to 15,000 per day.[40]

<p>

Letten became a war zone between rival drug-dealing gangs. When
police tried to investigate crimes, they faced gunfire and their
cars were attacked and overturned by addicts. Local police arrested
a drug dealer after the fourth murder within just one month. Fellow
drug dealers stormed the police station demanding the man's release
or else they would blow-up the station.[41] He was released. In February,
1995, Swiss authorities closed Letten and moved the addicts to
government-sponsored centers and &quot;shooting galleries.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist, and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program. She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of pro-drug forces.

<p>

Opposition to NEPs and government-sponsored heroin experiments
has not been tolerated. Doctors who protested the initial NEP
were quashed by the media and pro-NEP physicians. Even a public
school teacher who warned her elementary students about the risks
of illicit drugs lost her job because of pressure from pro-drug
groups. One of her students had died from a heroin overdose.[42]

<p>

Switzerland has the highest heroin addiction rate (30,000 addicts)
and second highest HIV infection rate in Europe. It experiences
between 350 and 400 illicit drug overdose deaths each year.[43] To
address the growing problem without experiencing more &quot;Lettens,&quot;
the Swiss federal government started giving drugs to some addicts.
Switzerland has an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin,
morphine and methadone are given to addicts. The project, which
is scheduled to end in December, 1996, includes 700 addicts. Nearly
half of these addicts are HIV-positive. They are given free drugs
up to nine times a day. At night they are given heroin cigarettes
to be used at home. The cost is covered by health insurance or
the government.[44]

<p>

Dr. Andre Seidenberg, who runs a Swiss government-sponsored heroin
maintenance clinic for 100 addicts, believes that &quot;[h]eroin
consumption should be medicalized.&quot; He would &quot;like to
see heroin distribution trials in the U.S.&quot;[45]

<p>

The experiment's aim is to improve addict health, decrease criminal
activity, cut addicts off from drug dealers and stop abuse. Unfortunately,
the number of addicts is rising, and the experiment has not cut
illegal drug abuse and crime. It is also reported that police
officials in Bern and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug
consumers and dealers.[46]

<p>

On July 1, 1995, Swiss prison authorities began experimenting
with heroin-addicted inmates. Junkie prisoners with at least a
nine-month sentence who were age 20 and older were given heroin.
The rationale for this experiment was not announced.[47]

<p>

It appears that Switzerland is moving towards drug legalization.
The problems associated with NEPs and drug maintenance programs
have contributed to a shift in attitude toward drugs. On November
9, 1995, 94 Swiss executives called for the government to embrace
a &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy that includes an expansion
of the legal heroin distribution program. Six of the executives
were representatives of American companies in Switzerland: Andersen
Consulting AG, American Express, Polaroid, Atag Ernst &amp; Young
AG, Agfa Gevaert AG and Revisuisse Price Waterhouse AG.[48]

<p>

Roland C. Rasi, general manager of the Swiss Bank Corporation,
spoke for the executives when he announced the 11-part &quot;harm
reduction&quot; strategy. The strategy would shift funds from
enforcement to treatment such as medicalized heroin distribution.
It would also demand that Swiss companies employ drug addicts
in order to better integrate them into society. He described one
Swiss company that proudly hires auto mechanics who are addicted
to heroin.

<p>

In 1996, the Swiss people will decide whether to legalize now-illicit
drugs. The vote is expected to be close. Dr. Haller said she hopes
America does not follow Switzerland's drug example.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY ABOUT NEPS?</h3></center>

<p>

The Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which is supported
by pro-drug billionaire George Soros, has hosted several Capitol
Hill seminars to brief Congressional staff about NEPs. Arnold
Trebach, DPF's president and an American University professor,
said at one of the seminars that the &quot;[d]ominant morality
is that drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[49] Trebach
said the federal government's needle exchange policy is &quot;obscene.&quot;
He says the research supports NEPs.

<p>

In September, 1995, the National Academy of Sciences announced
the results of its government-requested study of NEPs in its work,
&quot;Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles
and Bleach&quot;.[50] The panel called for the Surgeon General to
rescind the present prohibition against applying any federal funds
to support NEPs.

<p>

Dr. Moses, the study chairman, said that data from a program in
New Haven showed that the rate of HIV infection in needles turned
into the exchange had decreased by one-third.[51]

<p>

Edward Kaplan, a professor with Yale University's School of Management,
evaluated the New Haven NEP. Kaplan, a statistician, says he is
not an NEP advocate, but that he believes NEPs are effective.[52]

<p>

Moses also cited a study in Tacoma, Washington, which found a
dramatic drop in blood-borne diseases after an NEP started. That
study examined hepatitis B infection rates among NEP participants
and found these people were eight times less likely than non-participants
to contract the blood-borne infection. This study is supposedly
analogous for HIV infections.[53]

<p>

Dr. Don Des Jarlais, research director of the Chemical Dependency
Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, endorses
NAS's recommendation. &quot;Anyone who's looking at it from the
perspective of preventing HIV transmission,&quot; said Des Jarlais,
&quot;comes to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more syringe
exchange.&quot;[54]

<p>

Dr. Peter Lurie led a CDC-funded study entitled, &quot;The Public
Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States
and Abroad,&quot; 1993. The study evaluated 23 of the programs
in 15 cities across four countries. His study was extensively
reported by the NAS. Lurie concluded that NEPs &quot;do not appear
to increase drug use and do prevent HIV infections in injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children.&quot;[55] His
700-page report calls for more federal funds for NEPs, repeal
of laws precluding purchase of syringes without a prescription,
and repeal of paraphernalia laws.

<p>

Lurie's analysis evaluated eight needle exchange studies that
measured drug use levels. Only one study showed an increase in
drug use. Three showed a decrease, and four found no change. Lurie
found 10 of 14 other studies that showed a reduction in HIV infection
among NEP participants.[56]

<p>

Lurie's report acknowledges numerous problems:

<p><ul>

<li>None of the studies reviewed were &quot;randomized; self-reported
behavior (subject to response bias) was often used as an outcome;
follow-up was often poor; and risk behavior was often only roughly
measured.&quot;[57]

<p>

<li>Lurie admits that he can't determine whether NEPs change the
community level of drug use, and he found no evidence that NEPs
increase use of drug treatment.[58]

<p>

<li>With regard to New Haven-type studies that test only syringes,
Lurie says, &quot;The validity of testing of syringes is limited.&quot;[59]

<p>

<li>On the key issue whether NEPs effect HIV infection rates,
Lurie states, &quot;Studies of the effect of NEPs on HIV infection
rates...probably cannot provide clear evidence that NEPs decrease
HIV infection rates. However, NEPs do not appear to be associated
with increased rates of HIV infection.&quot;[60]

</ul><p>

Even a 1993 General Accounting Office report concludes, &quot;Research
suggests [that syringe exchange programs have] promise as an AIDS
prevention strategy.&quot;[61] GAO's &quot;promise&quot; and Lurie's
&quot;cannot provide&quot; are not comforting conclusions.

<p>

On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier interviewed Ton Quadt,
the Dutch Drug Rehabilitation Coordinator. Quadt said, &quot;If
you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people don't have
to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is lessened.&quot;
Since the program began 10 years ago, the AIDS infection rate
of those in the program has dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent.[62]

<p>

Enthusiasm for NAS's recommendation to lift the ban on NEP funding
is not universally shared. Assistant Secretary of HHS Philip Lee
said, &quot;I have not been convinced on the evidence that has
been presented so far.&quot;[63] His skepticism is well founded.

<p>

On October 16, 1989, then Secretary of HHS Louis Sullivan hosted
a conference with 12 scientific and legal experts to discuss NEPs.[64]
The consultants recommended designing a new multi-center experiment
lasting three to five years. Unfortunately, that recommendation
was never undertaken.

<p>

Lead consultant Dr. Edward Brandt, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary
for Health and then the Executive Dean of the College of Medicine
of the University of Oklahoma, said, &quot;It will be extraordinarily
difficult to provide a scientifically rigorous answer [with regard
to NEPs slowing HIV infection without increasing drug abuse].&quot;[65]

<p>

Considering the NEPs at that time, Brandt concluded, &quot;It
is not possible to perform a meaningful evaluation of existing
programs because none were designed and initiated with a stringent
evaluation approach as a primary objective. Also, comparison among
programs through a multi-center evaluation is not possible because
of major differences in program objectives, design, and operation.&quot;[66]

<p>

Brandt's reservations are evidenced in key studies cited in the
NAS report. For example, the New Haven study is based on a mathematical
model using six independent variables to predict the rate of infection.
The unreliability of any of these variables invalidates the result.

<p>

The New Haven study includes key assumptions. For example, it
assumes that any needle returned by a participant other than the
one to whom it had been issued had been shared and that any needle
returned by a participant to whom it had been issued had been
unshared.[67] Both assumptions are suspect.

<p>

More than half (60 percent) of the New Haven participants dropped
out. Those who remained in the program were most likely motivated
to protect themselves from infection and the drop-outs likely
continued in their high-risk lifestyles.[68]

<p>

The Yale study fails to consider the seroconversion rates in addicts
and also relies on self-reporting by addicts, a group not known
for reliability.

<p>

Additionally, most NEPs provide a host of services which account
for some of the reported &quot;success.&quot; Outreach programs
without needle exchange have been shown to have some effect.

<p>

Dr. Janet Lapey, a medical doctor, studies NEPs for Drug Watch
International, a worldwide anti-drug organization.[69] She critiqued
NAS's report, saying:

<p><ul>

<li>It downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts. Some
resort to prostitution to fund their addiction. After all, non-needle
using crack addicts have high incidence of HIV.

<p>

<li>It cites a NEP study that had no increase in heroin use by
young users. This is not surprising given that NEPs and drug treatment
programs are usually populated by older drug users.

<p>

<li>It fails to interview neighborhood residents near NEPs to
see whether they approve of the effect of these programs.

<p>

<li>It trivializes the drug problem and provides no solutions
other than NEPs.

<p>

<li>It does not cite studies that measured HIV seroconversion
rates, the only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

<li>It does not measure whether drug use rises in NEP service
areas.

<p>

<li>It gives credibility to pro-needle studies and claims that
anti-needle studies are lacking. She says this biased use of statistics
is analogous to the tobacco companies using statisticians to support
their claim that smoking does not cause cancer.

</ul><p>

James L. Curtis, director of the Department of Psychiatry, Harlem
Hospital Center, wrote to New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
to recommend against NEPs. Curtis said, &quot;On the unproved
assumption that these programs prevent the spread of AIDS, addicts
are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with
illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding
the needle exchange program. Indeed the addict is partially financed
in continuing this self-damaging behavior.&quot;[70]

<p>

Finally, Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix House
Foundation, a drug treatment organization, said, &quot;I don't
think we have any data yet that is compelling that needle exchange
is making a difference.&quot;[71]

<p>

<center><h3>POLICY DILEMMA</h3></center>

<p>

California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have
authorized state-funded NEPs. He explained, the &quot;[r]eal question...is
whether the hoped-for reduction in needle-transmitted HIV infection
justifies sending a mixed message that will threaten to undermine
the credibility of all society's other anti-drug efforts -- especially
those preventive education efforts aimed at dissuading young audiences
from choosing to engage in drug use.&quot;[72]

<p>

The NAS agrees with Wilson's reservations. The report says, &quot;The
long-term effects of these programs on the level of illicit drug
use in communities are not yet known.&quot;[73] It acknowledges that
&quot;the act of giving a needle to an IDU has a powerful symbolism
that has sparked fears about the potential negative effects of
NEPs.&quot;[74]

<p>

Wilson recognizes the hyperbolic nature of a pro-needle policy.
&quot;If we are going to demand that young people exercise personal
responsibility,&quot; Wilson explained, and &quot;if we say that
they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, [then]
what are they to think, when in the next breath we give formal
sanction to a project which facilitates drug use?&quot;[75]

<p>

Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) opposes NEPs. He has said,
&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse, not to find
a cleaner, safer way to do it. Sure, IV drug abusers put themselves
at risk of AIDS through sharing needles and, certainly, we want
to slow its spread, but there are better ways than giving addicts
needles to do their drugs.&quot;[76]

<p>

Former national drug czar William Bennett agrees. NEPs are rejected
because they &quot;may also confound a community's anti-drug efforts
by implicitly condoning the intravenous use of illegal drugs.&quot;[77]

<p>

Lee Brown, who resigned as President Clinton's drug czar last
December, said the Office of National Drug Control Policy &quot;can
find no compelling reason for the administration to depart from
existing federal policy regarding needle exchange...[It] is neither
an adequate substitute for drug treatment nor a preferred means
of entry into drug treatment.&quot;[78]

<p>

Dr. Moses, chairman of the NAS panel, claims that NEPs &quot;often
result in more referrals to drug abuse treatment.&quot;[79] Evidence
to support this statement is minimal.

<p>

Most addicts in treatment are there because of a run-in with the
criminal justice system, not because of a run-in with an NEP.
According to Dr. Lapey, only 16 percent of NEP participants voluntarily
enter treatment.[80]

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the NAS panel, Dr. Herbert
D. Kleber and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, claim that the news media
have exaggerated NAS's findings and that NEPs &quot;are not the
panacea their supporters hope for....We personally believe that
the spread of HIV is better combated by the expansion and improvement
of drug abuse treatment rather than NEPs, and any government funds
should instead be used for that purpose.&quot;[81]

<p>

A myth associated with NEPs is that there is a long wait for treatment.
But according to Rosenthal, treatment candidates are not turned
away without help. There is a four-week waiting period for in-patient
treatment, but all candidates for admission are placed into a
&quot;day care&quot; program until such time as beds become available.
The &quot;day care&quot; unit lasts eight hours a day, and patients
can receive AIDS education and counseling.[82]

<p>

Rosenthal says that the greatest HIV threat among heterosexuals
is from sexual contact, not dirty needles. Clean needles will
not modify sexual behavior in the IDU. He explains that in the
New Haven study, fewer than a third of the participants employed
safe-sex practices most of the time.[83]

<p>

Dr. David Williams of the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research says that NEPs raise important ethical and moral
problems. &quot;People can be morally compelled,&quot; said Williams,
&quot;to support a lesser harm [drug abuse] in order to overcome
a greater harm [AIDS].&quot;[84]

<p>

In response to this philosophy, Rep. Rangel said, &quot;Supporters
of free needles may have their hearts in the right place, but
they have overlooked some very important considerations. These
people should enlist in efforts to expand comprehensive treatment
and rehabilitation services. Better to stop needle use altogether.&quot;[85]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO NEPS ENJOY?</h3></center>

<p>

The DPF and the NAS report say that the public favors NEPs. They
site a 1994 survey of 1,001 Americans by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C., which showed that 55 percent
favor implementing NEPs to reduce the spread of diseases such
as AIDS.[86]

<p>

The NAS report also profiles 23 other surveys with mixed results.
A 1988 <I>CBS News/New York Times</I> national poll found that
only 40 percent of Americans favor giving injection drug users
sterilized needles to slow down the spread of AIDS. A 1989 Media
General/<I>Associated Press</I> national poll found that half
of all Americans favor giving needles to addicts given the promise
that it will slow down the spread of AIDS.[87]

<p>

To measure America's commitment to NEPs, pollsters should set
a better context for the needle question. Perhaps the pollster
should ask, &quot;Would you support giving clean needles to drug
addicts to slow the spread of HIV, if you knew that this policy
shift might increase illicit drug use among America's youth?&quot;
Most likely, a majority of Americans would answer &quot;no.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES?</h3></center>

<p>

There is ample evidence that NEPs contribute to serious social
consequences for affected communities. For example, Regina Policastro,
an editor for a small Boston newspaper, wrote about her experience
with an NEP client. On November 11, 1991, &quot;a woman, having
received a state-provided free needle, engaged in prostitution,
and overdosed right in front of Policastro's child in her yard.&quot;[88]
Police did nothing because the woman had an authorized needle
identification card.

<p>

The plentiful supply of free needles has created a rogue practice.
The <I>Boston Herald</I> reports that Boston police were on the
lookout for a junkie who obtains allegedly AIDS-tainted needles
from a local NEP and then sells them for use as weapons. An unidentified
Boston officer overheard schoolkids say, &quot;It's better than
a gun because a gun you can do time for.&quot;[89] Similar scares
are common among New York City commuters.

<p>

Reverend Steve Peterson, pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church
in Madison, Wisconsin, expressed grave concern that Madison's
NEP -- which is only 250 feet from the school -- will put his
parish elementary school children at risk. He explained, &quot;Our
concern is that the needle exchange violates the spirit of the
drug-free zone.&quot;[90]

<p>

Milt McPike, a Madison high school principal, said, &quot;I have
a lot of concerns about stuff like that [NEPs] near schools.&quot;[91]
His job is to protect children, and their welfare must be balanced
with the need to control HIV among drug addicts.

<p>

Nancy Sosman knows all too well the problems NEPs bring to a community.
Sosman is a member of the Coalition for a Better Community, a
New York City citizens group opposed to NEPs. Since the Lower
East Side NEP began, she says, &quot;We've seen an increase in
dirty syringes on our streets, in our school yards and in our
parks....There has been a dramatic increase in the public display
of injecting drugs.... Brazen addicts shoplift, loot and steal
to buy drugs.&quot;[92] Sosman says that there are no controls on
the number of syringes given to an addict at the NEP and in fact,
she has seen NEP participants sell their syringes to buy drugs.
Even &quot;exchange workers have been photographed selling needles
away from the NEP.&quot;[93]

<p>

New Haven Police Chief Nicholas Pastore supports NEPs. Pastore
told ABC's Catherine Crier, &quot;The thing that I feel good about
is that that heroin addict is not preying on society, is not killing
somebody, not banging somebody on the head, not breaking into
your or my home. They're getting help....&quot;[94]

<p>

That's not Nancy Sosman's observation. She says that the NEP participants
fan out into her neighborhood &quot;to buy drugs, use drugs, sell
drugs and steal to get money for drugs. Our local police will
never be able to stop the trafficking of illegal drugs.&quot;[95]

<p>

Curtis contends that NEPs are bad medicine. &quot;The police make
no attempt to arrest addicts even though it still is illegal to
possess and inject illegal drugs. The drug dealers flock to these
neighborhoods in order to sell drugs which are openly used even
in broad daylight. These neighborhoods experience dramatic deterioration
with a corrupting influence on many candy stores, newspaper stands
and grocery stores. The sidewalks are littered with used and bloody
needles, syringes and empty vials of crack cocaine. Furthermore
some addicts make a business of selling these needles to purchase
other drugs such as cocaine which they prefer.[96]

<p>

Curtis continues, &quot;Addicts commonly support their habit by
selling drugs to other addicts, by recruiting new addicts, and
by prostitution or by exchanging sex for drugs, all of which behavior
contributes to spread of the AIDS virus.&quot;[97]

<p>

NEPs &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order,&quot; the Harlem
doctor says. &quot;They are poor medicine and poor public health
practice. In fact, these programs constitute a reckless experiment
with human beings, totally unregulated by research guidelines
ordinarily applied to protect human subjects from potentially
dangerous research.&quot;[98]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

On April 2, 1995, Saudi Arabia beheaded three drug smugglers.
A little earlier, Singapore did the same.[99] There are no NEPs in
Riyadh and few addicts on Singapore's streets. Neither country
has an AIDS epidemic.

<p>

If America seeks to reduce drug use, it must stop coddling addicts.
Drug abusers need treatment, not encouragement to keep injecting
deadly drugs. Although AIDS will kill some, most will die from
drug overdoses or other high-risk behaviors.

<p>

Congressman Rangel tells public officials not to fool themselves
about NEPs. &quot;Can police honestly enforce laws against people
who use 'government-issue' needles when the government is the
very source of the tool to commit the offense?&quot;[100]

<p>

The growing needle exchange debate is really about drug legalization.
Pro-drug forces have nurtured a cadre of scientists and others
to give their fight the appearance of legitimacy. But they have
yet to satisfy the strict, scientific requirements set forth in
the law.

<p>

Before the federal government boards this <I>Titanic</I>, it should
sponsor research like that suggested by former Secretary of HHS
Sullivan or even embrace some of Dr. Lurie's recommendations for
methodologically-sound NEP studies. Then, if the evidence satisfies
the requirements of Congress, the lifting of the funding ban could
be reconsidered.

<p>

In the meantime, missteps with the NEP policy could lead the nation
down a tragic path. NEPs provide no guarantee to solve the AIDS
epidemic nor stop the drug scourge.

<title>THE IMPACT OF ROMER v. EVANS</title>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF <i>ROMER v. EVANS</i></h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

On May 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
Colorado's Amendment 2 to the state constitution, which had prohibited
the state and local jurisdictions from adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to minority protection statutes.  The amendment, approved by a
majority of voters in 1992,  was drafted after several Colorado
cities -- Denver, Boulder, Aspen and Aurora -- had enacted statutes
adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the list of protected
civil rights, thus affording homosexuals a vehicle to use civil
rights law in discrimination claims.

<p>

Amendment 2's sponsors viewed this &quot;special&quot; protection
to homosexuals as a threat to those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong and not a valid category for heightened protection heretofore
reserved for genuinely-disadvantaged minorities.

<p>

In a 6-3 ruling,[1] the court disagreed, saying that Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution because the state could not prove a &quot;rational
basis,&quot; that is, a &quot;legitimate legislative end&quot;
for denying homosexuals &quot;the possibility of protection across
the board.&quot;  Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier
ruling of the trial court and the Colorado Supreme Court in striking
down Amendment 2.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS RULING?</h3></center>

<p>

It sweeps aside the right of the people to amend their own state
Constitution, at least with regard to homosexuality.  The court,
in effect, said that it, and it alone, will determine which groups
can be considered &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they lose a statewide
ballot issue.  By this reasoning, any state that has outlawed
polygamy has &quot;disadvantaged&quot; polygamists by making it
unlawful for them to enact legalization of polygamy at the local
level.  In his forceful dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia addressed
this particular absurdity:  &quot;Has the court concluded that
the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern
of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality
is not?&quot;

<p>

Homosexual activists now have a guarantee that their opponents
will be prevented ever from rescinding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
laws at the state level.  Homosexual activists can work to get
&quot;gay rights&quot; laws on the books, but no group of voters
is allowed ever to rescind them at the state level.

<p>

The court's decision has not technically created a brand new class
of specially-protected citizens:  homosexuals.  But no other group
has that kind of heightened protection except for those that have
been designated as &quot;suspect&quot; classes in need of special
protections.  No court -- including the current Supreme Court
-- has ever designated homosexuals as a &quot;suspect class.&quot;

<p>

The cultural impact may be greater than the legal implications.
<I>The New York Times'</I> lead headline on May 21 proclaimed,
&quot;Gay Rights Laws Can't Be Banned, High Court Rules.&quot;
Although technically the ruling only applies to state laws that
bar passage of new gay rights laws, <I>Romer v. Evans</I> was
hailed as a repudiation of any efforts to delay consolidation
of the homosexual agenda.  Within hours of the decision, the Supreme
Court's ruling was cited by an attorney in a lesbian parenting
dispute in Florida, who proclaimed that the high court had outlawed
the use of sexual orientation as a factor in child custody cases.
The court did no such thing, but we can expect more of the same
sweeping interpretations to be used to sway a reeling culture
that has been force-fed homosexual propaganda for the past decade.
As Suzanne Goldberg of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
exulted after the decision, &quot;Because the court so clearly
rejected anti-gay sentiment, it plants the seeds for future decisions
rejecting anti-gay decisions in many other areas.&quot;[2]

<p>

<h4>Wasn't this a victory for tolerance of gay and lesbian people?</h4>

<p>

No. Homosexuals have achieved enormous tolerance and are now
seeking state-mandated acceptance of their behavior.  The <I>Romer
</I> decision was a defeat of the Colorado people's desire to create
a level playing field with regard to civil rights.  A majority
of Coloradans passed Amendment 2 so that people who disagree with
the homosexual activist movement would not be subjected to discrimination
in &quot;gay rights&quot; jurisdictions such as Aspen, Denver,
Boulder and Aurora.  As Justice Scalia put it in his dissent,
&quot;The only denial of equal treatment [the Court] contends
homosexuals have suffered is this:  They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution.&quot;  He also
said, &quot;The Court has no business imposing upon all Americans
the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members
of this institution are selected, pronouncing that animosity toward
homosexuality...is evil.&quot;  Note that Justice Scalia did not
say animosity toward homosexuals.  In singling out the behavioral
characteristic in question, Scalia correctly reflected the Christian
view of loving the sinner but hating the sin. The state should
never give preferential treatment on the basis of  behavior that
has been discouraged in all major cultures for thousands of years
and by all major religions.

<p>

<h4>The court cited some previous case law in its decision.  Isn't
this a well-founded ruling?</h4>

<p>

The court, indeed, cited some cases in which legal protections
have been extended to particular groups that are not officially
&quot;suspect&quot; classes but are &quot;identifiable&quot; groups.
But, overall, the opinion was so legally impoverished that it
had to be fashioned, as Scalia remarked,  &quot;so long on emotive
utterance and so short on relevant legal citation.&quot;  The
court's opinion fails to address <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>, the
1986 case in which the court ruled that there is no constitutional
protection for homosexuality.  So if it is legal to criminalize
the act of sodomy, then why can't a state decline to extend special
protections for a class of people whose only defining characteristic
is that they practice sodomy?

<p>

<h4>Doesn't Amendment 2 take away the civil rights of homosexuals?</h4>

<p>

No. It just prohibits the addition of special rights that others
do not have.  As Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;The Colorado Amendment
does not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favored for
many reasons -- for example, because they are senior citizens
or members of racial minorities.  But it prohibits them favored
status <I>because of their homosexual conduct</I>....(italics
in original)&quot;

<p>

In other words, homosexuals were in no danger of losing any civil
rights despite press accounts that incorrectly say that Amendment
2 &quot;strips homosexuals of their civil rights.&quot;  They
just could not gain new rights based solely on their predilection
to practice homosexuality.

<p>

<h4>The court ruled that no rational basis could be found to justify
Amendment Two.  What's wrong with that?</h4>

<p>

Ignoring numerous examples of how &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
protections can be wielded against ordinary citizens, the court
essentially concluded that the Colorado people's sole reason for
enacting Amendment 2 was an &quot;animus&quot; toward homosexuals.
This means the court is calling more than 800,000 Coloradans
&quot;hate-filled bigots&quot; and declaring that they had no
rational basis whatever for approving the amendment.  It also
means that God-fearing people in all major religions who believe
homosexuality is wrong are now deemed to be outside the realm
of decency.  This is a sweeping condemnation of the deeply-held
beliefs of billions of people around the world.

<p>

<h4>The court said that gay rights are not &quot;special rights.&quot;
Why do you say they are?</h4>

<p>

Homosexuals have the same rights all citizens have.  They have
the same redress that all citizens have if they face discrimination.
They want an extra level of preferential treatment that would
allow them to cite their homosexuality anytime they do not get
what they want -- a job, a promotion, whatever.  People who commit
adultery do not have such a right.  People who abuse drugs do
not have such a right.  In fact, nobody else has the right to
insist that their behavior is irrelevant to an employer.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; laws are a massive club with which to beat everyone
else into acceding to homosexuals' increasingly strident demands
for mandated acceptance.  As social critic David Frum writes,
&quot;Antidiscrimination law may invoke the language of rights
and freedoms, but its true function is to shrink the ambit of
freedom in order to promote equality.  The landlady who does not
want to rent an apartment to a tenant whose habits and friends
frighten her; the hardware store owner who wants to hire someone
he regards as trustworthy -- new antidiscrimination rules shrink
even further the liberty of these people to use their property
as they see fit or to hire whom they like.&quot;[3]

<p>

<h4>Can you give some examples of this?</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>In Ontario, Canada, the mayor of Hamilton was personally fined
$5,000 for running afoul of that city's human rights ordinance
that includes sexual orientation.  His crime?  He declined to
issue a special proclamation that the city would celebrate a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;[4] The mayor in no way threatened the rights of
homosexuals, but was personally punished for failing to use his
city office to celebrate homosexuality.

<p>

<li>The Boy Scouts of America have been under severe legal attack
by homosexual activists in states that have &quot;gay rights&quot;
laws.[5] Their crime? They updheld their 80-year-old moral tradition
that bans openly homosexual men from becoming leaders over young
boys.

<p>

<li>In San Fernando, California, Superior Court Judge John Farrell
was told by other judges in 1995 that he should quit his activities
as a parent volunteer for the Boy Scouts or resign from the bench.
His crime?  The Scouts &quot;discriminate&quot; on the basis
of sexual orientation, which is a protected category under California's
&quot;gay rights&quot; law. A proposed judicial rule would also
ban participation by judges in any group that discriminates on
the basis of sexual orientation.  So Farrell's volunteer work
with the Boy Scouts is a violation of  &quot;judicial ethics.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In Seattle, Washington, a small-business employer, Bryan Griggs,
was hauled before the city's human rights board.  His crime?
He allegedly violated the rights of a homosexual employee whom
he had laid off.  The employer did not know the employee was gay.
The employer had had to lay off the entire staff during a downturn.
The employee's claim to &quot;discrimination&quot; consisted
of his employer's playing Christian talk radio on which ads for
the business were running (this constituted a &quot;hate&quot;
crime), posting a letter from a Congresswoman regarding the 
gays-in-the-military issue, and having a note on his desk that he wrote 
to himself regarding homosexuals and adoption of children.  After spending
thousands of dollars defending himself, Griggs saw the case finally
dismissed for lack of substance.[7]  But the point was made to other
employers --  mess with any homosexual employee or would-be employee
and you will be legally harassed.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

In striking down Amendment 2, the court ignored a wealth of case
law, twisted the meaning of the Constitution, ignored the reality
of homosexual behavior, and intervened heavily on the side of
homosexual activism against those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong.

<p>

Justice Scalia summed up the case by writing, &quot;Today's opinion
has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends
to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable
provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive
sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment.  Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

In the face of an increasingly strident homosexual rights movement,
the court has declared war on the beliefs of millions of ordinary
Americans.

<p>

This is the real message of &quot;gay rights&quot; -- affirm what
we do or we will use legal means to harass you.  Americans who
want to stay neutral will soon find that this is a stance that
homosexual activists -- and now the Supreme Court -- will not
afford them.

<h2>STORM CLOUDS OR A DRIZZLE?<br>
A LOOK AT A NEW STUDY ON<br>
CHILD CARE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

The National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) recently released the initial
findings of a new child care study &quot;and fired the shot
heard round the world.&quot;  In this long-term study that plans
to track the effects of child care on children's development
through 7 years of age, the results of phase one rendered a body
blow to mothers choosing to provide full-time care for their babies.
Within days, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> headlines read &quot;Child
Care No Risk to Infant-Mother Ties,&quot; and <I>The Guardian</I>
reported, &quot;Child Care Report Backs Working Mums.&quot;
Meanwhile, mothers here and abroad tried to make sense of a study
that implied &quot;other care&quot; was as good as &quot;mother
care,&quot; at least in terms of a baby's attachment relationship
with his or her mother.

<p>

<center><h3>THE MEANING OF ATTACHMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Just what is meant by the term &quot;attachment?&quot;
In his l969 book <I>Attachment,</I> the late British psychiatrist
John Bowlby wrote about the centrality of the baby's attachment
to his mother which he believed was &quot;the foundation stone
of personality.&quot;[1] Bowlby added that a &quot;young child's
hunger for his mother's love and presence is as great as
his hunger for food&quot; and that &quot;her absence inevitably
generates a powerful sense of loss and anger.&quot;[2] Freud would
agree with Bowlby on the importance of the mother or mothering
figure in the child's early life.  Writing in <I>An Outline
of Psychoanalysis</I>, he described the relationship a child has
with his mother as &quot;unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and strongest love
object and as the prototype of all later love relations -- for
both sexes.&quot;[3]

<p>

The formation of attachment -- or
the emotional bond between a mother and her baby -- is a critical
developmental milestone during the first year of life.  In fact,
psychologists Alan Sroufe and Everett Waters call this enduring
bond a &quot;psychological tether which binds infant and caregiver
together.&quot;[4] From his earliest attachments, first to mother,
then to father, a baby develops a sense of his own worthiness,
conscience, and the capacity for intimacy in later significant
relationships.[5] He also learns -- generally by 12 months of age
-- whether or not he can trust his mother to meet his
physical and emotional needs.  If his mother is sensitive, consistent
and responsive in meeting his myriad needs, he is likely to be
securely attached to her.  If she is unpredictable in her ministrations
or rejecting, then the  mother and her baby will tend to develop
an insecure emotional bond or attachment.

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Just what did the NICHD-supported
scientists discover about the effects of child care on a baby's
attachment to his mother?  The study, which has followed 1,300
families at l0 different sites since 1991, found that child care,
<I>in and of itself</I>, does not harm the baby's emotional
bond with his mother.[6] Indeed, the researchers state that the
type of child care, the quality of care, the number of hours per
week in care and even the age the baby enters care do not create
an insecure attachment.  With this ammunition, the media heralded
the current study as a challenge to, or even  repudiation of,
earlier infant day care research, as well as a blanket endorsement
of child care for employed mothers.  Upon examination, however,
the NICHD study does not quite deliver the broadside to on-site
mothering that the media contends.  In fact, it contains some
important caveats to the central finding that child care neither
helps nor hurts the baby's attachment relationship to his
mother.

<p>

For example, the NICHD researchers
found that if a baby was unlucky enough to have an &quot;insensitive
mother,&quot; then the child care variables mattered.  Thus,
the &quot;dual risk&quot; of an insensitive mother <I>plus</I> 
poor quality child care, <I>or</I> inconsistency of care,
<I>or</I> more than l0 hours per week in care increased the likelihood
that a baby would be insecurely attached to his mother. While
the study did not contain a profile of the insensitive mother
(whether she was divorced, employed, stressed, and lonely, or
married, at home, financially strapped, and depressed), it did
find, as one would expect, that a sensitive mother who was well-adjusted
psychologically was more likely to have a securely attached child
than her insensitive counterpart.

<p>

The NICHD study also found significant
gender differences in terms of the effects of child care on attachment
security.  Infant boys who spent <I>more than</I> 30 hours per
week in child care were at risk for insecure attachment while
girls who spent <I>less than</I> 10 hours per week in care were
&quot;somewhat&quot; more likely to be insecurely attached
to their mothers.  Psychologist Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State
University, one of the study's researchers, explained these
particular findings this way:  &quot;Separation might prove
stressful for boys, but girls who are at home with mothers extensively
may become too close and enmeshed.&quot;[7] Belsky's interpretation
prompted <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Suzanne Fields to write,
&quot;In other words, mommies who spend a lot of time with their
infant daughters are dangerous to their daughters' mental
health.&quot;[8]

<p>

Additionally, the NICHD study found
that a mother's belief system affected her baby's
attachment security. Those mothers who believed that maternal
employment actually &quot;benefited&quot; their babies'
development placed their children in child care earlier and for
more hours than did those mothers who held &quot;weaker&quot;
beliefs.  Those mothers who felt child care was harmful to their
children but used it anyway tended to have more securely attached
children than their less anxious counterparts.

<p>

How to explain this apparent conundrum?
While some may wonder about the negative psychological implications
of being riven by guilt and anxiety, Belsky suggests, &quot;It
may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and
able to monitor the quality of care.  Being cavalier about the
effects of work turns out to be risky.&quot;[9]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD FINDINGS AND THE ONGOING INFANT DAY CARE 
DEBATE</h3></center>

<p>

Why were the NICHD findings so provocative?
The findings, as <I>The Guardian</I> so aptly stated,
&quot;go to the heart of an enduringly bitter debate&quot;
about the effects of child care on a baby's emotional security
during that critical first year of life.[10] This debate affects
a huge number of American families and touches on an emotion-laden
issue:  How best to raise America's children.  Not only
do more than half the mothers of infants under one year of age
participate in the work force, but in this particular study more
than half of the infants were in some form of child care for more
than 30 hours per week by the end of their first year.[11] In addition,
the NICHD study flies in the face of accumulated evidence since
the early 1980s, which  found that placing a baby in substitute
care, even good quality care, for 20 or more hours per week during
that critical first year, not only increased the baby's
risk of insecure attachment to mother and/or father, but also
was often the harbinger of behavioral and emotional problems later
on.

<p>

<center><h3>EARLIER INFANT DAY CARE RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

For example, in l988 researchers
Jay Belsky and Michael Rovine evaluated the effects of child care
on 491 infants and found that those who experienced 20 or more
hours per week of nonmaternal care during the first year of life
were more likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their
mothers than those who spent less time in care.  In l989,
psychologist  Alison Clarke-Stewart found similar results in
her analysis of 1,247 infants.[12]

<p>

When researchers looked at the long-term
effects of infant day care, they often discovered that early entry
into day care signaled later behavioral and emotional problems.
Evidence from as early as the mid-1970s indicates that children
who began child care during their first year were more physically
and verbally aggressive with peers and adults, less cooperative,
and less able to handle frustrations than those who started care
thereafter.[13] For instance, a l985 study at the University of North
Carolina found that children who entered child care during their
first year were more likely to &quot;hit, kick and push other
children&quot; as kindergartners and first-graders than those
who began care later on.[14] In light of these and other findings,
it is not surprising that a full scale ideological war is in progress,
or that the current study produced such a rousing and widespread
media response.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT REPORT</h3></center>

<p>

As a psychologist who has followed
the child care debate since the early 1980s, what struck me about
the current study were the findings that never made the newspapers,
namely these statistics:

<p><ul>

<li>About 42 percent of male infants were insecurely attached to 
their mothers when they worked more than 30 hours per week.  (This 
is a hefty number in light of proven male vulnerability to psychological 
and behavioral problems).

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their babies with insensitive 
caregivers, 56 percent of the babies were insecurely attached -- an 
obvious double-whammy for the babies.

<p>

<li>If insensitive mothers placed their babies in child care for more 
than 10 hours per week, between 46-48 percent were insecurely attached 
to their mothers.  (Evidence that simply placing a child in day care 
for more hours does not eradicate the need for time with mother, even 
when she's relatively insensitive.)

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their children in more than one 
child care situation, 44 percent were insecurely attached.  (This 
shows that inconsistent care coupled with an unresponsive mother is 
hazardous to attachment security.)

</ul><p>

These statistics gain significance
when we realize that in cross-cultural attachment research using
the Strange Situation-- the laboratory experiment developed by
psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues and used by researchers
in the NICHD study to determine attachment security -- about 35
percent of the infants are insecurely attached to their mothers.[15]
In most of the analyses in the current study, the rate of attachment
insecurity among the children is between 42 and 56 percent.  This
difference is not insignificant when translated into emotional
insecurity in children's lives.

<p>

<center><h3>MALE VULNERABILITY</h3></center>

<p>

The findings about infant male attachment
insecurity are particularly noteworthy since previous research
has found that males are generally more vulnerable than females
to a host of physiological and psychological ills.  Not only are
males more susceptible than females to speech, learning and behavioral
difficulties, but they are three to five times more likely to
have reading problems.[16] In the arena of emotional disorders, more
males than females suffer from night terrors, hyperactivity, and
autism.  Moreover, adolescent males have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia, delinquency, academic underachievement, and suicide
than females.  According to psychologist Dee Shepherd-Look, &quot;Until
adulthood, it is difficult to find a pathological condition in
which the incidence among females is higher than among males.&quot;[17]

<p>

What happens when mother returns
to the work force?  Researchers Belsky and Rovine found that,
in terms of attachment security, if a mother worked more than
35 hours per week during the baby's first year of life,
50 percent of the sons were more likely to be insecurely attached
to their fathers.[18] A 1987 study by P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and
Margaret Owen found similar results.[19] Also, studies of elementary
school children have discovered that boys are more likely than
girls to suffer when mother works outside the home.[20] In light
of earlier and current research, it is reasonable to suggest that
mothers of sons think long and hard about working full-time during
their babies' vulnerable first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THE INSENSITIVE MOTHER</h3></center>

<p>

As for the insensitive mother and
her baby, the NICHD researchers found that high quality child
care did not entirely compensate for a mother's relative
unresponsiveness.  This was the opposite of what they expected
to find.  In other words, if a baby had an insensitive mother,
the researchers hypothesized that it would be better for that
baby to spend more time away from her in the care of a sensitive
caregiver.  But this did not, in fact, prove true.  Instead, if
the insensitive mother worked part-time rather than full-time,
then her baby was more likely to be securely attached to her (65
percent vs. 56 percent secure, respectively).  This finding supports
the idea that high quality day care does not compensate for mother
care, even when a mother is relatively insensitive.

<p>

It's important to pause at
this point and ask ourselves just how many mothers, some of whom
may be  practicing &quot;defensive careerism,&quot; are able
to be genuinely sensitive and responsive to their babies'
cries and bids for attention, particularly if these mothers are
harried or super-stressed by the multiple demands of their lives?
How is a mother to know for sure that she is creating a secure
emotional bond with her baby as she goes off to work for 10-12
hours per day?  Even this study found that working more than 10
hours per week (that's a mere  two hours per day) puts
the child of the insensitive mother at risk for insecure attachment.
Unless a woman is confident that she is a sensitive mother who
is creating a strong, secure emotional bond with her baby, it
may be wise to err on the side of quantity rather than quality
time during the baby's first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA</h3></center>

<p>

A careful review of the NICHD study,
arouses some very real concerns.  First, 20 of the 25 researchers
are women.  Since all scientific study is, to some extent, contaminated
by bias, there is reason to wonder just how many of these researchers
relied on day care for their own children and may, therefore,
have a personal stake in the report's outcome.  In other words,
is the methodology or even the interpretation of the data, in
this instance, subject to serious bias?  When I posed this question
to psychologist Martha Cox of the University of North Carolina,
one of the study's researchers, she admitted, &quot;Most
of us have used early and extensive child care for our children.&quot;
She said that both of her children had been in child care since
they were two months of age.  But she was quick to add, &quot;If
we tried to get value-free researchers, we wouldn't have
anybody doing research.&quot;

<p>

That this issue is not a red herring
is evident in the article written by Dr. Jay Belsky for <I>Zero
to Three</I> in l986 that set off a firestorm among some
of the researchers involved in the NICHD study.  In this article
entitled &quot;Infant Day Care:  A Cause for Concern,&quot;
Belsky not only reviewed disturbing evidence on the effects of
early and extensive child care but admitted that scientists must
struggle to maintain an open mind when it comes to controversial
and emotion-laden issues. He stated, &quot;I am well aware, too,
that my <I>gender</I> and the more or less <I>traditional nature
of my family structure</I> (italics mine) could bias the reading
of the evidence.&quot;[21]

<p>

So how did the NICHD researchers
attempt to control for bias?  While Cox stated that the data were
coded in a central location (The University of Washington in Seattle)
and not by the individual researchers themselves, Belsky told
me in an interview that those who coded  the data knew this was
a study of child care.  &quot;If they erred, they erred on the
side of finding attachment security,&quot; he said.  Then he
added, &quot;If there's bias it could be the readiness
to embrace the finding that kids aren't affected by child
care -- to give the green light to child care.  If this were a
study of cocaine use and researchers found the same effects, who
would say cocaine use doesn't matter?&quot;

<p>

Additionally, the study examined
a mother's attitudes about the &quot;benefit&quot; of
maternal employment on her baby's development and found
that mothers torn by guilt and anxiety were more likely to have
securely attached babies.  Just what are we to surmise from this?
Does this finding imply that it is okay for mothers to be in
turmoil over their employment decisions as long as their babies
are emotionally secure?  As a therapist who works almost exclusively
with women, I would  suggest that it is hardly a positive for
mothers to have their hearts divided.  Over time, guilt and anxiety
tend to produce depression, and no child profits from having a
depressed mother.

<p>

I am also concerned that the NICHD
researchers examined a mother's attitudes when her baby
was one month old.  Mothers often dramatically change their attitudes
toward separation from their babies over the course of the first
six months after delivery.  In my own doctoral research on adult
attachment and attitudes toward employment conducted at Georgetown
University, I interviewed 89 new mothers two to three days after
they had delivered their firstborn infants and then again four
months later.[22] Not surprisingly, I found that over the course
of four months a number of the women had changed their attitudes
about leaving their babies to return to work.  It was not unusual
for them to say that they had fallen in love with their babies
and could not bear to leave them.

<p>

Finally, since much of the attachment
research using the Strange Situation has looked at a baby's
attachment relationship with his parents when he was 12 months
old, and then again at 18 months to track the stability of the
attachment classification, just why did the NICHD researchers
elect to study the babies at l5 months of age? If this &quot;largest,
longest, and most comprehensive study yet&quot; is to challenge
and even repudiate earlier findings, then why not examine the
mother-baby attachment relationship at the usual 12-month marker?
When asked about this, Dr. Cox said, &quot;We were using other
measures at 15 months and so using the Strange Situation then
was optimal for everything.&quot;  She added, &quot;There's
lots of stability (in attachment patterns) in the 12-18 month
range, though there's always a possibility that things
could change developmentally.&quot;  When asked if this difference
in the research design might have affected the study's
outcome, Belsky replied that the researchers had debated this
issue and reached a &quot;compromise solution.&quot;  Yet one
is left with a feeling of nagging doubt.  In the changing world
of infancy and the forging of emotional bonds, do these three
extra months make a significant difference?

<p>

<center><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3></center>

<p>

Whatever questions the study raises,
in the final analysis, it affirms the importance of mothering.
The study shows that  a mother's sensitivity to her baby
is the most significant predictor of attachment security.  While
it is obviously better for a baby to have a sensitive, well-adjusted
mother, even the presence of an insensitive mother is important
for her baby's attachment security.  Moreover, high quality
care does not eradicate a baby's need for extensive time
with his mother even when  she is relatively unresponsive to his
cues and bids for attention.  In fact, for the insensitive mother
and her child, the NICHD  study affirms the value of part-time
over full-time employment.  Additionally, it  found  that a mother's
attitudes toward employment are crucial in terms of her baby's
attachment security.

<p>

But does this NICHD study categorically
endorse &quot;other care&quot; for babies as the media would
have us believe?  Does it relieve the employed mother's
guilt?  Are we to assume that placing babies in early and extensive
child care carries no significant risk?  As we ponder the findings
of the NICHD study, we need to remember that those researchers
have looked at only one aspect of child development -- attachment.
They have yet to examine children's development in terms
of aggression, social skills, health, capacity for empathy or
intellectual competence.  These qualities will be examined when
the children are 3 and 4 years old.  Since aggression is well
established by age 3 and has been one of the long-term effects
of early and extensive child care, the researchers may find that
the insecurely attached children in this  study are more likely
to be disobedient to adults and bully their peers.  Or they may
not.  Unfortunately, it will be several years before we learn
what these early and provocative findings mean.

<p>

As Belsky said when interviewed,
&quot;It's too early to tell. In my early observations,
lots of child care posed a risk factor. In this study, even more
than 10 hours of care was important. It's the most vulnerable
children who are the most adversely affected.&quot;  In terms
of policy implications, he added, &quot;To presume that the
data carry policy implications at this point is to make decisions
after reading the first chapter of a novel.&quot;  Then changing
his image, Belsky said, &quot;The study shows it's drizzling
now.  It could be a cloud cover or it could be the leading edge
of a storm. We just don't know.&quot;

<p>

As we await later results, we would
do well to look beyond the realm of social science research  to
the cultural landscape where we find other evidence -- disquieting
evidence -- that also merits our consideration.  The indicators
are that children in this country are not faring well.  Increasingly,
we read about acts of rage and violence committed by young children
-- children seemingly without a conscience.  For example, a 6-year-old
boy was recently arrested in Richmond, California, for the attempted
murder of a 6-month-old baby.  (Ironically, his mother works in
a child care agency.)  In Englewood, Colorado, a 10-year-old boy
is being held for fatally beating a 19-month-old girl he was babysitting.
In Lucerne Valley, California, two boys and girls, ages 11 and
12, were arrested for attempting to murder their teacher.[23] Whence
this anger and rage?  How can we begin to understand such violence
in the hearts of some of our nation's children except in
the context of their intimate parental attachments?

<p>

As we continue to make our daily
decisions about how best to rear our very young children and attempt
to understand the results of  scientific study, it may be that
we are doing so, not in a drizzle or even in a storm, but in the
all-too-quiet eye of a hurricane.

<h2>FEDERAL DRUG WAR<br>
IGNORING GREAT ALLY:<br>
FAITH-BASED TREATMENT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Treating addicts is an important part of the nation's drug war.
When abusers are in treatment they aren't committing crimes, and
after treatment some never return to their formerly destructive
ways. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of addicts seek treatment,
usually as part of their punishment, and treatment programs are
limited. More significantly, the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs.

<p>

Faith-based drug treatment programs consistently produce the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country. In spite of high success
rates and zero cost to taxpayers, the government has often stiff-armed
these programs.

<p><ul>

<li>The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) tried
to shut down faith-based Victory Outreach, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts. Outreach founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;[1] Garcia claims a 70 percent success rate
for his privately funded program, while government programs cure
less than 10 percent of their clients and cost hundreds of dollars
per day. He explained, &quot;We believe that sin is the reason
why people take drugs....We believe that the drug addict is a
slave to sin, not to drugs. We believe that drug addiction is
a spiritual problem, and that Jesus Christ is the solution.&quot;[2]
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, &quot;Freddie Garcia has achieved
results that are almost unheard of....All too often the bureaucracy
has tried to put folks like Freddie out of business because they
don't have a Ph.D., or they don't fill out the paperwork right...instead,
they run very inexpensive neighborhood programs that feel more
comfortable to people on the street.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>Teen Challenge of South Texas was almost shut down by TCADA.
Like Garcia's organization, Teen Challenge is a faith-based program
with cure rates of 70 to 85 percent.[4] Teen Challenge has been successfully
treating drug addicts since its founding in 1958. TCADA said that
to get a treatment license Teen Challenge must employ psychiatrists,
masters of social work, certified counselors and other professionals.
It must also embrace a &quot;medical&quot; model for treatment of drug abuse
which presumes that addiction is a disease.[5] But in contrast, Teen
Challenge views addiction as a sin symptomatic of a life out-of-touch
with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Under a &quot;religious&quot;
model, drug addiction is viewed as eminently curable through the
teachings of Christ.

</ul><p>

Robert L. Woodson, Sr., founder and president of the National
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, says faith-based programs
aren't looking for government funds. They &quot;just [want] to
be left to do [their] Christian work...but...officials...insist
you've got to be certified by the state and comply with rules,
like having a 36-inch door rather than a 34-inch door....The government
officials cling to their regulations, and kids who might be rescued
are sleeping in crack houses or under...bridges.&quot;[6]

<p>

Faith-based programs may not work for everyone, but they are part
of a diverse range of programs fighting addiction. That's why
on May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George W. Bush set up a task force
to study how faith-based community service programs can further
help. The 17-member task force's goal &quot;is to identify ways
that Texas can create an environment where faith-based organizations
will flourish and meet the needs of people in crisis with focused
and effective aid,&quot;[7] said Bush. The task force includes Victory
Outreach's Freddie Garcia and J. Herbert Meppelink, the executive
director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the entire nation showing how 
financially-strapped governments can encourage faith-based programs that 
have a long history of meeting critical needs. Unfortunately, the faith 
community and government regulators often disagree over the nature of 
the problem.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT</h3></center>

<p>

There are two major schools of thought about the root causes of
drug addiction. Some argue that it is a disease and should be
treated as such. Others say drug addicts are people whose lives
have gone wrong.

<p>

Many treatment specialists would agree that drug use leading to
addiction is a moral choice and that long-term abuse has physiological
implications. After all, smoking the first marijuana cigarette
or snorting the first line of cocaine is a choice, and there is
medical evidence that increased abuse can lead to addiction which
can have serious, disease-like consequences.

<p>

Hiring a prostitute is analogous to using illicit drugs because
both actions begin with a moral choice and both may cause serious
damage. The sex customer makes a moral decision by hiring a prostitute,
and as a result he may contract a sexually-transmitted disease
(STD) and contribute to crime and to the destruction of his family
and reputation.

<p>

The sex offender can be treated for his disease (the STD), but
unless something is done about his morally-based decision-making
mechanism, he may continue to engage in high-risk and morally
depraved behavior. He needs help to heal both his sexual disease
and his decision-making mechanism.

<p>

Drug addicts also need help with the adverse health consequences
of abuse and with making moral choices. But not everyone agrees
with the dual nature of addiction and its treatment.

<p>

At least one government agency adheres to the disease model. Since
its establishment in 1974, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) has been the lead federal agency for drug abuse research,
looking for causes and effects of drug abuse. It oversees 90 percent
of all funding for drug addiction research nationwide such as
medication research and the new and noninvasive positron emission
tomography (PET) technology which makes it possible to see where
illicit drugs affect the brain. NIDA says that drug addiction
is &quot;a complex disease that can be successfully addressed
by scientific research.&quot;[8]

<p>

There are many non-government treatment specialists who agree.
David E. Smith, a longtime treatment expert and founder of the
Haight Asbury Free Clinics in San Francisco, says that the medical
protocol of his clinics is &quot;the study and treatment of addictive
disease, characterized by the compulsive use of drugs, often with
major physical, psychological and behavioral consequences....Anybody
is liable for addiction, although some are more liable than others.
If your father is an alcoholic, then your son has a four times
higher probability of developing the disease.&quot;[9] This view
suggests that alcohol addiction is genetically predisposed, an
as yet unproven theory.

<p>

Gabriel G. Nahas, professor of anesthesiology at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, writes in <i>A
Manual on Drug Dependence</i> that drug dependence is &quot;[r]eversible
and transient at first...[but] after repetitive drug use&quot;
addiction becomes &quot;irreversible and lead[s] to brain pathology
[disease].&quot;[10]

<p>

One of the classic rationales for labeling addiction a disease
is that it encourages abusers to seek help because there is a
lessened sense of guilt. The fact, however, is that most people
in treatment are there because of a run-in with the law and not
because of a desire to go straight. Unfortunately, the disease
approach allows abusers to ignore or explain away their moral
accountability, and consequently addicts perceive themselves as
victims.

<p>

There is a vast but often unheralded faith-based treatment community
that disagrees with the disease model. They argue that addiction
is a reflection of underlying moral or spiritual problems. Teen
Challenge, the largest faith-based treatment network with 120
centers nationwide, argues that addictions are a &quot;manifestation
of larger problems brought about by sin and self-centered attempts
to find meaning and fulfillment in life....When one does not have
a personal relationship with Christ's person, [he] has profound
emptiness that is often filled with misguided and self-destructive
efforts to achieve happiness.&quot;[11] Faith-based treatment will
be discussed in detail later, but first consider a profile of
American drug treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Many in the medical profession have embraced the disease model,
and this has influenced the available treatment modalities. Psychiatrists
are the primary caregivers for addicts and their manual, the American
Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), defines
substance dependence (addiction) as a disease. The DSM describes
addiction by the following symptoms: (1) compulsion or loss of
control; (2) tolerance, withdrawal reactions and using the drug
to avoid or interrupt withdrawal reactions and (3) impairment and 
preoccupation with the drug to the exclusion of all pleasures and activities.[12]

<p>

Addiction disease is most often treated using one or more of the
following modalities: detoxification, pharmacological treatment,
therapeutic communities, chemical dependency treatment programs,
and outpatient, drug-free treatment like 12-step programs.

<p>

Detoxification is the process of withdrawal of the drug under
supervision. Unfortunately, most detoxified addicts soon return
to the drug if other support treatment is not provided.[13]

<p>

Methadone maintenance is the most popular pharmacological treatment
for heroin addiction. There are at least 110,000 Americans enrolled
in government-sanctioned methadone programs lasting perhaps 12
months or longer. Methadone maintenance substitutes one addiction
(heroin) for another (methadone) requiring doses once a day. It
prevents withdrawal symptoms and stabilizes the addict. Methadone
patients live more productive lives than heroin addicts.[14] A 1991
NIDA-sponsored study of six methadone programs found that 82 percent
of subjects who left treatment relapsed within a year.[15]

<p>

There are a number of alternatives to methadone such as Naltrexone
and Buprenorphine. NIDA recently developed and the Food and Drug
Administration approved a longer-acting variant of methadone,
levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM). It needs to be taken only once
every 72 hours. There are other drug regimes for alcohol addicts
(antabuse) and cocaine addicts (amantadine, bromocriptine and
fluphenthixol decanoate).[16]

<p>

There are more than 500 residential therapeutic community (TC)
programs accommodating up to 15,000 patients annually. These programs
are primarily publicly funded. Seventy-five percent of the patients
have arrest records and are unemployed. TCs provide a strict environment
with group therapy where former addicts are the counselors. Drug
abuse is considered a disease of the emotions, and the patient
needs to be resocialized. Patients remain in residence up to a
year.[17]

<p>

Chemical dependency treatment programs differ from TCs in the
kind of patients, the length of the program and the level of professional
control. The Betty Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation
is an example where management and housekeeping are in the hands
of paid professionals and workers. Patients pay (hundreds of dollars
per day) for the treatment, stay for about a month and receive
care directed by a medical and mental health team. These facilities
care for about 10,000 people annually.[18]

<p>

Finally, outpatient drug treatment is the most common modality.
It includes 12-step programs which are not physician run and rely
on personal faith. Many people who have gone through other programs
will participate in a 12-step group for long-term help. The process
involves admitting powerlessness, seeking help from God, praying
that God will remove shortcomings, making a moral inventory, seeking
forgiveness, making amends, and helping others. Drug abstinence
is the goal, and participants are expected to attend meetings
daily.

<p>

<center><h3>THE DRUG TREATMENT INDUSTRY</h3></center>

<p>

The drug treatment industry can't meet the demand. The 1996 National
Drug Control Strategy claims that there are 11,800 specialty drug
abuse and alcoholism treatment facilities (both public and private)
for 7.1 million Americans who need treatment. But in 1994, only
1.85 million of the most severely addicted actually received treatment.
Most (62 percent) addicted Americans are men and employed (51
percent) with incomes (55 percent) less than twice the poverty level. 
Their lives are marked by criminal behavior, they rely on welfare assistance,
they lack health insurance, and they tend to be young (many under
age 18).[19]

<p>

Much of the recent public sector treatment growth has been within
the judicially-controlled population. In 1993, an estimated 944,208
people under custody of correctional agencies were also clients
in a drug and or alcoholism treatment program.[20] Of that number,
17 percent (160,573) were in non-government-funded treatment programs.
Most of the government (87.2 percent) and private (94 percent)
clients were in outpatient treatment.[21]

<p>

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most common &quot;treatment&quot;
modality. In 1995, there were 50,671 known AA groups and 1,150,447
national members.[22] These numbers do not include other 12-step programs
such as Narcotics Anonymous, Al-A-Teen and at least 629 Christian-based
programs.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TREATMENT COSTS</h3></center>

<p>

Public-sponsored drug treatment is very expensive. The federal
government will spend $5 billion in 1997 treating mostly 
economically-strapped and criminal addicts.[24] A 1992 National Drug and 
Alcohol Treatment Utilization Survey found 945,000 clients involved in 
federally-funded drug abuse treatment. Most (87 percent) were treated as 
outpatients.[25]

<p>

Federal treatment dollars have grown substantially over the past
five years. From 1989 to 1994 federal drug treatment funds increased
119 percent (or $1.3 billion), but the number of persons treated
has declined while the treatment demands have risen.[26]

<p>

Federal funding of treatment programs generally lacks strict accountability.
In 1996, there were 13 federal agencies that allocated treatment
funds to the states using a variety of mechanisms.[27] A percentage
of those funds are siphoned off for administrative costs at each
government level beginning in Washington, D.C.

<p>

Consider the funds California received from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) last year.
[SAMHSA is the source of 30 percent of federal funding for drug
abuse treatment and prevention.[28] ] The state took 5 percent for
administrative costs then negotiated with each of the 58 counties
which are responsible for providing treatment programs. But there
is no accountability mechanism. Perhaps that's why the state government
hired the University of California to study whether publicly-funded
treatment programs work. The report is due next year.[29]

<p>

<center><h3>DOES TREATMENT WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

Determining treatment success can be difficult. The National Drug
Control Strategy lists six treatment success measures: reduced
crime, reduced drug use, reduced domestic violence, reduced behavior
at risk for the AIDS virus, increased days of employment, and
positive change in social values and networks.[30] These indicators
are difficult to measure especially among unreliable addicts.

<p>

A common criticism of drug treatment programs and a good indication
of success is the high rate of addict recidivism. Repeat treatment
is very common and may be attributed to the addict not getting
the appropriate help in the first instance. &quot;There is no
single appropriate treatment for addiction,&quot; says Herbert
D. Kleber, the director of the Division of Substance Abuse, College
of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, &quot;any more
than there is for diabetes, hypertension or depression. These
populations are diverse. Some need medication, some need psychological
help, some need lifestyle change. It is critical to match the
individual with the appropriate treatment.&quot;[31]

<p>

Perhaps Dr. Kleber's warning explains why so many abusers drop
out of treatment. AA has found, for example, that 88 percent of
members drop out within a year, and only 20 to 30 percent remain
abstinent for five or more years.[32]

<p>

Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, one of the nation's
two largest residential drug-treatment organizations, says that
30 percent of residents drop out within the first six weeks and
about half make it through the first year.[33] Most therapeutic communities
like Phoenix House see only 10 percent of their patients complete
the program.[34]

<p>

Finishing Phoenix House's comprehensive 18- to 24-month program
is good insurance against relapse. Rosenthal claims that 90 percent
of his graduates are still working and law-abiding five to seven
years later and that 70 percent stay drug-free.[35]

<p>

Rosenthal sees drug abuse as a symptom of a deeper personal disturbance.
He explains, &quot;We have two years to teach industrial-strength
values to those most likely to resist them -- only two years to instill the 
social competence, self-respect, trust in other people, and optimism about 
the future that the addict's community and family did not.&quot;[36]

<p>

Large treatment outcome studies have found mixed &quot;successes.&quot;
The Drug Abuse Research Project Survey (DARPS), a 12-year follow-up
of heroin addicts admitted to methadone, residential, or outpatient
drug-free treatment began in 1969. It found that 83 percent of
the patients had been treated more than once by the end of the
survey and 74 percent had taken methadone at some time. The Treatment
Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) followed 10,000 abuse patients
three and five years after treatment. Most (95 percent) of individuals
in residential treatment reported more than minimal drug use before
treatment and a substantial reduction after treatment. Additionally,
of those who reported illegal activity before treatment, 97 percent
reported no illegal activity during treatment and more than half
(57 percent) reported a decrease in depression after treatment.[37]

<p>

In 1994, there was a California study of 1,900 addicts in treatment.
The study found that it wasn't necessary to complete the treatment
to yield a savings. Each day of treatment yielded a financial
return to society. Specifically, it was estimated that for 150,000
treated addicts which cost $209 million, the state saved $1.5
billion in reduced social costs, primarily crime.[38]

<p>

The effectiveness of drug addiction treatment is inconclusive.
But we do know that the best results come from intensive, long-term
programs that involve multiple modalities that target the addict's
specific problems.[39]

<p>

<center><h3>NO TREATMENT OFTEN BEST</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that there is a high rate of recovery among addicts
even without treatment. Heroin addicts typically break the habit
in 11 years, and half of all alcoholics free themselves without
outside help.[40]

<p>

A study of self-treated alcoholics found that more than half (57
percent) said they simply decided that alcohol was bad for them
and nearly a third (29 percent) said health problems, frightening
experiences, accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.[41]

<p>

A study of heroin addiction among American soldiers who fought
in Vietnam is most revealing. Two to three years after returning
from Vietnam, despite extremely high rates of addiction, they
were no more likely to be addicts than comparable civilians.[42]

<p>

The Vietnam study found that many soldiers were described as heroin
addicts in order to fit the mold of a drug treatment program.
These people had so many other problems, originating before the
addiction, that the label &quot;addict&quot; is little more than
a convenience, and &quot;treatment of drug abuse&quot; is an inadequate
description of their needs.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>A CASE FOR FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

There is room for faith-based programs to compete in the treatment
arena, especially given the poor showing by most publicly-funded
programs. After all, faith-based programs rely on the addict's
relationship with God as a primary treatment modus operandi, and
that appeals to many Americans.

<p>

The typical faith-based drug program is structured like the therapeutic
community approach. Both use former addicts as counselors, seek
to resocialize the addict and usually last for one year. The primary
difference is the faith-based program's philosophy. It claims
that a relationship with Jesus Christ provides meaning and direction
for life which is key to a healthy body, mind and spirit.

<p>

In 1996, a <i>USA Today</i> poll found that 56 percent of Americans
believe that faith helped them recover from an illness.[44] Herbert
Benson, author of <i>The Relaxation Response and Timeless Healing:
The Power and Biology of Belief</i>, supports the faith-healing
connection. &quot;To put it simply,&quot; Benson said, &quot;we're
wired for God...We're the only species that knows it's going to
die and has a belief in something beyond. We have a tremendous
healing capacity if we can tap into what I call the 'faith factor.'&quot;[45]

<p>

Dr. Dale Matthews, an associate professor of medicine at Georgetown
University, reviewed 212 medical studies examining faith and health.
He found three out of every four studies showed health benefits
for patients with &quot;religious commitments.&quot;[46]

<p>

Similar results are found in drug-related studies. In a review
of 20 published studies, 19 (95 percent) showed that religion
plays a positive role in preventing alcoholism. A strong religious
commitment was found to be a consistent characteristic of those
who have not used illicit drugs.[47]

<p>

A study in the <i>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</i>
found that faith-based addiction treatment programs are superior
to non-faith-based programs. The study concluded that patients
who attended faith-based programs were much more likely
(45 percent to 5 percent) to report abstinence from opium-based
drugs like heroin for one year after the program. The study which
was funded by NIDA also found that faith-based graduates were
subsequently three times more likely to be married and far less
likely to be on either parole or probation.[48]

<p>

While the average American is influenced by religion, mental health
care professionals are far less likely to be so inclined. Three
of every four Americans agree with the statement, &quot;My whole
approach to life is based on my religion.&quot; Only 33 percent
of psychologists, 39 percent of psychiatrists, 46 percent of social
workers and 62 percent of marriage and family therapists agree.
Given these statistics, it is easy to understand the secular bias
of these health professionals who have great say over the type
of care given a patient and the type of programs approved by government
health care advisors.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Most drug treatment doesn't work well and where it does work,
one size does not fit all. A diversity of treatment alternatives
to include low cost taxpayer-free and faith-based programs must
be available.

<p>

Pope John Paul II endorses the church's role in drug treatment.
He spoke to the Italian Federation of Therapeutic Communities
labeling drug abuse a symptom of &quot;a culture starved of genuine
values.&quot;[50] He said the church should have tremendous leverage
in addressing drug addiction.[51]

<p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich supports faith-based programs.
&quot;We need to get back to one-on-one missionary work,&quot;
said Gingrich.[52] &quot;We are in the business of changing and saving
people, not maintaining them in their decay. If you don't start
with a faith-based approach, then you haven't started anything...if
you're not improving your life every day, then you're decaying.&quot;[53]

<p>

There are practical reasons for supporting private or community
faith-based alternatives -- such as cost. Taxpayer-funded residential drug
treatment costs far more than many faith-based and taxpayer-free
programs. The 1994 California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment
found that taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment cost $61.47
per person per day and experienced high recidivism.[54] In comparison,
Victory Outreach costs about $25 per person per day and enjoys
very low recidivism.[55]

<p>

The dramatic differences between taxpayer-funded programs and
faith-based programs possibly explains why Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.)
told a Senate hearing on the issue of faith-based programs, &quot;I
believe there are people and groups in America with answers,&quot;
people who are &quot;winning the war on poverty and addiction,
one individual at a time.&quot;[56] He supports their active role.

<p>

Addicts need to be taken off drugs and resocialized. Some are
violent offenders who deserve jail, and others can once again
become productive citizens after help from a diversity of programs
including the Phoenix House, Victory Outreach, The Betty Ford
Clinic and Teen Challenge.

<p>

Government shouldn't try to fight the drug war alone. Rather,
it should focus on supply reduction and push prevention and treatment
efforts down to the community level where programs can be tailored
to local needs.

<p>

The local faith community will play a vital role in prevention
and treatment. After all, the church gives people faith and hope
that there are ultimate meaning and purpose of life. It gives
man answers to great questions of life. It establishes a system
of moral duties which have worked. It also gives direction to
public opinion and provides the basis for social order.

<h2>REPORT ON THE 40TH SESSION<br>
OF THE UNITED NATIONS'<br>
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF<br>
WOMEN</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Ellen Lukas</i></center>

<p>

From March 11-22, the 40th session of the United Nations' Commission
on the Status of Women (CSW) met to discuss and approve worldwide
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s
agenda for women's empowerment, &quot;aimed at removing all obstacles
to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private
life.&quot;

<p>

The CSW, a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), was established in 1946 to prepare recommendations for
the promotion of women's rights and on problems requiring attention
in that field. It meets yearly and has a membership of 45 countries.[1]
The Commission was the preparatory body which produced the Fourth
World Conference for Women in Beijing last year.

<p>

In comparison to the Beijing conference, the March CSW session
was a businesslike and uneventful meeting. Since the real work
of hammering together the platform was finished at Beijing, the
CSW session included no demonstrations, no protests, no brawls.
At least 4,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had gone
to Beijing, but they were not prominent or numerous at this meeting.
Even though the Commission had sent out special invitations asking
all NGOs who had gone to Beijing to come to this meeting, there
were perhaps 200 in the gallery on opening day, and on following
days, never more than a dozen.

<p>

Representatives of the Women Count Network lobbied diligently
for recognition of women's unwaged (i.e., house-) work. Bella
Abzug, co-founder of the Women's Environment and Development Organization
(WEDO), who addressed the Commission on its opening day, argued
for accreditation of a permanent roster of women's NGOs to participate
in CSW meetings, much as the Rio Conference NGOs participate in
meetings of the Commission on Sustainable Development. (This question
will be discussed further at the Economic and Social Council meeting
this month.)

<p>

Generally, government delegates to the CSW session were not the
fiery old-line feminists whose presence sparked the Beijing conference.
This time, for the most part, they were the sober permanent mission
representatives who usually serve on the General Assembly's Second
(Economic) Committee. They saw the issues which the session was
considering primarily through a Second Committee prism and were
more interested in economic questions than in ideological ones.
They also pressed for the use of Second Committee methods at the
session, such as the adoption of &quot;Agreed Conclusions&quot;
rather than resolutions in their final statements.

<p>

The meeting began with two days of general debate in which representatives
of the U.N. system gave their views on various aspects of the
organization's implementation of the document. Each of the 45
delegates on the Commission paid the expected tribute to &quot;gender
mainstreaming&quot; and spoke about his or her nation's programs
on behalf of women.

<p>

U.N. system speakers included the Secretary-General's advisor
on gender issues (Rosario Green, a Mexican woman diplomat); the
new director of the Division for the Advancement of Women which
supplies support services for the CSW; a senior advisor from UNICEF;
and a women's advisor from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). They talked about the impact of the Beijing Platform
for Action on the CSW agenda -- new programs for girls' education
and health, including strategies against early and unplanned pregnancy,
and plans to deal with sexual violence against refugee women.
A human rights specialist from the World Health Organization spoke
on violence as a public health issue, as well as of women's &quot;right
to health.&quot; (He specified &quot;reproductive rights as formulated
by the [Cairo] International Conference on Population and Development,
as a fundamental human right in all circumstances.&quot;)

<p>

When their turn came to speak, the G77 (a bloc of 137 developing
countries, including China) demanded that implementation of the
Beijing document place more emphasis on development. The representative
of the ultra-liberal 15-nation European Union reminded the session
that, &quot;The human rights of women include their sexual rights,&quot;
and mentioned recent resolutions adopted by the EU on integrating
gender issues into programs of development aid. The EU also managed
to get in a few paragraphs supporting sex education for adolescents,
and total support for the Cairo and Beijing Platforms.

<p>

In her opening speech in the general debate, U.S. representative
to the Commission Linda Tarr-Whelan promised that America &quot;is
very serious about the implementation of the Beijing Declaration
and Platform for Action, and about fulfilling our particular commitments
announced at Beijing....It is our goal to institutionalize as
much change as possible.&quot; In establishing the President's
Interagency Council on Women, she said, the U.S. has for the first
time created a formal mechanism to deal with the follow-up to
a U.N. conference.[2]

<p>

<center><h3>THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUES</h3></center>

<p>

From March 13-18 the U.N. staged a series of what it called &quot;interactive
dialogues&quot; (discussions between panels of experts chosen
by the U.N. Secretariat, and delegates to the Commission) on three
out of the 12 &quot;areas of concern&quot; mentioned in the Beijing
document. The three subjects covered at the current session were
&quot;Women and Poverty,&quot; &quot;Women and the Media,&quot;
and &quot;Child and Dependent Care, Including the Sharing of Work
and Family Responsibilities.&quot;

<p>

The Women and Poverty discussion ran for two half-day sessions,
March 13 and 14. A Secretariat report which formed the basis for
the discussion stressed the &quot;gender dimension of poverty,&quot;
noting that women constitute a majority of the world's poor, and
contending that they experience poverty differently from men,
because historically women have been disadvantaged in terms of
obtaining education, training and access to employment opportunities,
productive resources and capital.

<p>

Experts for this panel came from five U.N. system agencies: UNIFEM,
UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA (the U.N. Fund for Population) and the World
Bank, as well as from various governmental and non-governmental
grass-roots organizations. To remedy poverty among women, the
panelists urged the adoption of policy agendas which would assure
women of employment and income. They also agreed on the need for
an integrated approach to poverty which would go beyond provision
of money and creation of jobs to address gender discrimination
and violence. Arguing for the value of reproductive health services
for adolescent girls, UNFPA, which insisted that &quot;education
together with reproductive health are the most important means
of empowering women,&quot; was the only expert in this dialogue
to even mention &quot;reproductive health.&quot;

<p>

In the exchange that followed, more than half the delegates had
harsh words for the World Bank, whose insistence on painful structural
adjustment policies, they said, was hurtful to women.

<p>

The U.S.'s Tarr-Whelan managed to turn her intervention in the
dialogue into a sort of Clinton campaign speech praising the administration's
concern for the poor in America and slamming Congress for neglecting
them. &quot;There is now a polarized debate in the U.S. on poverty,&quot;
she said. &quot;There is not a sufficiently shared societal concern.
In the past, we have focused on a transfer payment method. But,
increasingly our social safety net is being dismantled. Poverty,
especially among children, is increasing....We are, however, trying
new strategies and methods.&quot; Among them: efforts (encouraged
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) to expand business ownership
development for women and new forms of community-based credit
as well as stronger initiatives to recoup child support payments
from &quot;deadbeat dads.&quot; Tarr-Whelan's mention of the commitments
the U.S. had made at Beijing and Copenhagen made her one of the
very few delegates to bring up &quot;family planning&quot; in
connection with poverty.

<p>

The CSW discussion of &quot;Women and the Media&quot; took place
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, the 13th and 14th. The
Secretariat report on the subject noted that &quot;the representation
in the media of violence against women, particularly sexual violence,
has increased tremendously in past years&quot; as have the production
and marketing of sexually explicit material, which is now a business
with established links to forced prostitution and trafficking
in women. The report also complained that in many countries women
lack access to new communications technologies. It also objected
to the fact that the media often portrayed women unfairly and
urged efforts to combat gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The expert panel on the subject, which included speakers from
governmental organizations, non-commercial media and the U.N.,
generally ignored the report's statements on violence and sexually
explicit material. They denounced the stereotyping of women and
praised women journalists covering the former Yugoslavia for contributing
to the focus on systematic rape during armed conflicts.

<p>

Discussion of &quot;child and dependent care, including the sharing
of work and family responsibilities&quot; ran on March 15 and
March 18. It was arguably the dialogue which will spark the largest
amount of subsequent discussion and have the greatest impact on
the family in the future.

<p>

The Secretariat report on the subject argued that &quot;women
carry a double burden of work and family responsibilities which
reinforces inequality between the sexes.&quot; More and more women
worldwide are going into the labor force all the time, and becoming
heads of households. At the same time, said the report, women's
home responsibilities do not diminish, but they continue to grow
as fewer and fewer women have the support of a spouse or of a
large or extended family to help them care for children or other
dependents. This leaves women crowded into a narrow range of low-status,
low-paying jobs from which they are unable to escape.

<p>

Panelists for child and dependent care were an odd choice for
putative child care experts. Along with a speaker from the Norwegian
Ministry of Family Affairs and representatives from the International
Labor Organization, UNICEF and the Population Council, there was
a woman from the China Family Education Association and a family
policy bureaucrat from Romania.

<p>

The Norwegian spokeswoman said that her government had recently
begun recruiting men for child care and -- although there had
been recent major court cases in Norway dealing with men's abuse
of children -- the government believed that &quot;more experience
by men of such caring and nurturing experiences will actually
prevent violence.&quot; The Population Council said that &quot;though
there is great (and not unfounded) suspicion of non-family 'center
care' in traditional societies,&quot; demand for such centers
could be created among the public by linking child care centers
up with health and vaccination programs, as well as with family
planning services. The Chinese expert gave a cheerful report on
child care in the People's Republic -- three meals a day, naps,
playtime and the possibility of Monday-to-Friday boarding facilities
from 3 years of age and upwards. The Romanian representative inveighed
against her country's &quot;repressive patriarchal tradition.&quot;

<p>

In the subsequent delegate exchange with the panelists, nearly
every country (including even Sudan and Iran) reported that it
already provided some kind of day care to help free employed mothers
from family burdens.

<p>

<center><h3>CSW RESOLUTIONS AND AGREED CONCLUSIONS</h3></center>

<p>

With the close on March 18 of the &quot;dialogue&quot; section
of the CSW session, delegates settled into smaller working groups
to negotiate the resolutions or &quot;agreed conclusions&quot;
they proposed to adopt on the issues under review. They also met
from time to time in full session to hear statements from those
delegates who had not spoken in the general debate and from concerned
NGOs.

<p>

By Thursday night, agreement had been reached on all the amendments
proposed for addition to the resolutions. By the evening of Friday,
March 22, more than a dozen resolutions were adopted.

<p>

Among them was a very commendable statement condemning &quot;traffic
in women and girls&quot; and calling for ratification of conventions
on trafficking in persons and for law enforcement against trafficking
networks and sex tourism. Another good resolution condemned &quot;violence
against civilian women and children in areas of armed conflict
and hostage taking,&quot; and a third worthwhile resolution condemned
&quot;violence against women migrant workers.&quot;

<p>

The resolution adopted on the subject of &quot;women and poverty&quot;
stressed female empowerment as essential to poverty eradication,
and urged governments to develop education and training programs
to promote women's employment and make legislative reforms concerning
the right of inheritance, land ownership, natural resources, technology,
decision-making, and protection during unemployment and maternity.
International financial organizations, including the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, were urged to assist.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;women and the media&quot; asked, among
other things, for an end to gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;child and dependent care, including sharing
of responsibilities between men and women,&quot; asked governments
to recognize the importance of making changes in societal attitudes
toward the work that women do at home, to promote increased participation
of men in family responsibilities including domestic work and
child care, to provide for family leave, and to adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value (akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; debate that has taken place in the past decade in
the United States).

<p>

Several resolutions were adopted which were specifically related
to the implementation of the Beijing document. A draft resolution,
prepared for consideration by the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), approved the CSW role in overseeing implementation of
the Beijing document as well as a schedule naming which of Beijing's
&quot;critical areas of concern&quot; will be considered in future
CSW sessions. A resolution on &quot;mainstreaming the human rights
of women and girls&quot; urged that the issue of the human rights
of women and girls be integrated into all U.N. policies and programs.
A resolution commented on the U.N.'s &quot;System-Wide Medium
Term Plan for the Advancement of Women,&quot; describing how the
Beijing Platform for Action is to be incorporated throughout all
the work plans of the U.N. system, including education programs,
technical assistance programs, and contacts with governments,
academic and other institutions and NGOs. Another resolution dealing
with drafting an &quot;Optional Protocol to the Convention on
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)&quot; asked
for a report on the views of members of the international community
on the feasibility of initiating a reporting procedure on violations
of women's rights in states which are parties to CEDAW.[3]

<p>

<center><h3>THE FAMILY AS AN ISSUE AT THIS SESSION OF THE CSW</h3></center>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have children 
at some time in their lives, the family remained a non-issue at the 
March 11-22 CSW.

<p>

There was almost no mention of the family in the 
Secretariat reports which formed the basis of the dialogues, in the 
panelists' speeches, in the delegates' comments, or in the adopted 
resolutions -- not even a mention of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights' definition of the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot;

<p>

And, of course, there was no suggestion that the family has value
or that it contributes anything meaningful to society. There was
no discussion of how to preserve the family now that it is under
siege, or how to shore it up.

<p>

In the poverty discussion and elsewhere, women were seen primarily
as a labor force, with success as workers and economic decision-makers,
recipients of credit, and consumers of child and elder care assigned
as their highest goal.

<p>

Listening to the speakers at the dialogues and at the negotiations
for the resolutions, one had the impression the traditional family
had already almost totally disappeared. The great question with
regard to human relationships was how to reassign and rearrange
the roles of men and women in whatever kind of partnership in
which they are now living.

<p>

<center><h3>CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE AS DISCUSSED AT THIS SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

There were really two questions approached in the discussions
and resolutions on child and dependent care. The first was the
question of how to ease the double burden women must bear in attending
to jobs as well as to family responsibilities. In the resolution
the Commission adopted on child care, measures suggested included
redistribution of family responsibilities, provisions for parental
leave from work,[4] arrangements for part-time work, more provision
of child care services, and provision of elder care and support
to persons with disabilities. (No reference was made to relieving
the burden of taxation on families with children. The Beijing
Platform for Action focuses on getting women out of the home and
into the labor force. It has no interest in bolstering the family
by tax relief or any other means.)

<p>

The second problem connected
with the question of child care was how to put a market value
on the unpaid work that women do in connection with the home.
Last September the 1995 Human Development Report published by
UNDP estimated that there is $16 trillion worth of unpaid work
done around the world annually, some $11 trillion of it by women.
Unpaid work is an issue about which women's groups staged silent
vigils at Beijing, complaining that lack of remuneration greatly
contributes to women's low social status. If the value of women's
unpaid work were to be counted, they say, it could greatly affect
inheritance rights and divorce settlements, as well as access
to credit and other issues determined by economic contributions.

<p>

At this CSW session, the question of unpaid work was complicated
by introduction into the discussions of the radical feminist terms
&quot;productive&quot; and &quot;reproductive work.&quot; &quot;Reproductive
work,&quot; used in contradistinction to &quot;productive work&quot;
(work outside the home for pay), was applied to such tasks as
&quot;child-bearing, breast-feeding, child-rearing, cooking, housework
and transmission of values [and also, in some places] fetching
water and collecting wood.&quot; The Secretariat report on child
care noted that &quot;reproductive work does not normally carry
with it the entitlement to an income, and those who bear responsibility
for it must take on additional work to generate income of their
own.&quot;

<p>

After making some attempt to wrestle with the terms &quot;productive&quot;
and &quot;reproductive&quot; work, delegates finally dropped the
terms altogether. In the resolution on the subject, they referred
to work connected with the home simply as &quot;unremunerated
work&quot; and urged the recognition of its social and economic
importance. They also urged that governments adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value, akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; proposals that gained some notoriety in the United
States in the 1980s.

<p>

Although the Beijing Platform for Action (Para 68b) urges that
national and international statistical organizations should: &quot;Devise
suitable statistical means to recognize and make visible the full
extent of the work of women and all their contributions to the
national economy,&quot; including women's contribution in &quot;the
unremunerated and domestic sectors,&quot; CSW delegates decided
to skip the question of how governments might go about putting
a value on this unpaid work.

<p>

There were, however, some suggestions for devising a methodology
to include data on unpaid work in calculations of GDP[5] and other
indicators, put forward by some of the more imaginative NGOs and
by their supporters at INSTRAW (a small U.N. research institute
on women's issues). Essentially, this methodology involved conducting
&quot;time-use&quot; studies, paid for in developing countries
by development institutions and other donors, to count the time
women spend doing household tasks (including those they do simultaneously,
such as caring for children and cooking). Governments could then
factor estimates of the value of this work into the &quot;satellite&quot;
(or parallel) accounts that some countries compile as annexes
to their figures on paid work.

<p>

The present U.S. administration has shown some interest in the
issue of unpaid work by women. Hillary Clinton's speech at Beijing
made a critical reference to the lack of recognition of unwaged
work by governments, and during this CSW session's poverty dialogue,
U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan announced that &quot;the Departments
of Labor and Commerce are undertaking consultations to determine
how best to construct reliable estimates of the value of unwaged
work in the U.S.&quot;

<p>

Last year, apparently there was a bill in the Congress (H.R. 966,
The Unremunerated Work Act) which called on the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to conduct time-use surveys of the unremunerated work
done by women and men in America, so that its value could be included
in the GDP. The AFL-CIO Executive Council in February 1995 issued
a statement on the bill, declaring that reliable statistical data
about unpaid work in the U.S. is essential to provide for the
well-being of large numbers of women, children and families in
the U.S.

<p>

<center><h3>THE UNITED STATES AS AN ACTOR AT THE CURRENT CSW SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

Since the purpose of this meeting was only to approve implementation
of provisions already adopted at Beijing, the U.S. was generally
less assertive at the CSW session than it has been at other recent
U.N. meetings. Even the NGOs at this session complained that the
U.S. did not cheer them on as enthusiastically as it has in the
past.

<p>

The U.S. was on its good behavior at this session even with its
recent opponents. At a negotiating meeting on the poverty resolution,
for example, when the G77 and China proposed an amendment calling
on governments to provide day care centers in very poor neighborhoods
&quot;in order to facilitate the training and integration of mothers
into productive work&quot; (&quot;a fin de facilitar la capacitation
incorporacion de las madres al trabajo productivo&quot;), the
Holy See Observer suggested to U.S. delegates that they might
not really want to back a paragraph implying that motherhood was
a &quot;non-productive effort.&quot;

<p>

The U.S. said they would &quot;take care of it&quot; and did.
When the text resurfaced the next day, it asked for day care centers
&quot;to facilitate the training of mothers for their entry into
paid employment.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SWIMTEP</h3></center>

<p>

According to the schedule of meetings adopted in the resolution
on the &quot;Follow-up to the FWCW&quot; (that is, the Beijing
conference), the CSW will not get around to holding a &quot;dialogue&quot;
on the women's health section of the Beijing document until 1999.
Since the recent CSW session was not specifically concerned with
the issues of women's health or women's rights, there was no talk
about sexual orientation, no open mention of abortion, and no
attempt to trip the Cairo language wire on &quot;reproductive
rights.&quot;

<p>

Proceedings at the session were, in fact, so bland and bureaucratic
that one had to remind oneself that the session had quietly approved
the System-Wide Medium Term Plan for the Advancement of Women
(also known as &quot;SWIMTEP&quot;), which gives details of how
the Beijing Platform for Action --- the complete Platform for
Action, including issues relating to women's health and reproductive
rights -- is already being implemented in all U.N. policies and
programs. This is an enterprise that could radically affect society
for years to come.

<p>

To mention only a few of the tasks assigned by SWIMTEP to U.N.
entities on behalf of women's health and reproductive rights:

<p>

UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF and UNESCO will report to the U.N.'s Population
Division on promotion of women's reproductive rights worldwide;

<p>

WHO and UNFPA will provide technical guidance to governments in
the area of fertility regulation, by providing technical guidelines
on specific methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives;

<p>

WHO and UNICEF will develop practical methodologies in the area
of women's reproductive health in support of governments' efforts
to implement reproductive health programs;

<p>

The U.N. system will prepare training and counseling materials
for NGOs, women's groups and health providers, and provide special
programs for girls and boys regarding responsible sexual behavior.
These programs will be run by WHO, UNESCO, UNDP, U.N. Volunteers,
the Center for Human Rights, U.N. Department for Development Support
&amp; Management Services, UNICEF and UNFPA. N.B. These provisions
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.

<p>

How much effect the U.N.'s Beijing health strategy will have on
national health policies throughout the world depends to a great
extent on what resources will be available for the enterprise.
The U.N.'s budget problems must be factored into consideration
of this issue. The U.S. has not paid its assessed debt of $699
million for this year's regular U.N. budget, which, among other
things, covers operating expenses of the CSW. In addition, there
are the cuts which Congress made recently in U.S. voluntary contributions
to U.N. agencies (a total of only $285 million for such agencies
as UNICEF, UNDP and the Population Fund this year, compared to
$374 million in 1995). This will certainly be a limiting factor.

<p>

Speaking of finances for the implementation of the Beijing Platform,
SWIMTEP notes that funding &quot;will have to be identified from
all sources and across all sectors....Mobilization of additional
resources, both public and private, including resources from innovative
sources of funding, will be necessary.&quot; Speaking to this
question at the current CSW, U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan reminded
the U.N. that the U.S. had warned it at Beijing that it expected
the Platform to be implemented &quot;within existing resources, through
reordering priorities and thinking creatively.&quot;

must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers needing
to care for seriously ill parents, spouses, themselves, or their
children.  The survey showed that only 2 percent of U.S. workers
have availed themselves of the provisions of the law since it
was enacted; 59 percent of leave-takers said they did so to attend
to their own health, not to take care of elderly parents, sick

TOWARDS THE OFFICE</h2>

<p>

The good news is, being a &quot;family-friendly&quot; corporation
is now considered <I>in</I> by professionals in the field of human
resources.  The bad news is, this new family-friendliness does
<I>not</I> include empowering one parent to support a family on a
single income. Instead, what it means is domestic partner benefits,
on-site day care, business support for intrusive &quot;home visit&quot;
schemes such as Missouri's &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program,
and helping new mothers &quot;return to work&quot; (the words
imply that child-rearing is a leisure activity) as soon as possible.

<p>

This is the conclusion this writer reached after attending a two-day
conference entitled, &quot;The 1996 Work and Family Conference:
Is the Family a Corporate Stakeholder?&quot;  The conference
was sponsored jointly by the Conference Board, a leading organizer
of business conferences, and the Families and Work Institute,
a grantee of the U.S. Department of Education.  The conference
was underwritten by Johnson &amp; Johnson and IBM, and was held
in New York City in late April.

<p>

<center><h3>COMPANIES THAT &QUOT;GET IT&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

The first panel of speakers was called &quot;Family Values in
a Corporate Context.&quot;  Andrew D. Sherman, vice president
of the benefits consulting firm The Segal Company, said his company's
criterion for family benefits eligibility is &quot;two adults,
not related by blood, in a relationship that is non-platonic,
financially linked, and intended to be permanent.&quot;

<p>

Providing such benefits has been very inexpensive, in part because
only about 1 percent of Segal's employees have chosen to enroll as 
domestic partners.  According to Sherman, this makes domestic partner 
benefits a &quot;win-win&quot; for his company: Its gets praise for its
enlightenment at very low cost.

<p>

The only question, he asked, is why more companies do not offer
such benefits? Sherman's answer was that many CEOs don't &quot;get
it.&quot;

<p>

Detailing other companies policies, Sherman noted that Xerox includes
extended family members as well as domestic partners.  Lotus offers
domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples <I>only,</I> on
the theory that opposite-sex couples 
can acquire those benefits by marrying.  Lotus's aim, Sherman
said, is to be known as &quot;the employer of choice for talented
people of all descriptions.&quot;  Kodak offers benefits to same-
and opposite-sex couples, because of its self-image as a &quot;progressive
and innovative corporation,&quot; Sherman said.

<p>

Wendy Starr, a consultant in the field of &quot;work-family programs,&quot;
and a former human resources executive at Xerox, said the human
resources field has matured from the shuffling of benefits paperwork
to &quot;support of the total person.&quot;  This mandate is all
the more extensive, she noted, because in the field of  benefits,
notions of legal marriage are giving way to &quot;a variety of
significant people.&quot;

<p>

Xerox, whose CEO &quot;gets it,&quot; defines &quot;extended family&quot;
for benefits purposes as those who reside in the employee's home,
are financially dependent on the employee, are not eligible for
benefits elsewhere, and are related to the employee as domestic
partner (same- or opposite-sex), parent, parent-in-law, grandparent,
grandparent-in-law, or child.  (Missing from the list is &quot;spouse,&quot;
but one assumes that not even Xerox has taken the step of affirmatively
penalizing the married.)

<p>

Perhaps the goal of &quot;supporting of the total person&quot;
which many of today's human resources specialists are suggesting
is overreaching.  Laura Nash, who teaches business ethics at Boston
University's School of Management and School of Theology, suggested
the possibility at one time, in her book <I>The Nanny Corporation</I>.
In her Work and Family Conference presentation this year, however,
Nash seemed more concerned with assuring attendees that she is
not really that far off the reservation.

<p>

What happens in the employee's family, she said, affects the company.
The really &quot;progressive&quot; companies are driven by non-economic
values such as &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;universal access&quot;
-- though she admitted it is difficult to point to shareholder
value created by such policies.

<p>

&quot;You are progressively changing the face of the social fabric,&quot;
Nash told the assembled human resources professionals.

<p>

One could argue that companies should just pay salaries, and not
get into employees' lifestyles, she said, but employers have legitimate
concerns about how employees will spend the extra money.  On the
one hand, conformity and dependence are dangerous, but on the
other, employers want healthy employees, not employees with poor
health and a Porsche.

<p>

Christian C. Kjeldsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice president
of corporate staff, spoke glowingly of his company's on-site day
care centers.  The one at the company's headquarters has 200 children,
and there is a waiting list!  Johnson &amp; Johnson aims to build
to more centers, Kjeldsen said.

<p>

In a stunning illustration of the power of the print media in
elite circles, and an equally stunning illustration of contemporary
corporate values, Kjeldsen noted that the problem of proving the
bottom-line benefits of extensive employee benefits (including
on-site day care) never came up at his company.  The reason? 
<I>Forbes</I> and <I>Business Week</I> ran articles about changing
demographics.  That was all the proof  his company's management
needed to make on-site day care and other benefits a permanent
fixture even through downsizing, &quot;rightsizing,&quot; and
early-outs. In other words, Johnson &amp; Johnson was
building programs to enable mothers to work for them and warehouse
their children, even while it was eliminating programs -- i.e.,
<I>jobs</I> -- that enabled workers to provide for their families
without recourse to day care.

<p>

After a while one sensed that all the cheerleading for &quot;progressively
changing the face of the social fabric&quot; was coming mainly
from the presenters, while the audience had more mundane concerns,
such as getting sanity back into their lives and the lives of
the employees they were supposed to be taking care of.

<p>

Someone from the audience asked Kjeldsen whether all this paternalism
was not perhaps in direct conflict with what they heard at last
year's Work and Family Conference, which focused on the decline
of dependable employment and the consequent need for portable
benefits.  Kjeldsen looked uncomfortable and said that &quot;companies
still have a lot of control over who is and who isn't at a desk.&quot;
Perhaps Kjeldsen's meaning was that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like
many other companies, sees extensive benefits as a recruitment
and retention issue and that the function of those benefits is
to convince prospective and present employees that a corporate
&quot;social contract&quot; still exists, even though none does.

<p>

<center><h3>&QUOT;OUTDATED&QUOT; PERSONNEL POLICIES</h3></center>

<p>

Randall Tobias, CEO of  the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly,
said in the event's keynote address that although some argue that
taking care of the family is not something that should be done
within the walls of the corporation, he disagrees.

<p>

The problem, Tobias said, is that many managers have an &quot;outdated&quot;
view of the family, which is why so many U.S. companies have personnel
policies &quot;based on Ozzie and Harriet.&quot;  Tobias claimed
such a family structure accounts for only 18 percent of employees
in the U.S.

<p>

Eli Lilly has changed with the times, Tobias said.  It is building
an on-site day care center for 220 children.  Its cafeteria prepares
take-home dinners four nights a week.  Other available benefits
include dry cleaning, and a 24-hour counseling service.  &quot;The
child care facility,&quot; said Mr. Tobias, &quot;will benefit
not only the families that use it, but all our employees, stockholders,
customers -- all who benefit from the <I>undivided attention</I>
of our employees.&quot; (Emphasis added)

<p>

Are we perhaps recreating the dreaded &quot;company town&quot;
from a bygone and unlamented era of U.S. labor relations?  Tobias
is not concerned.  &quot;You're kidding yourselves,&quot; he said,
&quot;if you think you can tell employees to leave their problems
at the factory fence.  You cannot hire <I>part</I> of a human
being.&quot;

<p>

Eli Lilly's employees seem to agree.  According to Tobias, the
company's internal surveys show that its employees do not see
the company's policies as intrusive.  They feel they are being
made more productive, and are glad to be part of an effective
corporation.  Human resources today, he said, requires attention
to the &quot;entire lives of our employees,&quot; and its professionals
must help &quot;break down the barriers to change.&quot;

<p>

After lunch, I chose to attend a session featuring Donna Klein,
a human resources executive with Marriott International.  I wondered
if perhaps Marriott's Mormon ownership would lead it toward more
traditional forms of family-friendliness.

<p>

Interestingly, what Marriott is doing is not exactly traditional.
At its headquarters in Atlanta,  Marriott has gotten together
with other hotel chains to establish Atlanta's Inn for Children,
a &quot;family center&quot; for low-income members of the &quot;hospitality
profession.&quot;  It is a 250-slot day care center that also
provides immunization, parent education, and nutrition counseling.

<p>

Marriott has also set up an Associate Resource Line (ARL), which
combines an &quot;employee assistance program&quot; with a 
&quot;case-management approach.&quot;  In other words, the hotel company 
brings the social work profession fully into the private-sector workplace.
In fact, Klein said this decision was made based on the fact
that some of Marriott's managers were spending more than half
of their time on social work rather than with business management.

<p>

In fairness to Marriott, their work force gives them an unusually
pressing need to bring social work into the workplace.  The company
has a high percentage of immigrant employees, many of whom need
help integrating into American society.  For instance, the ARL
has, to date, administered counseling in 15 different languages.
Still, one cannot help but be startled at the breadth of issues
that Marriott now considers to be workplace-related, including
housing, marital problems, and school problems.

<p>

Why have more companies not gone the way of Marriott?  Klein had
a simple explanation:  The wives of their CEO's &quot;don't work.&quot;

<p>

At this session, the audience was on board.  One participant praised
Marriott for having &quot;got religion&quot; on the need to subsidize
&quot;working mothers.&quot;

<p>

&quot;To some extent,&quot; Klein said, &quot;we are just rearranging
our overwork.  Still, better to overwork flexibly than inflexibly.&quot;

<p>

I left that first day remembering an old <I>New Yorker</I> cartoon
in which guests are being announced as they arrive at an ultra-posh
reception.  The butler/herald calls out:  &quot;The Duke and Duchess
of Exxon.  The Earl and Countess of Kodak.  The Marquis and Marchioness
of Glaxo,&quot; etc., etc.  Just as that cartoonist envisioned,
corporate leaders are the aristocracy of today, and they are very
serious about the paternalistic doctrine of &quot;noblesse oblige.&quot;
Whether this is good for the family as institution is another
question.

<p>

<center><h3>NO LONGER SUBSIDIZING THE FAMILY</h3></center>

<p>

A panel on &quot;Corporate Implications of the Fatherhood Debate&quot;
featured William Galston, professor of philosophy and public policy
at the University of Maryland.  Risking the opprobrium of the
mainly-female audience, Galston noted that the surge of women
into the paid work force over the past forty years has coincided
with the replacement of the &quot;military&quot; model of life,
left over from World War II, by the &quot;self-expression&quot;
model.  The result, he said, is that the family is weaker than
ever.

<p>

Galston saw a limited, but real role for the corporation.  It
can ease, but not eliminate, the tension that men feel between
work and home.  Corporate culture should change so that men do
not feel they are endangering their chances of promotion -- or
even of surviving a downsizing -- if they show by their actions
that they take their family responsibilities seriously.

<p>

Kathleen Gerson, professor of sociology at New York University,
was much more optimistic about the state of the family.  Men face
more economic insecurity than before the gender-role revolution,
Gerson said, but that very insecurity gives them the opportunity
to discover that &quot;motherhood and fatherhood are not very
different.&quot;

<p>

Gerson declared that the gender-role revolution is irreversible.
Women in the workforce and &quot;fluidity of marriage,&quot;
she said, are two of the immovable pillars of the new order.

<p>

Those who want to keep corporations out of people's lives fail
to understand those changes, Gerson said.  Companies used to subsidize
an unsalaried caregiver at home by paying the breadwinner (usually
the husband/father) a sufficient salary, she said, but because
of today's  &quot;irreversible&quot; social changes, corporations
must now take responsibility for their employees' whole well-being.

<p>

<center><h3>EMPLOYERS AS TEACHERS</h3></center>

<p>

The conference press kit included a glossy booklet entitled <I>Employers,
Families, and Education</I>, which was produced by the Fatherhood
Project at the Families and Work Institute.  The booklet covers
a variety of topics, including recommendations on how businesses
can provide family-friendly policies such as flextime, working
at home, and paid time-off for parent-teacher conferences.  These
are packaged, however, as ways of  &quot;making family involvement
in learning a goal&quot; and &quot;encouraging employees to get
involved in their children's schooling&quot; -- evidently assuming
that most parents are utterly unconcerned about their children's
education until given a nudge by their employers.

<p>

This assumption is carried forward in many of the specific recommendations
in the booklet.  One section touts an eight-hour &quot;parenting
seminar&quot; created by the U.S. West Education Foundation, and
available for purchase by human resource professionals for use
with their employees.  &quot;Interactive exercises and structured
discussion groups aim to give parents the understanding, confidence,
and skills they need to become positively involved in their children's
education.&quot;  One does not get the impression that parents,
as such, are viewed in a very positive light by the emerging 
corporate-business &quot;partnership&quot; in education.

<p>

The very next paragraph of the Families and Work Institute's booklet
touts the &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program, which, despite
the Orwellian choice of words in its name, assumes that 
parents lack even the most basic skills for bringing up their
children, never mind being their children's teachers, and therefore
need ongoing supervision by social workers.  Here is the entire
paragraph verbatim:

<p><blockquote>

<i><b>Parents as Teachers (PAT).</b> A home-school-community partnership
program designed to support parents of children from birth to
age 5 through home visits by parent educators, parent support
groups, and a referral network.  Established originally by four
school districts in Missouri, PAT is now mandated as a service
in that state, and has been replicated in hundreds of other school
districts around the country.  Scott Paper sponsors PAT in two
communities, IBM sponsors it in five, and Honeywell has adapted
the program for its own employees.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Employers, Families and Education was &quot;developed under contract
to the U.S. Department of Education.&quot;  The same notice specifies
that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Department
of Education, even though Secretary Richard Riley's name appears
on the title page.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

As shown by the above-quoted text, and by many of the presentations
at the Work and Families Conference, it would be a great mistake
to assume that everything that is &quot;private sector&quot; is
necessarily free from bureaucracy, institutionalized patronization,
and a control-mentality.

<p>

While some of the initiatives discussed at this conference are
no doubt helpful and commonsensical, others are intrusive, paternalistic,
and more or less explicitly aimed at undermining the traditional
family by subsidizing alternatives to it.  These are offenses
that we generally associate with the overweening state.  But private
industry is likely to work hand-in-glove with government in the
campaign for direct access to our children, whom industry views
exclusively as tomorrow's employees and consumers.

<p>

Robert E. Allen, CEO of AT&amp;T, says it better than I could
in a quote prominently featured in <I>Employers, Families, and
Education</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We have not traditionally linked the well-being of children to
the success of business or the governance of nations.  Yet increasingly 
we're acknowledging that upheavals in the American family aren't 
self-contained -- they intersect with business and economic circles 
and loop into the social fabric of this nation. As a society, we 
assume a larger affiliation -- one that implies, not just family 
ties, but added obligations.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This view would be less threatening if it were less accurate.
Anyone who recognizes that family breakdown has consequences
beyond the particular family in question deserves applause.  The
problem comes when we reduce those consequences to their impact
on &quot;business and economic circles,&quot; and then imply that 
they signify the failure of the family as such, and a consequent 
need to deploy &quot;a larger affiliation.&quot;

<title>THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE EMPLOYMENT<br>
NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT:<br>
AN UNWARRANTED EXPANSION<br>
OF FEDERAL POWER</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Touted as a logical extension of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act,
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 1863, S. 972) is actually
a radical change in workplace discrimination law. Backers of ENDA
say, without any credible substantiation, that homosexuals need
heightened protection not afforded to other employees in the workplace.

<p>

But ENDA is being brought up now to complicate efforts to pass
the Defense of Marriage Act. ENDA is bad legislation because it:

<p><ul>

<li>Sets the stage for an enormous expansion of federal power
over employers. This violates the principle of federalism embodied
in the 10th Amendment.

<p>

<li>Guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation which could hurt
small businesses most of all.

<p>

<li>Paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference, regardless
of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed. (Remember
Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights Act would
never lead to racial quotas?)

<p>

<li>Prohibits employers from disciplining or taking into account
in any way any sexual activity on or off the job by an employee.

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot; so broadly that all
sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality, are given
special protection and therefore moral status on a par with sex
within marriage.

<p>

<li>Suggests the federal government is officially supportive of
sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals by definition have sex with
more than one person.

<p>

<li>Creates a broad cultural force that rewards and protects sexual
dysfunction at the expense of traditional marriage and family.

<p>

<li>Poses a serious threat to employers' and employees' freedoms
of religion, speech and association. The law would ensure that
employers could no longer take their most deeply held beliefs
into account when making hiring, management and promotion decisions.
This would pose an unprecedented intrusion by the federal government
into people's lives.

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists claim that as many as 84 percent of the American
people support &quot;equal rights in terms of job opportunities.&quot;[1]
Well, yes. Most Americans believe that homosexuals should have
the same rights all employees have -- but no more than that.

<p>

It depends on how the question is asked. When the question is
asked whether homosexuals should have fewer rights, the same rights
or more rights, a majority says they should have the same rights.
A <I>Newsweek</I> poll in May 1996 asked, &quot;Has the U.S. done
enough to protect gay rights?&quot; Fully 66 percent answered
either &quot;done too much&quot; (40 percent) or &quot;done enough&quot;
(26 percent). Only 27 percent said &quot;more effort needed.&quot;
Polls also show that a majority of Americans believe that it would
be wrong specifically to enact new legislation in this area.[2]

<p>

Sometimes, the question is asked during debates, &quot;Do you
think someone should be fired just for being gay?&quot; Most people
would answer &quot;no.&quot; Few people want gays &quot;discovered&quot;
and fired, and most homosexuals can honestly report no real discrimination
against them. But the loaded question ignores crucial facts, such
as how the person's sexuality was made manifest and whether and
how it affected the workplace or even if children are involved
in any way.

<p>

The Boy Scouts have already suffered numerous legal attacks by
homosexual activists, and ENDA would only make their efforts easier.
There is no protection whatsoever in ENDA for professional Scout
employees. Homosexual activists contend that the Scouts would
be protected in their &quot;primary activities&quot; as a volunteer
group,[3] which is possible, but this could be swept aside by an
activist judge.

<p>

ENDA's sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
eliminates any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual
behavior.

<p>

Here are some examples of how ENDA-like policies have already
been or could be abused:

<p><ul>

<li>In Seattle, a CPA referral specialist, Bryan Griggs, laid
off all of his small staff except his wife in 1994. One employee
later charged Mr. Griggs with discrimination and sexual harassment
under Seattle's gay rights law even though Mr. Griggs did not
even know the man was a homosexual. Before he cleared his name,
Griggs spent thousands of dollars defending himself. The homosexual
employee charged that Mr. Griggs had created a bigoted atmosphere
of hatred toward homosexuals because he aired in the office Christian
talk radio on a station on which he had run advertising and kept
a letter from Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) regarding the issue
of homosexuals in the military. The letter from Rep. Dunn was
included in a packet of letters from a variety of public officials,
including President Clinton. Another employee, who also happens
to be homosexual, submitted an affidavit stating that Mr. Griggs
at no time ever created a hostile atmosphere toward homosexuals
nor did he ever harass the other employee in any way. Even the
liberal <I>Seattle Times</I> editorialized that the complaint
represented an abuse of Mr. Griggs' rights as an employer. The
<I>Times</I> wrote: &quot;Now Griggs unfairly faces spending thousands
of dollars in legal fees to defend himself against a problem he
never knew existed. Already, some are calling this a landmark
test. Frivolous is a better name for it. It is a tortured reach
to redefine 'hostile work environment.' It is a scary assault
on the First Amendment.&quot;[4] Such incidents could become common
on a national scale under ENDA.

<p>

<li>In 1991, Shell Oil was fined $5.3 million for dismissing an
executive, Jeffrey Collins, who had used company equipment at
a Shell subsidiary firm, Triton Biosciences, to produce and copy
a flyer advertising a &quot;safe sex&quot; party for homosexual
men.[5] Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Taber ruled that the California
company violated a policy that it would judge employees only on
job performance and not on activities unrelated to work. The ruling
effectively means that California employers like Shell must turn
a blind eye to even the most outrageous outside &quot;activities&quot;
of employees, even when the employee uses company-owned equipment
to promote them. Taber cited a 1979 California Supreme Court ruling
that employees cannot be fired for off-the-job &quot;political&quot;
activities. Promoting &quot;safe sex,&quot; she reasoned, constitutes
a &quot;political&quot; activity. She also made it clear that
Collins' activities were protected not in spite of but because
of his sexual orientation. &quot;The evidence is overwhelming
that homosexual group sexual activity was beyond the pale of conduct
acceptable to the top management of Shell,&quot; she wrote.[6] Taber's
ruling explored, in her words, &quot;the relatively new issue
of how far a corporation may go in demanding that its managerial
staff, in their respective private lives, deport and conduct themselves
in a manner acceptable to and meeting the corporation's concept
of propriety.&quot;[7] By deciding against Shell, the judge ruled
that private companies cannot discourage employees from participating
in homosexual orgies or any other behavior broadly covered under
&quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Loudoun County, Va., Jeffrey Bruton, a teacher/coach at
a public middle school and high school, was found to have appeared
in several hard-core homosexual porn films.[8] Loudoun School Superintendent
Edgar B. Hatrick III said that the teacher would be dismissed
if the allegations are true because, &quot;We believe that teachers
as people who are chosen to be instructors as well as leaders
of our young people, should be exemplary in their professional
as well as personal lives.&quot; He also said he would ask the
state to revoke Bruton's teaching license. Virginia state law
stipulates that a teaching license can be revoked for &quot;conduct
such as immorality, or personal condition detrimental to the health,
welfare, discipline, or morale of students.&quot; Before the school
acted, Bruton resigned and turned in his teacher's license. Under
ENDA, Bruton could have claimed that his &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is nobody's business -- certainly not his employer's -- and that
school officials would be discriminating against him if they even
mentioned it.

<p>

<li>In 1993, a computer software company in California hired a
temporary employee, who turned out to have been a man dressed
as a woman. One of the women who worked at the company suspected
the &quot;woman&quot; was really a man, and she warned other women
that &quot;she&quot; might use the rest room. Many of the female
employees opted to go several blocks away to use the rest room
of a fast-food restaurant. When &quot;her&quot; temporary employment
was at an end, the &quot;woman&quot; applied for permanent status.
The employer, who still did not know the &quot;woman&quot; was
really a man, declined on the basis that &quot;she&quot; was overqualified
for the position and also had &quot;a chip on her shoulder.&quot;
The &quot;woman&quot; sued the company, claiming discrimination
based on &quot;sexual orientation.&quot; The employer settled
out of court in 1995, paying the &quot;woman&quot; $600,000, as
well as incurring $600,000 in legal bills. As a result of this
expensive legal attack, the company immediately laid off eight
employees and has not yet recovered, dropping from more than 50
to 30 employees.[9]

<p>

<li>An electrician at a large company in Michigan recently wrote
a letter to company management politely protesting a visit by
two homosexual clergymen who had presented materials claiming
that the Apostle Paul, The Old Testament's Jonathan and David,
and probably Jesus Christ were all homosexual and that the Bible
never really condemns homosexuality. The electrician's letter
rebutted the theories. A copy of the letter was taken from one
employee's personal mailbox and left in the mailbox of a woman
known for her lesbian activism within the company. She complained
that this constituted harassment because of her sexual orientation.
The man whose mailbox the letter had been in originally was downgraded
in tradesman's status, effectively costing him $3,000 to $5,000
per year in salary. Other employees who helped type the letter
were summoned before Human Resources and disciplined individually.
The man who wrote the letter has been told his job is now in jeopardy
and faces more hearings before the Human Resources Department.[10]

<p>

<li>In Hollywood, an orthodox Jew was working at his desk when
two homosexual colleagues stopped nearby. They discussed openly
and graphically a homosexual porn film that one of them had seen.
The Orthodox Jew, who says he has nothing against homosexuals
but does not approve of homosexuality, asked them politely not
to talk about pornography around him. The two men charged him
with sexual harassment. Apparently, any interference with their
enjoyment of a sexually-explicit, &quot;gay&quot; pornographic
film (even after the fact) constituted disapproval of their &quot;sexual
orientation.&quot;[11]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

ENDA is so broad that any bizarre sexual behavior would be protected.
Under this legislation, if an employer heard that a highly visible
employee was openly flaunting his sexual tastes, having highly
noticeable adulterous affairs, or discussing his taste for pornography
with other employees, the employer would have no recourse. Even
asking about such activities might be construed as sexual harassment
based on sexual orientation. Since courts consistently have found
that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is meaningless without sexual
activity itself, any legislation based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
defends all sexual behavior and declares it to be irrelevant to
the employer and to customers.

<p>

What at first glance appears to be a harmless gesture of 
&quot;tolerance&quot; toward homosexuals in the workplace actually is 
a mighty weapon to be used against employers, other employees who 
believe that homosexuality is wrong, and against the freedoms of 
association, religion and speech. It would distort the concept of civil 
rights by creating an unprecedented behavioral component whose outer
limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

<center><h3>KEY POINTS</h3></center>

<p><ul>

<li>ENDA has nothing to do with the Defense of Marriage Act and
should be judged on its own merits at a later date.

<p>

<li>Americans favor equal rights, not special rights, for gays
in the workplace. Homosexuals deserve the same rights as other
Americans -- no more, no less.

<p>

<li>Senators Kennedy, Jeffords and Lieberman dismiss opposition
to ENDA as mere &quot;prejudice.&quot;[12] If they prevail and ENDA
becomes law, then the biblically-held views of millions of Americans
will be actively suppressed by their own government in the name
of &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<p>

<li>ENDA ought to be called the Government Lawyers Expansion Act,
since it would result in so many opportunities for the use of
lawsuits to expand federal power.

<p>

<li>Legitimate minorities will see their own efforts to ensure
equal treatment undermined by this unwarranted expansion of claims
by a group that in no way shares their history.

<p>

<li>As a group, homosexuals enjoy enormous economic and political
power, and are not disadvantaged the way true minorities have
been.[13] Civil rights laws were enacted to
offset discrimination against African-Americans, but homosexuals
can claim no such victim status as an oppressed, poor minority.
They are trying to hijack a movement for their own advantage.

<p>

Parents are rightfully concerned about and possibly confused by
the recent flurry of teen drug abuse reports.  The numbers seem
high and appear to be getting worse.  This paper will profile
the latest reports focusing on drug abuse by adolescents (ages
12 to 17).

<p>

The studies found:

<p><ul>

<li>Teenagers in trend-setting California are abusing drugs at
levels that rival peaks more than a decade ago.

<p>

<li>There is a significant downward shift in the number of teens
who perceive drug risks.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among teenagers.

<p>

<li>Parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs can make
a significant difference.

<p>

<li>In 1995, heroin- and marijuana-related emergency room episodes
rose 19 and 17 percent, respectively.

<p>

<li>Most of the rise in heroin abuse is due to increased snorting
and smoking rather than needle injecting.

<p>

<li>Black teenagers are the most affected by the surge in marijuana
abuse (up 195 percent for males and 253 percent for females).

<p>

<li>Nearly half (44 percent) of all high school students smoked
cigarettes at least once last year.

<p>

<li>There is conflicting evidence that cigarettes may or may not
act as a gateway to illicit drug abuse.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>1995 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

On August 20, 1996 the federal government reported that adolescent
drug abuse is rising fast.  Alarms over the drug scourge sounded
across the country.

<p>

Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, warned,
&quot;Drug, alcohol and tobacco use by young people is a poison
in the well of our national future.&quot;  White House Drug Policy
Director General Barry McCaffrey said, &quot;We must not allow
drug use by young Americans to return to the disastrous levels
of the 1970's and early 1980's. That would be a tragedy.&quot;[1]

<p>

The 1995 National Household Survey (NHS) on Drug Abuse found that
an estimated 12.8 million Americans were current illicit drug
users.  In 1992, the rate of past-month illicit drug abuse by
adolescents (ages 12 to 17) reached a low of 5.3 percent. By
1995 it had climbed to 8.2 percent and now it is at 10.9 percent.
That is a 105 percent increase over the past three years.[2]

<p>

The NHS is a representative national sample and has been done
annually since 1971.  Since 1992, the survey has been supported
and directed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), which is part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.

<p>

In 1995, the teen drug of choice was marijuana.  The rate of past-month
use of marijuana jumped 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Since
1992, the rate has more than doubled.

<p>

The abuse of so-called &quot;hard&quot; drugs is especially alarming.
The NHS found that past-month adolescent abuse of cocaine shot
up 166 percent between 1994 and 1995, and LSD abuse rose 55 percent.

<p>

Perhaps more alarming are the number of recent first-time abusers.
Looking back over the past three decades (1964 to 1994), the
number of first-time adolescent abusers (ages 12 to 17) across
many illicit drugs has increased dramatically and especially over
the past four years. Consider the facts.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Since 1991 the number of first time adolescent
abusers has risen 95 percent. Looking back three decades to 1964
there were 4,400 first-time marijuana users while in 1994 there
were 74,200.  That's an incredible increase of 1,600 percent.
<I>(Marijuana First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
1)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. The number of first time adolescent cocaine
abusers has risen 820 percent since 1964 and 127 percent in just
the past three years.  In 1964, there were 1,100 first-time abusers
and 10,200 first-time abusers in 1994.<I>(Cocaine First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 2)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Inhalants</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time inhalant
abusers has increased 98 percent, and the number of first-time
inhalant abusers has increased 11,100 percent since 1964.  In
1994, NHS found that 22,200 teenagers abused inhalants for the
first time.  <I>(Inhalant First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994,
Figure 3)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time
hallucinogen abusers has increased 108 percent and the number
of first-time hallucinogen abusers has increased 2,000 percent
since 1964.  In 1994, NHS found that 23,300 teenagers abused
hallucinogens for the first time.  <I>(Hallucinogen First-Time
Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 4)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time heroin
abusers has increased 320 percent and the number of first-time
heroin abusers has increased 600 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 2,100 teenagers abused heroin for the first time.
<I>(Heroin First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 5)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time alcohol
abusers has increased 38 percent and the number of first-time
alcohol abusers has increased 277 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 171,900 teenagers abused alcohol for the first
time. <I>(Alcohol First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
6)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time cigarette
abusers has increased 16 percent and the number of first-time
cigarette abusers has increased 33 percent since 1964.  In 1993,
NHS found that 125,400 teenagers abused cigarettes for the first
time.  The study found that teenagers who smoked were about eight
times as likely to use illicit drugs and 11 times as likely to
drink heavily as nonsmoking teens.  <I>(Cigarette First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 7)</I>

</ul><p>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, also conducted by SAMHSA, reported
an increase in drug-related emergency room visits.  There were
531,800 drug-related visits last year, and the greatest increases
were attributed to heroin and marijuana-related episodes (up 19
percent and 17 percent, respectively, from 1994).  The most commonly
reported motive for taking a substance was &quot;suicide attempt
or gesture&quot; (38 percent).[3]

<p>

<center><h3>MONITORING THE FUTURE STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Another government-sponsored study found similar teenage drug
abuse trends.  &quot;Monitoring the Future:  A Continuing Study
of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth&quot; is conducted by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.[4] The study surveyed 50,000
8th-, 10th- and 12th- graders from 435 public and private schools
during the spring of 1995.

<p>

The proportion of 8th-graders taking any illicit drug has doubled
since 1991.  Since 1992 the proportion of any illicit drug abuse
has risen 65 percent among 10th-graders and 44 percent among 12th-graders.
The details are outlined below.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Between 1991 and 1995, lifetime abuse among
8th-graders rose 166 percent (from 6 percent to 16 percent). 
Among 10th-graders annual abuse almost doubled from 15 percent
in 1992 to 29 percent in 1995.  Among 12th-graders annual abuse
increased 59 percent from 22 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in
1995. Nearly one in 20 high school seniors was a daily marijuana
abuser.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. LSD abuse continued to rise.  The proportions
reporting abuse were 3 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders respectively. Between 1991 and 1995 annual
abuse rose 76 percent for 8th-graders; 89 percent for 10th-graders;
and 54 percent for 12th-graders. For 12th-graders abuse within
the last month was up 37 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Hallucinogens other than LSD showed
a smaller increase in 1995. The annual prevalence rates for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders were 2 percent, 3 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse rose 136
percent for 8th-graders; 59 percent for 10th-graders; and 14 percent
among 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Crack cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse
rose 129 percent for 8th-graders; 100 percent for 10th-graders;
and 40 percent for 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Annual abuse in 1995 was between 1.1 percent
and 1.4 percent for all three grade levels -- a rise of 57 to
150 percent.  The investigators hypothesized that non-injection
forms of use like snorting and smoking account for the recent
rise.  Many heroin abusers reported only non-injectable use (32
percent, 45 percent, and 57 percent of past-year heroin users
for grades 8, 10 and 12, respectively).

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a
row) was reported by 15 percent of 8th-graders; 24 percent of
10th-graders; and 30 percent of 12th-graders.

</ul><p>

Fewer students report seeing drugs as dangerous.  The risk perception
for marijuana dropped from 79 percent of 12th-graders in 1991
to 61 percent in 1995.  There was also a decline in the perceived
dangers of using crack cocaine, cocaine powder, LSD and heroin.

<p>

Lloyd Johnston, principal investigator of the Michigan study,
blames the lack of information and anti-drug emphasis for the
growing drug problem.  &quot;These newest waves of children entering
adolescence,&quot; said Johnston, &quot;have had less opportunity
to learn about the dangers of drugs than did youngsters who grew
up in the eighties.... During the last three or four years the
amount of public attention paid to the drug problem, and its ravages,
has plummeted.  There are dramatically fewer newscasts on the
subject and fewer anti-drug commercials are getting on the air.&quot;[5]

<p>

Johnston says that most Americans still see drugs as dangerous
but warns &quot;there is a clear erosion in these attitudes and
beliefs, and we conclude that this erosion explains most of the
change in their actual drug-using behaviors.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>TREND-SETTING STATE ABUSE UP</h3></center>

<p>

California has long been identified as the nation's trend setter.
A recent report from that state should shock all Americans.

<p>

On August 26, 1996, California's Attorney General released a new
statewide survey that shows drug abuse rising rapidly.[6] Dan Lungren,
the attorney general, said, &quot;In the late 80's, drug use among
California students decreased.  In the early 90's, it mostly leveled
off, with some warning signs of small increases.  Over the past
four years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in drug use
among students -- back to levels that rival peaks ten years ago.&quot;

<p>

The sixth biennial &quot;California Student Substance Use Survey&quot;
polled public school students in grades 7, 9 and 11. Based on
student reports of drug use within the past six months, it found:

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. More than a third (34.2 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 60 percent
rise in four years.  Nearly half (42.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 46 percent
rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Amphetamine</b>.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of
9th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past six months,
a 227 percent rise in four years.  More than one in ten (10.4
percent) of 11th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past
six months, a 53 percent rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. Nearly one in ten (9.9 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 161 percent rise
in four years.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 33 percent rise
in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Heroin abuse for 9th-graders has jumped from
1.0 percent in the last survey to 2.9 percent, a 190 percent increase
in just two years.  Eleventh-graders have seen a 69 percent increase
in the last four years.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Cocaine abuse among 9th-graders has jumped
78 percent in the last four years.  For 11th-graders it has risen
9 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Most teens have used alcohol in the last
six months (50.3 percent of 7th-graders; 67.2 percent of 9th-graders;
and 75.3 percent of 11th-graders).

</ul><p>

Attorney General Lungren blames parents and the pop culture for
rising abuse rates.  He says some of the parents are abusers themselves.
The glamorization of heroin is the most recent example of media's
drug promotion effort.  &quot;We can look to the advertising business
to spot a trend,&quot; says Lungren. &quot;Companies such as Gucci
and Versace use emaciated, pale models with dark circles under
their eyes, known as the 'heroin chic' look, to sell clothing.
One company goes so far as to have one of its models roll up
his sleeve, as if he is getting ready to 'shoot up.'&quot;

<p>

Lungren called for a &quot;return to the power&quot; of the truth.
&quot;Our national commitment in the 1980s to a cultural discouragement
of drugs with its emphasis on youth prevention and zero tolerance
worked,&quot; said Lungren.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S LARGEST PARENT GROUP<br>
FINDS HIGH DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) announced
that teenagers are using drugs more and too few parents are doing
what they can to prevent it.

<p>

On November 2, 1995, PRIDE reported significant increases in cigarette
and marijuana abuse among students in grades 6 through 12.[7] There
were also rises in cocaine and hallucinogen abuse.

<p>

PRIDE's annual survey, which included nearly 200,000 students,
found the following levels of drug abuse.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana.</b> One third of high school seniors smoked
marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent smoke monthly.  Nine
of 10 marijuana smoking seniors said they started pot smoking
during high school years at ages 14 to 17.  Young blacks are the
most affected by the surge in marijuana abuse.  Use among black
males rose by 195 percent (4.5 percent to 13.3 percent) in the
past four years, and use by black females rose by 253 percent
(1.9 percent to 6.7 percent).

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. PRIDE found a 36 percent increase (3.3 percent
to 4.5 percent) in cocaine use by high school students since 1991-92.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogen</b>. Use has risen 75 percent (4.4 percent
to 7.7 percent) since 1988-89.

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Cigarette abuse has reached its highest
level since PRIDE began surveying.  Nearly half (44 percent) of
all high school students smoked at least once in the past year,
compared with 37 percent in 1988-89.

</ul><p>

PRIDE found that parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs
can make a difference. Drug abuse declined among students whose 
parents frequently discussed drugs with them.  Among high school 
students whose parents &quot;never&quot; talk about drugs, 
one-third (34 percent) smoked marijuana, versus
one-quarter (24 percent) among high school students who said they
talk with their parents &quot;a lot&quot; about drugs.

<p>

Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE, said, &quot;The most effective
drug prevention program in the world -- parental intervention
-- is used far less than we think.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>1996 SURVEY BY PARTNERSHIP FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA</h3></center>

<p>

Drug surveys have consistently shown that abuse rises as perception
of risk falls.  A recent nationwide survey validates this observation.

<p>

&quot;Changes in attitudes drive changes in behavior,&quot; said
Ginna Marston, director of research and strategic development
for Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  &quot;These findings
tell us one thing:  drug use will continue increasing among teenagers
until these attitudes change.&quot;[8]

<p>

In 1996, PDFA announced the results of its annual Partnership
Attitude Tracking Study.  This is the largest, ongoing body of
research on drug-related attitudes in America.  The survey sampled
teenagers, pre-teens and parents about attitudes, parent-child
communication and risks.  It found:

<p><ul>

<li>Adolescents see fewer physical and social risks in illicit
drugs.

<p>

<li>Most (60 percent) baby boomer parents are drug experienced.

<p>

<li>Three out of four boomer parents do not want their teenagers
experimenting with drugs.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among their teenagers (14 percent of parents believe their children
have experimented with marijuana but 38 percent of teens report
smoking pot).

<p>

<li>There is a communication gap between teens and parents.  Most
parents (95 percent) say they have talked with their children
about drugs, but only 77 percent of teens agree.

</ul><p>

There has also been a shift in the drug risks perceived by teenagers.

<p><ul>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement &quot;taking
drugs scares me&quot; declined from 47 percent in 1993 to 36 percent
in 1995.

<p>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement that they
do not want to hang around with drug users declined from 55 percent
in 1993 to 39 percent in 1995.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in regular and trial use of marijuana.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in both crack and cocaine abuse.

</ul><p>

The study speculated about why there has been a drop in perceived
drug risks.

<p><ul>

<li>Select music groups encourage marijuana legalization.   In
1995, Capricorn Records released <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit
album for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML).  At least 45 bands have declared support for legalizing
marijuana.

<p>

<li>Marijuana abuse is portrayed lightly or as inconsequential
behavior. The number of drug-related stories airing on the three
major television networks between 1989 and 1994 declined by more
than 83 percent (from 518 stories in 1989 to 82 in 1994).  Some
of the programs were veiled drug promotions like <I>ABC</I>'s
&quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 6, 1995) and <I>Discovery Channel's</I> &quot;The War on
Drugs&quot; (June 20, 1995).  Even the network news favorably
profiled marijuana.  For example, <I>NBC</I>'s <I>Nightly News</I>
aired a one-sided viewpoint by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a member
of NORML.  The <I>NBC</I> &quot;Health News&quot; segment by Robert
Bazell interviewed many people who claim marijuana helps them
with medical problems that include AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma,
and cancer.  <I>NBC</I> ignored more than 10,500 scientific studies
which chronicle the adverse consequences of marijuana use.

<p>

<li>The marijuana fashion craze in the early 1990s attracted wide
media attention.  Companies like Adidas have popularized marijuana
through the introduction of &quot;The Hemp&quot; shoe.  Hemp is
a name for the type of plant from which marijuana is derived.

<p>

<li>The public continues to debate the legalization of drugs.
Several years ago, the Surgeon General called for a study of
drug legalization.  Noted conservative columnist William F. Buckley,
Jr. called for legalization in a widely publicized edition of
<I>National Review</I> (February 12, 1996).  On November 5, 1996
Californians will be asked to decide whether to legalize marijuana
for medicinal purposes.

</ul><p>

&quot;With teenagers seeing fewer risks with marijuana and drug
use,&quot; said Partnership Chairman James Burke, &quot;we can
expect to see another increase in adolescent drug use in 1996....
After years of tremendous progress, the country is losing precious,
hard-won ground in its effort to curb adolescent drug use.  Today's
drug trends are similar to those of the late 1960s, and the outlook
for the near future is disturbing.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SURVEY LINKS DRUG ABUSE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h3></center>

<p>

Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.

<p>

The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[9]

<p>

&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
president and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;

<p>

The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents,
asked, &quot;What is the most important problem facing kids today?&quot;
One-third of the adolescents answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant
second with 13 percent was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot;
which often also involves drugs.

<p>

<center><h3>TARGETING THE TOBACCO GATEWAY</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration has chosen to avoid the epidemic of
illicit drug abuse and/or attack it indirectly via a frontal assault
on tobacco.  It has launched a major assault on teen tobacco abuse
by issuing a presidential executive order to classify nicotine
as a drug.  Apparently the President believes reducing tobacco's
availability will protect teenagers from the temptation of cigarettes
and will impact the illicit drug problem because tobacco abuse
as a gateway to illicit drugs.  But not all experts agree.

<p>

Tobacco is not necessarily a gateway for illicit drugs.  According
to an Abt. Associates Inc. memorandum dated August 28, 1995 and
given to the White House, &quot;Smokers do not necessarily become
marijuana users.&quot;  Abt.'s reports that &quot;about two of
every three marijuana users became marijuana users before they
smoked cigarettes.&quot;[10]

<p>

The &quot;gateway&quot; theory is bolstered, however, by Lloyd
Johnston, the principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future
Study.  He wrote in 1995, &quot;[c]igarette smoking is strongly
correlated with the use of marijuana, and suggest[s] that the
upturn in cigarette smoking during the past four to five years
may well have contributed to the increase in marijuana use of
the same period.  Because smoking usually precedes marijuana use
and teaches youngsters how to take smoke into their lungs to secure
a drug-induced effect, it provides an excellent training ground
for learning how to smoke marijuana.&quot;[11]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool are only part of the answer
to the illicit drug plague.  Leaders at all levels must speak
out against the danger of illicit drugs.  Strong law enforcement
must stop the supply, and parents must communicate frankly and
frequently with their children.  Drugs should be demonized not
glamorized by the media.  These changes will go a long way to
increase the perceived level of risk for teenagers.

<p>

The facts about drugs are clear  -- illicit drug abuse is rising.
Now is not the time to divert attention away from the dangerous
threat of illicit drugs.   Most Americans want a tough line on
drugs.  They know that taking a tough line will save lives and
taxpayer money.

<h2>FAITH-BASED<br>
PRISON PROGRAMS<br>
CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</h2>

<p>

Crime in America seems out of control.  The government's response
has been to build more prisons and keep convicts behind bars longer.
But that won't cut growing incarceration costs and high recidivism
rates. Such cuts should be the goal, and faith-based prison programs
can help.

<p>

&quot;I believe moral rehabilitation,&quot; says Burl Cain, warden
of the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola, &quot;is the only
true rehabilitation there is.&quot;[1]

<p>

Although most Americans support punishment for criminal offenders,
there is a growing consensus that there is more to solving the
crime problem. &quot;The nation's crime and prison problem is
fundamentally a moral and spiritual problem,&quot; says Richard
Rettig, chairman of University of Central Oklahoma's sociology
and criminal justice department.  &quot;We should bring the criminal
abusers not to a punishing environment which hurts and kills,
but unto a God that heals,&quot; Rettig says.[2]

<p>

Whitney Kuniholm is the executive vice president of Prison Fellowship,
the world's largest prison ministry.  Kuniholm explains, &quot;You
can have job programs, literacy programs, drug programs and educational
programs, but unless something changes on the inside [of the person],
that stuff isn't going to make a difference.&quot;[3] Inmates agree.

<p><ul>

<li>Bill McCall, a convicted murderer in Indiana, explains, &quot;Before
I became a Christian, there was no way I could deal with what
I had done.  But now that I know God has forgiven me, I can forgive
myself.&quot;[4]

<p>

<li>Mark Wiggins, a Texas inmate convicted of possession of a
sawed-off shotgun, says, &quot;I was just out of control, totally
out of control.  I had no love, no sense of caring, no sense of
anything.  I just...didn't care.&quot;  Wiggins says he became
a Christian through the unswerving efforts of his wife.  He says
he was simply tired of losing and wanted to change.  &quot;Now
I feel a sense of peace inside of me that I've never felt,&quot;
he says.[5]

<p>

<li>Ex-convict Billy Greer, once an armed robber and drug dealer,
has been out of prison and straight for three years.  &quot;I
place God first and I'm able to overcome the temptation,&quot;
says Greer, &quot;because God, to me, is greater.&quot;[6]

</ul><p>

North Carolina's former secretary of corrections, Aaron Johnson,
says Prison Fellowship's religious programs made his prisons more
manageable.  &quot;There was a change in the environment in those
prisons.  Infraction rates went down in almost every prison.&quot;[7]
This is good news for taxpayers because these programs lead
to lower operating costs, more frequent parole, and reduced recidivism.

<p>

Cost-conscious states are taking notice.  Texas Governor George
Bush may soon give approval for a private, faith-based prison.
Not only does the program promise to save the taxpayer millions
in operating costs, but it gives hope to Texas citizens that fewer
convicts will leave prison only to commit more crimes.

<p>

Before considering the benefits of faith-based prison programs,
however, consider a profile of the worsening crime problem and
America's prison system.  This profile will help one appreciate
just how desperate we are for better solutions.

<p>

<center><h3>SOCIETY COPING WITH CRIME</h3></center>

<p>

The U.S. has tripled its prison population in the past 15 years,
and the Rand Corporation projects it will double again over the
next decade.[8] Meanwhile, prison costs doubled to $24.6 billion
over the past decade, and experts foresee substantial increases
in the future.

<p>

A U.S. Justice Department study found that more than half (62.5
percent) of all released state prisoners are rearrested for a
felony or serious misdemeanor within three years, and almost half
(41.4 percent) return to prison.[10] This is in spite of a serious
decline in the crime clearance rate (the rate at which police
identify and arrest suspects).  Since 1955, the probability of
a murderer being arrested has declined 26 percent, and for a rapist
the probability has gone down 27 percent.[11]

<p>

Keeping chronic and violent criminals in jail makes sense.  &quot;All
of us look at the futility of having to spend money on prisons,&quot;
says John Engler, governor of Michigan, &quot;but we recognize
the public necessity.&quot;[12] That's why Virginia's governor, George
Allen, ended parole and more than doubled expected prison time
for many offenders.  &quot;People were disgusted with the dishonesty
and leniency of the system,&quot; Allen says.[13]

<p>

Americans aren't so concerned about punishing criminals as they
are about keeping the fox out of the chicken coop.  For example,
a 1994 nationwide Wirthlin Group poll asked, &quot;What do you
feel is the main purpose of prisons?&quot;  To that question,
61 percent said, &quot;to keep criminals out of society.&quot;[14]
Almost three in four (73 percent) Americans told <I>ABC News</I> 
that they approve of building more prisons so that
longer sentences can be given to prisoners.[15]

<p>

John J. DiIulio, a criminologist and Brookings and Manhattan Institute
scholar, explains that there are financial benefits to locking
up chronic criminals.  &quot;It costs society at least twice as
much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.&quot;[16] In fact,
according to Patrick Langan, a senior statistician with the Justice
Department, tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 likely
prevented 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults
in 1989 alone.  Given that each murder costs society $2.4 million,
each rape $60,000, each arson $50,000, imprisoning violent criminals
can be a bargain.

<p>

Indeed, many Americans are persuaded that prisons are worth the
cost.  According to William and Mary College economists Thomas
Marvell and Carlisle Moody, 21 crimes are averted for each criminal
who is kept off the street.[18] That translates into hundreds of
billions of annual savings in costs to society.

<p>

The enthusiasm for more prisons and longer sentences is not universal,
however.  Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU's National Prison Project
opposes the current rate of incarceration.  &quot;There is a spirit
of meanness, selfishness and punitiveness,&quot; says Bronstein,
&quot;that seems to have no bounds.&quot;[19] Tim Matthews of the
American Probation and Parole Association says, &quot;It doesn't
take an Einstein to tell you if prison were the answer, crime
should have dropped.&quot;[20]

<p>

The immediate answer, of course, is that crime <I>has</I> dropped.
Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and murder 
dropped 12 percent, the largest drop in the murder rate in years and six 
times larger than the drop in the same period in 1994.[21]

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics &quot;will
give us a false sense of security.&quot;[22] This is especially true
for young offenders, where problems have been growing in recent
years -- and are apt to get worse before they get better.

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking rate of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens from 15 to 19 years of age
will increase by 23 percent, and a very large proportion of these
teens will be coming from homes without fathers.  Given the clear
and established correlation between father absence and crime,
some experts estimate that violent crime like murder could increase
to 40,000 killings per year -- up 60 percent from current levels.[23]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles, warns, &quot;There's a tornado coming.
We can't stop it.  We have to prepare for it.&quot;[24] The future
portends escalating violent crime and a growing need for prisons
and longer sentences unless something dramatic is done.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICAN PRISONS: PUNISHMENT OR REHABILITATION?</h3></center>

<p>

The question that must be answered is, &quot;What are prisons
supposed to do?&quot;  The U.S. has a history of vacillating between
rehabilitation and punishment for inmates.  The pendulum is now
moving away from rehabilitation.

<p>

&quot;I'm sick and tired of these people getting by with murder
and rape and child molestation and just being allowed to be in
jail.&quot;[25] Illinois Senator Adeline Geo-Karis said these words
just before the state senate approved legislation setting up a
chain gang program. She explained, &quot;I say, let them out
in the rock pile to pay their penalty. No more mollycoddling!&quot;[26]

<p>

A 1995 <I>Time/CNN</I> poll found that two in three Americans
(67 percent) believe prisons are too lenient.[27] Two-thirds favor
chain gangs and half would deny inmates television and barbells.[28]
Texas Senator Phil Gramm says, &quot;We've got to stop building
prisons like Holiday Inns.&quot;[29]

<p>

Within the penal system, there are a variety of prisons and operating
philosophies.  There are ultra-maximum-security prisons like the
one near Florence, Colorado.  Here are housed the nation's 484
toughest federal prisoners.  The 428,000-square-foot facility
has 168 videocameras and 1,400 electronically controlled gates.
Each cell has unmovable cement furniture and a small black-and-white
TV.[30]

<p>

Despite its effectiveness, James Joy, Colorado's ACLU director,
says, &quot;The prison is designed to drive people crazy, to break
them psychologically, by locking them up with no meaningful human
contact.&quot;[31]

<p>

Sheriff Joe Arpaio runs a no-frills prison for Maricopa County,
Arizona. He has organized prisoners into chain gangs, houses
them in tents in the scorching desert sun and feeds them baloney
sandwiches with no coffee. Inmates are denied broadcast television
but given educational programming. &quot;I want to make this
place so unpleasant that they won't even think about doing something
that could bring them back,&quot; says Arpaio. &quot;I want them
to suffer.&quot;[32]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called for a fundamental overhaul
of the prison system.[33] He's joined by Rep. James Moran (D-Va.),
who wants a better balance between punishment and rehabilitation.
America needs &quot;an effective criminal justice system,&quot;
says Moran, &quot;not only punishing offenders, but also on teaching
the skills and discipline necessary to keep them from becoming
repeat offenders.&quot;[34]

<p>

The cadillac of prisons is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania.
McKean Medium-Security Prison is labeled by some as a &quot;resort&quot;
or &quot;country club.&quot;  The taxpayer pays $15,370 for each
inmate per year.[35]

<p>

DiIulio says, &quot;McKean is probably the best-managed prison
in the country, and that has everything to do with a warden named
Dennis Luther.&quot;  Luther's success is attributed to his philosophy
of building a &quot;prison culture&quot; that includes unconditional
respect for inmates as people.  Luther explains, &quot;If you
want people to behave responsibility, and treat you with respect,
then you treat other people that way.&quot;[36]

<p>

Nearly half (47 percent) of McKean inmates are enrolled in education
classes.  According to DiIulio, &quot;In some prison systems,
cost-effective management is possible only because programs keep
prisoners busy, with less supervision than you'd need otherwise.&quot;[37]

<p>

McKean is the exception among prisons.  Most prisons are by design
very inhospitable places.  William Weld, governor of Massachusetts,
expresses a widely-held view about prisons saying they should
be &quot;a tour through the circles of hell,&quot; where inmates
learn only &quot;the joys of busting rocks.&quot;  The fact that
most prisons are &quot;a tour through the circles of hell&quot;
explains why an inmate serving a life term in New Jersey said,
&quot;You create Spartan conditions, you're gonna get gladiators.&quot;[38]

<p>

This inmate's perspective is understandable and all too common.
According to former Arkansas corrections commissioner Don Hutto,
&quot;One prison I worked in had a sewage problem....But the state
budget people told me it would take four years to get the money
for a new sewage treatment plant....The inmates knew they were
at risk and they protested.  We had to discipline them, even though
they had a good case. It was like that with nearly all the projects
I tried to get started, and then people wonder why there's a prison
riot.&quot;[39]

<p>

Incarceration has at least four social benefits:  retribution,
deterrence, rehabilitation and incapacitation.[40] Recent trends
have been weighed more heavily on the side of retribution and
incapacitation. Meanwhile, prisoners are more diverse, harder
to control and often re-enter society better criminals than ever
before.  Evidence abounds that our penal system is failing to
curb recidivism and costs, and in many instances prisons serve
as advanced training centers for more sophisticated or violent
crimes.

<p>

Overcrowding is driving a rush to build new facilities, such as
in Texas, which has launched a prison construction boom to raise
its capacity from 38,000 in 1987 to 150,000 by 1997.[41] The U.S.
has 1,037 state and federal prisons which are operating at between
17 and 36 percent above capacity.[42]

<p>

Incarceration costs are also rising.  For 1995, states appropriated
$18 billion for corrections, making this the fastest-growing item
in state budgets.[43] According to the Justice Department, the average
annual spending per prisoner is $15,586 for the states and $14,456
for federal prisons.[44] These figures do not include hidden and
indirect costs which significantly elevate the outlays to anywhere
from $25,000 to $40,000 per prisoner.

<p>

A number of factors drive escalating costs -- more inmates, numerous
drug-addicted and violent offenders (who cost more to supervise
than other prisoners), more prison gangs and other anti-social
groups, diverse ethnic make-up, more elderly prisoners who require
special care, and the unprecedented explosion of prisoner lawsuits.
The most expensive prison service, however, is health care.

<p>

Prisoner health care takes 21 percent of the typical state's corrections
budget.[45] The high costs are dictated by the generally rising costs
of health care in society, but also because inmates are far more
likely to have chronic diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis than
the general population.  Annual health care costs per prisoner
range from $634 per inmate in Louisiana to $3,264 per inmate in
Massachusetts.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISONS FOR PROFIT</h3></center>

<p>

Jimmy Turner, now a prison warden with the for-profit Corrections
Corporation of America (CCA), spoke of the Texas state prison
system, explaining, &quot;We were taught that communication only
went one way....A prisoner did what you told him. That works,
if you can afford to let prisoners get angry and tear up the place.
No one is going to care if he wrecks a $1,500 sink in his jail
cell. The state will foot the cost.&quot;[47]

<p>

Many states are seeking commercial prison alternatives because
costs are spiraling out of control.  CCA is the largest private
operator of prisons in the U.S.  The chairman of the CCA said,
&quot;It seemed such a logical idea when we started....As long
as there's a monopoly, there is going to be inefficiency, and
government is the biggest monopoly of all.&quot;[48]

<p>

CCA contends that it can build prisons cheaper and run them better
than can the government.  &quot;Anyone who has worked in prisons
learns pretty quickly that when people are treated humanely, in
a way that maintains their dignity, the environment is safer,&quot;
says Don Hutto, who helped found the corporation in 1983, &quot;but
that's not what often happens in public prisons.&quot;[49]

<p>

James Wiedenman, a CCA shift commander, prefers CCA's approach,
explaining, &quot;The atmosphere in those places [state-run prisons]
was awful....The prison administration was even more of an enemy
than the inmates were.  You didn't see the warden for more than
once in six months....Most of us [guards] got into this business
because we like what we do, but if I hadn't moved into the private
sector, I think I would have found another career.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISON POPULATION</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, 1.6 million people were in federal, state and local prisons
and/or jails.  That's 387 incarcerated Americans per 100,000 population,
up from 139 in 1980, making the U.S. the leading jailkeeper in
the western world.[51] More than half (60 percent)[52] of all federal
prisoners are serving time for drug-related offenses, while 94
percent[53] of state prisoners are serving time for violence-related
offenses.

<p>

Most prisoners have long criminal histories beginning with extensive
juvenile records. Two out of three prisoners have served time
in a juvenile institution, but their juvenile files are seldom
available to judges when deciding on adult sentences.[54]

<p>

What's more frightening than the offenses for which these inmates
are currently serving are those crimes they committed for which
they were never convicted.  In the late 1970s, the Rand Corporation
surveyed prisoners in Texas, Michigan and California and found
that the median number of admitted crimes committed by each inmate
in the year prior to their incarceration was 15.[55]

<P>

Most state inmates become hardened veterans of the prison system.
More than 60 percent have been incarcerated before, and nearly
all of these (91 percent) have been in jail or prison for an offense
within the five years preceding their current offense.[56] Convicted
rapists and murderers are by far the most likely of all felons
to return to prison.[57] Only 19 percent are serving their first
sentence.[58]

<P>

The typical prisoner is poorly educated.  Seven in 10 inmates
have no high school diploma, and most (66 percent) are illiterate
with limited marketable skills.[59] Three-quarters are drug or alcohol
abusers at the time of incarceration, and most female inmates
leave children behind when they go to prison.[60]

<P>

The prison culture is often as bad as or worse than the lifestyles
inmates left behind.  Prisons are filled with some of society's
worst offenders.  Besides a host of bad company, the prisoner
experiences many deprivations which include restricted movement,
loss of possessions, loss of autonomy, and reduced contact with
family. Prisoners live in a very regimented, highly regulated
environment designed to control every aspect of behavior.

<p>

Male prisoners must often fight to survive.  They must be constantly
on guard for personal safety.  Homosexual rape is common, especially
for new inmates.  Gangs often define and control the prison experience.

<p>

<center><h3>DOES PRISON REHABILITATION WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

The taxpayer has a right to expect the prison system to be more
than a holding tank or a revolving door for criminals.  Most prisons,
however, are little more than expensive warehouses within which
inmates finely hone their criminal skills.

<p>

A 1974 review of 231 prison rehabilitation studies found that
correctional treatment showed no effect on recidivism. Robert
Martinson published a review, &quot;What Works - Questions and
Answers About Prison Reform,&quot; which helped move the rehabilitation
pendulum toward &quot;nothing works.&quot;[61] But Martinson's analysis
lacks support from some contemporary experts.

<p>

&quot;You are not going to rehabilitate the chronic offender,&quot;
says DiIulio, &quot;but it is also wrong to say we are not going
to rehabilitate anybody.&quot;[62] Most prison officials agree.

<p>

In 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee polled prison wardens
to discover their views on rehabilitation.  Wardens overwhelmingly
favor prison rehabilitation programs.  Ninety-three percent favor
literacy and other educational programs, 92 percent favor vocational
training, and 89 percent favor drug treatment.[63]

<p>

J. Michael Quinlan, a former director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, supports rehabilitation because it makes prison operations
more efficient.  &quot;It is absolutely the most important ingredient
in managing a safe and secure institution,&quot; says Quinlan,
&quot;to keep the inmates productively occupied, in either work
or education or drug treatment or structured recreation.&quot;[64]
Quinlan says, &quot;It is really a question of do we want to
pay now, or do we want to pay later.&quot;[65] Ninety-five percent
of inmates return to the streets. If they have been sitting idly
in prison, their chances of recidivating are higher than if they
have been involved in productive programs.[66]

<p>

Most prisoners are poor employment candidates.  A 1991 Justice
Department survey found that most (70 percent) prisoners earned
less than $15,000 in the year before their arrest.[67] A prison term
also worsens their job prospects.  These facts should support
efforts to increase inmate skills so as to improve their post-prison
employment chances.

<p>

A 1993 study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that many
prisoners want to participate in education programs to improve
their chances of finding a job, and thus not committing a crime
after release.[68] Numerous other studies have also found a strong
relationship between prison education and lower recidivism.[69]

<p>

Paul Barton, the co-author of a 1996 prison-based Educational
Testing Service study, found &quot;[s]olid information...about
how low the literacy level of prisoners is in relation to what
the job market needs.&quot;  Barton said, &quot;Education may
not be the sole answer to cutting recidivism, but the evidence
shows that it helps.&quot;[70]

<p>

Barton's study found that two-thirds of all inmates are substantially
behind the general population in literacy, even lower than the
average unskilled laborer. He said, &quot;They're not going to
make it when they get out. This is where a whole lot of our youth
are these days, especially minority youth.  For many of them,
it's their last chance for education.&quot;[71]

<p>

Prison-based work experience is another form of rehabilitation.
Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association,
says, &quot;It is a matter of public safety: inmates who have
worked in prison and gained new skills have a significantly better
chance of not returning to crime and prison.&quot;[72]

<p>

Former Attorney General Edwin Meese favors prison-based programs
as a means of reducing recidivism. &quot;Prison industries is
one management strategy that shows promise,&quot; explains Meese,
as a way to &quot;reduce recidivism and increase public safety.&quot;[73]

<p>

A 1991 Federal Bureau of Prisons study followed 7,000 inmates
after release.  Those who worked in prison had a 35 percent decrease
in recidivism the first year.[74] Prison-based work programs also
save on operating costs.

<p>

Prisoner wages are garnished to help pay for incarceration costs.
At least 25 states now have contracts with private firms that
employ inmates.[75] But such work programs are restricted by two
1930s-era federal laws that limit interstate commerce in prison-made
goods.

<p>

<center><h3>FAITH-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

Now that we have an overview of the prison problem and the most
popular approaches to dealing with the incarcerated, let's look
at other programs that have proven to be effective and most efficient
-- faith-based programs.

<p>

Todd Clear, a Rutgers University criminologist, says, &quot;Religious
programming is the single most common form of institutional program
for inmate management and rehabilitation.&quot;[76]

<p>

Jailhouse conversions are viewed skeptically by judges and parole
boards.  John Wiley, a UCLA law professor, cautions, &quot;There's
such an incentive to fabricate [a conversion] that it's difficult
to be convincing....The problem is that the best evidence of a
genuine conversion comes after the person leaves the prison.&quot;[77]

<p>

Wiley says people are often too quick to label conversions as
fake. &quot;Actually,&quot; says Wiley, &quot;prison is the kind
of environment that might well prompt a conversion.  It's a shattering...monkish
existence...a complete change in your life.  Sure, some turn to
the worst instincts.  But I don't think it's implausible that
some turn to the best.&quot;[78]

<p>

Todd Clear, who is also a fellow at the National Institute of
Justice, believes spiritual commitment makes a difference.  &quot;Prison
is designed as an experience to pull people out of their realities
so they can, in fact, confront who they are and what they've done
and try to commit to a different version of themselves....I mean,
we would want people who go to prison to admit that they did wrong....These
religious traditions fit into what we really want prison to do.&quot;[79]

<p>

Louisiana prison warden Cain agrees with Clear.  &quot;All these
men were looking for was something, just looking for something
to hang their hats on.  We ought to be ashamed for what we hadn't
done for them before. They were ready for God.  They were probably
more ready than anyone. Even though some of these people may
never be free from this place, they'll be free with eternal life.
That's what it's all about.&quot;[80]

<p>

Charles Adkins, an Indiana state prison official, says religion
is one of several rehabilitation avenues.[81] But it's the only approach
that addresses the root problem -- a moral crisis inside the inmate.

<p>

Paul Robinson, a law professor at Northwestern University, dissects
the root of crime.  Robinson asks, &quot;Why do people obey the
law?  People obey the law because they fear the disapproval of
their social group and because they generally see themselves as
moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it.&quot;[82]
The fact that many offenders come from social settings that approve
of anti-social behavior might, in part, explain their crime history.

<p>

&quot;Reinforcing the compliance powers of the social group and
personal morality,&quot; says  Robinson, &quot;could reduce crime
even if policing and prosecuting functions cannot be made more
effective.&quot;[83] Perhaps  this is why religion has been effective
for some prisoners.  Inmates who simultaneously experience a changed
personal morality (salvation or conversion) and then are totally
immersed in a faith community experience religion's life-changing
power.

<p>

Religion serves four roles in prison.  First, it provides answers
to the prisoner's questions about life.  Second, it provides rules
to adhere to, which makes inmate management easier.  Third, it
is experiential. In other words, something intrinsic takes place
(salvation or conversion) which is evident to the inmate and later
to those around him. Finally, religion plays a social role bringing
together like-minded inmates for worship, Bible study and other
faith-related activities. This togetherness gives the inmate
a sense of belonging and positively impacts the prison's culture.[84]

<p>

There is evidence that religion helps make prisons more manageable.
A 1992 Rutgers University study found that prisoners often seek
God to cope with inmate life, which is marked by depression, guilt
and self-contempt.[85] Todd Clear, the Rutgers researcher, found
that highly religious inmates evidence lower rates of depression
and commit fewer disciplinary infractions than other inmates.
In another study, correctional officials from three states credited
Prison Fellowship's religious programming with improved morale,
lower rates of depression and fewer disciplinary infractions.[86]

<p>

Inmates who are highly religious while in prison also tend to
have lower recidivism rates. A 1990 Prison Fellowship study of
360 ex-convicts found that only 40 percent of those who were heavily
involved in religious programs committed new crimes after release
compared with 51 percent of the non-religious group.[87] Although
this isn't an especially large margin, it's better than recidivism
results attributed solely to education, work or drug treatment
programs.

<p>

A 1996 Prison Fellowship study of 201 inmates involved in religious
programs found that high participation in Bible studies is related
to lower likelihood of arrest during the one-year follow-up period.[88]
A 1992 Prison Fellowship study of 225 New York inmates also found
that high religious program participation meant lower odds of
being re-arrested.[89]

<p>

<center><h3>BRING MORE RELIGION TO PRISON</h3></center>

<p>

If religion works better than other forms of prison rehabilitation,
then the taxpayer ought to favor more religious programming.
There is a problem however and it has more to do with what goes
on inside the prison than laws separating church and state functions.

<p>

Suzanne McElwain, chief chaplain at the Luther Luckett Correctional
Complex, La Grange, Kentucky, says, &quot;It's not cool to be
a Christian on this yard.&quot;[90] She finds that many inmates believe
Christ was killed on the cross because he wasn't smart enough
to avoid it.

<p>

&quot;We've got a lot of unchurched men here,&quot; says McElwain,
&quot;a lot of unbelievers, and a lot of people with an unhealthy
(image of ) God.&quot;[91] If religion is to help change inmates,
these barriers must be removed.

<p>

One means of removing these barriers is to embrace a prison concept
that involves all inmates in a prison-wide faith-based program.
Sociologist Rodney Stark writes in the <I>Journal of Research
in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;Religion only binds people
to the moral order if religious influences permeate the culture
and the social interactions of the individuals in question.&quot;[92]

<p>

A prison operated on a faith-based philosophy offers great promise.
Such an approach would introduce into the prison many desirable
attributes.  It opposes antisocial values, emphasizes responsibility
and accountability, advances non-deviant over socially deviant
behavior, promotes reconciliation, seeks to mediate conflict,
and champions social support and comfort for those in need.[93]

<p>

Although such a program is not for every inmate, it will work
for many.  For example, the Association for Protection and Assistance
of the Sentenced (APAC) is based on a unique prison model started
in Brazil 20 years ago.  The program restores inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families
and Creator. It also promises to reduce prison costs and reduce
recidivism. Prison Fellowship researched the approach and found
that ex-convicts who completed the Brazilian program had an incredibly
low four percent recidivism rate.[94]

<p>

The first APAC program could be run in Texas by the Community
Corrections Institution, a faith-based nonprofit organization.
CCI proposes to run a corrections institution for Texas for 90
percent of the current per prisoner cost and promises to reduce
recidivism by half.[95]

<p>

CCI's program will provide jobs and job training for up to 500
residents per facility.  It will satisfy all statutory requirements
for a penal institution, and it guarantees accreditation by the
American Correctional Association.  It will teach inmates marketable
skills and assure that skills will be marketable upon release.
It will also pay prevailing wages for the skills learned.  Inmates
will contribute to room and board, support their families, make
restitution to victims, establish savings accounts and have spending
accounts.[96]

<p>

To be eligible for the CCI facility, inmates must be at least
one year, but no more than two years, from initial parole eligibility
or mandatory release.  They must agree to stay at least one year
and make themselves available for all programs, services and employment.[97]

<p>

On May 8, 1996, CCI representatives met with representatives of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice System to discuss key
points of a Texas-based APAC program.[98] CCI answered the Justice
System's legal questions:

<p><ul>

<li>A corrections program may be authorized for management by
nongovernment participants to further state interests and secular
purposes. State interests include lower incarceration costs,
lower recidivism rates and lower, long-term state expenses.

<p>

<li>The state must give a contractor the discretion to provide
religious or values elements without necessarily causing impermissible
state endorsement, so long as inmates voluntarily participate.

<p>

<li>Nonreligious elements can be funded with direct state support,
but religious elements should not be funded without legal authority.

</ul><p>

CCI's proposal satisfies these legal requirements.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Bill Glass Prison Ministry goes across the country spreading the
Gospel to hungry inmates.  &quot;I give myself to going to prisons,&quot;
says Glass, &quot;because men in prison...have come to a point
they realize they have a need, and they're willing to trust the
Lord...and what we're trying to say is that you can have a new
life.&quot;[99]

<p>

Chuck Colson, Prison Fellowship's founder and himself a former
prisoner, says prison may just be one of the best places to start
over again.  &quot;The Gospel is better news in prison than anywhere
else,&quot; says Colson, &quot;because these people really understand
the depths of their own sin.&quot;[100]

<p>

Religious rehabilitation programs work for many prisons.  They
provide a moral compass for inmates who have been led astray by
a corrupted value system. Work, education and drug programs,
although important, can't change the inner man which is the target
of faith-based programs.

<p>

The prisoner who acquires an intrinsic faith has a better chance
to live a crime-free post-prison life.  For those who must remain,
they are easier (translated less costly) to manage.  The taxpayer
collects the benefits from a rehabilitation philosophy that embraces
the life-changing power of religious faith.  It is an experiment
well worth trying.

<B><center> Small Business Group Asks Who Actually 
Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health
Insurance?
</B></center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Average SBSC Rating        2.3%<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

September 17, 1996<BR>
<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<b><CENTER>Small Businesses Harboring Chemical Weapons?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>American Businesses To Be Subjected to Foreign Inspections
Under Proposed Chemical Weapons Convention<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Foundation
(SBS Foundation) &#173;&#173; a nonpartisan research and education
organization focusing on public policy issues relating to small
business and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; has called on candidates
to focus closely on the issues in this year's campaign.  To help
this process along, the Foundation re&#173;released its comprehensive
guide to issues impacting entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A 
Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues.&quot;
<P>
SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Entrepreneurs,
business 
owners, and their employees are looking for a substantive, issues&#173;based
campaign in 1996.  
<P>
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; will help candidates
at both the federal and state levels, 
as well as the media and citizens in general, to sort through
the real issues affecting small 
business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96,&quot; echoed these comments by noting, &quot;As
the campaign season moves 
into high gear, the tendency increases for rhetoric to overwhelm
substance.  Our 
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; booklet attempts to
keep attention and offer guidance on 
substantive issues.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Each chapter in &quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot;deals
with important public 
policies and how they impact entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
tax policy, government 
spending, regulations, monetary policy, trade, immigration, health
care, government 
reform, as well as key issues at the state and city levels.  The
booklet also examines the role 
of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy and
over the next century.    
<P>
Keating concluded: &quot;Our economy has been growing at a slow&#173;to&#173;mediocre
pace 
since the late 1980s and we need to be debating policy options
that will place the economy 
on a high&#173;growth track.  Of course, real economic growth
and job creation are generated 
through investment and entrepreneurship.  &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96&quot; offers an 
entrepreneur&#173;friendly agenda.&quot;

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; To mark the start of
National Small Business Week, the Small Business Survival Foundation
&#173;&#173; a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization
focusing on small business issues &#173;&#173; released a new
report today the &quot;Small Business Survival Index: Ranking
the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small
Business Survival Foundation 
and author of the report, noted: &quot;The Small
Business Survival Index provides a measure of 
government&#173;related costs affecting the decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses &#173;
&#173; the engines of economic growth and job creation.&quot;<p>
 The study combines nine major costs 
(whether rates, ratios, or indexes) levied on small
businesses and entrepreneurs into one 
comparative index number:<BR>

<P>
<B>Top
Personal Income Tax Rate</B>.  State personal income tax rates
impact economic 
decision&#173;making related to working, saving,
investing, and risk taking. 
<P>
<B>Top
Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate</B>.  State capital gains taxes
are direct levies on 
investment and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; the
sources of growth in the economy.  
<P>
<B>Top
Corporate Income Tax Rate.</B>  State corporate income tax rates
affect a broad range of 
business decisions &#173;&#173; most clearly decisions
relating to investment and location.
<P>
<b>Property
Taxes (per $100 of personal income).</B>
State and local property taxes impact 
decisions as to where businesses and entrepreneurs
choose to locate, as well as decisions 
relating to investments in facilities.
<P>
<B>Sales
Taxes (per $100 of personal income)</B>.  State and local sales
taxes impact the
economic decisions of individuals and families, as
well as various retail businesses.
<P>
<B>Death
Taxes</B>.  Estate taxes amount to nothing more than a government
hostile takeover of 
a business at the time of the owner's death and impact
investment and location decisions.
<P>
<B>Top
Unemployment Tax Rate Paid by Employers on Taxable Wages</B>.
 The unemployment
tax rate on taxable wages affects labor&#173;versus&#173;capital
as well as location decisions.
<P>
<B>Workers'
Compensation Costs (cost index)</B>.  High workers' compensation
rates also 
impact labor&#173;versus&#173;capital and location
decisions.
<P>
<B>Total
Crime Rate</B>.  Just like taxes, a high crime rate acts as a
disincentive to entrepreneurs, 
who naturally seek out environments where life and
property are protected.  <BR>

<P>
Keating acknowledged that other obstacles are placed
in the path of entrepreneurs 
and businesses at the state and local levels, particularly
regulations.  Unfortunately, no 
reliable, comparative measure for state and/or local
regulatory costs is currently available.  
<P>
<B>Under the Small Business Survival Index, the lower
the index number, the lighter the </B>
<B>governmental burdens, and the better the environment
is for risk taking. 
</B>

<P>
Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival
Foundation, noted: 
&quot;According to our Index, South Dakota, Wyoming,
Nevada, and Washington rate best for 
entrepreneurs because they don't tax personal income,
capital gains, or corporate income.  
Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alaska, and Florida
rank very high as well.  
<P>
Unfortunately, places like Minnesota, New Mexico,
Maine, Montana, Vermont, New York 
State, Iowa, Hawaii, California, and Rhode Island
treat job&#173;creating entrepreneurs and 
small business owners rather shabbily.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
Keating added: &quot;The District of Columbia ranks
as most hostile to entrepreneurship 
when compared to the 50 states.  However, if you
add New York City into the mix, it 
offers the worst environment for entrepreneurship
&#173;&#173; by far.  For entrepreneurs, the Big 
Apple is rotten.&quot;  <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
-- a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization
-- today released a statement regarding the observance of Small
Business Week.  SBSC President Karen Kerrigan prepared the following
statement:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Every year small businesses and entrepreneurs become more
vital to the growth and dynamism of the U.S. economy.  Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and chief job producers
of America, and without their activity our economy would stagnate
and ultimately deteriorate.  National Small Business Week commemorates
the sacrifices made by entrepreneurs, and gives politicians the
opportunity to talk about the sacrifices they've made for small
business.<BR>
<P>
The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.
 Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships increased
from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167%.  It is
interesting to note that as over 500,000 Americans lost their
jobs due to downsizing in 1994 (according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics), new business incorporations skyrocketed to
a record 750,000 in the same year.  Not surprisingly, more Americans
are taking advantage of technological advances and economic trends
to start their own business.  They have no interest in &quot;corporate
responsibility,&quot; but rather creating their own long-term
economic security.<BR>
<P>
It is essential that elected officials recognize the strong economic
forces that will dominate the 21st Century workforce -- trends
that Senator Connie Mack's Joint Economic Committee fittingly
describe as a workforce controlled by diversity, mobility and
entrepreneurship.  Though these trends have been identified by
the 104th Congress -- with scores of proposals offered to take
advantage of our exciting economic future -- the agenda of growth
and entrepreneurship has been vehemently rejected by President
Clinton.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton has been given sufficient opportunity to support
the entrepreneur's agenda, but through the use of his veto pen
and through countless policies passed and presented by his Administration
-- he has decided to support and advance a European model that
mistakenly places the government at the center of the economy.
<BR>
<P>
President Clinton likes to claim that he's tough on crime and
criminals.  What is more evident, however, is that he has gotten
even tougher on innocent small business owners.  In fact, &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out&quot; -- the trendy slogan for various tough-on-crime
proposals --  is now an appropriate label for President Clinton's
small business record.<BR>
<P>
What are those strikes against the Administration?  STRIKE #1:
 The 1993 Clinton tax hike.  Touted as a soak-the-rich scheme,
small businesses took a bath on  the 'I feel your pain' increase.
 According to the IRS, 70% of those impacted by the hike were
small businesses.  A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey
of small businesses revealed that 69% of respondents took some
action in response to the Clinton tax hike.  STRIKE #2:  The Clinton
Health Care Plan.  Adorned with its proposed employer mandates
as the primary mechanism to achieve 'universal coverage,' the
plan would have been devastating to our nation's small businesses.
 Mrs. Clinton claimed that she could not be held responsible for
&quot;every undercapitalized entrepreneur in America,&quot; and
no one asked her to be.  Small businesses want to succeed or fail
on their own, but without the government as a &quot;silent partner&quot;
forcing them into collapse.  STRIKE #3:  The minimum wage hike.
 President Clinton used to be against the wage hike as a &quot;New
Democrat,&quot; but that was before the labor unions took over
his election-year agenda.  The Clinton wage hike is another silly
ploy to appease his boisterous left-wing at the expense of small
business owners.<BR>
<P>
Of course, President Clinton has also vetoed many of the important
reforms recommended by his own White House Conference on Small
Business (WHCSB).  The President has opposed practical and moderate
reforms at OSHA and EPA; securing property rights; reforming outdated
labor laws and <U>repealing</U> Davis-Bacon; giving small business
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in health care reform, to name
a few items.  The WHCSB recommended, but the President promptly
<U>vetoed: </U> an increase in small business expensing; capital
gains tax reduction; estate tax reform; tax equity in health care
reform; pension reform; and tort reform -- all important to small
business growth and survival.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton will make every attempt this week to talk about
how friendly he has been to small businesses, and they will be
rightly incensed by his crass election-year rhetoric.  Moving
bureaucrats around agencies like pawns on a chessboard does not
help the entrepreneur's bottom-line.  &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;'
schemes have not lifted the paperwork and regulatory burden on
small businesses.  Conversely, increasing taxes and regulations
only serve to hurt entrepreneurship and economic growth.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton's track record on small business speaks louder
than his words.  Indeed he has embraced an economic model placing
government at the center of the economy.  The opening exists,
therefore, for a certain White House challenger to expose the
President's bias against small businesses and offer an agenda
that properly places the entrepreneur at the economy's center
--  producing a dynamic and exciting economy offering opportunity
for those who seek the path of entrepreneurship.  A Presidential
candidate who advocates this agenda would truly make National
Small Business Week, a week to celebrate.&quot;<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> - Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan today released the following statement after the
United States House of Representatives increased the starting
wage: <BR>
<P>
&quot;Small businesses are the job creating engines of the United
States - making up nearly two-thirds of American businesses. 
Mandating the wage hike would effectively throw a monkey wrench
in that engine. The wage hike amounts to an unfunded mandate.
 As such, it should not make its way out of Washington.  And without
a doubt, small businesses will shoulder most of the cost of mandate.
To offset the cost of the wage hike, small business owners will
either be forced to reduce current employee hours, forgo hiring
additional workers, or raise the prices of goods and services.
 All of these consequences -- viewed by us as anti-worker -- 
will not put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers.
The wage hike gives President Clinton a chance to again say 'I
feel your pain' during this election year.  But every time the
President 'feels our pain,' his compassion is followed by another
blow to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  For the small business
sector, this false compassion has meant increased taxes and costs,
courtesy of Bill Clinton.&quot;  <BR>

<center><h2>Media Release<P>
Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and 
investment.
<br>
<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.
</ul>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.

</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>News Release<P>
Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) -785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<i>FDA Examined From An Entrepreneurial and Economic Growth Perspective: <br>

<b>For Immediate Release:  September 22, 1995<br>

<hr>
                            <P>
Washington, D.C. </b>-- In a newly released booklet, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation substantiates the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) crushing impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth, driving high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas.
                                     <P>
SBS Foundation -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization examining issues crucial to the entrepreneurial sector of  the economy -- has published a booklet entitled FDA Hazards:  How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy.
                                               <P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of "FDA Hazards," offers numerous examples of where and how the FDA has gone awry.  From orange juice raids to export hurdles to shutting down the last smoked-herring company in the United States, the FDA has moved beyond a traditional role of reasonable safety regulation and education to a harsh, confrontational stance with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses.
                                                            <P>
And while FDA enforcement tactics have become more aggressive and intrusive, its ability to meet deadlines in terms of medical device and drug approvals deteriorates.  Keating notes that the average FDA approval times in these critical areas fail to even come close to what is required.  As approval times become more lengthy and costly to U.S. firms, FDA's inflation-adjusted budget increased by almost 53 percent between 1989 and 1994, and the number of full-time FDA employees increased by more than 25 percent.
                                                                       <P>
"FDA Hazards" examines the record of the FDA in terms of its ability to move medical devices and drugs through its approval process in a timely manner;  its strategies and tactics when dealing with entrepreneurs and businesses;  its budget and number of employees;  the incentives under which FDA employees operate;  and more.
                                                                                <P>
Several market-based reforms are suggested in "FDA Hazards":
                                                                                         <ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  The private sector should be tapped for medical device and drug approvals.
                                                                                              <P>
<li>The government has a role in helping to secure consumers against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, et al.
                                                                                    <P>
<li>The marketplace needs to rest upon sound legal and regulatory systems.  Unfortunately, both systems have gone awry, and some of our most dynamic industries -- medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- suffer accordingly.  Legal reform is needed.
                                                                          <P>
<li>The FDA ban against manufacturers distributing information regarding off-label uses of drugs such as independent journal articles and studies, should be lifted.
                                                                  <P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as it processes and standards for determining what products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.
                                                       <P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals.
              </ul>   <p>
In addition to a total restructuring of the FDA, Keating also advocates the elimination of capital gains taxes, which will help attract capital to such high-risk industries as medical devices and pharmaceutical.
                                    <P>
Keating summarizes the FDA's woes as follows:  "A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving devices and treatments."
                                                                                                                 <P>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the value of business investment in durable goods by $42.5 billion</b> in today's dollars; $15.4 billion of this is lost investment in computers.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

<li>Most of the change in earnings can be accounted for by the loss in firm-size wage premiums as workers have moved from larger to smaller firms.  All else being equal, larger firms pay 12 to 23 percent more than smaller firms.

<li>The data comparisons made in this section refer to similar points in time during these four expansions.  For example, average employment growth from March 1991 to the present (59 months) is compared with the average employment growth from February 1961 to December 1965 (59 months), from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to October 1987.<p>

<li>Data on median weekly earnings are not available on a consistent basis prior to 1979.<p>
<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>
<li>U.S.  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, <I>Consumer Expenditures in 1993</I>, Report 885, December 1994, Table 4.  The figures are an average of all consumer units and have been adjusted to 1995 dollars.<p>

<li>See Technical Notes for a full description of how these figures were calculated.  It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>

We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today.... " President Clinton, "Address to the Nation," February 15, 1993.<p>
<li>The FY 1996 forecast does include some spending cuts enacted by the 104th Congress and signed by the President.  Heritage analysts, however, are unable to estimate these effects at this time.<p>
<li>A disproportionate share of the savings from spending cuts, $33 billion or 63 percent, are achieved in FY 1996.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1996 presidential campaign has rekindled the debate over tax reductions. Among the proposals being considered are an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, the repeal of rate increases imposed in 1990 and 1993, the deductibility of payroll taxes, and a modified flat tax. But regardless of the particular features of each change under consideration, the argument is the same. Proponents argue that lower tax rates will spur economic growth by reducing the penalty on working, saving, and investing. Opponents disagree, claiming that the economy is doing fine and that tax rate reductions, if enacted, will help the rich disproportionately while widening the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fortunately, there is a way to judge the desirability of lower tax rates. The United States has had three major episodes of tax rate reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. By looking at how the economy performed during these periods, and by examining what happened to the deficit and the degree to which different income classes were affected, it is possible to gain useful evidence about the desirability of tax rate reductions today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The evidence provides strong support for those who believe the economy is weak and favor reductions in tax rates. Recent history is especially compelling. Tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 boosted the top rate to 39.6 percent (and over 42 percent including the Medicare payroll tax). This means a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship when compared with the 28 percent rate in effect when Ronald Reagan left office. The effect has been dismal:
<p><ul>
<li> During the post-Reagan era, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.
<p>
<li> Real median family income, the best measure of living standards for the average American, has fallen by more than $2,000 since Reagan left office.
<p>
<li> Assuming there is no change in policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth for the next ten years will average less than 2.1 percent annually.<sup>1</sup>  This is well below the post-World War II average of 3.2 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy's sub-standard performance in recent years should come as no surprise. As seen below, major changes in tax policy inevitably affect growth.
<p><ul>
<li>Across-the-board tax rate reductions in the 1920s reduced the top rate from 71 percent to 24 percent. The economy boomed, growing by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929.
<p>
<li> In 1930, Herbert Hoover raised tax rates from 25 percent to a maximum of 63 percent, and Franklin Roosevelt boosted them to 79 percent later in the decade. The 1930s, to put it mildly, are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li> Across-the-board tax rate reductions introduced by President John F. Kennedy reduced the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. These lower rates, along with substantially lower taxes on savings and investment, are associated with the longest economic expansion in American history.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li> The Johnson surtax, enacted in 1968 during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson, combined with the inflation-induced bracket creep of the 1970s (subjecting taxpayers to higher rates even though their real incomes had not changed), resulted in a decade of stagflation.
<p>
<li> Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts ushered in America's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new jobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs.
<p>
<li> The tax rate increases imposed under George Bush and Bill Clinton, as outlined below, are associated with the slowest growing economy in 50 years and a decline of more than $2,000 in the average family's income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If legislators want to unleash stronger growth and more prosperity, the best tax policy would be the flat tax. Under that proposal, all three major problems of the current tax code -- high rates, anti-capital bias, and complexity -- would be minimized. To the extent that politicians are reluctant to adopt a flat tax, however, any change that moved in the right direction would be helpful. If history is any guide, any tax rate reduction, whether a 15 percent across-the-board cut, a repeal of the Bush and Clinton tax hikes, or some other reform, would boost the economy and raise living standards.
<p>
<b>LOOKING AT CASE HISTORIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of tax rates on economic activity should not be overstated. The economy, after all, can be affected significantly by trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, and many other government actions. Even within the context of fiscal policy, tax rates are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Keeping all these caveats in mind, there nonetheless is a distinct pattern throughout American history: Simply stated, when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with subpar economic performance and stagnant tax revenues.
<P>
<b>The 1920s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Administrations of Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, tax rates were slashed from the confiscatory levels they had reached in World War I. The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Spurred in part by lower tax rates, the economy expanded dramatically. In real terms, the economy grew 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, and annual economic growth averaged more than 6 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction in tax rates, personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of no inflation).<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The share of the tax burden borne by the rich rose dramatically. As seen in <a href="bg1086c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, taxes paid by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent of the total tax burden in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This surge in revenue was no surprise to Mellon:
<p><blockquote>
	The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1960s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation the following year dropping the top rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Kennedy tax cuts helped trigger the longest economic expansion in America's history. Between 1961 and 1968, the inflation-adjusted economy expanded by more than 42 percent. On a yearly basis, economic growth averaged more than 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Tax revenues grew strongly, rising by 62 percent between 1961 and 1968. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to President Kennedy:
<p><blockquote>
	Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.<sup>8</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1980s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts were dramatic. When Reagan took office in 1981, the economy was being choked by high inflation and was in the middle of a double-dip recession (1980 and 1982). The tax cuts helped pull the economy out of the doldrums and ushered in the longest period of peacetime economic growth in America's history. During the seven-year Reagan boom, economic growth averaged almost 4 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Critics charge that the tax cuts caused higher deficits, but they misread the evidence. The Reagan tax cut, though approved in 1981, was phased in over several years. As a result, bracket creep (indexing was not implemented until 1985) and payroll tax increases completely swamped Reagan's 1.25 percent tax cut in 1981 and effectively canceled out the portion of the tax cut which went into effect in 1982. The economy received an unambiguous tax cut only as of January 1983. Thereafter, personal income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the "rich" who paid the additional taxes. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts was then-U.S. Representative <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY). According to Kemp:
<p><blockquote>
	At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THE LESSONS
<p>
1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of virtually no inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
<b>2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>13</sup>

<p>

<b>THE 1990S: IGNORING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike reductions in tax rates, increases in tax rates have a history of failure. The Hoover and Roosevelt tax increases of the 1930s certainly contributed to the dismal economy during the Great Depression. Tax revenues fell during much of the period, and the deficit increased. And as <a href="bg1086c11.gif">Chart 11</a> shows, the high tax rates of the 1950s resulted in sluggish revenue growth. Ignoring history, both Democrats and Republicans at the time argued that tax rates reaching over 90 percent could not be cut for fear of revenue loss. Moreover, the 1970s, which began with the Johnson surtax and later were hit by bracket creep, triggered the tax revolt and the Reagan tax cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps more than any other decade, however, the 1990s make the best argument against higher tax rates. In both 1990 and 1993, the economy was subjected to record tax increases, the ostensible purpose of which was to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. As <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a> illustrates, however, these increases backfired. Total tax revenue, as a percent of economic output, is expected to be lower this year than it was when Reagan left office.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, the modest decline in revenues relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is due to the slower growth in personal income tax revenues. As shown in <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a>, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of economic output in 1989. By 1996 -- two large tax increases later -- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.5 percent of economic output. In other words, the tax that was increased the most accounts for the drop in tax revenue as a share of national output.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
High tax rates are bad for the economy. High tax rates that increase the deficit by reducing the growth of tax revenue are even worse. What makes recent history especially tragic is that the economic and budgetary losses could have been avoided if Bush and Clinton had simply kept Reagan's policies in place. In 1989, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit, which then was $152 billion, would continue to fall for the next five years assuming no change in Reagan's policies. As of 1995 -- again, two large tax increases later -- the budget deficit had risen to $164 billion, and it is projected by the CBO to reach more than $400 billion by 2006 if Clinton's policies are left in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dismal budget numbers, however, tell only part of the story. The economy has been the real victim of higher tax rates. As <a href="bg1086c13.gif">Chart 13</a> shows, the post-Reagan era has seen the slowest growth of any seven-year period since the end of World War II. As discussed earlier, this slow growth has left people with more than $2,000 less income when inflation is taken into account. The biggest losers have been the poor. As Chart 14 illustrates, income for the bottom 20 percent has fallen the most during the Bush/Clinton era. The politicians who imposed the higher taxes, needless to say, argued that the rich would be the ones to suffer.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy is limping, incomes have been falling, tax revenues are stagnant, and it is projected that the deficit will more than double in the next ten years. This is the legacy of higher tax rates and a tax code that punishes working, saving, and investing. History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates. Legislation to reduce rates would do this. Better still, Congress should scrap the current system as quickly as possible and replace it with a flat tax that treats all taxpayers equally and minimizes the burden on productive behavior.

<a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a>: Direct and Indirect Costs Can Consume Half the Cost of Employing a Worker 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Average American workers have become frustrated that their take-home pay seems to buy less and less. Some policymakers say this is because corporations are not passing on to workers the real value of their labor. Focusing on the low-paid, some lawmakers say take-home pay needs to be increased by raising the minimum wage, even though this would destroy thousands of job opportunities.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The problem with this view is that it overlooks the huge gap between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck that can be cashed. Most American workers have little understanding of just how much disappears from their earnings before the money reaches their pockets. They usually are aware only of the taxes taken directly from their paychecks. What they do not see is the additional cost of government taxes, mandates, and regulations that employers also must bear and that, in practice, comes out of a worker's compensation.<sup>2</sup>  Over the past 20 years, these additional costs have taken an ever-increasing bite out of personal income, creating a larger and larger "wedge" between the cost of hiring a worker and what that worker receives as take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do government taxes, mandates, and regulations increase the cost of hiring employees and reduce the take-home pay of workers?
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, it cost all employers in private industry an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.<sup>3</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less than the total direct expense of employing them. The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>4</sup>

In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.<sup>5</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000. This equals somewhere from $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government must share the blame for reductions in the take-home pay of American workers. Over the years, it has forced employers to shift more of their employees' "pay" to mandated employee benefits, thereby making the hiring of workers more and more expensive. Employers, as well as employees, operate within a competitive labor market in which wage rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers -- <I>less</I> the costs of taxes, mandated benefits, and regulations associated with employing a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that worker will be paid. The smaller the government tax and mandate wedge is, the more cash workers will be able to take home.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay. Such policies also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities, and real earnings. Specifically, Congress should cut payroll and income taxes, reduce the regulatory burden on business, cut the capital gains tax, and improve basic education through school choice.
<p>
<b>THE DIRECT COST OF GOVERNMENT TAXES AND MANDATED BENEFITS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The hourly wage that employers pay is not what workers take home; nor is it the total cost of labor borne by businesses. When calculating the hourly cash wage rate that a business will pay workers, the employer also must take into account the legal obligation to pay Social Security/Medicare taxes, federal and state unemployment insurance taxes, and workers' compensation taxes.<sup>7</sup>  These costs reduce the amount the employer otherwise would be prepared to pay, based on the productivity of the worker. But from the wages and salaries employees receive initially in their paychecks, workers must pay their share of Social Security/Medicare taxes, as well as federal and state income taxes. The difference between this cost of labor to employers (cash wages plus mandated taxes and benefits) and the take-home pay of workers (cash wages minus payroll and income taxes), is the tax wedge (see <a href="fyi102c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). In 1995, the tax wedge averaged $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of an average worker's total hourly compensation (see <a href="fyi102t1.gif">Table 1</a>).<sup>8</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Legally mandated benefits, such as unemployment insurance and workers' compensation, are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, some 88 percent of the cost of all employer-paid government-mandated benefit taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>9</sup>
<p><ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost all private industry employers an average of $17.10 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>10</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.84 per hour, or 42 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost manufacturing industry employers an average of $20.47 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>12</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $10.93 per hour, or 47 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $4.65 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost service industry employers an average of $15.88 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>14</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.46 per hour, or 40 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $3.64 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.</b><sup>16</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the years, proliferating mandates and rising taxes have increased the cost of hiring workers. By 1994, the cost of government-mandated benefits accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and just 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government taxes and fees have been taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (<a href="fyi102c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person increased 155 percent in real terms over the same period.<sup>18</sup>  In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every person.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, in recent years there has been a significant increase in mandated benefits (<a href="fyi102t2.gif">Table 2</a>), and these costs are likely to become larger in the future. For example:
<ul>
<li>If Congress proceeds with a proposed 90 cent increase in the minimum wage, it will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages. It also will cause employers to create over 200,000 fewer entry-level jobs each year until 1999.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
<li>The Medicare program is on the brink of insolvency. To put it on a sound financial basis without reforming and improving the way the program operates could mean as much as a 3.52 percentage point increase on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. This means workers earning $45,000 per year would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $1,584 per year.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess, rather than corporate greed, consumes their take-home pay.
<p>
<b>THE HIDDEN COSTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes and mandated benefits are not the only government policies that drive a wedge between the cost of hiring an employee and that employee's take-home pay. Regulations also increase the cost of employing workers. For example, environmental and workplace safety regulations impose costs that take the form of such things as compliance expenditures (e.g., equipment purchases, worker training); time lost due to paperwork requirements; delays in the processing and issuance of permits required by the government; and attorneys fees incurred in regulation-related litigation. For the smallest businesses, the costs of tax compliance (paying professionals to decipher the tax code, filling out forms, maintaining the appropriate records) and payroll recordkeeping are the largest components of the regulatory burden.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Regulation imposes the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze. According to recent studies by Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology:
<p><ul>
<li>For the average firm with fewer than 20 employees, the regulatory cost per employee is estimated to be about $5,500. For the largest firms (those with more than 500 employees), the cost is about $3,000 per employee.<sup>21</sup>  Unfortunately, Congress has responded to the disproportionate burden on small business by exempting different sizes of companies from different regulatory statutes. The effect of this approach has been to discourage companies near an established threshold from hiring new employees.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
<li>The business regulatory burden also varies considerably by industry. For example, the average cost of regulation per employee in the manufacturing industry, where regulatory costs are the highest, is in the range of $5,000 to $7,000. For the service industry, where regulatory costs are the lowest, it is in the range of $2,000 to $3,000. As <a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a> shows, these average costs are equal to a range of approximately $1.00 to $3.00 per hour per worker.<sup>23</sup>
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As Professor Hopkins notes, estimating the precise cost of federal regulations to business and workers is extremely difficult. These cost estimates are intended to offer only an illustrative profile of the cost of the regulatory system. While these estimates do not factor in the benefits of particular regulations, understanding the cost impact is important for policymakers, particularly in light of the already significant costs to employers of taxes and mandated benefits.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although regulation imposes costs on businesses, ultimately they are passed on to individual Americans, often through lower wages (see <a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>24</sup>  Moreover, mandated requirements, such as family and medical leave, directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, how much cash to pay the worker, and how long to keep that worker. The rise in mandated labor costs paid by employers is one of the most important forces leading companies to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A recent study by Richard Vedder for the Center for the Study of American Business shows that in addition to the costs of complying with regulation, there are longer-run costs in the form of reduced productivity. Vedder explains that when a business must devote resources to implementing regulatory mandates, those resources are used in a less efficient manner because firms are forced to use more costly and less productive methods of production.<sup>26</sup>  This significant "drag" on productivity denies workers higher wages and a higher standard of living.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other studies support similar conclusions. One 1987 study by economist Wayne Gray examined the effects of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations on 450 manufacturing industries and concluded that these regulations explained more than 30 percent of the slowdown in productivity from the 1960s to the 1973-1978 period.<sup>27</sup>  A 1995 study by the Employment Policy Foundation found that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by OSHA28 and that nearly half of the slowdown in long-run productivity growth can be explained by rising government regulatory activity.<sup>29</sup>Further, since productivity and workers' pay and benefits rise together, government regulations are directly responsible for some part of the slowdown in wage growth and take-home pay (<a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).
<p>
<b>RAISING TAKE-HOME PAY</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress and the Administration should focus on policies that will increase wages and job opportunities for Americans by improving labor productivity and reducing the cost of employing workers. Specifically, Congress and the Administration should:
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Cut payroll taxes.</b> Taxes and government-mandated benefits cost the average worker over 21 percent of total compensation -- 13.8 percent for minimum wage workers. The solution is not more mandates -- for example, a higher minimum wage. Cutting payroll taxes, however, would directly increase take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Cut the capital gains tax.</b> The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once.<sup>30</sup>  It taxes corporate and individual income from investment, and then taxes capital a third time by taxing capital gains. Lowering the capital gains tax would increase investment in the U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms to put their capital to work here with American workers. A capital gains tax cut also would make more venture capital available for emerging technologies and for research and development that would improve future productivity.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Enact significant regulatory reform.</b> The explosion of new regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital, created barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and raised the cost of employing Americans. This higher cost of employment in turn means that in a competitive economy, the return to labor in the form of wages is reduced. The regulatory burden needs to be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but also to decrease the cost of hiring workers. To do this, Congress should strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies; establish in statute a set of principles, including cost-benefit analysis, to guide regulatory decisionmaking; establish a regulatory budget; and require federal agencies to review existing regulations to ensure that they meet sound regulatory principles.<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Increase the skills of the workforce.</b> What is needed is fundamental change aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening core curricula, and enabling local educators to improve discipline and set high expectations. Congress also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education savings accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling states and individuals to use lump-sum unemployment insurance benefits for education and training.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians who blame "corporate greed" for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government. Over the years, more and more mandates, higher and higher taxes, and excessive regulation have slowed the growth of the economy and created a larger and larger wedge between the cost of hiring employees and workers' take-home pay. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly realize the significant costs government imposes and the effects on their take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to these problems is not more government mandates and programs, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems -- high payroll and income taxes, and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.

<P><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clichs: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

</h3> <h2>A Separate Class for the Elite</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Bill Clinton is
someone who doesn't like to face major problems.  He seldom proposes politically risky
solutions to serious difficulties facing the nation.  His Medicare fix, for example, would
simply tide the system over until Clinton leaves office.  That has been true of much of what
he has proposed, with the exception of his first term health care initiative, which was
really Hillary's baby.<dd>

So Bill Clinton is praying that the Supreme Court will see things his way as the Paula Jones
case is taken up once again.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers, including the highly-priced Bob Bennett, argue that the President should
be protected from civil lawsuits while in office.  Richard Cohen, the liberal columnist for
the Washington Post, puts the argument this way: "In the end, only two people know what
happened that day in Little Rock, and their stories are not likely ever to conform.  Jones
deserves her day in court -- but not necessarily right away and not if it means that
Presidents can be legally harassed by their political enemies."<dd>

Paula Jones was no enemy of Bill Clinton.  She wasn't involved in politics at all.  It is
true that she received and took bad advice by surfacing her case at C-PAC, the Conservative
Political Action Committee annual conference in Washington.  It is also true that the
attorneys she ended up with are partisan Republicans.  That has more to do with her economic
standing than it has to do with any political motives on her part.<dd>

But those facts should not obscure the fact that what this case is really all about is
sexual harassment.  If Army drill sergeants must face the music for their misdeeds, why not
the President of the United States, their Commander-in-Chief?<dd>

What is really at stake in the Supreme Court action on the Paula Jones case is whether the
President of the United States constitutes a special class all by himself.  One set of rules
applies to him. Another set of rules applies to the rest of us.<dd>

By the way, I have taken this position consistently for nearly thirty years.  Richard
Nixon's imperial style Presidency was as offensive to me as is this Clinton argument on Paul
Jones.  I said so publicly back then.<dd>

The President's legal team argues that were he to have to stand trial on this lawsuit, it
would interfere with his work as President.  This is a President who plays golf frequently;
a President who just attended the Renaissance week-end where he mostly played hooky and
didn't attend many lectures.  This is a President who just returned from a family vacation
in the Virgin Islands.  I don't begrudge him these interludes.  Some of our better
Presidents have had a decent amount of leisure time. President Eisenhower played lots more
golf than Bill Clinton does, and Ronald Reagan frequently took naps in the middle of the
day.  On the other hand, Jimmy Carter worked day and night.  So the success of a Presidency
is not necessarily tied to hard work.<dd>

By the same token, a President who has time to engage in frequent recreation and who does
not hesitate to vacation, cannot at the same time argue, which Clinton does, that he is just
too busy to tend to this lawsuit.<dd>

The notion that political enemies would simply file frivolous lawsuits against the President
to harass him if the Jones case is allowed to go to trial now is preposterous.  A President
is sued almost daily over his policies in office.  That is fair game.  But a lawsuit
alleging improper personal conduct would have to have some basis or else it would be
dismissed immediately. <dd>

Paula Jones, before she filed the suit, had nearly gotten Bill Clinton to acknowledge that
he knew her, that they were in the same hotel together, and that he would apologize if
anything he had said had been misinterpreted by her.  At the last minute, Clinton decided
not to settle and the case went to court.<dd>

I also have no idea what went on in the hotel room where Paula Jones contends that then
Governor Bill Clinton exposed himself to her.  We would soon find out in a trial if she made
this story up. <dd>

But I do know this.  It is a dangerous doctrine which suggests that the President of the
United States is, even temporarily, above the law.  One of the reasons why the United States
was so different from other nations, even other nation states with democratically elected
governments, is precisely the fact that we always viewed our Presidents as men of the
people.  Yes, they may receive special treatment while in office to facilitate their conduct
of official business, but they are, in the words of Richard Nixon's critics, "not above the
law."<dd>

If the court goes along with Clinton, and I suspect they will because they themselves view
themselves as part of the nation's elite, then we will have established a special class of
citizen. Someone who, for four or eight years, does not have to face the consequences of his
own actions. Who will be next?  Senators?  I worked for two of them and I can attest that
they had mind boggling schedules.<dd>

True if Bill Clinton's trial is postponed, he will still have to face Paula Jones when he
leaves office.  But by then national interest in the case will be minimal.  Who pays any
attention to what happens to George Bush in his personal life these days?  The very
compensation which Jones seeks in her lawsuit, namely the restoration of her good name,
would be effectively denied her if the trial is postponed.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers say that Jones would not have suffered the loss of her good name if she
hadn't stepped forward with her lawsuit.  Let's not forget that she only did so when an
Arkansas State Trooper contended in an article for the American Spectator that Paula Jones
was the willing girlfriend of the Governor.<dd>

I am very afraid that this court will disregard what is really at stake in this case and
will grant the extra time to Bill Clinton.  Thus they would be blinded to the fact that
Clinton's behavior is the basis for this lawsuit.  Why haven't we had lots of personal
lawsuits against former Presidents who did not have any court ruling that they would have to
be protected from trials while in office.  Simply put, these recent former Presidents never
conducted themselves in such a way so as to provoke such lawsuits.  They were by no means
perfect, but they weren't out cruising for trouble with strangers either. <dd>

If Bill Clinton is upheld in this case, we will take another giant step away from a
government of the people, by the people and for the people. <P> <blockquote> <a

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 8, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Second Chance for Gingrich</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Considering the burden
on his shoulders,  Newt Gingrich performed well yesterday as he became the first Republican
Speaker to be re-elected to that post since l928.<dd>

His speech to the House was statesman like and hit just the right tone for the occasion.
Gingrich's re-election was not the foregone conclusion the rest of the House leadership
claimed it was for the past two weeks. There were nine Republican defectors.  Four of them
were really serious defectors.  They voted for another candidate.  Had the other five who
voted "present" cast their ballots for a different candidate than Gingrich and had they
added just one more defector to their ranks, Gingrich would not have been re-elected, at
least not on the first round.  It was close.  Some of those who voted "present" had been
inclined to vote for another candidate but were talked out of that scenario by some in the
leadership, including Gingrich himself.<dd>

Whether Gingrich has really learned anything from this episode or not will be determined by
two factors.  First, how does he treat his defectors. Ronald Reagan was an artful leader.
His then Secretary of Education Terrell Bell complained bitterly in his book about the
Reagan years that he had seen me on television attacking one of Reagan's policies on one day
and then bumped into me as I was going into a meeting with the President the very next day.
Reagan did not take it personally when some of us opposed his policies.  The first Gingrich
term was often marked by petty hostility to those who crossed him, especially if they were
conservative.  The Speaker needs to look beyond the vote yesterday and to the larger
question of where he is going to lead his majority.  If he treats the nine defectors too
badly he is buying further trouble with some of his supporters.  More than one Congressman
has warned the Speaker that his tenure as Speaker could be cut short if he takes it out on
those who didn't vote for him in the Republican ranks.  A move to reconsider the vote as
Speaker can be made by anyone who voted for Gingrich at any time and it becomes a privileged
motion.  The Speaker, after all, has to still face a vote on he report by the Ethics
Committee, perhaps as early as the end of this month. <dd>

That brings me to my second point.  I was asked last evening on a syndicated radio show how
Gingrich could overcome the media created image which now has a majority of Americans
believing that the Speaker has more ethical problems than the President of the United
States.  I answered with just three words: "Push an agenda".  A solid agenda which advances
the cause of limited government, a strong defense and traditional moral values, will
overcome the Speaker's adversity in a matter of a few weeks.  If Americans can be involved
in the policy process of governing the country, and if they generally agree with the
Speaker's agenda, they will forget about the Speaker's problems, even though his Democratic
opponents will raise those issues every chance they can get.<dd>

Even though this commentary is about the Speaker, a word needs to be said about the conduct
of some of  the Democrats.  When minority leader Dick Gephardt turned the gavel over to the
Speaker, he said it was his "responsibility" to do so.  He didn't say it was his high honor
or privilege to do so, words which usually accompany that ceremony.  Perhaps Gephardt was
still smarting from Monday's Washington Post editorial entitled "Why Gephardt will never be
Speaker".  It suggested that  Mr. Gephardt's ethics problems are worse than the Speaker's
and are almost certainly deliberate, as opposed to Gingrich's problems which appear to be
more inadvertent.<dd>

And then there was Minority Whip David Bonior.   While his fellow Democrats were giving
Gingrich three standing ovations during the course of the Speaker's 19 minute oration,
Bonior sat down, did not clap, and frowned angrily, a reaction no doubt to the fact that he
took on Gingrich and lost. <dd>

Despite a passion for a good fight, most Americans still admire sportsman like conduct. 
These Democratic leaders didn't display any of that yesterday. <dd>

So, Speaker Gingrich is being given another chance.  Either he will seize this moment in
history, as he did with his fine speech yesterday, and he will lead the country in the right
direction or he will not.  When all is said and done, Speaker Gingrich will be remembered in
history not for his ethics problems but for whether things changed in a positive direction
during his tenure or things declined further.  History only gives most political figures one
chance.  Speaker Gingrich needs to thank God for this second chance and to take the
responsibilities of governing for the common good very seriously. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 7, 1997
</h3> <h2>Rethinking Diplomatic Immunity</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A sort of
international drama has been playing out in both Washington and New York over the
long-debated question of diplomatic immunity.<dd>

In Washington, a 16-year-old girl, Joviane Waltrick, was killed in a tragic traffic accident
caused by an apparently intoxicated diplomat from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The
United States has formally asked the nation of Georgia to lift diplomatic immunity and
permit the young Georgian diplomat to be tried on a change of negligent homicide here in the
United States.<dd>

Meanwhile in New York City, two diplomats from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus got
involved in a brawl with New York City police after the police tried to arrest them for a
traffic violation. Officials from Belarus charge that the police engaged in brutality and
broke the arm of one of the diplomats in the process. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said
the diplomats were drunk and disorderly and moreover didn't pay their parking ticket. He has
now suggested that such members of the diplomatic community ought to go back to where they
came from and has ordered his police to begin towing their cars the same way cars of
ordinary citizens get towed if they violate parking regulations. The Russians, for example,
have 14,437 summonses for 222 cars stationed in New York, primarily at the United Nations,
which they have yet to pay.<dd>

Back in Washington, the U.S. State Department was on the defensive arguing that diplomatic
immunity needs to continue. In answer to the questions of angry reporters, the State
Department could not point to a single instance where diplomatic immunity has been waived by
a nation after a serious crime was committed. In most instances, such diplomats are simply
sent back to their native land.<dd>

It should be understood that the idea of diplomatic immunity was pushed by the United States
in the first place. It was this nation which insisted on most of the treaties or
understandings in this regard which are currently in effect. This is because the United
States was afraid, and rightly so, that its citizens could  break some unknown law in a
foreign country and thus be subject to punishment for such infractions according to local
practices. In the former Soviet Union, it was easy to break their laws. Many were made up
along the way, according to circumstance. Infractions there could well have caused Americans
to have been put to death or to have suffered long incarcerations in Soviet prisons. Right
now, in this age, it is unlawful in Saudi Arabia to attend a Roman Catholic Mass, for
example. A diplomat who simply wanted to exercise freedom of religion as he knows it in this
country could actually be put to death for doing so.<dd>

So there are valid reasons that the practice of diplomatic immunity was pushed by this
nation. And our diplomats will continue to need this sort of protection since rights which
we take for granted here are not guaranteed in most of the other nations of this world.<dd>

On the other hand, it seems to me that the negotiation of new agreements is in order. The
idea of diplomatic immunity was meant to protect citizens from arbitrary punishment for
violating unknown or obscure laws or laws which contradict practices which are commonly
accepted in the United States. Driving while drunk and thus endangering the lives of others,
it seems to me, is not acceptable in any nation. Without endangering the concept of immunity
which still has its utility, we need to see if we can't come up with agreements on such
issues which have the same meaning in all nations.<dd>

Georgian President Edward Shevrednadze has hinted that his government might consider waiving
diplomatic immunity in the case of his diplomat. If he does, that would set an excellent
example. But such a precedent is not good enough.<dd>

If we as a nation are capable of negotiating the fine points of peace between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, if we are capable of coming up with agreements for Northern Ireland or
Bosnia, surely we can do better than the present situation.<dd>

The Congress should mandate that the State Department form an immediate task force charged
with the responsibility of making recommendations on new agreements covering situations such
as the death of Joviane Waltrick or even Mayor Giuliani's complaints.<dd>

If our diplomats abroad drive while intoxicated and kill local residents of some nation,
they ought to suffer the appropriate local consequences. Issues like this have little to do
with the notion of protecting diplomats from arbitrary and capricious rules and laws which
are meant to entrap foreigners. I know I am talking about the State Department here, but
let's get down to some common sense. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 6, 1997 </h3>
<h2>Will the Supreme Court Turn Lose Dr. Death?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> In many ways,
a nation can be judged by how it treats the weakest of its people, those unable to fend for
themselves.  No, I am not making an argument for welfare benefits here.  Much of the
government assistance which has been granted over the past many decades has made people weak
and dependent.  There government intervention is counterproductive.  I am talking here about
those who cannot speak for themselves.  The unborn constitute one such group at one end of
the spectrum.  The aged and infirm, especially those who are disabled, are at the other end
of the spectrum. <dd>

The U.S. Supreme Court, having taken away the force of law which at one time protected the
rights of the unborn, is now about to hear Glucksberg vs. the State of Washington and Vacco
vs. Quill.  These cases will determine if the Supreme Court will now find a "Constitutional"
right to die the way the Court found the "right of privacy" which led to abortion on demand.
 Also being tested is physician assisted suicide.  In other words, will the Supreme Court
turn lose Dr. Deaths, symbolized by Jack Kevorkian, in every community in the land?.  The
way this Court has shown such an utter disregard for the sacredness of life, I would not be
at all surprised to see a majority opinion affirming death at this end of the spectrum as
well. <dd>

Evan Kemp, Jr., who was Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the
Bush Administration, and who has had a disabling disease since he was 12 years old, had a
moving piece in Sunday's Washington Post op-ed section entitled, "Could you Please Die Now?"
 In it, Kemp argues forcefully against the idea that assisted suicide should be legalized,
because, he rightfully contends, disabled people like himself have the most to fear from
such an idea. <dd>

Already, some hospitals are virtually forcing patients to sign "do not resuscitate" or DNR
orders requesting that so called heroic measures not be taken to keep the patient alive in
the case of an emergency which might develop.  Kemp goes on to cite several cases which are
just a sample of things to come if the court rules the way that some us fear it will.  Joe
Ehman is a 30 year old newspaper reporter in Rochester, New York who uses a wheelchair. 
Social workers hounded the poor man to sign a DNR form when he entered the hospital in 1995
for back surgery.  He declined to do so.  But just a few hours after surgery, while he was
still half under the anesthetic, another social worker tried to again get him to sign such a
form.  He managed to let her know that he would not because he didn't want to die.  God only
knows what would have happened had Ehman not had the presence of mind to resist. <dd>

He might have suffered the fate of Marjorie Nighbert, a 76 year old Florida woman who was
hospitalized last year after a stroke.  She did sign a DNR order, so her family used that to
push the apparently willing hospital authorities to deny the lady food and water.  The
hospital medical ethics committee ruled that she was "not medically competent to ask for
such treatment."  The lady starved to death 10 days later, strapped down to her hospital bed
to prevent her from stealing food from other patient's trays.<dd>

Kemp, for whom my daughter once worked as a speech writer, has more than a casual interest
in the subject.  When he was diagnosed with a progressive neomuscular disease, doctors gave
him just two years to live.  That was 47 years ago.  He, as with so many people we have
known, beat the odds.  What if, on the basis of their original estimate of his life span,
his doctors had decided that it would be better for him to die.  That way, he wouldn't have
been such a burden to his family.  Yes, Kemp is right when he suggests that the right to die
is going to lead to health care rationing.  Once we give physicians the right to help people
who supposedly are terminally ill and want to die, it is just a very short leap to permit
these same physicians to determine that a person should die even against his will because he
would require too much medical care for too long. It is coming and coming fast. The fact
that no jury in Michigan would convict Dr. Kevorkian tells us that society has bought the
notion that we, not God, ought to determine when we die.  If we can do that for ourselves,
why not someone else?.<dd>

It is not for nothing that Evan Kemp draws an analogy between what we are seeing today and
Hitler's first attempt at killing, which was of those who had disabilities, which he did on
the basis that such people were "useless eaters" and constituted "life unworthy of life". 
When that was tolerated by the society, the mass killing of Jews was not far behind. <dd>

Kemp, despite his disabilities, will be one of hopefully thousands who will be keeping vigil
outside the Supreme Court as they hear these cases. It is an unusual coalition.   Dr. C.
Everett Koop, former Surgeon General, will be among those addressing this mass protest
because he believes that the disability community is "so threatened by physician assisted
suicide."  For once the Clinton Administration, the AMA, the Catholic Church, Orthodox Jews,
the disability community and most conservatives are all on the same side.  The ACLU, which
always claimed to speak for the less fortunate, is to be sure on the side of death.  <dd>

Many of you watching this commentary can't be there with this Coalition.  But you can write
and let the Supreme Court know what you think on the subject.  Perhaps had that been done in
1972 when oral arguments were heard on Roe vs. Wade, the nation would have been spared that
horrendous decision which has led us directly to this point.  Never make the mistake of
believing that the Court is isolated from public opinion.  Not this court anyway.  This is
one issue where all of us have a stake in letting this aging court know where we stand. 
Maybe, just maybe, considering that they may one day soon be in a position where some doctor
or family member wants them to die before their time, just maybe they will understand. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 3, 1997 </h3>
<h2>Senate Should Not Seat Landrieu</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> It was exactly 30 years
ago, January 5th, 1967, when this naive, eager 24-year-old set foot inside what is now the
Dirksen Building (Dirksen was still alive then) to begin to work in the U.S. Senate. What an
education that was. Within the first month I learned something which utterly shocked me. The
Senator I worked for introduced a bill in the Senate with which he didn't agree. When I
questioned this, he said he did so to help a constituent. I said, in my ignorance, "But what
if the bill gets passed?" Gordon Allott smiled at my question and said reassuringly, "I have
a deal with Scoop [Jackson (D-WA), then Chairman of the Senate Interior Committee] that the
bill will never see the light of day." And this, by the way, was done by one of the most
honest men ever to have served in the Senate.<dd>

Such began my insight into the long-playing game of Washington deception. The trick is to
look like you are doing one thing while doing the opposite. These games never cease.<dd>

The Senate is getting ready to seat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana "without prejudice," meaning
that if it turns out there is sufficient evidence of voter fraud in the recent Senate
election there, theoretically the seat could be vacated and a new election held. I say
theoretically because, although key Senators are telling Landrieu's opponent Woody Jenkins
otherwise, the fact is the way this is being orchestrated means the race is over. Even if
the Senate Rules Committee concluded that there was enough fraud in the election to have
turned the results (and more evidence is coming in every day), all the Democrats would have
to do is to filibuster and Mary Landrieu would keep her Senate seat. And they would, of
course. This is all a cozy little deal worked out between the majority and the minority in
the Senate.<dd>

The fact is, if the Republican majority were serious about the problems in Louisiana, they
would not allow Mary Landrieu to be seated at all. That is what the Democrats did to Louis
Wyman of New Hampshire, the certified winner of the Senate race in that state in 1974. The
Democrats claimed voter irregularities. There was no evidence whatsoever of the sort that
has turned up in Louisiana. In any case, the majority in 1975 refused to seat Wyman.
Governor Meldrim Thompson then appointed just-retired Senator Norris Cotton to the Senate
seat to serve in the interim and a new election was held. In that election, the certified
winner, Louis Wyman, was defeated by the loser of the general election in 1974, John
Durkin.<dd>

This took place before Vice President Nelson Rockefeller maneuvered to change the Senate
rules. In those days, Republicans could have mounted a filibuster with just 34 votes. They
had 38 Senators that year. Democrats didn't take that chance. They did not seat
certified-winner Wyman conditionally.<dd>

The fact is that there is evidence enough right now to deprive Mary Landrieu of that Senate
seat. If only the Republican majority had the stomach for confrontation this is exactly what
they would do. Instead, we will go on with the charade of an investigation. From their point
of view, the Republicans will do Woody Jenkins the favor of validating his claims and lay
the blame on the Democrats for filibustering a move for a new election.<dd>

Well, Republicans, how about doing the nation a favor? How about preserving the integrity of
our electoral system? How about, for once, standing up and behaving as if you were the
majority? Mary Landrieu should not be sworn in as a Senator in the 105th Congress on
Tuesday. This would be the perfect occasion to stop playing games and to start leveling with
the American people.<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 2, 1997
</h3> <h2>The Truth Is Spreading</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A quarter of a million
people jammed into Belgrade's main square New Year's day to continue their protest against
Yugoslavian Communist President Slobodan Milosevic's having voided opposition  victories in
23 municipal elections. <dd>

These demonstrations have been continuing on a daily basis for weeks now, and they have
begun to threaten the last Communist regime on the European continent. <dd>

The demonstrators are unarmed.  Milosevic's troops are armed to the teeth, yet betting is
with the street demonstrators.  Why?<dd>

The real weapon which the people have today in Yugoslavia which wasn't available to people
in past decades who lived under Communist regimes is underground media.  A low power FM
station in Belgrade, which can't even be heard in some parts of the city, has now formed an
alliance with other small stations throughout the country and is broadcasting the truth to
the people.  Meanwhile, the state controlled radio and television, which dominate the
country, hardly mention that anything is happening.  Thanks to the Internet, which kept the
voice of the radio station alive for a short period when the government shut it down,
information is now available to citizens which would have been unthinkable a decade ago.
<dd>

A Communist regime can exist only if the people are ignorant and isolated.  That is how the
Soviets kept power for seven decades.  I am no fan of Mikhail Gorbachev.  His own people
demonstrated what they thought of him by giving him a half of one per cent of the vote in
last year's Russian Presidential primaries.  But Gorbachev did one positive thing which
ultimately led to his downfall.  At the urging of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Gorbachev stopped the jamming of the BBC worldservice, the Voice
of America and eventually Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe a decade ago.  No doubt
Gorbachev did not understand the dynamic of the information age.<dd>

Yet once the people of the Soviet empire had access to alternative information, the
Communist regime there was doomed.  The Communists had the tanks and trained armies and a
huge spy network, but it could not compete with the truth.  I well recall an official
government hosted dinner I attended in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, in the same lodge where a
couple of months earlier Secretary of State James Baker and then Soviet Foreign Minister
Edward Shevrednaze had met.  Irkutsk is in the middle of Siberia.  Yet officials there were
more up on American politics than most Americans and more sympathetic to America than at
least a third of its own people.  This was in 1990, a full year before the flag of the
Soviet Union was lowered over the Kremlin.  The reason?  These Siberians had built
themselves tiny little crystal set type radios and pulled in information from Voice of
America which for the previous decades they could not hear.  I knew after I attended that
dinner that the Soviet empire as we knew it was doomed.<dd>

Broadcast information had created a bigger fifth column inside the Soviet Union than the KGB
could handle.<dd>

The same thing is happening in Yugoslavia a decade later.  Even some in the Milosevic
controlled army have told their commanders that they will not shoot at the opposition
demonstrators.  There may yet be much bloodshed, because dictators don't give up easily. 
But in the end the Communists will fall.<dd>

Remember Tienamen Square? Recall that for the first several days of street demonstrations
there the local soldiers were sympathetic to the students.  The reason the confrontations
dragged on for so long is that the Communist Chinese had  to call in troops from the far
provinces to suppress the democracy movement. The local troops would not shoot.  Troops from
the backwater places in China, where information is not readily available, were told that
China had been invaded by a foreign power. It took that kind of lie to crush democracy. But
as the Internet advances and more information is now available from Taiwan and elsewhere,
that sort of lie won't cut it  forever.<dd>

That is why I am betting on what has been called "the information Guerrillas" in Yugoslavia.
 The truth, ultimately, is more powerful than armies.  It is too early to tell at the
moment, but 1997 could be the last year for the Milosevic regime.  His ability to keep his
people loyal has been dependent on keeping the truth out.  But the truth is spreading.  As
with the mighty Soviet Union, the truth may prove too powerful for the remaining Communist
regimes to survive. <P>

<h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The Media Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the 
news media and, in the words of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, 
"people are tired of the media elite."
<DD>
It is about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a 
long while, especially with the shift to advocacy journalism which 
occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's accelerated by Watergate.
Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the facts 
rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public 
figures.
<DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the 
following: Journalists ignore people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if 
he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically biased. The funny 
thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree 
with that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. 
The real problem here isn't that journalists are paid off. The problem 
is that the powerful have access to important information and they 
become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that 
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any 
story, on television or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find 
that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of the story will either be 
at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be 
entirely missing.
<DD>
Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude 
in newsrooms these days is that America is among the worst places on 
earth and that we are responsible for most of the world's problems. If 
you have that view, it is not hard to be negative. Journalists have too 
much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have 
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of 
which was driven by fears of the media and not by what was best for the 
nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the press. Nothing is sacred 
anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their slogan, 
regardless of who is hurt.
<DD>
Journalists don't care about people. We live 
in a cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by 
surveying any newsroom. The media makes people guilty until proven 
innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop the story. The 
media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public 
has an insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and 
judging by the ratings of various TV shows, the media may be right on 
that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for accuracy went 
out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, 
since expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone 
suing the media over misstatements had to prove malice in order to 
collect. That is well understood by the lowest journalist on the 
ladder.
<DD>
The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look 
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational 
coverage of things which gets the ratings and sells the papers. 
Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed. Retractions happen all 
too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally 
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper.
I agree with most of the findings of this survey, but one issue greatly 
disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public says that the government 
could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the point 
of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a 
minute here. The same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey 
find the media too liberal, wants the Clinton Administration to force 
balanced reporting?
<DD>
When we had the so called "Fairness Doctrine" in 
force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know 
them because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines 
time for opposing viewpoints.
<DD>
Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as 
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind 
the statement of Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense 
Secretary." Government," he said, "is the enemy  until you need a 
friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans 
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as 
soon as there is a problem as big as this one is, we want the 
government to solve it. The government is the last place we want to 
turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media. Most 
Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control 
all of this. If we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend 
their money to reach fewer and fewer numbers. These papers will go out 
of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and television that 
we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do 
them in.
<DD>
We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with 
the media with our willingness to continue to buy their product. That's 
all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h2>U.S. Inherits Soviet Traits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Two recent incidents with two different airlines well illustrate how the United States is fast becoming a nation of bureaucratic rules rather than a nation of individuals empowered to make common sense judgments.
<dd>The other day I had to make a quick trip to Phoenix to address the annual meeting of the Arizona Transit Association. I chose Southwest Airlines out of Baltimore Washington International airport because that airline saved me literally four hours over the other choice I was given, was a United flight out of Dulles airport.
<dd>Southwest is a well-run and efficient airline with lower fares than all of the competition.
<dd>Somehow they have managed to get in and out of interim terminals in 20 minutes while their competition takes at least an hour. The only problem with Southwest is that in order to keep costs down they always seem to have the last gates in any given terminal concourse. Gates are usually auctioned off and Southwest wants to pay the lowest price possible in order to keep their fares down.
<dd>As some viewers know, I broke my back early this year and am held together by 16 metal parts. I am very blessed to be walking at all. I can now walk reasonably well but when I have to carry a bag it is quite difficult. I had only one bag when I arrived at BWI. When I got through the security system, which at BWI now requires that hand carried bags be unpacked and searched, I asked if there was an electric cart to take me to gate 16 at the very end of the concourse. I was told that Southwest did not operate such carts, whereas other airlines on other concourses did. They do need to cut costs to keep the fares low. So I managed to walk carrying my bag to the end of the terminal. I wanted to check in early because on Southwest, there is open seating. Southwest doesn't serve real food and this was 1 p.m. so I wanted to get something to eat, but the cafeteria was half way down the concourse. So after I received my boarding pass, I asked the gate attendant if I could leave my bag with him, explaining my circumstances. Southwest is known for its cheerful, even funny employees. Not this fellow. He literally growled at me, &quot;Your bag has to be attended at all times.&quot; I replied, &quot;yes and if you keep it, it will be.&quot; Then he really got surly. &quot;You have to keep your bag with you at all times,&quot; he barked. So off I went carrying my bag. When I got to the cafeteria, the arrangement was such that I could not set it down anywhere and keep an eye on it. So I carried my bag and a tray at the same time. Unfortunately carrying both elevated was more than I could handle and some of the contents on the tray ended up on the floor.
<dd>The second incident involved a United flight out of New York. We pulled away from the gate and onto the runway, whereupon the pilot came on and said, &quot;We're sorry folks, we are 18th in line and because of the weather, take-offs are very slow. We will be here at least a half hour.&quot; The man across the aisle from me summoned the stewardess. He told her, &quot;I almost missed this plane. I didn't have a chance to get to the bathroom and I was counting on going after takeoff. I need to get to the bathroom.&quot; She told him emphatically, &quot;You must stay in your seat while we are on the runway.&quot; He asked again: &quot;Please, this is really an emergency. I am not feeling well.&quot; She got very agitated for no good reason as the gentleman was as polite as could be. &quot;You stay in your seat and if you try to get up I will have you arrested,&quot; she told him. At that point other passengers around the man hissed and booed at her. I got her attention and told her, &quot;You know if this man is ill and suffers any damage as the result of your order he could sue you.&quot; At that point she threatened to have me arrested. Then just like the Soviet attendants on Aeroflot used to do before the collapse of the Soviet Union she stood in the aisle of the plane with her hands on her hips and shouted, &quot;I have complete authority to enforce FAA regulations. If anyone else objects I will get the police.&quot; The poor man was forced to sit there in agony for over 40 minutes until the plane was in the skies and the captain had turned off the seat belt sign.
<dd>In an earlier time, in both instances, an attendant would have been able to use his own judgment. To the Southwest gate attendant I had pointed out that my bag had just been completely unpacked and repacked and that he himself had removed the red tag indicating that the bag was okay. I don't think I exactly fit the profile of a terrorist. He should be allowed to make such judgments. Aboard the United flight the other passengers all assured the stewardess that if she let the man go to the bathroom, they would not ask for the same privilege. No, this &quot;lady&quot; wanted to play the role of the enforcer.
<dd>The irony is that on my last Aeroflot flight from Ulan Bataar to Moscow, the stewardesses were as polite and helpful as could be. They accommodated several unusual requests from passengers. They now have competition from Mongolian Air which is a superbly run U.S.-style airline using Boeing 737's.
<dd>Maybe the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was correct. He predicted convergence between the Soviet system and ours. As far as I can see, the Russians are becoming more like the United States used to be and we are becoming more like the Soviets used to be, a land of mindless regulations where the individual counts for nothing.

<h2>
Strategic Control in the Hands of Liberal Senators
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>There has been a great deal of talk about how Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is leading the most conservative group of Republican Senators in at least 50 and maybe even 70 years.
<dd>True enough. And it is also true that there is only a small group of liberal Republicans left: Chafee (Rhode Island), Jeffords (Vermont), Specter (Pennsylvania), Collins and Snowe (Maine), with Warner (Virginia) and Gorton (Washington) and sometimes D'Amato (New York) falling into the moderate category.
<dd>By my count that leaves 47 votes ranging from moderate conservative to rock solid conservative in the GOP Caucus. I call that a pretty good majority, 47 - 8.
<dd>So the policies coming out of the Senate should be pretty good, right? In fact, most commentators have suggested that it will be the Senate which takes conservative initiatives now, not the House as it was in the 104th Congress.
<dd>Well, think again. Thanks to the new Senate GOP Conference Chairman Connie Mack having chosen Senator Slade Gorton (Washington) to chair the Committee on Committees, and thanks to only a two-vote margin of Republicans vs. Democrats on each committee, it is now the case that the moderate and liberal Republicans are controlling the show. They are strategically placed on each major committee so that all one of them has to do is to vote with the solid lineup of liberal Democrats and they can block anything positive from getting out of committee. In the case of the finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth (Delaware) is stuck with two such votes so this Committee Chairman, who is as solid as a rock on taxation issues, can't control his own committee.
<dd>That puts these eight Senators in control of the agenda. Either the Committee Chairman compromises with them or they vote with the Democrats and nothing happens. Of course a couple of them, Jeffords and Chafee, remain Committee Chairman themselves, thanks to a lack of fortitude on the part of any of the Conservative Senators to challenge them under the new rules of the GOP caucus. So in those cases, they can control what is even discussed in Committee. 
<dd>How a rip roaring majority of 47 can be outdone by eight is really an incredible development. Apparently Senator Mack (Florida), who had just been elected Conference Chairman, was just too naive to figure out what was happening. A good question is this: Since he is supposed to be such a solid conservative, how is it that, out of the whole group of 47, he managed to ask one of the group of eight to be in charge of the Committee selection process?
<dd>Unless the Senate leadership wants to now take the highly unusual step of initiating legislation from the floor instead of in committee, don't look for any positive, constructive pro-growth, pro-family measures coming out of the Senate. You don't have to worry about the Democrats filibustering such proposals. Heck, they'll all be killed in committee.

<h2>
Political Correctness and the Media
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>On the show "Ways and Means" Tuesday night, my colleague Bob Siegrist and I had as one of our guests Mr. Roderick Conrad of Project 21, the black conservative group. We were discussing the brutal attack by Congressman Clay of Missouri, the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on the just defeated black Republican Congressman Gary Franks. We asked Mr. Conrad twice what was driving political correctness in the black community and twice he replied, "the media" - an interesting answer.
<dd>Both Siegrist and I have been around long enough to have witnessed the profound change which has taken place in media circles which makes Mr. Conrad's answer the correct one. Mind you, most who populated the media were always liberal. But despite that they played by certain rules.
<dd>Siegrist's reporting career dates to the late 1930's, and mine to the late 1950's. Siegrist was once the celebrated prodigy of the powerful WGN radio in Chicago. Both of us worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel a decade apart. He wrote editorials. I covered local politics. About 31 years ago, I worked for Bob Siegrist as an editorial assistant. At the time, Siegrist had put together his own radio network to carry a daily commentary show. (Yes, Rush Limbaugh wasn't the first in the nation to do so). I was hired by Siegrist because he knew I generally agreed with his point of view. But I found out all too quickly that when it came to the copy I wrote for his show every day, he could have cared less about my opinion. He wanted facts. If I couldn't back up every word I wrote with cold hard data, I was in big trouble.
<dd>I mention all of this because even in this case, when I was hired because I had a point of view, I was expected to put that aside to help Siegrist deliver accurate information. When I was working for the Milwaukee Sentinel during the Goldwater campaign of 1964, the management made it clear that I was not to cover the campaign because of my political passion for the then Senator from Arizona. I sat across from Cy Rice, who did cover the campaign, and even though I heard his interviews and what he said privately afterwards, I never knew his political views and readers couldn't tell either.
<dd>That is the way it was back then and the way lots of people still think it is now. As recently as 1984, I received from one of the major daily papers in San Francisco an unsolicited letter of apology after running a tough piece written by one of its reporters. The reporter had soundly trashed a pro-family conference we were running there just prior to the Democratic convention of that year. The reporter turned out to be a homosexual activist who hated what we stood for. In the letter of apology, the paper's managing editor said he had not understood this when he assigned the reporter to cover us, and when he found out he removed the reporter from that assignment. The managing editor assured me we would receive fair treatment from there on out. We did.
<dd>That would not happen today. Whereas back then if editors found out you were involved with one group or the other, if they didn't fire you for such activity, they made it clear that you could not cover the activities of such a group. At the time I was an active journalist, black reporters  were not assigned to cover the civil rights movement precisely because editors felt they had an emotional stake in the coverage.
<dd>It is exactly the opposite today. Today homosexual reporters are deliberately assigned to cover the recent court decision on same sex marriages in Hawaii on the grounds that only they understand the feelings of that community and thus can give the correct picture of the impact of that decision. Black reporters cover the civil rights movement. That accounts for the astounding statement by Mr. Conrad that his organization, Project 21, which is the leading organization of black conservatives in the country, had yet to receive a single call from the national media asking for reaction to Congressman Clay's assertion that Congressman Franks had sold out his race because he didn't follow the liberal line. In today's media, if you are not a liberal woman, the assumption is that you cannot possibly comprehend the women's movement, so mostly radical feminist women today write about the so-called women's movement. That's why the white reporter for the Washington Times was told by the black principal and students at a Washington, DC, school to get her "white ass"  --  forgive the direct quote  --  out of the school. You see, in today's media no white person can possibly write accurately about the conditions of the oppressed blacks. Anyway, you get the picture.
<dd>Well, then, hearing all of this, you may think that things probably balance out because these same media outlets hire conservatives to cover the conservative movement and born again Christians to cover evangelicals. Wrong. That doesn't happen because from today's media perspective, what is happening in those movements is largely irrelevant. We are in what the New York Times has labeled "the post Christian era." As to conservatives and Republicans, even the back-to-back Republican control of Congress for the first time in 68 years is looked on as a temporary aberration on the inevitable road to resurgent liberalism, so why bother.
<dd>Siegrist and I were always a minority in our chosen profession. But it didn't matter as much then. True, it did effect what stories were covered. But once a decision was made to cover a story, even liberal reporters felt some obligation to cover the facts without getting caught up in the insider feelings of the moment.
<dd>No, what you are getting today, which passes for news and factual information, is beyond bias. It is a reflection of the agenda of those who are doing the reporting. That is why, more than ever, you need NET. We have an agenda too. But it isn't partisan. It is called telling the truth. Three years ago when we started NET, I was asked by Stone Phillips of NBC who was going to provide the balance in NET's coverage. I replied that we are the balance, and I said "we need a whole network just to balance out Bryant Gumbel." I haven't been back on the "Today" show since. That's just fine. I stand by my statement.

<h2>
Leadership in Lott
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 <DD>Trent Lott was re-elected Senate Majority Leader
today by his fellow Republicans without any opposition. He leads
the most conservative group of Senate Republicans since, perhaps,
the 1920's.  Lott is a symbol of the changes in his own party.
He came to Washington as a Democrat. He served on the staff of
the late William Colmer, Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
and one of the last of the crusty old Conservative Democrats to
rule a House Committee with an iron hand.
<DD>
 Lott left Colmer to run for the House as a Republican
in 1972, the year that Richard Nixon swept the South. Ed Feulner
and I told Lott he was crazy for doing so. [Feulner, now the President
of the Heritage Foundation, back then was an influential House
staffer.] Lott could see already then what we didn't yet recognize
and that was that the Republicans were going to one day dominate
the South.
<DD>
 In 1980 when Ronald Reagan swept many new and conservative
Republicans into the House, Lott ran for and was elected House
GOP whip. He defeated Bud Shuster, the favorite of the GOP establishment
at the time. He held that position, largely in frustration, under
Bob Michel for eight years and finally opted to run for the Senate.
<DD>
 When in 1994 another large crop of freshmen Senators
was swept into office, Lott challenged then Majority Whip Alan
Simpson and defeated him by one vote. When Bob Dole resigned,
Lott faced off against his fellow Mississippian Thad Cochran and
beat him 44 to 8. Lott has never lost an election at home or in
the Congress.
<DD>
 It is clear that Lott knows when to hold 'em and
when to fold 'em. Two votes were added to Lott's majority in an
election which saw Bill Clinton sweep the nation. Not only that,
most of the incoming Republican Senators are more conservative
than the Republicans they replaced. The liberal wing of the party
is down to a few votes.
<DD>
 But the one thing Lott doesn't have which he had
when he entered the leadership in 1980 is conservative Democrats.
Lott became famous for being able to reach across the aisle to
get votes for Ronald Reagan's favorite programs. Conservative
Democrats trusted him. He may have changed parties but at heart
he was still one of them. Today when Lott looks across the aisle,
he finds almost no moderate to conservative Democrats left. Those
he could get from time to time in the last session, Heflin of
Alabama, Johnston of Louisiana, Exon of Nebraska, are all gone,
replaced either by Republicans or liberal Democrats.
<DD>
 In the Senate, even if Lott can keep his 55 Republicans
together on some votes, he still needs another five votes to break
a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle knows that and
will play it for all it is worth.
<DD>
 Lott is, when all is said and done, a wily Southerner.
He likes to make deals, but sometimes, when he feels a great principle
is at stake, he can be tough as nails. Following the Civil War,
Southerners learned to adjust. They learned to sound accommodating
even when they didn't intend to be. Lott is very much that way.
What you see and hear is not always what you get. And that often
surprises friends and enemies alike.
<DD>
Lott is the most clever GOP leader in the Senate
since the late Everett Dirksen passed on to his eternal reward
in 1969. He is a man who keeps his word once you can be absolutely
sure what his word is.
<DD>
Lott is someone who knows how to use power, but he
uses it very sparingly. He is often compared with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. He likes the comparison. Mitchell
just smiled and smiled while he was driving a stake through the
heart of the Republicans. Lott wouldn't mind repaying the favor
from time to time.
<DD>
 Lott will have at his side a conservative team to
help him. That team reflects where the GOP has gone these past
years: Don Nickels from Oklahoma as whip; Larry Craig of Idaho
as Policy Committee Chairman; Connie Mack of Florida as Conference
Chairman; Paul Coverdell of Georgia as Conference Secretary; Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky as Chairman of the Senatorial campaign committee.
The South and the West, that is where Republicans tend to do well
and that is where the leadership team comes from.
<DD>
The Senate is a far different place than it was 30
years ago when I first encountered it. Half of the GOP membership
back then was liberal and Southern Conservative Democrats dominated
the structure.
<DD>
Trent Lott is truly a creature of the body which
he will lead for another Congress. As with the South itself, what
change comes about during his term will be incremental, steady
and managed. Trent Lott is no revolutionary but in terms of the
Senate itself, it is revolutionary that he is its leader.<BR>

<h2>
Clinton's Difficult Choice
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Poor Janet Reno. She can't win no matter what she does. Just a few days ago, the Republicans were singing the praises of the Attorney General calling her "honest and independent". That was because close aides of the President had been all over town telling anyone who would listen in the media that the President wanted to dump Miss Reno because she had been too willing to apply the independent counsel statute. Four times she had invoked that procedure regarding Clinton Administration officials and so there are that many high level investigations going on at the present moment.
<dd>The White House was especially concerned that the Attorney General would invoke the independent counsel statute in the matter of the foreign fund-raising practices of the Democrats, which became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
<dd>Well, whether the threat to her job was enough to get her attention, or whatever the reason, and at this point the lady deserves the benefit of the doubt, Janet Reno declined to invoke the independent counsel statute in the Democratic party fund-raising case. In her reply to Senator John McCain of Arizona, signed by a Deputy Attorney General, Janet Reno said one thing which is absolutely true and another which is highly questionable. First, she said that the statute itself was not designed to cover issues involving a political party, which is a private organization. True enough. But then the Attorney General went on to say that there is no evidence that either the President or Vice President has been improperly involved in the case (which, if true, would trigger the statute) and thus the investigation will be handled internally by the Justice Department and not by an independent counsel. But that statement misses the whole point.
<dd>We don't know what the role of the President and Vice President was in this episode. True, they both have denied any wrong doing. Richard Nixon also assured us he wasn't a crook. But it is essential to understand just what sort of influence foreign money paid in determining our government's policies. While Al Gore says he had no idea that a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple handled illegal contributions, (including several $5,000 contributions from Buddhist nuns who had taken a vow of poverty), the really suspicious activities involve the President himself. He met several times with Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, formerly with the powerful Indonesian conglomerate known as the Lippo group. In at least one case, U.S. policy toward Indonesia changed following one of those meetings. Maybe that was all just coincidence, but that, at least, is one huge question mark hanging over this matter.
<dd>So Senator McCain, (who had written Reno to ask her to invoke the independent counsel statute) and Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have both suggested that in view of Reno's decision, the Republican majority in Congress will just have to hold hearings on Democratic fundraising. That is entirely appropriate under the circumstances, because those hearings will put pressure on the internal unit at the Department to Justice to make its investigation honest.
<dd>Attorney General Reno did say that if the internal investigation warranted it, an independent counsel could always be appointed later. Maybe after the President reassures her that she will be retained during her second term she will feel more liberated to act.
<dd>The issue, in any case, is not going away. Now the Attorney General has earned harsh words from the same folks who had been lauding her  just days ago. It remains to be seen, however, if the White House aides who had been trashing her will now feel she has demonstrated sufficient loyalty to the President to be kept on the job. Bill Clinton has a big problem regarding Janet Reno. If he fires her, he will suffer great political damage because the assumption will be that she got the axe because she was too anxious to see his Administration investigated. On the other hand, if he retains her, he does run the risk of her rediscovering her independence because she retains considerable credibility with the media and the Congress and could easily recover from this temporary setback.
<dd>Yes, poor Janet Reno. The lady is not well physically and she has problems no matter which way she elects to go. It is Bill Clinton who deserves the real pity, however. He has a problem if he fires his Attorney General and he may well have a problem if he doesn't. It is for this reason that Presidents have always looked for close friends to put in that position. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's third choice. They hadn't even met until he made the appointment. Maybe, considering all the trouble he is in, Bill Clinton really wants a close friend in the  Attorney General's office. Too bad Vince Foster didn't live to see this day. He might well have made the ideal Attorney General for Bill Clinton.

<h2>
Time to Reform the FDA
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Another in the long line of appointees of President Clinton is stepping down and in this case, not a moment too soon.
<dd>David A. Kessler will resign early next year as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Actually he was first appointed by President George Bush, but toward the end of the Bush Administration he signaled that he really was a Clinton supporter and Clinton kept him on as FDA Commissioner.
<dd>During his tenure, Kessler engineered several major power grabs which opponents contend are unconstitutional at worst or against the will of Congress at best.
<dd>Actually, Kessler's adventures against tobacco, widely embraced by Bill Clinton, is one of the key factors in continued Republican control in the House of Representatives. Although union and environmentalist money defeated many GOP incumbents in the North, Republicans picked up enough seats in the South to offset those gains and Republicans hung on to the House. Several GOP incumbents in the South and border states, thought originally to be in political trouble, all kept their seats due in part to the Administration's war on tobacco.
<dd>Kessler's departure comes at a time when Congress was beginning to take an increasing interest in his power maneuvers. There were signs that the 105th Congress was finally going to confront the FDA chief so Kessler probably thought it was a good time to get going. Former FDA General Counsel Peter Barton Hut said Kessler's unexpected announcement yesterday was "great news both for the FDA and for the public health." The FDA is "in the worst state of disarray in four decades," Hut said. The agency "now needs a real leader who will focus on the agency and not on their own personal agenda."
<dd>Indeed that is Kessler's legacy.
<dd>He greatly expanded FDA's power and in the process ran roughshod over the legislative process. The more controversial his actions became the more he seemed to enjoy the fight. Ralph Nader-style proponents of big government view him in heroic terms. Business concerns which were victims of his arbitrary and often capricious harassment view him as the devil incarnate.
<dd>As with all practitioners of power politics in Washington, he got a bit carried away with his own office. The Washington Legal Foundation just issued a report accusing Kessler of padding his expense account during his tenure. In truth, that may have prompted his resignation more than anything else. Better to leave now while some segments of the media and the public consider you a hero, then to fight charges which will tarnish your image and give opponents the opening they had longed for.
<dd>President Clinton has made noises about accommodating the realities of a Republican Congress by appointing more centrist people in his Administration. The FDA would be an excellent place to demonstrate his sincerity.
<dd>While Commissioner Kessler has used his time and energy to assume jurisdiction over products where he had no authority to do so, the United States has lagged way behind the rest of the developed nations of the world in approving new life-saving drugs. It is a travesty that U.S. citizens now have to travel abroad to seek medical treatment deemed safe in Europe and Japan but not available here. The poor, which Kessler and his friends always claimed they were championing, cannot afford to go abroad for treatment. They have been left to die untreated here at home. Kessler was bold in seeking new power, but extraordinarily timid in taking action to save the lives of U.S. citizens.
<dd>Congress should now pass legislation to reform the agency to force it to function as it was set up to do. The FDA  ought to swiftly test and put on the market new products that further the health of the nation. The FDA ought to get out of those areas where Congress has not given it jurisdiction.
<dd>The President, for his part, should look for someone sensible to head the agency. Kessler, for all of his great public relations, has actually succeeded only in tying up the agency with various lawsuits which will take years to settle. Those law suits can be put behind us if the President will make the right appointment. Bill Clinton won't appoint any conservative to office, but he doesn't have to appoint a power-mad ideologue either.
Now we will get a chance to see if Bill Clinton wants to behave as a "New Democrat," at long last, or if he intends to replace Kessler with another headline-seeking Commissioner with his own agenda. That choice, which is bound to be given significant scrutiny by the Congress, will tell us a great deal about Bill Clinton's plans for a second term.

<h2>
The Speaker's Profound Remarks
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was approved by his party caucus for another term as leader of the House of Representatives, said something very important which got little coverage yesterday. The media was busy talking about the Speaker's pledge to cooperate with President Clinton and his acknowledgment that he had made some mistakes.
<P>
<DD>
Yet of far more profound significance were these words by Speaker Gingrich:
"The country will never again be healthy if we don't have the courage to confront the spiritual and cultural and moral deficit that is an even greater threat to our future than the economic deficit.
<P>
<DD>
"In the core documents of our freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, is says unequivocally, we are 'endowed by Our Creator with certain unalienable rights'. And I think we have an obligation to reassert in a calm, open way, involving people of all backgrounds, each approaching God in their own unique way, that this nation comes from God, that it is in fact only successful when it is submissive to God's will, that while all of us are sinners and all of us fall short, that does not excuse any of us forgetting where our powers and our responsibilities come [from]; and somehow reestablishing in the public square that it is legitimate, in fact it is vital, that we recognize the degree to which, in the broadest sense, if America does not get its rights from Our Creator, there is no explanation of America and there is no way of thinking of the future. 
<P>
<DD>
"I am not suggesting here in any way a state religion. I'm not suggesting in any way a theocracy. But I am suggesting to you that if you read Lincoln and you read the Founding Fathers and you read as recently as FDR, and then you look at our modern 30-second attack commercials and you look at the decay in our society, that maybe we lost a great deal when we became too timid to talk openly about the source of the American dream and the source of our rights and that we have an obligation to re-establish them."
To this I can only add "Amen and Amen." It is a mark of our time that the Speaker feels he would have to add as many qualifiers as he did in making a very valid statement. The early leaders of our nation were much more straight forward in proclaiming their belief in God.
<P>
<DD>
Important civil documents invoke the name of the "Most Holy Trinity." The argument then was between those such as Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged a distant deity and those who proclaimed that we were a Christian nation, albeit one which was tolerant of other beliefs.
<P>
<DD>
Today the argument is between those who want only to acknowledge God in the public square, as the Speaker did in his speech, and those who insist that belief in God is at most a private matter, and any utterance or acknowledgment of God in the outside world is not only improper but should be forbidden. Unfortunately, in what the New York Times has described as the "post-Christian era in America," those who want not to separate church and state but to ban God from government, have won the day.
<P>
<DD>
Viewers know I have many differences with the Speaker. But I applaud him for raising this issue. He did so on the day on which his father, Robert Gingrich, who had adopted him at age three, died of cancer at age 71.
<P>
<DD>
The words of Speaker Gingrich were a fitting tribute to the only father he ever knew. There is something that happens to us when our fathers die. We begin to look at life more seriously. Somehow when they are still alive, we think of ourselves still as kids, no matter how old we or they may be. But when we lose our fathers, we understand that the future now is up to us. We take responsibilities more seriously.
<P>
<DD>
I believe in the Providence of God. I believe nothing happens by accident. The Speaker said with the passing of his Dad, he felt strongly that he had to bring up the issue of God in the public square, even though it might be a little controversial. I believe he was inspired to do so. The Speaker spoke the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Let us ask Almighty God to find rest for Robert Gingrich in a place where there is no pain nor grief but only everlasting life. Let us ask that same God to inspire and bless Speaker Gingrich that he might find the wisdom and strength to do exactly what he suggested needs to be done: namely to help to reestablish God's rightful place in the affairs of mankind.
<P>

<h2>
The Declining Conscience of America
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Those who watched this program regularly earlier this year may recall that when President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion measure, I predicted that this would be the high water mark of his administration. That act, I suggested, would bring about his defeat in the Fall. It is true that Clinton, who at that moment enjoyed a 56% approval rating, the highest of his Presidency for more than a day or two, never did achieve that high water mark again. But it is not true that this issue made a controlling difference in this election. 
<p>
<dd>
The liberal columnist Mark Shields, also host of CNN's Capital Gang, said today that post election survey data revealed that abortion was important to a much greater portion of the electorate than had originally been believed. Moreover, of those for whom abortion was deemed their most important issue in this election, Bob Dole defeated Bill Clinton two to one. So much for the myth that the so called pro choice position is an automatic winner with the electorate. It can be correctly argued that abortion did not effect the outcome of the Presidential race because Bob Dole refused to make it an issue. 
<p>
<dd>
Even when, in the final debate, a minister handed Bob Dole a soft ball question about the decline in morality in America, Dole did not raise the issue and gave President Clinton a pass. Unless voters went to one of the churches where pastors made this an issue or unless voters received mailings from the National Right to Life Committee, they probably were simply unaware that this was an issue. Indeed, another survey released last week revealed that among voters who followed and understood the issues, Dole was a decisive winner. 
<p>
<dd>
But among those who simply voted without following what was going on in the country, Bill Clinton won in a landslide. There were races, however, where the abortion issue became a principal focus. In Louisiana, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan declared that it would be a sin for Catholics to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Mary Landrieu because of her abortion position. What followed was days of discussion in the media about the separation of church and state, so that voters almost could not escape hearing about the issue. Since Louisiana has the greatest share of Catholics in the South, Hannan's statement was thought to be the death blow to Landrieu. But, barring the ability of Republican candidate Woody Jenkins to present evidence to the Senate of overwhelming fraud, Mary Landrieu will take her place as a Senator in January. Just a few years ago a statement such as Hannan made on abortion would have been a death blow to Landrieu. There is at least some evidence that Hannan's statement may have actually moved some Catholic voters to vote for Landrieu out of spite. 
<p>
<dd>
Likewise in Iowa, the race for the Senate against incumbent Senator Tom Harkin became, in the words of Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot's campaign manager John Maxwell "a referendum on partial birth abortion". Lightfoot's initiative on the issue hurt incumbent Senator Harkin badly enough that it forced Harkin to air a television commercial accusing Lightfoot of distorting his record. Harkin claimed that he really was against partial birth abortion. That caused Lightfoot to air a commercial featuring a retired Catholic priest who looked like he stepped out of a Bing Crosby movie. The priest explained partial birth abortion and said Harkin had not told the truth when he said he was against it because he had voted to keep the procedure legal twice. Then the priest looked into the camera and said :'If Harkin would lie about this...." The commercial ended. It seemed to do the trick. Lightfoot came back up in the polls. But on the day before the election President Clinton came to Iowa and supported Harkin on the issue and Harkin went on to win the closest Senate contest against an incumbent. 
<p>
<dd>
But still Harkin won. So I was dead wrong about America. The Presidential race can be explained away. The Iowa and Louisiana Senate races cannot be. Yes, both were very close races. Yes there were many other issues involved. But abortion was front and center in both cases long enough for the electorate to make an informed choice. The electorate went for the candidate who supported near infanticide, the act of killing a baby by sucking its brains out moments before it is delivered from the Mother's womb. Because I thought America still had a conscience, I was confident that this issue would be decisive with voters. It was with some, but not enough.  
<p>
<dd>
I regret to say that I was wrong about this issue, not because I made a mistake. The Good Lord knows that I make lots of mistakes every single day. I regret that I was wrong not because the candidates I hoped would win lost. I regret to say I was wrong because of what it says about the American electorate. It tells me that no matter how brutal the crime, no matter how unconscionable the act, no matter how dire the consequences for the society, a majority of those who bother to show up at the polls will blind themselves to reality. That, my friends, does not bode well for the survival of our nation.

<h2>Public Prayer Launches Romanias New Era</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
It was a scene worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille production. Thousands of people were gathered in University
Square early Monday morning in Bucharest, Romania, as Emil Constantinescu addressed them from a 
balcony overlooking the square. "I am here to tell you that I will never betray you. We are here for the people 
who fought the guns with their bodies," Constantinescu said. With that, the new President-elect of Romania 
asked the crowd to pray with him. Thousands of people dropped to their knees, bowed their heads and 
recited The Lord's prayer.
<DD>
Thus began a new era in Romanian history, the last of the Eastern European nations to shed the old 
Communist regime. At Christmas time in 1989, just after the Berlin Wall came down and following changes 
in other Eastern European nations, Communist Dictator Nicholas Ceaucescu was captured and executed. 
The man who gave the order for the execution was Ion Illiescu, who subsequently was elected and then 
re-elected President of Romania. He loosened some government controls of people's lives which Ceaucescu 
had imposed, but he kept his government in the hands of the Socialists. Almost no privatization. Huge heavy 
and unproductive industries still owned and operated by the government. Rampant inflation and a population 
which could scarcely get by.
<DD>
Illiescu was able to keep control with his own cleverness. His agents infiltrated the Democratic 
opposition and caused them to fight each other over the smallest of points. He inaugurated political parties 
with near identical names to those of the Democratic parties so that uneducated peasants would have trouble
 telling the difference. His tactic worked. His neo-Communist Socialists hung on for seven long years.
<DD>
Finally the Democratic opposition got its act together. Finally the voters caught on to who was really 
responsible for the terrible conditions in their country. It began earlier this year when anti-Communists swept
 municipal elections. Following that, in the November 3rd parliamentary elections, the Socialists were roundly
 defeated, leading to Sunday's runoff election for the Presidency. Romania has finally taken the step which 
everyone else in Eastern Europe took years ago.
<DD>
Bob Krieble and I and our team of political trainers were the first Western democracy specialists into 
Romania, just two months after Ceaucescu was killed. Candles were still burning day and night in the streets 
under mounted icons to commemorate those who were killed in the bloody exchanges culminating in the 
Dictator's death.
<DD>
Religious believers were still meeting secretly in apartments. There were no street lights at night. 
Neighborhoods took on an eerie feeling as people shuffled about in the dark. Streetcars rumbled through the 
city jammed with passengers, but with lights off. Foreigners were looked at with suspicion. I recall one lady 
approaching me in the back of an Orthodox church, speaking to me in German. I replied that I spoke English. 
She then asked me where I was from. I said America. She threw her arms around me and began to cry. 
"God Bless you for coming here," she said, surprising herself at her public display of emotions which 
attracted the attention of other worshipers in the now-jammed church. "You are the first foreigner I ever spoke 
to," she sobbed. "Two months ago, I would have been executed if I had spoken to you this way," she beamed. 
It was a scary place. Our meetings to teach the fractured opposition were infiltrated by the Communists.
<DD>
The opposition parties, then coming out of hiding after decades in the underground, were fixated on the past, 
each blaming the other for Romania's decades of suffering under Communism. Our pleas that they work 
together at first fell on deaf ears. But gradually the efforts to divide and conquer the opposition were 
recognized and overcome.
<DD>
To Bob Krieble's credit, we continued to do training there in the years to come, long after many others had 
given up and pulled out. Sunday that effort finally paid off.
<DD>
Romania followed Bulgaria, which had just elected an anti-Communist parliament a couple of weeks ago 
along with a pro-free market President as well. Now comes the hard part. Romania is so far behind, it will take
an extraordinary effort to catch up.
<DD>
In today's Washington Post, right next to the article about the developments in Romania, is a long article to 
the effect that the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, 17 years after she first took office, are now finally 
paying off for Britain big time. Things are booming in the old British empire. But that took 17 years of 
uninterrupted rule by the Conservative party -- the same party which the voters seem poised to retire from 
office next year.
<DD>
Romania, in this new highly competitive atmosphere in Europe led by Britain, will find the going rough. 
However, the suffering people there kneeling in the streets praying to the Lord is an auspicious start. The 
situation may look on paper hopelessly complicated, but the Romanians know, with God all things are 
possible.

<h2>Dornan Will be Missed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Congressman Bob Dornan called me yesterday afternoon to say that in the absentee ballot count, he had lost his race for re-election. Dornan contends that the election was stolen from him. Boxes and boxes of illegal ballots, he says, were brought in after the polls closed and the voters they supposedly represented were never matched with the voter rolls. Dornan says these are the votes of illegal aliens and he blames the Motor Voter act for making this sort of thing possible.
<dd>Dornan told me that the Republican party, which had pledged to help him go to the wall on this race, has now abandoned him when they realized that they would have to challenge Hispanic groups in the process. Some Hispanic groups have threatened to shut down the Congress if Dornan's opponent, Loretta Sanchez isn't seated. The GOP, he said, doesn't want this sort of confrontation, even if it means losing a seat in the Congress.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be missed. I first met him in 1975 when he was a talk show host in California and I appeared on his show. Ironically, Dornan called me earlier this year when one of the radio networks had approached him with a healthy contract to do a syndicated radio talk show. He has often filled in for Rush Limbaugh. Dornan asked me for my advice on this offer. I told him he should take it, because I was convinced that he would do more good on the outside than he could do on the inside, where he was constantly clashing with the Republican leadership. He did not follow my advice but instead ran for re-election. Now he hopes the network offer is still available.
<dd>Ever since bursting on the electoral scene in 1976, Bob Dornan has been a thorn in the side of liberals. The White House, for example, was thrilled yesterday when they heard that Dornan had gone down. For years Dornan has been on Bill Clinton's back on everything from draft-dodging to baby killing. In 1992 he made more speeches than George Bush warning the nation what the election of Bill Clinton would mean. Unfortunately much of what he predicted would happen has proved to be true.
<dd>Dornan served a total of eighteen years out of the last twenty, taking off a two year stint for an unsuccessful try at the United States Senate. In 1996 he ran for President, not because he ever thought he could win, but because he felt his presence would force the other Presidential candidates to address the social issues. Dornan was wrong about that and his poor showing and prolonged absence from his district were not helpful in his re-election bid. What also didn't help Dornan or others in California was the early declaration by all the media that Bill Clinton had won the Presidency while the polls were still open out there. That caused many Republican leaning voters to skip the election. The Democrats did turn out, but participation by voters in California was at an historic low.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be most remembered for his passion on the issues of the sanctity of life and on our national defense which earned him the nickname B-1 Bob.
<dd>He was always ready for a confrontation. It was Dornan who helped to convince Pope John Paul II to issue the declaration forbidding Catholic priests to hold civil office. That forced Congressman and Catholic priest Robert Drinan to have to retire from his Congressional seat. Dornan particularly disliked Drinan's politics because he felt his fellow Roman Catholic had betrayed his faith.
<dd>It was Dornan who was willing to confront the homosexual lobby. The pro-life movement has other passionate advocates, but no one else in the entire Congress of either party is willing to take on the homosexuals. Dornan did and they were among the groups working hard for his defeat in this election.
<dd>Dornan is from the Fidel Castro school of political rhetoric. He can give a two hour speech and never notice the time. Moreover, I've been present when he has done so with the whole audience sitting on the edge of their chairs hanging on every word. He is tough to follow on the podium, I can tell you from personal experience.
<dd>Perpetually disorganized, Bob Dornan's office always looked like a scene from the movies just as the Second World War concluded. Yet he always knew exactly where everything was.
<dd>Congressman Robert Dornan is above all else a man of his convictions. In an era when pale pastels seems to be the way to get elected, Bob Dornan's colors are blinding. He distinguishes himself from most of his colleagues because he actually believes in what he says.
<dd>Bob Dornan leaves a great void in the Congress. Lots of conservatives were elected last week, but not a one of them has the sort of passion Bob Dornan represented. In that sense, he belongs to another era when politicians, without the benefit of slick television commercials, actually had to excite people. That he does. You are either for him or against him.
<dd>Bob Dornan's voice in the Congress may be silenced but I can assure you, you haven't heard the last of him yet. Some radio network will be fortunate enough to employ him and when they do, it won't be long before the nation will be talking about him the way it now talks about Rush Limbaugh.
<dd>He is one of a kind. Without him in the Congress, we need to invent someone just like Bob Dornan.

<h2>Remaining Undecided Races</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It has been a week since the voters have spoken but throughout the nation not all of the races have been settled yet.
<dd>Oregon supposedly adopted the most modern election system of all with its vote-by-mail operation. In the special election to replace the ousted Senator Bob Packwood, voters could cast their ballots over a three-week period. Well, that system wasn't in effect for this election, but the voters thought it was anyway. So over a third of the state's voters asked for and received absentee ballots. Come election night, officials could declare no winner in the contest to succeed retiring Senator Mark Hatfield. It took until last Friday night to determine that State Senate President Gordon Smith had won the election. Rep. Jim Bunn of Oregon had to wait still another day to find out he had lost his election.
<dd>Meanwhile in California, Rep. Bob Dornan has been hanging on by the skin of his teeth to the 233-vote margin he had on election night. Counting of absentee ballots is proceeding but election officials said they won't release the final results until tomorrow. Why on earth must it take over a week to count absentee ballots? Dornan now thinks there may have been tampering with these same ballots. He is toying with possibly seeking an injunction to keep the election records intact.
<dd>Up the coast in Washington state, not only the networks but also both parties have pronounced Rep. Linda Smith defeated in her re-election bid. The only problem with that is Smith is now leading as officials count the absentee vote. Her office contends there is no way she will lose the election. Meanwhile, in another Washington state district, Rep. Jack Metcalf, who was also pronounced as defeated by everyone, has narrowed the numbers between him and his opponent. If the that trend continues, there is some chance that he, too, could rise from the political dead.
<dd>Down in Louisiana, the canvass of all the precincts shows that Mary Landrieu has defeated State Rep. Woody Jenkins by 5,800 votes out of 1.7 million cast. However, Jenkins is morally certain that more than 5,800 fraudulent votes have been cast in that election. Proving it may be another problem. In Louisiana you sign a document when you register to vote and you sign another document when you actually show up to vote. If there is fraud, a comparison of signatures should do the job. Except that the Motor Voter law, on which Republicans acquiesced to President Clinton, makes those original signature cards, which used to be public documents, private documents. It now takes a court order to permit the Jenkins campaign to inspect the cards and there is no guarantee that the federal court will permit him to do so. If he fails in that attempt, he can ask the United States Senate to examine the election, but that would be unprecedented.
<dd>In Pennsylvania the recount is underway in the district where Rep. Jon Fox has held a 10-vote lead since election day. No one is alleging any fraud in that election. It was just an uncommonly close contest. Likewise, Rep. Peter Torkildsen of Massachusetts is hoping a recount will reverse his paper-thin defeat in that state's Democratic landslide. In these two races, the delay in the final results is justified because the results on election day were about evenly divided. But out on the West Coast, the delays in reporting the results are indefensible. In all three states where I have lived, absentee votes are counted on election day itself and simply added to the total, precinct by precinct. That way both candidates and voters know the results when the totals are reported. True, an election here or there can be so close that a recount must take place before a winner is certified. That happened in the Virginia Senate race of 1978 when John Warner finally emerged the winner by 4,000 some votes. But at least the preliminary totals were known on election night itself. This is all a matter of state regulation and it seems to me those West Coast states would do well to get with the rest of the nation in the way they count their ballots.
<dd>What has happened in Louisiana, however, is quite distinct from the other contests. The Jenkins campaign has been gathering evidence that gambling interests, which had several ballot propositions at stake in that election, spent money illegally to bus voters to the polls, which is not permitted by Louisiana law. Moreover these same gambling interests distributed ballots to those they recruited to vote. The ballots had Mary Landrieu's name on them, which is a likely violation of the law forbidding corporations to participate in federal elections. Jenkins has been an outspoken opponent of gambling in Louisiana. The most outrageous aspect of all of this is the open invitation to fraud which the Motor Voter law has brought about by not making the original registration signature cards available for public inspection. Former Congressman Rick Tonry was elected in that state in the 1970's when corrupt precinct officials added to the tally many of those who had registered but had not shown up to cast their ballots. When the voting records were examined, Congress vacated the seat and ran a new election and Congressman Bob Livingston was the victor of an honest count. In a state with that sort of history, cheating on elections should be made more difficult, not shielded by federal law. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that cliffhanger, the law there must be changed to make the sort of outcome we are now dealing with in Louisiana impossible to ever happen again.
<dd>If in this day and age elections can still be stolen with ease, then our system of government isn't safe. Who is to say how many Senate votes decided by a margin of one would go the other way if an election had been honest instead of corrupt. The whole nation has a stake in the outcome in Louisiana.

<h2>Speaker Should Step Down Temporarily</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Oklahoma's just re-elected Congressman Steve Largent has suggested that Newt Gingrich step down as Speaker of the House temporarily until ethics charges against him are cleared up. Gingrich has rejected the idea. 
<dd>Let me say at the outset that I believe that Gingrich will be exonerated from these charges. I have said so from the beginning. I continue to believe that.
<dd>But let me tell you why I think Largent is right when he argues that Gingrich should step aside for the time being.
<dd>One of the most important issues facing this Congress is how to handle the many scandals of the Clinton Administration. If Republicans go after Clinton in what is perceived to be too partisan a manner, they will end up getting into trouble with the voters. On the other hand, the charges against Clinton, unlike those against Gingrich, are serious. Many, especially the recent questions about campaign contributions by foreigners in exchange for subtle changes in US policy, are extremely troubling and could add up to real trouble for the President and his Administration.
<dd>Gingrich has a problem. From the time he took office and defended a multi million dollar book deal to the collapse of his no exit strategy on getting President Clinton to agree to Republican proposals on the federal budget, Gingrich has not fared well image wise with the American public. Add to this the hundreds of millions spent by the unions and others to attack Gingrich, and what we have is a weakened Speaker of the House. Granted, the Democrats do not control the Congress. But the margin is very close. A tarnished Gingrich will have problems upholding the Republicans as ethically sound while he weighs in against the many problems of the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>By stepping aside temporarily as Largent suggests, Gingrich would pave the way for himself to return stronger than ever. In effect, he would wipe the slate clean of his previous problems with the American public.
<dd>I know that would be a tough decision for the Speaker to make. His position is that since he believes he is innocent, there is no reason for him to do this. 
<dd>But think about it for a moment. Gingrich steps aside with an agreement that the investigations against him will be completed by a time certain. He says he is so certain of the outcome that he is willing to take this action so that the American public will have confidence in him and the Republicans when he is vindicated. 
<dd>This action contrasts with Bill Clinton. All we have heard since the election out of the Clinton Administration are rumors about trying to remove Janet Reno as Attorney General. Trying to find  a way to get at Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Clinton himself says he wants to go after his political enemies who have made Whitewater and other matters an issue.
<dd>Bill Clinton isn't going to be willing to step aside until he is vindicated of charges against him because, as he well knows, he is not likely to be vindicated. 
<dd>This Administration has been brilliant, however, at deflecting its own problems. Their rule is to attack the attacker. So if Gingrich makes any statements, as he did toward the end of the campaign, about the many serious charges pending against Clinton and his associates, spokesmen for the President will simply say that Gingrich has no right to make such charges when his own house isn't in order. 
<dd>While Harold Volkmer is gone, David Bonior is very much alive. The Gingrich inspired campaign to defeat him failed miserably. Bonior is going to be back full tilt in the 105th Congress. 
<dd>I believe that Steve Largent has suggested a course which is actually best for Speaker Gingrich and the country as a whole. It will enable Gingrich to seize the moral high ground. Assuming I am correct that Gingrich will be vindicated, he would take a short step backward to take a much larger step forward. If cleared of these ethics charges, he would return to the Speakership then with the ability to take on the Clinton Administration without their capacity to point to Gingrich as a way of shielding themselves.
<dd>But, you say, Congressman Bonior and his ilk would just file more charges as soon as the Speaker returns. That is , of course, possible, although Gingrich in the second half of the 104th Congress hasn't gone to the bathroom without checking with the ethics committee first. Yes, Bonior might file more charges but if the Speaker was willing to step aside and was subsequently vindicated, he would show those charges for what they are: pure politics and a payback for his having gone after Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright. 
<dd>I am sure that that the initiative Largent took has made Gingrich either hurt or angry. The Speaker should rise above his feelings. Largent has actually suggested a way for Gingrich to restore his moral credibility with the nation.

<h2>Drunkenness at the Helm of Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Back in the Cold War days, political leaders routinely saw blocks of nations dividing the international landscape. In those days our heads of state worked hard to maintain a balance between opposing forces: the Communist world and free world; the East against the West; Russia and China verses the United States.
<dd>Apparently, many of our citizens have forgotten the struggle that gave us the Iron Curtain, mutual assured destruction, and communist subversion within the U.S. counterculture.Today a new set of opposing forces has gathered with little notice in the press. 
<dd>While the U.S. is still the dominant force for freedom and democracy, that course is uncertain as we approach the 21st century. Much of the problem rests with an outdated world perspective upon which our elected leaders and appointed officials presuppose our nation's foreign policy. The Administration and its State Department still see the world as a collection of nations divided according to geography. Stabilization, democracy, and now environmental unity are the altruistic goals of the 90s.
<dd>Unfortunately the world has become far more complicated than the two-dimensional map would suggest. Like the Cold War, a serious division has emerged. This time the battle lines have been drawn between opposing cultures, one of which has become united behind a religion whose logical conclusion is world dominance.Unwilling to recognize this, Washington is squandering our nation's military and economic preparedness, by allowing our future to become steadily drunk at the international saloon of the United Nations and its appeasement politics. <dd>Drunkards slur their speech; our foreign policy experts make vague pronouncements. Drunkards are make fools of themselves; America's foreign policy leaders have disgraced their country. Drunkards are slow to react to sudden danger; America's foreign policy drunkards scarcely see what is happening in the world around them: leaders of the modern Islam have declared war on our society.
<dd>Islamic cultural leaders are committed to the ultimate destruction of the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It is a holy war, or jihad, as they call it. The generals of this war have constructed an unlikely alliance with China and Russia. Remember, Communist China still hates the U.S.  Also, half of Russia's population are anti-West and would willingly return to life as a communist nation. Over the past several years, these two nations have helped arm key Islamic client states, such as Syria, Iran and Iraq.Foreign policy inebriation is nothing laughing matter. 
<dd>Our nation cannot remain silent while its elected leaders and their appointees wile away our future and sacrifice our safety, passed out in the UN saloon. As citizens, we must demand from our government the thing our government has no right to possess. We must demand that Washington give America back to the people before it is too late.

<h2>An Examination of Election Results</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Some random and hopefully not too disconnected thoughts about yesterday's elections. 
<DD>First, we had the lowest voter turnout since the Presidential election of 1924 when the Democratic nominee John Davis was actually more conservative than the Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Those who wanted change opted out. It says a lot about our system when half of those who registered have declined to participate. Candidates of both parties failed to address the real concerns on the minds of the American people. Both parties are on life support systems, but, as if often the case, neither recognizes it yet.
<DD>Second, the big loser in this election was organized labor. They spent a minimum of $200 million to try to buy the Congress and it didn't work. Some of the money which was spent was spent illegally. That needs to be investigated.
<DD>Third, coming out of this election will be a big push for Common Cause-style campaign reform. If the Congress is foolish enough to pass such a bill, it will only make a bad system worse. Yes, we need to get foreign money out of politics. But as far as American citizens are concerned, we need to deregulate the process, not make it more difficult for candidates to comply with cumbersome laws.
<DD>Fourth, the caucuses of both parties in Congress in both Houses will be further apart as the result of the election. Republicans in this Congress are more conservative. It is hard to find liberal Republicans these days. It is equally hard to find conservtive Democrats. The Democrats in the Congress are more liberal.
<DD>Fifth, Bill Clinton may, in due course, wish he had lost. Investigations of wrong-doing in the Administration will continue and this time the Republicans will have their act together a bit better. Moreover, the bills are now going to come due for Bill Clinton from organized labor, the enviornmentalists and the radical lifestyle community. He will have to pay up or risk losing his base. But when he pays up, he will be perceived as moving to the left. That, in turn, will strengthen the Republicans in the next election, known as the six-year-itch election.
<DD>Every six years of a Presidential cycle where one party keeps the Presidency for eight years in a row produces a six-year reaction of great proportions. FDR caught it in 1938. Truman in 1946, Eisenhower in 1958, Johnson in 1966, Reagan in 1986. The last two years of the Clinton Administration, if he survives that long, may turn Clinton into the all-time lame duck.
<DD>Sixth, some of the non-Presidential and Congressional results may be, in the long run, more significant. The California Civil Rights initiavtive was passed handily, dealing a blow to affirmative action programs. Look for similiar initiatives elsewhere in the USA , which may even force the leadership of the 105th Congress to act. Meanwhile, Tax limitation initiatives passed nearly everywhere. A unique term-limits measure passed in nine states and may even yet pass in two others. If upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, this particular measure may finally be the key to winning the term-limits issue at the national level. If a district votes in favor of term limits and the Congressman disregards the voter's wishes, that information would be right there on the ballot the next time that Member of Congress came up for election.
<DD>Seventh, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who became the whipping-boy of the liberals, can take some comfort in the defeat of Harold Volkmer in Missouri. While David Bonior was very strident, Volkmer became a pathalogical opponent of the Speaker's. Volkmer will not be back next year. Gingrich will be. But all the power he managed to get the Republican caucus to cede to him at the beginning of the 104th Congress may not be appropriate for him as he tries to govern his reduced majority in the 105th Congress. He may be forced to give back some of that power to his colleagues to keep the ship together. By the way, the GOP loss in the House which will be anywherefrom 7 to 10 seats, compares very favorably to pick-ups for Presidents being re-elected to a second term. Ronald Reagan, in winning his landslide in 1984, gained 14 seats in the House.  
<DD>Finally, while there were some excellent men and women who were elected to Congress yesterday, there were few known leaders. We suffer so greatly for lack of leadership. Maybe the Lord will see fit to raise a few of them up to help lead this nation back to sanity.
<P>

<h2>Election Results Seldom Meet Expectations</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>In some locations in the nation, the polls are about to close, in others the polls will be open for another four hours yet, but soon enough we will know the verdict of the American people in this election.
<dd>Whatever the outcome, it is good to keep this election in perspective. Every two years I hear several people say, "This is the most important election we have ever faced in our history." Usually they cite some burning issue of the day as their reason for feeling that way. It is true that elections have significance, but usually that significance is not as profound as we think. When FDR was returned to office with a landslide and the Democrats actually gained seats in Congress for the fourth election in a row, FDR thought he could get whatever he wanted. He proposed packing the Supreme Court which had ben resistant to some of his initiatives. Yet it was that very Congress, where FDR's opposition had been reduced to next to nothing, which stopped his court-packing scheme.
<dd>My first election in which I was active in a major way was 1958. I was by then the youngest member ever to serve on the Board of the Young Republicans of Racine, County, Wisconsin. That year, we got wiped out by the explosion of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education or COPE. The Democrats won huge majorities in the Congress. Yet that Congress produced little of what the Democrats wanted. All of President Eisenhower's vetoes were upheld. He actually was a better President with that Congress than he had been when he was dealing with a much friendlier Congress. In fact, that Congress -- which was practically owned by big Labor -- passed the Landrum Griffin Labor Reform act over the strident opposition of the very Members of Congress who had been elected to stop it.
<dd>It is true that in 1964, then Conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater got crushed by Lyndon Johnson and the Congress which followed gave us all of the dreadful Great Society legislation we are still trying to cope with today. But also out of that election was born the modern conservative movement which produced Ronald Reagan, first as Governor of California and then as President.
<dd>The Democrats again crushed the Republicans in 1974 and some of my friends were suicidal. Yet that Congress upheld all but one of President Ford's vetoes. By the way, in my three decades here, the two least damaging Congresses were the Congress elected in 1966 and the Congress elected in 1978. Both anticipated the election of Republican Presidents and the Republicans finally got their act together and held off just about everything that was destructive.
<dd>Expectations were high for the Congress which came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980, and indeed the first eight months of the Reagan Administration were exciting and did good things. After that, it was back to more of business as usual. By the second session of that Congress, the largest tax increase in history, up until Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993, was passed and signed into law by Reagan.
<dd>The election of Bill Clinton with a Democratic Congress in 1992 was very troubling. Yet many bad initiatives were stopped by that Congress, some of which were passed by the Republican Congress which followed it. Expectations were never higher than two years ago. The first few months of the 104th Congress were terribly exhilirating. But that Congress too left town with a whimper with most of its urgent business left undone.  My point is simply this. Whichever way this election goes tonight, it will be neither as good nor as bad as contemporary observers believe it will be. If Bill Clinton gets back in with a Democratic Congress, probably a united and outraged Republican opposition may get its act together. On the other hand if somehow the voters deft the odds and elect Bob Dole with a Republican Congress, true believers out there who think the nation has now been saved will be disappointed. We may, in fact, get mixed results. I have come to believe that the American people do that by design. They give us a President of one party and a Congress of the other because in their minds less damage will be done that way, and sometimes they are correct.
<dd>What is important, in the long run, is not this particular election. What is important is that we begin to face our real problems as a nation. These are not the problems which were ever talked about by the major candidates in this election. They are the sort of problems being discussed by my colleagues Bill Lind and Brad Keena on the "Next Revolution." Sooner or later elected officials will be forced to face those problems. Let us fervently pray that at that moment in our nation's history, there will still be time.

<h2>Politicizing a Murder</h2>
<p>
Direct Line Commentary<br>
by <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>President Clinton is pretending
to be tough on crime and has taken to exploiting the murder of
12-year old Polly Klaas in order to get re-elected.  <dd>In a television
ad, narrated by Polly Klaas's father, Mark Klaas, he praises President
Clinton for forcing Congress to pass his tough crime bill.  He
goes on to say that the recent attacks on Clinton's character
are just politics and claims the President's character is evident
in his courage to protect children.  <dd>All politicians exploit tragedy
to get elected - Republicans used paroled murderer Willie Horton
as their example of how Michael Dukakis was soft on crime.  Now,
Democrats are doing it to show how Bill Clinton is tough on crime.
<dd>It is an election year, and we should expect nothing less from
any politician - if Mark Klaas were a Republican, I'm sure we'd
see him in a Bob Dole ad.  But the Clinton campaign has gone too
far in using Mark and Polly Klaas to counter Bob Dole's attack
on Clinton's character.  The truth is, Bob Dole has done nothing
that even resembles an attack - he has barely scratched the surface.
<dd>There is so much material fact on Clinton's lack of honor and
morality that this campaign has missed, that the Clinton campaign
would be better off not responding at all.  To top it off, Bill
Clinton is far enough ahead in the polls that there was no need
to even mention the word character. I have to admit that I have
a personal sadness when I see a grieving father embrace an administration
that has done nothing to prevent crime.  In fact, it has encouraged
crime by putting drug prevention on the back burner, putting lenient
judges - anti-death penalty judges - on the bench for life, and
by trying to outlaw ownership of guns by law abiding citizens.
<dd>But Mark Klass is an adult and he is free to endorse whichever
candidate he chooses.  I just don't have the faith that he is
getting all the facts.

<h2>Dole's Record Solid on Judges</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>I keep having people come to me asking the same question: "Give me one reason I should vote for Bob Dole for President," they ask. Okay, I'll give you a reason: The federal judiciary.
<DD>To date President Clinton has appointed 202 federal judges and 26% of the federal judiciary overall. His future appointments will even more dramatically shift the balance of the federal bench because the percentage of his activist appointees replacing more restrained Bush/Reagan appointees has steadily risen from 14% in 1993 to about 25% in 1995. That number will continue to rise because instead of activist Clinton judges replacing activist Carter judges, they will be replacing more restrained judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Whatever you may think of George Bush, by the way, his federal judge appointments were overall slightly better than those of Ronald Reagan.
<DD>13 judges have already announced that they will take "senior status."  132 district court and 42 appeals court judges will be eligible to take senior status by the end of a second Clinton term. So Bill Clinton's appointees could comprise almost 60% of the federal judiciary and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court if he has a second term in office.
<DD>Let me give you a few examples of the judges Bill Clinton has already managed to get on the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, regarded as "moderates" by Clinton standards, voted against single sex education, voted to block a ban on quotas for homosexuals, voted to require discrimination against religious expression, voted to allow race preferences in government, voted to allow the creation of racially segregated congressional districts, voted to block the voters wishes to have federal term limits and have voted to empower the federal government to regulate virtually every aspect of the economic life of the country.
<DD>This is just a sample of the sort of people Clinton has put on the court. Judges Blaine Michael and Diana Motz voted against excluding homosexuals from the military. Judge Carlos Lucero voted to declare a city seal with a cross unconstitutional, Judge Theodore McKee voted to abolish student-led graduation prayers. Judge H. Lee Sarokin argued that prison inmates have a constitutional right to receive mail uninspected by prison officials. Judge Martha Daughtrey voted to throw out drug and child pornography evidence. Judge James Beaty voted to overturn a double murder conviction because a juror had driven past the house where the murder took place. And so it goes. I could go on and on but you get the picture.
<DD>The same goes for those Clinton appointees left hanging when the 104th Congress adjourned. Clarence Sundram supports the legalization of drugs. Margaret Morrow supports gun control and has an extensive record of feminist activism. Margaret McKeown helped to turn the American Bar Association toward its current pro-abortion position and was the lead counsel in homosexual rights litigation. William Fletcher believes there is a "discretionary Constitution" judges may use to legislate from the bench. And believe me it would only get worse in a second Clinton term.
<DD>But, you may protest, Bob Dole voted for most of those Clinton judges. True enough because Dole supports the right of a President to pick judges as he wishes. He expects the same treatment from the Senate if he gets the chance to pick judges. Nevertheless, an August 1996 report by the Judicial Selection Monitoring project of the Free Congress Foundation gave Dole a 100% score. The tally included votes on 20 closely-divided, controversial judicial and Justice Department nominations. Each of the nominations chosen for the report presented a genuine choice between judicial activism and restraint. On each vote, Bob Dole chose restraint.
<DD>Now does that guarantee that all of Bob Dole's judges will be judges we would approve of? No it does not. President Bush made a concerted effort to pick good judges and wound up with David Souter on the Supreme Court. But that is because he took the word of his then Chief of Staff John Sununu who insisted that Souter was a judicial conservative. The former right wing Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thompson agreed with Sununu and said he would stake his career on Souter being conservative. Both were wrong. 
<DD>I know from personal experience Bob Dole has always worked hard to confirm judges which the left fought hard against. Ask Dan Manion, approved by a single vote margin in the Senate for an appeals court seat. Ask Clarence Thomas, approved by only a four vote margin. Each prevailed despite overwhelming opposition from the Left, and thanks in no small part to Bob Dole.  Moreover Dole has proposed doing away with the role of the American Bar Association in the judicial selection process. The ABA is controlled by the liberals and has often shot down some of the better judicial nominees which Reagan and Bush sought to put forth.
<DD>Bob Dole has said that "the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the utmost restraint - without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny."
<DD>Over the next four years the president will likely decide several Supreme Court Justices and perhaps a third of all federal judges. I don't know about you, but I would rather trust someone who has Dole's philosophy than I would the current occupant of the White House to decide those appointments. Let's put it this way. We know what sort of federal judges Bill Clinton will give us. There is a fair chance that Bob Dole's picks will be a lot closer to what the founding fathers had in mind.

<h2>Schools Sending the Wrong Message</h2>
<P>
"Direct Line" Commentary<br>
By Special Columnist <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<P>
<br>
<DD>Lately it seems that America's schools are spending more time playing parent than teaching our kids how read, write, and spell. Schools all over the country are getting out of hand with their "It Takes A Village" mentality, confusing their role as educators with the role of parents, or acting fearful that one wrong move will bring on a lawsuit.
<P>Take for example the most recent news of Kimberly Smartt, the girl who was suspended for four months for taking a Midol tablet and giving one to a friend. The school claims that she violated the drug policy and is forcing her to pay for and undergo drug counseling. Kimberly, who is black, claims she is a victim of race discrimination and is suing the school superintendent, school principal and the county board of education. All of this over a drug that is as harmless as Tylenol and caffeine and a problem that could have been solved with one trip to the principal's office. What makes this situation more outrageous is that this very same girl could be given a condom or help in obtaining an abortion by the school without a blink of an eye.
<P>You may also remember the case in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania where 39 8th grade girls were given gynecological exams without their parents' consent. The school not only didn't think there was anything wrong with this, they actually argued that they were mandated by law to do it. No outrage on the part of the school there.
<P>And how about the schools around the country that are making it mandatory for students to volunteer as a requirement of graduation. Not just any volunteer work will do, it must be approved by the school and as you may have guessed, activities including religion or pro-life work is frowned upon or not allowed at all.
<P>What all of this means is that the liberal Department of Education and Hillary devotees are having an impact on our school system to the degree that education is now secondary. The schools know what's best for your child even if it defies common sense and violates your moral beliefs. Bob Dole articulated the first step in solving this problem the other night during the debate. When asked if he still supported abolishing the Department of Education, he said yes. What more needs to be said?

<h2>A Preview of a Union-Controlled Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<DD>The U.S. Senate should have adjourned last night, but instead it is still in session because Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of organized labor, invoked arcane Senate rules to try to "exact one more pound of flesh for labor as we head out of here," as Majority Leader Trent Lott put it.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin wanted a certain provision dropped from the bill which funds the FAA and other agencies. This provision would have corrected what is viewed as a mistake in legislation which passed the last Congress. That mistake had the effect of making it easier for unions to organize Federal Express. Senator Fritz Hollings, one of only few Democrats not owned by the labor unions, sponsored the rider which would correct the mistake and put Federal Express back on a level playing field with everyone else.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin even caused the bill in question to be read to the Senate for hours on end. This hasn't happened in anyone's memory, but anything to please organized labor. Senator Harkin is up for re-election in Iowa and so confident of victory that he can afford to engage in such blatantly special-interest politics. By the way, 80% of Harkin's big war chest for his re-election comes from out of state, and most of that from the unions. No wonder he is doing their bidding. 
<DD>I mention this obscure moment in history because it is an illustration of things to come if the unions are successful in their quest for a change in who controls Congress. Already union bosses have a disproportionate influence over public policy way out of line for the number of people they now represent. There was a time, in the private sector, where unions had organized a third of the work force. In some states the unions were so strong that employers had to ask their permission before hiring anyone. Today union strength is at around 10% of the private sector work force and it is continuing to decline. Public sector unions are much stronger but even there big labor's grip has been loosened in some states with Republican Governors and legislatures.
<DD>The fact is that old fashioned unionism is out of step in our highly competitive society. The unions believe otherwise. Ask ValuJet. They began flying again yesterday after a three-month shutdown following the fatal crash in the Florida Everglades. While no one wants to cut corners on safety, the shutdown ordered by the FAA is unprecedented considering the type of crash. But ValuJet is non-union and the unions wanted the airline grounded. So, the FAA obliged, shutting down ValuJet even before investigators had determined the cause. Union lawyers are still in court trying to get an injunction to once again ground ValuJet. This argument is not about safety. ValuJet, with months of non-stop inspections and a good portion of its fleet not yet up and running, is probably the safest airline in the skies right now. This argument is about unions. If ValuJet can make a go of it with its highly attractive prices, the contracts the unions have negotiated with the other airlines come under great pressure. So it appears that the unions used their friends in the Clinton Administration to ground the airline. Unfair you say? Again, just a preview of coming attractions if the unions prevail.
<DD>And it does look promising for them. They are spending huge sums of money to defeat Republican freshmen and to win open seats. Republicans, who hoarded their money until these last weeks before the elections, are still not competitive. Meanwhile, the unions have pulled out all the stops, even to the point of deliberately violating federal election law, just so they can spend more money to buy the Congress. They don't care at this point. They are confident of winning.
<DD>Unions should have been out of business in the 104th Congress, yet they forced the issue of a minimum wage increase and the Republican Congress gave in. In fact anything objectionable to the labor unions was either killed in Congress, which didn't want the fight or was vetoed by President Clinton.
<DD>If the union bosses can get that much accomplished in the Republican 104th Congress, imagine what they can do with a Congress whose majority they have bought and paid for. This should be a hot issue in this election. But, alas, the union bosses have succeeded in intimidating the Republican majority who are now afraid to take the union bosses head on.
<DD>Go ahead. Tune into C-Span 2 and watch the union bosses at work through their surrogates Kennedy and Harkin and others. Then close your eyes and imagine the next session of Congress when these people could well be in the driver's seat. If that isn't enough to motivate you to get active in the electoral process, I don't know what will.

<h2>A Look Back at the 104th Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The 104th Congress whimpered to an end, a mere farthing of its former self. This is the 15th Congress I've had the privilege of witnessing from start to finish. In the past three decades, only this Congress and the 97th Congress, which came in with Ronald Reagan, actually seemed poised to pass positive initiatives for the American people. Each passed one truly significant piece of legislation. In the 97th Congress it was the Reagan tax cuts. In this Congress it was welfare reform. Each of those Congresses did pass other positive legislation as well. The 104th Congress may well be remembered in the future for the line item veto, but if Bill Clinton is President the next four years, that is not likely to be a positive memory.
<DD>Each Congress is also noted for having lost its nerve along the way. In the 97th Congress, that meant passing TEFRA, which up to that point was the largest tax increase in history. For this Congress, it was throwing in the towel in the attempt to kill all sorts of undesirable government programs.
<DD>Expectations were unreasonably high for this Congress. But then the American people had just caused one of the largest Congressional turnovers in modern history. They wanted to be heard through their representatives. The first few months were exciting. The House of Representatives passed item after item in the Contract with America. But the U.S. Senate broke the back of that momentum when it failed to pass a Constitutional Amendment for a balanced budget. Even though that amendment would not have been ratified instantly by state legislatures, it would have provided a framework within which Congress would have most likely operated. When that battle was lost, Congress then tried to pass a balanced budget through legislation. But when Bill Clinton stopped that and it was back to business as usual for the remaining session.
Except for welfare, this Congress never came to grips with the rest of the entitlements. It never tackled the crippling national debt we shoulder. It left much of the important work to the next Congress.
<DD>The freshmen Republicans, who came to Washington so determined to make a difference, found that they were unable to move their more senior colleagues who were not impressed with the election results. Now, most of those freshmen are seriously threatened for re-election. The unions are spending up to $2 million per Congressional district to defeat them. This doesn't include what the environmental groups, radical lifestyle organizations and the Democratic party itself is spending. When you hear that Republicans have more money to spend in this election than the Democrats, don't you believe it.
<DD>Despite GOP Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon's brave words, a number of these freshmen won't be back. Unfortunately for those that do return, the lesson they may learn from this could be that you can't tackle the Washington establishment and win.
<DD>Sunday night on PBS, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott debated would-be Speaker Dick Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. I say debated. It was more like a friendly argument over who had indeed spent the most money for education and school lunches and who could better protect Medicare.
<DD>All of the passion which brought the Republican Congress to power was gone. There seems to be far too little difference between the two political parties. The differences seemed profound only two years ago.
<DD>For the 105th Congress, the American people need to send to Washington another crop of freshmen similar to the ones they sent in 1994. That seems less likely, however. This election is not being fought over the issue of freedom. Even though it is true, no one has made the case that the future of the very Republic is at stake this time around. In 1994, Republicans painted the big picture of the threat of intrusive government promoting radical ideas. That big picture is almost entirely missing from this election.
What a pity that Republicans lost their nerve. The folk lore here is that the government shut down was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans. I disagree. They were on the road to winning the issue when they caved in and they haven't recovered from that mistake since. 
<DD>We can only hope that in local races for Congress, absent the overarching theme, there are candidates who still believe that tackling the crippling problems of America the Bankrupt are important. Maybe we just aren't hearing about them back here. I fervently hope so. America does not need a 105th Congress less committed to sanity and true reform than this one was.

<H2>Watergate All Over Again</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is an honest but doctrinaire liberal. There is hardly an issue where he and I don't disagree. Recently, however, he reversed himself on the partial birth abortion issue because, he said, he was misled by the pro-abortionists who had claimed  incorrectly  that it was a rarely-used procedure.
<p>
But Cohen can usually be counted on to boost the liberal end of the Democratic agenda. That is why it was startling to read his column in this morning's Post in which he suggests that we might be on the verge of reliving history. The sort of history Cohen has in mind is Watergate, 24 years ago. Then, as he correctly points out, Washington was consumed with the Watergate story but out in the countryside it didn't mean a thing. Richard Nixon was overwhelmingly re-elected. Then the nation had to come to grips with the Constitutional crisis that followed.
<p>
What troubles Cohen and should trouble all of us is the reaction of the White House in the face of the latest report by the office of Inspector General of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hillary Clinton was involved in an effort to deceive federal regulators into approving a sham real estate transaction, the report said. But the reaction of the White House is to attack those who have written the report. According to the Clinton White House, those who wrote the report were unduly pressured by Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
<p>
As to the other troubles visited on the Clintons, why, that is all the fault of the alleged partisan activities of Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Even Clinton himself has gone on the attack against Starr, echoing the complaint of Susan McDougal who says she'll rot in jail because Starr wants her to lie about the Clintons. Of course, this same Bill Clinton has hinted that he would not rule out a pardon for Susan McDougal and the others.
<p>
All of this has a familiar ring not just to Cohen but to the rest of us who were here in Washington at the time of Watergate. I cheered when then Republican National Chairman Senator Bob Dole told us that Watergate was just the product of the liberals being pushed by the left-wing Washington Post. "Tell it like it is, Bob," I thought as I watched Dole defend misdeeds at the White House. It turns out Dole had been lied to about the situation by Nixon and company so he was doing what he thought was right.
But the tactic is the same. When you can't explain your actions, blame someone else for asking the questions.
<p>
In the same paper in which Cohen's column appears there is a headline spread across page A-10 which reads "GOP Says White House Logs on Readers of FBI Reports have 6 Month Gap." Hmmm. Sound familiar? The 18 minute gap on a tape-recording just about sealed Richard Nixon's fate. But, of course, the Clinton White House blames their gap on a low-level aide named Mari Anderson, who just happens to be in hiding right now, unable to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't worry Mari. Congress is about to go out of session and then you can come out of hiding. After all, it's only five weeks until the elections and Bill Clinton's second term triumph. He'll take care of you and all the rest after that.
<p>
Yes, Cohen is exactly right. We have heard all of this before and it has an eerie ring to it. The fact is Richard Nixon's list of transgressions is minor compared with Bill Clinton's. If, in one narrative, you string together all of the problems this Administration has had, it is absolutely mind boggling. Yet the nation seems to care less. Things are going well. Unemployment is low. Inflation is stable. The stock market is high. We are all just fat, dumb and happy.
<p>
However, it is clear to Cohen and should be to the rest of the country that we may well be headed for the repeat of what happened in 1972: a Presidential re-election triumph and then a Constitutional crisis thereafter. No wonder the cartoon character Doonsbury, penned by the liberal but politically savvy Gary Trudeau, is preoccupied with Al Gore pretending to already be President. If this is indeed history repeating itself, then Gore ought to be President by 1998.
<p>
But wait a minute, folks. We are not the victims of some unstoppable historical forces. We have the power to make a difference. The clock hasn't stopped yet. We can still determine who wins in November. There is still time to wake up from the collective dream we Americans seem to be in to do something about this sorry mess before it is indeed too late.<p>

<h3>September 25, 1996</h3>
<H2>New Hope for the Senate</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
As a follow up to a commentary of a couple of weeks ago, there is some good news to report. After we took on Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the GOP Senatorial Campaign Committee, over the matter of his lack of support for Woody Jenkins, the endorsed GOP candidate in Louisiana, things began to happen.
<P>
Picking up that theme, Columnist Bob Novak wrote a column quoting this commentary and his piece ran in the New York Post. D'Amato got the message. Realizing that if the Louisiana general election ended up with two Democrats facing each other he would have it hung around his neck, D'Amato swung into action. The Senatorial committee began to poll to see which of the six GOP candidates had a chance to be in the runoff. They found, to their utter surprise, that Woody Jenkins was that candidate. Jenkins had built up a significant organization to the point where he scored in lower double digits even though most of his opponents had spent millions of dollars on television which Jenkins didn't have to spend.
<P>
Based on that data, D'Amato first tried to get other candidates to withdraw from the race. They would not do so. So, D'Amato got together with other GOP leaders in the state and one by one they agreed to support the candidate so that in the last week before the election, each day a different prominent Republican endorsed Jenkins. Four days before last Saturday's election, D'Amato then wired the Jenkins campaign about half of the money they could have given under the law so that Jenkins could, at the end, have lots of television and radio commercials. All of this created a surge effect. When the ballots were counted, Jenkins was not only in the runoff, he placed first among all the candidates. As a result, Republican Woody Jenkins will face Democrat Mary Landrieu, the daughter of the former mayor of New Orleans.
<P>
D'Amato called me to assure me that what happened was all part of the plan from the beginning. His own staffers assure me that it was not. But in any case, what happened worked. Now Republicans have a better than 50-50 shot at taking the Senate seat. In the primary, all the Republican candidates combined got about 58% of the vote. The Democratic candidates got 42% of the votes. Landrieu is on the far left of the Democratic party, although she is now trying to run as a moderate. Jenkins is the most solid conservative running for the U.S. Senate in the country. He is not backing away from his views at all. So we have a classic philosophical contest. Of course, the turnout in November will be far higher and right now Bill Clinton has a huge lead in Louisiana, but still Jenkins can be considered the slight favorite. 
<P>
What happened in Louisiana mirrors what has happened in just about all the states except in the East. Conservatives have been nominated for the U.S. Senate. Except for Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican nominees are good on the issues. 
<P>
The liberal mantra is that conservatives can win primaries but they will all be defeated in the general election. Some no doubt will. But some will also likely be elected. Al Salvi is running an outstanding campaign against Congressman Dick Durbin in Illinois. He is behind, but he showed in his primary that he knows how to come from behind to win. Sam Brownback in Kansas is an excellent campaigner. He is slightly ahead in his contest with Jill Docking. In Alabama, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is slightly ahead. Congressman Tim Hutchinson has a shot at winning the Senate seat in Arkansas despite Bill Clinton's being at the top of the ticket. In Colorado, Congressman Wayne Allard is even in the polls with lawyer/lobbyist Tom Strickland. And so it goes. I don't have time to mention all of the races at this point. 
<P>
But the point is this. Unless the Republicans are completely destroyed by a Democratic surge at the end of the election, similar to what happened with the Republicans in 1994, the Senate should be an improved body after November.
<P>
That is good news for those of us who have been so frustrated by the Senate's resistance to constructive measures passed by the House.
<P>
Oh, and by the way. If it is clear that Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected, the Wall Street Journal poll reports that by a margin of 53% to 39%, voters want a Republican Congress to keep Clinton in check, rather than a Democratic Congress which can enact more of Bill Clinton's agenda.
<P>
The fact is there is some hope after all in this otherwise dismal political season.
<P>

<h2>VMI Decision Tragic for the Nation</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
A tragedy occurred in the State of Virginia over the weekend for which the whole nation will pay. By a one-vote margin, the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted to end its 157 years as an all-male academy. Beginning with the 1997 school term, VMI will admit women.
<P>
By the same 9 - 8 vote, the Board also rejected a plan to take the school private - a move by which the Board could have avoided a court order requiring the admittance of women.
<P>
The action against VMI began in the Bush Administration. The State of Virginia fought against it. But earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-supported all-male schools are unconstitutional. Never mind that the State of Virginia has opened a military academy just for women so that women who desired a military education could have an equal chance to do so under the law. No, that wasn't good enough for the fanatical Supreme Court, the majority of whose Justices deserve to be impeached for undermining the Constitution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Virginia Board of Visitors could have maintained VMI's all-male status by voting to take VMI private, thereby placing the school out of the reach of the court ruling. But, the Board voted not to. What was tragic about that narrow decision is that it was dictated not by what is right for the country whose military VMI serves, not by what was best for the students attending VMI, not by the wishes of the alumni who were prepared to raise the money to buy the school, but by the liberal media and its accomplices in the political community.
<P>
Virginia's Republican Governor, George Allen, who had originally supported VMI in its court case, changed his position, a few days before the Board of Visitors meeting. Allen got a case of political correctness and declared VMI should not go private because the media would make it into a pariah institution. That statement was enough to tip the balance in favor of admitting women. Several of Governor Allen's appointees to the Board of Visitors voted to reject the motion to take the school private.
<P>
Thanks, Governor Allen, the supposed conservative Republican with national ambitions. We'll remember this whenever you seek whatever office it is you want after leaving the Governorship next year.
<P>
I well recall the words of Dr. Ben Alexander, the former President of The University of the District of Columbia. He courageously tried to get rid of the politician imposed students who were not there to learn but just to get a worthless degree. Dr. Alexander wanted to place standards on UDC. He was doing exactly the right thing. Many of us tried to help him. But he resigned. Afterward, I asked him why he resigned when it was the right fight at the right time. He said because he was told that if he continued to fight the Washington Post would ruin him. "If I had NET back then, I might well have stayed to fight," Dr. Alexander said. But this was in the early 80's before there were many alternative means of communications.
<P>
Ben Alexander at least had an excuse. What is the excuse of the majority on the VMI Board? That their Governor considers them an embarrassment? That they would be attacked by the national media? Just when are we going to get some people in this country who will say "I don't care if we get attacked. This is the right thing to do. We are going forward." I will tell you there would be an emotional outpouring of support that would amaze and overwhelm the politicians. 
<P>
But no, the majority on the VMI Board had to listen to the state's chief politician who just didn't want the fight, lest it damage his plans for national office. Well, Governor Allen has likely brought VMI to the end of the line as a viable institution. "Without a distinctive, attractive educational niche, VMI, a small school with limited offerings in close proximity to three major state universities, will lose its ability to compete for students," Anita Blair, a VMI trustee who voted in favor of taking the school private, said after the vote. "A coed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs at Virginia Tech and elsewhere." She is absolutely right. And who will suffer in the process? The U.S. military which has used VMI to train officers now for over a Century and a half.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public and the politicians asked themselves why it is that the media should be able to dictate what private citizens want to do? The pseudo macho majority on the VMI Board said they aren't going to change a thing at VMI when it admits women. Right. They claim that the tradition of treating freshmen cadets as rats, with shaved heads, will continue. It will never happen. But even if it did I would be against it. Women, even if they desire this kind of punishment, should not be treated this way and as the Citadel has proven, at the end of the day, they won't be.
<P>
It is all part of the effort to pretend that men and women are all the same. It is the same sort of pretend world that the Soviets invented with their concept of the "new man." It defies reality. But this sort of fiction is permitted to continue because politicians such as Governor Allen refuse to stand up and fight for what is right.
<P>
It is no wonder that Robert Bork was motivated to write his new book "Slouching Toward Gomorra." The culture is collapsing, not just because forces of evil such as elements of the media are pushing it in that direction, but because in public life there are no real men left who are willing to stand up and say "enough is enough."
<P>

<h2>A Gap Bigger Than Gender</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick of the Polling Company provided us with data on a survey taken from September 5th through the 12th on who will control the Congress. Her conclusion is that whatever happens in the Presidential race, Congress is going to remain in Republican hands. That conclusion is verified by several other recent polls which show the Republicans even or with a slight edge. The Polling Company finds Democrats with a one point edge, but traditionally Republicans perform better than the so-called generic ballot-test for Congress.<P>
We hear a great deal about the gender gap and indeed Kellyanne does find such a gap. But her research finds the gender gap at 8 points and not the 20 plus points which the so called mainstream media keeps touting. Kellyanne is the one, genuinely culturally-conservative pollster in the business and I trust her results. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a three-point advantage with Generation X voters (from 18 to 29 years of age) and a two-point advantage with Baby Boomers. But Republicans are down two points with so called pre-retirees (thats my age group) and down five points among seniors. Thats not surprising considering the amount of propaganda put forth by the unions and liberals on Medicare and Social Security.<P>
Now come the kickers. Here are the real gaps in American politics. Singles favor the Democrats for Congress by six percentage points. Those who are married but without children favor the Democrats by eight percentage points. But those married with children favor the Republicans by a whopping 10 percentage points!<P>
I mentioned this to Kellyanne at a dinner last night and she said, "Yes, Its the three Ms." Three Ms? What are the three Ms? "Marriage, Mortgage and Munchkins," she replied. If you want your children to vote for conservatives for Congress, not only do they need to be married, they also need to have children, Miss Fitzpatrick said. So the gap between those who are married and have children and those who are married without children is greater than the gap between men and women. Apparently, there is nothing like a few responsibilities to make voters understand who favors policies in their best interests.<P>
But lets talk about the truly gigantic gap in American politics. Yes, there is a gap bigger than either gender or marriage. Among those who dont listen to talk radio at all, the Democrats hold a nine-point advantage in the race for Congress. Among those who listen to talk radio five hours or more a week, the Republicans hold an incredible 16-point margin. Among those who listen to talk radio only one to four hours a week, the margin for the Republicans is just three points.<P>
So now things are clearing up nicely. If we care what kind of Congress we have, we must see to it that the young people we know get married and have children quickly. We must introduce talk radio to these young families immediately. I dont have the figures for those who are married, have children and listen to talk radio, but the gap must be gargantuan.<P>
Mrs. Weyrich and I are about to become grandparents for the first time. My wife has all sorts of plans to get a cradle for the baby and car seats for each of the cars, and heaven knows what else. Well all of that is fine. But as for me, Im buying this new little family several radios, each tuned to the best talk shows in the business. Hey, I care about my future!<P>

<h2>Dwelling in the Past</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Yesterday I attended part of a two day conference called " A Dialogue on race" at Towson State University in Baltimore. The conference was sponsored by a group called "Search for Common Ground" which promotes dialogues between opposing groups worldwide. They are active in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and have set up a dialogue between pro life and pro choice groups here in the United States.<p>

I stayed for only part of the conference because once my friend Lawry Chickering, the President of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in California, for whom I have great respect, persuaded me to go, we had a next to impossible time finding out the schedule of the event and meanwhile I got committed to other things. <p>

But I was present for the entire session which dealt with the barriers to racial progress. The group consisted of about half whites and half blacks. There were no Hispanics and only one Asian American present. Four of us were conservative philosophically. The rest ranged from left to far left. <p>

What struck me about the whole exercise was the fixation most of the blacks and many of the whites had on the past. The outstanding editor of the Heritage Foundation's magazine Policy Review, Adam Meyerson, tried to introduce the notion that many blacks represent the American dream. They have overcome slavery and segregation and have gone on to become prosperous and successful and have made important contributions to the society in which we live. Meyerson suggested that it would be well to study those examples as role models since they had, in fact, achieved the progress the others were seeking. <p>

That did not go over very well in this room filled with professionals, many of whom make their living working on the issue of racial conflict. After all, if we solved racial problems, some of these folks would be out of work. 
We were told that unless we could identify with and experience the pain suffered by blacks because of slavery, segregation and racism, we could never  make any progress. <p>

I began to think about that. The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed impossible demands on Germany after World War One, caused my family terrible trouble. They had never been wealthy. But what little they had was wiped out. They became poverty stricken and unable to support themselves financially. For such a reason did my father become the first in his family, at age l9, to journey to America in l923 to seek a decent living.<p>

All my life I have heard stories about that era and the pain it caused. I can acknowledge, and have done so, that the Versailles Treaty was unwise and unjust. But should I go around and insist that everyone else comprehend the damage done to my family because of that injustice? Granted, those conditions lasted a much shorter time than did slavery and segregation. But the principle is the same. <p>

I want to know about that era because I want to understand why my family on my father's side came here. I want to understand what happened in case world leaders ever again try to humiliate a nation the way France insisted on humiliating Germany back then. We know the consequences of that action. The Versailles Treaty created the conditions which made Adolph Hitler possible. <p>

But I did not remain dead in the water because of that injustice. Nor do I insist on discussing it constantly. 
Now I was told at that conference that, of course, my family could make progress because we were white. Oh, really? Does anyone remember what it was like being a German in-between the two World Wars? You were suspect. You were discriminated against. Laws were passed to prevent German language newspapers from being printed. A law in Wisconsin even stopped the sermons in German at the local parish church and the church bulletin had to be printed half in English and half in German. It was not a fun era. It was overcome by perseverance, discipline and hard work. <p>

Even though my family came from Germany and Norway, long after slavery had been instituted here, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that this did great injustice to black people. I am perfectly willing to stipulate that segregation laws were unjust and that blacks got the short end of the stick for many years. <p>

But I am not willing to try to go through some exercise where I am expected to identify with the pain black people suffered back then any more than I should expect them to understand the pain my family suffered because of the unjust Versailles Treaty. These things happened. One participant did acknowledge that it was liberating for him to have learned that in history blacks sometimes oppressed other blacks and that whites sometimes enslaved other whites because he had been brought up with the notion that only whites had enslaved blacks.  True enough. Some of the blacks who came to the United States were sold to their white slave owners by other blacks. <p>

History is good to know and to understand, but it is not healthy or, productive to try to constantly relive that history. That is what prevents progress in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and elsewhere. Yes, we must acknowledge and ask God's forgiveness for injustices. But the main thing is that we work to be sure there is a level playing field because, as Meyerson has pointed out, many who have used that level playing field have made great progress.<p>
 
As for me, I don't need a conference to tell me what needs to be done. All I have to do is to take my Christian faith seriously. Many blacks are very religious people. I have more in common with them than I have with secular non believing whites. We can all move forward because of shared beliefs. Christianity is nothing if it is not a religion of forgiveness. In that context, and with the acknowledgment of past injustices, we have the framework for real progress. <p>

No, we should never forget the past. Nor should we try to relive the past. God put us here and now in this time and in this age. For that we should be grateful. We might start by thanking God for the privilege of living here. Having visited more than 50 nations in the world, I can affirm that it is a privilege even for the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps then, with a sense of gratitude, we can move to overcome artificial barriers to progress, some of which are constructed by the very people whose job is supposed to be to tear them down.

<h2>Absent Shame, Morris Profits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>




<P>In the latest chapter involving former Presidential advisor Dick Morris, it now seems that he is about to become a TV talk show host and will be paid a huge talent fee for doing so.
This comes after his $2 million deal with a publisher in which Morris has agreed to write a book about his exciting year and a half with Bill Clinton.<P>
The more sordid the details which emerge about this whole affair, the greater the profit for Dick Morris. And that says all you need to know about the wretched state of things in contemporary America.
When the story first broke about Morris during the Democratic convention and he was forced to resign, who was it that called him from their campaign bus to offer sympathy? Why President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. As one observer noted, it was as if Morris had been injured in a car accident. Not since that day has Bill Clinton or the prematurely canonized Al Gore ever said a single word to the effect that they disapprove of what Dick Morris did. We know Clinton and Gore think it is terrible that the prostitute was disloyal. We know they think it is terrible that the rest of the media published her tabloid account. What the American people have not heard from the President and Vice President are words to the effect that "we are sickened by what has been done here and we think Dick Morris should be ashamed of himself."<P>
No, indeed. In the past, political figures who had done far less were sent into exile for years. But Morris didn't have to endure even a day of shame for what happened. Not even from his wife. I am all for forgiveness and I don't like to see any marriage break up for any reason. My initial reaction when I heard the Morris story was to extend sympathy to Mrs. Morris whom I regarded as the real victim. But I should not have bothered. She didn't need my sympathy. She was too busy posing for the front cover of Time Magazine. By that gesture not only did she tell her husband that such behavior was acceptable, but by implication she was critical of any other wife who would have suffered extreme humiliation over what happened. She said she didn't want the details because she is an adult. How positively noble. She even quoted scripture saying that "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". It is comforting to know, I suppose, that anything from the scriptures has penetrated the consciousness of those two. <P>
Far from suffering, Dick Morris is actually better off financially from what happened than if he had simply stayed in the background and had continued to advise Clinton all the way to the election. No doubt, if Clinton is re-elected, there will be a line of future candidates at Morris' door just waiting to sign him up for all his brilliance. In fact, now even if Clinton loses, Dick Morris won't suffer. He can claim it is because he was forced to resign.<P>
It isn't just that all of this has happened that is so bad. It is the deafening silence about it from the rest of the political community. Granted Bob Dole is not in a position to say much about this, but what of the rest of his party? In their bid to show extreme tolerance, the Republicans have contributed to this dreadful situation by failing to proclaim that what Morris did is just plain wrong. The most we heard from the Republican camp was a bit of chortling because the incident caused Bill Clinton problems. That even stopped abruptly when the media pointed out that Morris had worked for Trent Lott and Jesse Helms among others. <P>
In the Old Testament God sent a plague of snakes to bite the Israelites just because they complained that they were sick of  eating the Manna from Heaven which the Lord had provided. God punished their audacity.<P>
What will it take to punish ours?<P> 
It is true that all through the history of humanity, from the Garden of Eden on, God's laws have been broken by mankind . But I guess one would have to go back to Sodom and Gomorra to find a time when people flaunted their immorality as much as they do today. Of course, God destroyed those cities.
Must we tempt God to do the same here by completely destroying the sense of shame in this nation?<P>

<h2>Conventions Losing Their Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>

<P>A few parting thoughts about the Republican convention in San Diego.<P>
First, we will never know if my VP prediction would have come true. I had Bob Dole picking Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio as his running mate, but Voinovich took himself out of the running before the convention ever started. He told me privately that "no one with a last name like mine would ever get selected as a nominee of this party," a reference to his Eastern European roots. Be that as it may, Voinovich was a Catholic from a large Midwestern industrial state and might have helped Dole there. But I admit that Dole got a great deal more from his actual choice. Jack Kemp has fused the Dole campaign and Dole himself with energy and that is something that Voinovich would not have done as well. Moreover, Kemp is able to communicate with lots of voters Dole had virtually no chance of getting. To the extent that Vice Presidential picks ever help their Presidential nominees, this one certainly did and Dole has to be given an A for imagination and surprise on his choice.<P>
The convention itself was another matter. Having participated in one way or another in eight other Republican conventions since 1960, this was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a real convention. It was a four-day glorified infomercial. To be fair, the Democrats started that trend with the convention they produced in 1992 which bore little relationship to the delegates in attendance but was calculated to recast Bill Clinton as a New Democrat. They succeeded and Republicans got the picture.<P>
The delegates themselves had nothing to say about this convention. Every word, every image, even the demonstrations were scripted. To be sure there was a certain amount of scripting which occurred at every convention in the modern era. But the control of this convention was breathtaking. Members of the Politburo would have been proud. Next week we will have the Democratic version of the same scripted orchestration.<P>
The institution of the political convention cannot endure this level of contrivance for very long. Delegates who go to the trouble of getting themselves elected, based on representing grassroots networks of followers, are simply not going to tolerate paying all of that money to become a delegate only to be told they count for nothing and can't even cast the vote for which they were elected in the first place.
No, what we witnessed in San Diego and what we will witness in Chicago is not a political convention. I've been to enough of them to know the difference. What we witnessed was a grand scale TV production, in the case of San Diego, run by Mike Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image maker who later went to federal prison for improper lobbying. The irony is that most people did not watch this television spectacular. The Democrats are now worried that even fewer people will watch theirs. Except for the question of how Hillary's speech will match Elizabeth Dole's, there is really nothing interesting likely to take place there. So for all of their efforts to put on a good TV show, and it was that, the convention handlers did not achieve what a real convention, with some drama, conflict and good old fashioned political battles would have done. It did not produce an audience.<P>
With major media outlets already saying enough is enough, the era of this sort of political convention is about over. For my money good riddance. If the price of a party getting its message out is to deprive the delegates of their freedom to act as delegates, then this kind of convention is not worth having. Haley Barbour, Republican National Chairman, is busy congratulating himself on a flawless convention. I hope he has fond memories. It will probably be the last of its kind.<P>
Thanks to the many of you who called us, wrote us, E-mailed us or faxed us on our convention coverage. Our crew in San Diego, led by Peter Estrada and Greg Jenkins, worked incredibly hard. They drove themselves to the point of exhaustion. While others were out partying, the NET crew was still working. We had to. We did with less than 20 people what the major networks did with 500. We appreciate many of you saying that our coverage was better than theirs.<P>
As to Bill Lind's commentaries which some of you disliked, I asked Bill to write about this convention the way that the late H.L. Menken wrote about politics in the earlier part of this Century from his headquarters at the Baltimore Sun. Lind did just that, and he made some people angry in the process. Well stay tuned. He is going to write about the Democratic convention as well.<P>

<h2>Republicans Can Count on Whitewater</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>
Some Republicans have been smug all along  since the l994 elections, believing that they were destined to win the Presidency and keep the Congress. Even as even their own polls show Bill Clinton way out front, the smugness in these same Republican circles had continued. The reason? The belief that that somehow Whitewater or some related Clinton scandal was going to bail them out. <p>

Well, look again, Republicans. A jury in Arkansas has acquitted two Arkansas bankers on four charges of fraud in connection with the l990 Clinton gubernatorial campaign and it has deadlocked on seven others.<p>

 That trial had the most promise of directly linking Bill Clinton to wrong doing. It failed. Moreover, Whitewater Special Counsel Ken Starr has indicated that he does not believe that his investigation should interfere in the political process. What that means is if Starr did have plans to indict Hillary Clinton, and there are solid reasons to believe he did, such an indictment will wait until after the l996 elections. Starr well remembers Lawrence Walch's political inspired indictment of former defense Secretary Cap Weinberger on the eve of the l992 election and he was bitterly critical of it. He does not intend to follow that model.  <p>

So now here are the Republicans. 90 days away from the general elections and their silver bullet theory has gone out the window. Moreover Bill Clinton has done an excellent job of running to the center politically. It is hard for the electorate to distinguish Clinton's positions from Bob Dole's positions.<p>
 
What that means is that if they have any chance to win, the Republicans are going to have to come up with some real barn burner issues. These must be issues that excite the electorate. These must be issues which indicate that there is a clear cut difference between the candidates. These have to be issues which would force Bill Clinton to abandon his own base and risk losing the Presidency if he chose to echo the Republican position as he has thus far done with most of the issues Dole has weakly raised .<p>

That is a tall order for any Presidential candidate. It is an especially tall order for candidate Dole, who has made a point of running as fast to the center from the right as Clinton has run to the center from the left. It is little wonder that a poll issued late last week indicated that there is almost no interest in this year's Presidential contest, with only 20% of the electorate feeling strongly about re-electing Bill Clinton and a mere 11% of the electorate feeling strongly about electing Dole President.<p>

Miracles do happen. The Olympics demonstrated that very well. But usually they happen to people who have been working hard to prepare to take advantage of the moment. Unfortunately for Dole and the Republicans, that doesn't seem to fit the description of their candidate. With Whitewater all but gone from the political scene, Dole and the Republicans will need a sharply defined message to take to the electorate and that is something which is strangely missing from this year's political process. 

<P>

<h2>Congressman Gunderson's Allegations</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
A point of personal privilege. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin yesterday held a press conference which attacked me personally. Here is the background. Last year Gunderson, who has served in office in the 3rd Congressional District from Wisconsin since l980, announced that he would not seek another term in Congress. <p>

Subsequent to that time, Congressman Pat Roberts, who has been Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, decided to run for the U.S. Senate for the seat now held by Nancy Kassebaum. The man in line to succeed Roberts as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson, died. Thus Gunderson, who was next in line, began to change his mind. He asked the Republican candidate for Congress Jim Harsdorf to step aside. He declined to do so. Notwithstanding that Gunderson, one of the openly homosexual Members of Congress, encouraged a write in candidacy on his own behalf. Yesterday he announced that he was pulling the plug on that effort and that he would not be a candidate for re-election after all.<p>

In the process of making that announcement, Gunderson said the following: "It has come to my attention that conservative social groups in this country, led by Paul Weyrich, have informed the Speaker they would initiate a major independent expenditure against me. I have been informed that these people were prepared to do whatever was necessary to not only defeat me, but destroy me. I have been informed these groups were going to make allegations regarding my health status and AIDS. I have been informed that they were going to engage in other elements of character assassination....... Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that to some people in this country, the possibility of someone who is openly gay assuming the chair of a major Committee in Congress somehow legitimizes their personal life. And sadly, they could not accept that. "<p>
 
Gunderson said he had been assured by Speaker Gingrich that he would support Gunderson all the way if he chose to do the write in. This is the same Speaker Gingrich who is punishing Congressmen Smith and Dornan for standing on principle. <p>

Now let me make this clear. I wish I could take credit for driving Steve Gunderson out of the race. His lifestyle is his own business, and I have not sought to make it an issue. He did. He openly flaunted his lover at Congressional functions. His partner, whose name is Rob, even enjoyed a spousal pass in Congress which meant he had a special parking place and get into otherwise restricted areas. <P>

But I opposed Gunderson because of what he believed in. He was one of these so called "moderates" who was nearly always working at cross purposes with those of us who believe in traditional values.<p>
 
The fact is , however, that Gunderson made up this charge about an independent expenditure against him. I have made no such move. I have never discussed such an idea with anyone. Anyone who knows me knows that I deal with issues. Lifestyles only become important when the high nature of the office demands it (for example, a President who was on drugs could not perform his duties appropriately) or when the person himself makes it an issue by his or her conduct. <p>

Speaker Gingrich would not possibly have known about such an independent expenditure because I have not spoken to the Speaker or his staff or any other Member of the leadership or their staffs or anyone else for that matter about such a campaign. <p>

The fact is, and he admits it in his own statement, that leading Republicans in his own state were adamantly opposed to his running. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. I never spoke with any of them. Gunderson, despite the poll he released which claims that the people were clamoring for him to run, was afraid he would lose. In Washington, the game these days is to blame someone else for your decisions. I guess for Gunderson, I was a convenient target.<p>

As difficult as it is for anyone who is considered a public figure to win a libel or slander suit these days, I have my attorneys looking into the matter. As happy as I am to see him leave the Congress, Steve Gunderson should not be permitted to make things up about me or anyone else. He should not be permitted to sully my good name.<p>
 
Gunderson said that "ugliness has become the rule, rather than the exception in modern day campaigns." If that is true, then what Gunderson did is one of the worst examples of ugliness I have ever seen in the electoral process. He is truly a pathetic public figure. All of us should pray for him.<P>

<h2>Clinton and Terrorism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
It is an all too familiar sound. President Clinton, in a broadcast to the nation, offers
                      sympathy to the families of the victims of terrorism. Then he insists that no stone
                      will be left unturned to track down and punish those responsible. 
<P>
                      Those words, used over and over again recently after the blast in Saudi Arabia,
                      after TWA's Flight 800 and after the Olympic pipe bomb incident, just to name a
                      few in the past weeks, may comfort the nation. But the deeds of the Clinton
                      Administration are another matter. 
<P>
                      One of the nation's leading experts on terrorism told me privately the other day that
                      this Administration has resisted doing what is absolutely necessary if we are
                      actually serious about tracking down those responsible, and if we truly want to
                      prevent future incidents of terrorism. The Administration doesn't want to use human
                      agents to infiltrate suspected terrorist groups. 
<P>
                      "The problem with the Clinton Administration", this expert in terrorism told me, "is
                      that they think you can track down everything by satellite and other electronic
                      means. But in combating terrorism, there is no substitute for having real live bodies
                      on the scene. That's how you really get the job done". 
<P>
                      It is ironic too because after Oklahoma City, when it was clear that the suspects
                      were domestic anarchists, the Administration was only too willing to engage in
                      spying. The Republican Congress finally stripped most of those powers from the
                      legislation which Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. 
<P>
                      But when it comes to the international variety, the Administration, trapped by its
                      own l960's view of the world, rejects escalated spying. 
<P>
                      That is, in fact, typical of the attitude of the far left, which formed its attitudes about
                      spying in the depth of the cold war. Somehow, for the far left, it was acceptable for
                      the Soviets to have their agents everywhere in the United States. But it was
                      impermissible for the United States to spy on Soviet activities. The left has never
                      been shy about double standards. 
<P>
                      President Clinton is one of the most able Presidents we have ever employed when
                      it comes to sympathizing with the victims of terrorism. The relatives of those killed
                      in TWA Flight 800 sang the praises of Clinton as he spent several hours with them
                      last week. His efforts in that regard are commendable.
<P>
                      But the one effective thing Clinton could do for those relatives-- to track down
                      those who were responsible for the tragedy itself by the most effective means
                      possible, the President is reluctant to do.

<h2>Sacrificing Conscience to Republican Totalitarianism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p><p>

In two nations which were part of the NATO alliance, conservative political parties which were at one time dominant forces in those countries, have all but disappeared. In Canada, the Progressive Conservatives went from a solid outright majority in the Parliament to just two seats following the last Canadian election. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the party of the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly always the central partner in Italy's many post-war governments, has nearly vanished following recent elections there.
<p.
In the United States, the Republican party may be next. This week the party took another giant step in that direction. House Speaker Newt Gingrich inflicted ex post facto discipline on Reps. Bob Dornan (R-CA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) for supporting former Congressman Joe DioGuardi in his primary race against the militantly pro-abortionist Rep. Sue Kelly (R-NJ). Dornan and Smith were forbidden to serve on key conference committees which are bringing forth crucial bills to be passed before this Congress becomes history. Moreover, both Congressmen have been denied travel funds even though both are chairmen of international subcommittees where travel is required as part of the responsibilities of the committee.
For Rep. Smith especially, opposing Kelly was an exercise of his conscience. Rep. Kelly is one of five Republicans to vote with Bill Clinton on the partial birth abortion issue. Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has called the brutal murder of the baby in the partial birth abortion procedure infanticide. Mr. DioGuardi is in the race because of that issue.
<p>
Rep. Smith has introduced a freedom of conscience resolution in the House Republican Conference. It declares that any Member of Congress shall have the right to back any candidate for office according to his own conscience. Moreover, if sanctions were to be imposed on a Member for doing so, the resolution would require a vote on the issue by the entire House GOP Conference.
<p>
Smith needs 50 signatures on his resolution to have it considered. He is having trouble getting the signatures because Speaker Gingrich has so intimidated Members with his disciplinary measures that many who are sympathetic to Smith are now afraid to sign up.
<p>
The fact is there was no rule in the GOP Conference against a Member supporting a primary opponent of a sitting congressman. In a display of Soviet style justice, the sanctions were imposed after the fact.
If we have come to the point where, because he serves as a Republican Member of the House, a Member of Congress can no longer follow his conscience (and anyone who knows Smith knows that he is genuinely a man of conscience), then we have changed our form of government overnight without the consent of the governed. If these sanctions are allowed to stand, the Republican party, in due course, will surely follow the way of the Canadian Conservatives and the Italian Christian Democrats.
<p>
If to be a Republican means one has to give up his freedom of conscience, then the price, as Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) has suggested, is much too high.

<h2>Casino Gambling Reform Hits Roadblock</h2>
<p><p><p>
<blockquote>
When both sides of a highly contentious issue claim they are satisfied with the result of a compromise, it is a sure sign that very little will be accomplished. That is exactly the case with a bill, for which the House of Representatives gave final approval, which would create a federal commission to examine the $40 billion gambling industry.
<p>
That any bill was passed at all was due to a rare combination of the religious right, who believe that gambling has hurt families, and liberals who target the gambling industry as another example of the corruption of free enterprise. 
<p>
The original bill, as conceived by Congressman Frank Wolf, an evangelical Christian from Virginia, was greatly weakened. 
<p>
Originally the commission would have had broad subpoena power. But the bill which passed the Congress, now permits the commission to only subpoena documents, not people. In addition, if material is not available from public sources, the Commission must keep its information confidential. Wolf said he is satisfied with the powers the commission has. But so is Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Chairman, who represents the gambling industry in Washington. He says he welcomes a "balanced" inquiry into the industry. 
<p>
What all of this means is that Congressman Wolf got just enough out of the commission that he doesn't have to deny that his bill was gutted, while Fahrenkopf is satisfied that the commission doesn't really have enough power to do any real damage to the industry. So there you have it. Another "Washington Commission" has been born. It will spend lots of taxpayer money. It will issue reports. Most likely few will read the reports. Nothing will change. 
<p>
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the commission was needed to know the implications of the growth of the gambling industry. A couple of decades ago there was legalized gambling in only two states, Nevada and New Jersey. Now only two states, Utah and Hawaii, ban legalized gambling, and there are operating casinos in 23 states. 
<p>
The Family Research Council points out that in states where gambling is flourishing, more and more families are becoming impoverished. They contend that gambling is addictive in many cases and has led to financial ruin for many families who otherwise would be able to maintain themselves. The gambling industry, on the other hand, contends that only 5% of gamblers are addicted. And so the debate goes on and on. 
<p>
It is really a part of an age old debate about what sorts of activity, which if done in excess can lead to the destruction of human beings, should thus be legal and open for all citizens to participate. Such a debate preceded the passage of the Volstead Act, the Constitutional amendment which outlawed the sale of liquor and was in force for more than a decade. Enforcement of the Volstead Act, critics claim, was responsible for the establishment of the Mafia in the United States, as liquor sales went underground. The same question now pertains to gambling. Should it be open and above board where it can be seen and regulated? Or is society better off if gambling is underground, even if authorities have a much harder time policing it?
The new Gambling Commission may provide some data, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue. The real question, as it is with pornography on the Internet or drug usage and other such matters, is simply this: what damage is caused to society when potentially sinful activities are engaged in by a substantial percentage of its population? And if it can be proven that substantial damage is done by such activities to society as a whole, what right does society have to curb the choices which can be made by free citizens?
Libertarians contend that citizens should be free to do as they wish, because it is a matter of their choice to use their resources as they see fit. Traditionalists contend that society must protect itself against any behavior which is seen as self destructive and should therefore be free to curb such behavior. Thus far, the Supreme Court has tended to side with the Libertarians. 
<p>
But in any case, that will continue to be debated so long as we have the freedom to do so. It will be debated long after the new Gambling Commission issues its ponderous reports, which when all is said and done, are not likely to effect the outcome of the debate in this society much at all. That's all for Direct Line for tonight.

<p></h3><h2>
The Next American Revolution
<p></h2><p><p>
<blockquote>
This past Spring, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of praising his opponent, Bob Dole, for insisting that a disclaimer be added to the Republican Party platform.  The disclaimer calls for tolerance for opposing opinions.  For weeks, the issue was the Republican's so-called anti-abortion plank.  The establishment media feasted on the debate over whether to amend the language.  While Clinton cheered him on, Dole finally resolved to put the tolerance disclaimer in the preamble to the platform, although for awhile he seemed wrestle with a decision to put the tolerance language directly in the paragraph which addresses the issue of abortion.
<P>
Interestingly, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic Platform.  Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would have no guarantee of saving unborn lives.  The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the practice.  Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.
<p>
Ultimately the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms.  The real contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest which pits Washington against its own citizens.  Let's be honest about one thing: the Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by establishment politicians. Yet, what our culture badly needs is honesty in its political process.  Our society desperately needs elected leaders who maintain the courage of their convictions.
<p>
All of this may require a third political party.  If that is the case, then so be it.  You see, America has reached a great crossroads in its history.  Our nation faces a great dilemma  our government is in debt bordering on insolvency.  Meanwhile, increasingly, our country faces threats from unknown entities throughout the world in the form of terrorism.
<p>
What we need more than anything else is prayer; the prayer of honest citizens that our elected leaders act responsibly; prayer that our culture turns from its tailspin of depravity; prayer that God, who at one time blessed this great nation of ours, will again restore our nation to moral and fiscal health.
God has given us a wonderful gift. He has given us a nation in which its citizens are free to worship, speak, own property, and elect popular leaders. But slowly we have allowed our elected leaders and cultural elitists to squandered that gift, through debt, moral erosion, lawlessness and political deceit. I believe God can judge America or save America. It's up to us. But time is running out, both for our economic and spiritual well-being.
<p>
If we as a nation return to the faith and righteous principles upon which this country was founded, I believe God will once restore to our nation the America we once were. May God help us to pray for that to happen.

<h2>Business-As-Usual No Longer Works</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>

This morning's Washington Post is just gloating over Republican Senators who, the Post says, have rediscovered government. They cite among others, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah who fought to add another $10 million to the appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts because, he says, the Endowment supports dozens of small cultural entities in Utah.<P>
The Post describes Bennett as a Mormon with strong culturally conservative views. Those views, the paper is happy to report, were not enough to override his desire to bring federal money to his state, even though the National Endowment for the Arts funds pornography and homosexual art. The last time I checked, neither was well thought of in Mormon circles.<P>
But the case of Bennett, and several other Republican Senators mentioned, serves to illustrate why the Republican attempt to balance the budget by 2002 absent a Constitutional Amendment is folly. There are always just enough so-called conservative Senators who are willing to play the game of trying to be the local hero who brought home the federal bacon. Therefore cutting federal spending becomes next to impossible.<P>
We had cultural activities in my hometown, but local people supported them with their own money. If they didn't, the local symphony and museums and other projects would have disappeared. And this is as it should be.<P>
If the question is should cultural projects in Utah be funded by the rest of us taxpayers, sure voters will say yes. But if the question is should we as a nation go into debt to fund these projects, my betting is the answer would be different. Bennett, I am willing to wager, could maintain his political support by posing the second question rather than the first.<P>
This Congress came within a single vote of passing a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. With Bill Clinton continuing to lead Bob Dole and Ross Perot by such impressive numbers, I fear that the next Congress will be even less willing to pass such an amendment. Yet the fiscal condition of the nation demands that this be done. We are on the verge of bankruptcy.<P>
I have to give credit to Perot and Dick Lamm, the rivals in the Reform party. At least they are talking about this issue. You don't hear either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole saying much about it, and they would say nothing at all if the Reform party weren't in the mix.<P>
If the next Congress is unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to pass a Constitutional Amendment, then there is no alternative to a Constitutional Convention to take up that issue, term limits and other such questions which are beyond the courage of the Congress. Then at least the states would be given the chance to ratify or reject such proposals. My guess is that at the state level, a balanced budget would get overwhelming approval.<P>
The politicians like Bennett just don't get it yet. The way we've done business for the past sixty years just doesn't work anymore. The nation can't afford it. But since there seems to be no hope of replacing enough ordinary politicians in the Congress, our only hope is an extraordinary measure such as a Constitutional Convention. I regret that is the case and there are dangers in calling such a convention. But the alternative is to have business as usual and this business is going belly up.<P><P>

<h2>Bob Dole and His Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>It is a strange world, this world of politics. Reality seldom penetrates the consciousness of the players. Perceptions, which are often created by one's political enemies, become reality. And politicians act upon that false reality. <P>Such is the case concerning the 1992 Republican national convention in Houston.<P>On the first day of the convention, the man who challenged President Bush, Pat Buchanan, gave a barn burner of a speech. The late John Chancellor of NBC called it one of the finest speeches he had ever heard at a convention and that was saying something since Chancellor had covered politics since the 1950's. Also speaking that evening were former Education Secretary and Drug Czar Bill Bennett and former President Ronald Reagan. Both gave excellent speeches. Polls were taken that night and for the one and only time during the peak political season, George Bush led Bill Clinton in the Presidential race.<P>But other media began to criticize both the Bennett and Buchanan speeches, especially the part of Buchanan's speech where he suggested we were in the midst of a culture war. Excerpts of that speech were played over and over again, out of context, and Buchanan was ripped apart by the media and by liberal politicians. When George Bush lost to Bill Clinton, this same media blamed his loss on Buchanan and conservatives who allegedly scared moderate women away from the Republicans. <P>Now mind you, those speeches, including Buchanan's, only helped Bush in all actuality. In truth, George Bush was fired by the American people for two reasons. First because he pledged not to raise taxes and then engineered the largest tax increase in history up to that point. Second because Bush seemed to be preoccupied with foreign affairs at a time when the United States was in a mild recession. <P>One person, however, bought the media line about 1992 wholesale. That person is Bob Dole. Determined not to scare these same fictitious voters, Dole has banned Pat Buchanan from speaking in a major time slot at the convention, even though Buchanan ended up the runner up in the Presidential contest. Such a move is without precedent in modern American politics. Moreover, Dole has put forward the feminist Republican Susan Molinari as the keynote speaker. Colin Powell, a self declared Rockefeller Republican who disagrees with most of the GOP platform, will also be featured that first night. The Dole advisers are confident that when he puts forth this moderate image to the American people they will come flocking to him in droves. <P>It is an interesting theory. By that measure, Dole can be elected President by doing what the media wants. Never mind that in reality Dole will be driving away millions of conservative voters in the process. That is the truth. Oh, yes, and there is one other little problem. The media loves Bill Clinton much more than Bob Dole no matter what Dole does to try to please them. When all is said and done they won't give him much credit for doing what they have proscribed for the Republican party. Perceptions will vanish and reality will hit home to Bob Dole on election night. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h2>Racism, Sexism Revisited</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>
Bill Lind's recent series of commentaries on Political Correctness created quite a stir here at NET.  We have had a substantial internal debate about whether, particularly, his commentary of Monday, July 9 promotes or invites racism.  We've also had some discussion about his July 10 commentary on sexism.
When authentic, racism is extremely harmful because it fails to consider the worth and dignity of each person as an individual.  As Mr. Lind noted in one of his commentaries, "Wise people judge other individuals as individuals, not as members of any group."<P>
Our culture has indeed become so Politically Correct, so infected by false racism and irrational sexism, that it has become quite difficult to discuss any of these issues without being accused of committing that which one would condemn.  People today are so often told that they are victims of characteristics beyond their control that they tend to believe it.  Worse, those who have experienced real discrimination, yet whose lives are dedicated to rising above it by courageously finding ways up, over and around it, are the most seriously harmed by false discrimination.  Why?  Because false discrimination tends to become confused with authentic discrimination.  Real discrimination thus becomes harder to detect, which means that fewer citizens take action to stamp it out.<P>
The late Dr. Martin Luther King urged Americans to judge people by the content of their character.  We at NET, and at its founding organization, the Free Congress Foundation, agree with that statement.  We do not espouse or condone racism in any form.  We are committed to the fair treatment of everyone.  Consequently we condemn both real and false racism.<P>
As Mr. Lind also noted in last week's series, we recognize that men and women are different.  Complementary, but different.  Thus we believe, for example, that single-sex education, recently condemned by the Supreme Court, should be supported in this country; we endorse parental choice in education.  That does not deny that many young men and women do well in a co-educational environment; nor does it deny that most men and women are able to perform the vast majority of  jobs equally well.  However, we disagree with the feminist view that there are no differences between men and women.  That view is a delusion. It is a failure to recognize physical reality.  We are not all the same; each of us is a unique individual, deserving of respect as such.<P>
In our NET commentaries, we intend to discuss difficult, contentious issues.  Our editorial viewpoint is, for example, uncompromisingly pro-life and pro-family.  We will continue to express ourselves, and to present guest commentaries on controversial issues, because we believe you, our viewers, are well-served by discussions of issues rarely presented elsewhere with forthrightness based on a search for truth.  And when our commentaries create controversy internally, we will continue to have open, frank discussions.  Your views are important to us as well; they enrich our discussions, and they help us to know you better.  So we invite you to call, write, fax and e-email us whenever you wish to comment on an issue, or on anything else we do.<P>

<h2>Lamm Candidacy Adds Dimension</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
I was out of the country when former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm announced that he was going to run for President. Fortunately, I returned last night from Bulgaria just in time to see the repeat of that press conference on C SPAN.<P>
Lamm has burned his bridges and has now agreed to support the nominee of the Reform party, even if that nominee is Ross Perot, against whom Lamm is now running for the Presidential nomination.<P>
On the surface Lamm's candidacy looks like a quixotic one. He is barely known outside of Colorado. He is running in the party which Perot founded with Perot's money. It is unclear who will vote in that party primary, which is being conducted by mail over a several day period.<P>
Lamm has only about a month to get himself well enough known that he would have a shot at defeating Perot in the Reform party primary. Given his lack of financial resources, Lamm would seem to be a sure loser to Perot. But Lamm is touching a chord with his message. In fact, his candidacy was the result of his stark assessment of where we as a nation have gone wrong. He delivered that assessment to a state convention in California. Delegates, right then and there, circulated a petition and urged Lamm to run. Other states followed. This prompted Perot, who had planned on a coronation for the Reform party nomination, to announce prematurely that he was likely to run again and so the campaign has begun.
Mind you I completely disagree with Governor Lamm's social issues policies. We are about as far apart as two people can get on that spectrum. But I have long admired Dick Lamm as a man who believes in what he says and has the courage of his convictions.<P>
I am also a big fan of former Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong, who in my view, missed his calling by not being a Presidential candidate in 1996. I think he would have swept all the others away. Were he the nominee, Republicans would not now be facing the sort of electoral disaster that awaits them if Bill Clinton continues to hold on to the sort of numbers he has now.<P>
The year was 1984 and Armstrong was seeking his second term in the U.S. Senate. Dick Lamm was then Governor of Colorado and widely thought to be a possible candidate for the Senate. Armstrong proposed that if Lamm were the Democratic candidate for the Senate, the two of them should go city by city throughout Colorado together, debating the issues. For whatever reason Lamm did not run that year. I suspect he wasn't sure he could defeat the equally articulate Armstrong.<P>
What a Senate campaign that would have been. Two of the most knowledgeable and attractive candidates ever to have run for public office debating real issues in the public forum. That is the way our system ought to work. <P>
Now Lamm is out there for President and the odds are very much against him. Unfortunately he has to run at a time when the American voters are least tuned into politics. It is a pity because, agree or disagree, they need to hear what Lamm has to say. He is making points that other politicians simply refuse to talk about. True, Bob Dole does pay lip service to the notion that excessive spending by government is not a good idea, even though he has helped to pass much of what he now complains about.<P>
Lamm, coming as he does from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has the greater impact on such issues. What Dole says is expected from a Republican candidate. When Lamm says it, it has real credibility. Dick Lamm is to entitlements and the bankruptcy of America what Richard Nixon was to China. His message is tough, but he has a non-threatening personality. Lamm can say what he says without scaring people the way some republicans manage to do so. He makes you stop and think. And by the way, what he says about entitlements is the same thing that senators Al Simpson of Wyoming and Robert Kerry of Nebraska have been saying now for some time. Perhaps at the Presidential level Lamm can get the audience Simpson and Kerry have never managed to get.<P>
I wish Dick Lamm well. His policies on values questions preclude my voting for him but I think he is doing the nation a service just by running. He brings a desperately needed level of candor to the Presidential campaign in which Bill Clinton lies, Bob Dole speaks unintelligibly, and Ross Perot speaks only in platitudes.<P>
If by some wholly unexpected chance he were to defeat Perot in his own primary and go on to the general election, Lamm would totally destabilize the November election scene. Liberals would have an alternative to Bill Clinton and conservatives whose primary focus is our entitlement mess would have an alternative to Bob Dole. A debate between the three of them is a Presidential campaign to die for.<P>
Just like the exciting possibility back in Colorado in 1984, it is unlikely to happen. But given this uninspiring political campaign, our thanks to Dick Lamm for giving us something to at least dream about.<P>

<h2>Disney's Moral Whitewash</h2>
<P>

Awhile back the Southern Baptist convention passed a resolution at their annual convention of Messengers calling on their members to boycott Walt Disney theme parks, movies and merchandise.<P>
Granted the Southern Baptists cant control what their members do and many of them are not likely to go along with the boycott; still it is an uncomfortable position for Disney to be in with the largest Protestant denomination in the United States telling its membership to stay away from Disney properties.<P>
The Southern Baptists were protesting not only the Disney decision, as a corporation, to grant benefits to homosexual partnerships but also recent Disney distributed films.  For example, last year Disney released "the Priest," a movie which portrayed a homosexual clergyman sympathetically. Indeed, even what are supposed to be classic style Disney movies such as "the Lion King" and the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" are now filled with sexual references. Reviewers are even suggesting that "Hunchback" is not an appropriate movie for children. Michael Eisner and company have taken the Disney company a long way from its pro family roots. No wonder the Disney theme parks now sport a Gay and Lesbian pride day with special discounts for public displays of such behavior.<P>
So to the rescue comes Father Leo ODonovan, the President of Georgetown University, one of the most venerable Catholic institutions in the nation. He has just been elected to a two year term on the Disney board. Father ODonovan can be expected to uphold traditional Judeo Christian moral values, right? ODonovan is Eisners market response to the move by the Southern Baptists, right?<P>
Well, think again. ODonovan is to traditional Catholics what John Chaffee is to traditional Republicans. ODonovan is a liberal Catholic. He has been elected to the board not to make the Disney company sensitive to traditional morality but to give Eisner cover. Already he has defended the Disney decision to grant benefits to homosexual couples as standard industry practice and he has defended the Disney distribution of the movie "the Priest." ODonovan says that a company or an individual cant be judged by "a single act or production, or wed never lead lives or have businesses."<P>
Are you surprised? Im not. Georgetown has its own Gay pride activities with the full blessing of ODonovan. Indeed ODonovan has done his best to remove what little vestiges of the Catholic faith remained at Georgetown.<P>
Soon after he became President six years ago, ODonovan showed up here at a dinner party I had to discuss our pioneer television efforts. I say showed up because I hadnt invited him. He came as the uninvited guest of someone we did ask to come. It was clear ten minutes into our conversation that he was a liberal who will defend just about anything on the liberal agenda.<P>
Eisner was not bowing to market pressure from the Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights which has similarly blasted Disney. Eisner was looking for someone with credentials who could defend the company and give a thumbs up for its immoral practices. Well since Notre Dames former President Theodore Hesburgh is too busy serving on Bill Clintons legal defense fund board, I guess ODonovan was the next best thing. Besides, Hesburgh is well known as a liberal. ODonovan isnt, so he will be more useful to Eisner.<P>
No, if Disney is serious about wanting some moral input, I am sure Dr. James Dobson, or the Presbyterian intellectual D. James Kennedy or one of the many former Presidents of the Southern Baptists would be available. Or if Disney really does want the genuine Catholic point of view, I suggest Cardinal OConnor of New York or Cardinal Law of Boston.<P>
What Disney needs is someone on its board who will represent the point of view of parents to the company and not the other way around. Eisner is clever.  Appointing ODonovan is a good public relations move. But the Southern Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights are still correct. What Disney is producing these days is a disgrace. The company should be boycotted. Real economic pressure will force real change. The ODonovan appointment, far from a bow to the traditional values community, represents business as usual.<P>

<h2>Faith and Global Stability</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations are happy over the result of the Russian elections this past week.  Incumbent Boris Yeltsin won.  The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations were not happy over the result of the Israeli elections last month.  The incumbent lost.<P>
This mentality speaks volumes for the modern world view of global stability.  The world leaders now put the concept of global stability above risk, higher than right and wrong, and ahead of principle.  This means that human rights, individual freedoms and even democracy now take a back seat to the new global imperative of maintaining stability, status quo, and "peace."<P>
No policy is without an overriding philosophy and global stability is no exception. Its philosophy is relativism, a mentality which holds that truth and even morality can only be defined within the context of todays events.<P>
Today, those who question the philosophy of relativism are scorned by the popular culture, in the press, on TV and in Hollywood.<P>
Ask U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Speaking at separate events, Scalia and Thomas recently told of the importance of faith in God.  Thomas was criticized for his religious views.  Academia laughed at Scalia for believing in angels.  The culture wants to stop jurists like Scalia, Thomas and William Rhenquist for applying Constitutional absolutes to legal cases for a society which has begun to question eternal truth and moral absolutes.<P>
I for one agree with Scalia. Let them laugh.  Angels are real.  We cant see God and we cant see the wind.  Yet God and the wind exist whether the cultural engineers like it or not.  In fact, its not what they think that matters but what God thinks that really matters.  Thats the faith perspective. Thats exactly whats missing from the new world view of the White House, the State Department and the United Nations.<P>
The faith perspective understands right from wrong.  The faith perspective realizes there is something much greater at stake than the futile pursuit of peace through stability.  A faith perspective requires leaders to take a moral stand, armed with absolutes which modern events simply cannot change.<P>
Murder and stealing are forbidden by our laws. Why?  Because life and charity are good things according to the precepts of God who does not change.<P>
Our society began with a belief in God and with faith.  Look at the words on our coins.  It doesnt say in the world we trust, in the UN we trust, or even in government we trust.  Our nation began with a cultural trust in God and a societal faith in Gods precepts.<P>
The faith of a nation is a powerful quality.  It has made the twentieth century the century of America, a nation founded on belief in God.<P>
Our nation will never end with a belief in God, but it can end without a belief in God, and we must never let that happen.  Its time to end the global stability and moral relativity lock on our future.  America doesnt need a UN to tell us where weve been or a faithless government to tell us where we can go.  What America needs today is a few good citizens, of faith and courage, to safely guide us into the next great century.<P>

<h2>Cigarettes and Aliens in Washington
</h2>
<P>

There's a new movie out this week, appropriately named "Independence Day."  In Washington, this movie is so hot, they are running a 4 a.m. showing at the Uptown Theater and even that is sold out.  "Independence Day" is about aliens who take over and eventually destroy the White House.  The world is next on their agenda.<P>
The trouble is, the movie is about three years too late.  The aliens have occupied the White House since George Bush left in 1993.  No plot from Hollywood could possibly come close to what we already have with these diabolical aliens.  There's the First Lady who doesn't remember making a call from Arkansas the night lawyer Vince Foster mysteriously died.  There's the Vice President who advocates a new world order run by environmentalists.  There's the president who tells one group he's pro-life and then supports the practice of partial birth abortions.  This is the White House that ordered FBI summary files on its political enemies.  These are the aliens who brought us Whitewater, travel-gate and "I feel your pain."<P>
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not running the President's reelection campaign.  His party has their hands full trying to contain a candidate who has begun to hemorrhage in the polls.<P>
Perhaps the Democratic party has found a way out.  They recently discovered what they are sure will be a scandal against Republican opponent Bob Dole.  The scandal they have begun to stoke is cigarettes.  It seems Bob Dole used to smoke cigarettes. Unlike the President, Mr. Dole admits that he actually inhaled.  The Democrats are so certain they have a marketable scandal against Dole, they've even hired an actor to follow the Dole campaign.  Each morning the actor dresses himself as a seven-foot cigarette.  The actor who portrays this giant cigarette calls himself "Butt Man."  The idea is that Mr. Dole is somehow villainous because his campaign has received money from cigarette conglomerates.  What's worse, Mr. Dole won't even say he's sorry.<P>
The Democratic National Committee says it is proud of "Butt Man."  What else can they talk about?  After all, Dole is about as scandalous as Socks the Cat-and we're told Socks even counts mice among his friends.<P>
"Butt Man" probably won't be coming to a town near you.  Certainly "Independence Day" will soon be playing at theater near you.  If you go to see it, remember to follow these simple rules of theater etiquette.  First, don't talk when the movie begins, that irritates other viewers. Second, don't laugh when you see the White House blow up, it really isn't funny. And finally, whatever you do, don't smoke. The real aliens just might attack you, in the press.<P>

<h2>The Establishment is Having a Fit</h2>

<P>
                      Establishment Republicans across the country are upset at the rising influencing of
                      anti-establishment Conservatives in their party. These party professionals have drawn
                      quiet sympathy from their Democratic counterparts who share their disdain over the
                      revolutionary voices of an anti-Washington public threatening the status quo of the
                      cozy two-party system.
<P>
                      In Kansas, the establishment has quietly criticized Sam Brownback, a conservative
                      freshman Congressman, because he is running for Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat.
                      The Republican establishment has chosen a liberal to fill the seat, and view
                      Brownback as a threat to the carefully-crafted status quo.
<P>
                      In South Carolina, eleven Christian conservatives outpaced former Governor Carroll
                      Campbell this Spring in the voting for the state's delegates to the National Convention.
                      Campbell was furious that unknowns would challenge the establishment. "I play in a
                      much bigger league than they do," Campbell later told reporters. "I don't have time to
                      fool with them."
<P>
                      All of this intolerance towards anti-establishment conservatives is masked in official
                      calls for tolerance toward liberals in the Republican party. The center of gravity in
                      today's political debate is the culture. The issue most symbolic of the cultural debate is
                      abortion. It is for this reason that the establishment insists on language of tolerance
                      only in the abortion plank.
<P>                      At the same time, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic
                      Platform. Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually
                      says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would
                      have no guarantee of saving unborn lives. The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts
                      the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the
                      practice. Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes
                      in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.

                      While the two parties continue to apply a double meaning to the term "tolerance," a
                      vast group of Americans have begun to rethink their support for the Republican Party.
                      In fact, the day is coming when ordinary American voters will no longer be able to tell
                      the two parties apart. When that happens, it is likely that a new, anti-establishment
                      party will arise, fueled by a public outraged at being ignored by both Republicans and
                      Democrats.

                      You see the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms. The real
                      contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest
                      which pits Washington against its own citizens. Let's be honest about one thing: the
                      Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by professional
                      politicians. It is this same establishment that long ago took Washington into captivity,
                      controlling the media, lobbying for special interests

<h2>When Whitewater Wasn't Cool
</h2>
<P>

There is an old country song which goes, "I was country, when country wasn't cool."  Like the song, there was a time when Whitewater, as a news story, wasn't cool.  Now that Special Counsel Ken Starr has secured actual jury convictions, and now that Attorney General Janet Reno has added "Filegate" to Starr's portfolio, Starr and Whitewater enjoy generally-accepted credibility.<P>
Today Whitewater is cool.  But I remember the days when Whitewater wasn't cool.  I recall 1994, when Washington Times investigative reporter Jerry Seper uncovered factual Whitewater information on an almost daily basis. On Whitewater, Seper spent weeks meticulously fitting together the factual pieces of a puzzle scattered over a ten year period, strewn across Arkansas and Washington, DC, and overlooked by establishment reporters who sat on the facts because Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
At the same time, NET-television network began a weekly "Whitewater Update" on "Capitol Watch."  NET tried to get the painfully uncompromising Mr. Seper on our program, but found him routinely unavailable for the limelight. Fortunately, we managed convince several of his colleagues to help us present to our live call-in audience the factual details known at the time.  Editorial Page Editor Tod Lindberg, editorial writer Eric Felton, and even Wesley Pruden helped NET interpret the latest facts in a case which was, for other networks, too difficult for the nightly news.  Indeed, Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
Talk radio played a hand back then. The Seper and Times reports were reliable talking points for an audience trapped between a media establishment trying to avoid Whitewater as a story and hucksters trying to exploit Whitewater for profit.  Even then much of the public new there was a story amidst the confusion.  Whitewater was a story which simply wouldn't go away.<P>
Whitewater wasn't cool then, but it became fashionable later.  As the 104th Congress began its hearings and Special Counsel Starr took over the investigation, gradually the story began to achieve its acceptance.  Seper continued his work. The editorial page added its perspective for readers of the new National Weekly edition and for Insight magazine.  Talk radio and NET continued to take calls.<P>
Finally Starr's work produced its first indictments  former business partners of the First Lady, Susan and James McDougal, and the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Conventional wisdom said the Governor and Susan McDougal would win acquittals partly because the Little Rock jury had not been sequestered and names of the jurists were published in the local papers.  Yet, Starr's efforts prevailed and the jury convicted each of the defendants.  Thus, Whitewater became "cool."<P>
Today Whitewater and its cousins, "Filegate" and "Travelgate," have become the story of the year.  Today a pool of reporters have jumped into the cool current of Whitewater.  They go to bed with visions of Pulitzer dancing in their heads. Few may realize they have a story built on the foundation of work quietly produced by the likes of Jerry Seper. To the readers of the Washington Times, the listeners of talk radio, and the viewers of NET, Whitewater was always a story.  We were Whitewater when Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>

<h2>The Communists are Going to Lose
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>



It appears to me that the Communists are about to lose the elections in   

Russia.  I say this because I have watched elections in which they have   

participated in for over 35 years.  Absolutely every time they think they   

are going to lose they begin to complain that the election process is   

rigged with fraud ahead of time.  Well that is happening now with a   

vengeance as the Communists hope to discredit any victory by Russian   

President Boris Yeltsin.<P>

Yeltsin, for his part, has been running very tough television commercials   

narrated by famous Russian actors calling to mind the days of terror   

inflicted on the Russian people by Stalin, the times of famine due to the   

Communist system, the lack of freedom to travel and worship and so on.<P>   

The pro Yeltsin narrators say of Gennady Zuganov, the Communist candidate   

for President, that the Communists now claim that they are different than   

those of old but, in fact, they are not. These American style television   

commercials have a point. While Zuganov tones down his views when he is   

speaking to Western reporters, out on the hustings when speaking to the   

party faithful he doesn't hesitate to invoke the name of Stalin and he   

makes no apologies for the Communist era which he said brought Russians   

stability.<P>

One aspect of the Russian campaign which has interesting implications is   

the effort by Boris Yeltsin's newfound electoral partner Alexander Lebed   

to denounce aspects of Western culture.  Since the fall of the Soviet   

Union in l99l, Russia has been invaded by American soap operas, American   

pornographic magazines, American R and X rated movies, American punk   

fashions and contemporary American morals.  Lebed, while somewhat friendly   

to the West politically, has denounced this trashy Western influence on   

the Russian culture and has promised that , if continued in power, he   

will do his best to rid the nation of such corrupting elements.  Lebed   

placed a strong third in the first round of the Russian elections and   

Yeltsin hired him as his security chief the next day.  Lebed has been more   

visible than Yeltsin this past week as the campaign heads to July 3rd for   

the final round.<P>

It will be interesting to see if the Russian voters respond to Lebed's   

promise to rid Russia of the degrading aspects of Western culture.  If   

they do, American politicians might take note.  While this country would   

not respond well to the authoritarian suggestions of Lebed, I think the   

climate is right for a political figure to finally have the courage to   

say "enough is enough" when it comes to the ever degrading television   

shows, movies and printed material that constantly flows forth these   

days.  There are still enough people who adhere to the Judeo Christian   

moral structure in this country to make a mighty difference if any   

credible political figure would tell them what they are anxiously waiting   

to hear. <P>

<h2>Second Thoughts About a Constitutional Convention
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>


I am about to upset a lot of people. So get your pens ready, crank up your computers, and oil your fax machines. Here we go. <P>
I am sitting here thinking about another dreadful Supreme Court decision, the 7 to 1 rendering on the VMI case which outlaws same sex educational institutions. It paves the way for women in combat and a host of other things we have fought over the years. It continues what my colleague Tom Jipping has called "the cultural Jihad." <P>
I, of course, have called for the impeachment of the majority on this court, although I know how far that will get. Still, the question is, as Lenin once said, "What is to be done?" <P>
If you watched Direct Line Wednesday night you understand that Congress will do nothing about this decision. There are constitutional remedies available to the Congress, such as withdrawing jurisdiction from the Court on certain issues, but they never, ever use them. Lets face it, after more than fifty years of watching the Court erode its power, the Congress is afraid to do anything about it. <P>
I keep thinking of what the Court has done to votes of the people such as in the Colorado homosexual rights case and in the Arkansas term limits case and on and on. I will bet that had the people in Virginia voted on VMI or the people of South Carolina voted on the Citadel they would have voted to uphold tradition. It is clear that with this Court the votes of the people dont matter. <P>
This Court keeps altering the Constitution to the point where it can no longer be recognized. They find rights which are not there. They do not respect, in any way, the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states and to the people those matters which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. <P>
The argument against a Constitutional Convention is that it would change our constitutional form of government. But our form of government is being changed by this Supreme Court case by case, year by year. The Court does so without the consent of the governed or even of the Congress elected by the governed. With this Court there is no Constitution unless it is found convenient to resurrect it from time to time. <P>
I know this is going to send my friend Phyllis Schlafly into orbit and I will be forever branded as a traitor to my country by various committees of correspondence who busy the fax machines and the Internet. But I have to ask the question. Can we be worse off with a Constitutional Convention elected by the people than we are with a Court that constantly undoes the work of the people? <P>
I guess I have more faith in the people than others do. I recall that the same fears which have been expressed about a national Constitutional Convention were expressed about both Maryland and Louisiana when they held such conventions to rewrite their state constitutions. No real damage was done in Maryland, despite it being one of the most liberal states in the country. Louisianas constitution came out far better after the convention than before. <P>
If my good friends at the NRA, the Christian Coalition, in pro-life groups, and a host of other groups can help win elections all around the country, why cant they help elect a majority to a Constitutional Convention? If we ran slates of delegates to such a convention on a reform ticket which included items such as term limits and a real balanced budget amendment with tax limitation and so on, Ill bet we would win a majority of the convention hands down. Maybe then we could change the Constitution to protect the unborn, insure that citizens have their rights restored on issues such as Amendment Two in Colorado, insure that the court cannot repeal human nature as they have tried to do in the VMI case, and so on.
It is true that we could lose the elections to such a convention. That is always the chance you take when the people vote. But what is the alternative? At least such a Convention would be acting on a vote of the people. The way things stand, our way of life, our Constitution, our culture, our system of government are all being changed by a Court which is responsible to no one. Do we sit here and let it happen? Or do we try to take back our country? My colleague Bill Lind wants a new political party. Well and good, but what will that accomplish if this Court takes all of our rights away in the meanwhile? <P>
Let me make something clear. I revere the work of the Founding Fathers. I think the Constitution they produced has a near sacred quality to it. I believe it produced the best government the world has seen for a century and a half. Remember that these same Founding Fathers provided for the very Constitutional Convention we are discussing. <P>
But lets face it, the era when the Constitution was respected by the Supreme Court has long been over. Several Republican Presidents have tried to appoint so called "strict constructionists" to the court to reverse what has been happening since the New Deal. It hasnt worked. The majority in the VMI case were Republican appointees. <P>
It seems to me that we have to face reality. I want the opponents of a Constitutional Convention to make the case to me that we are better off letting this runaway Court strip us of our heritage on a systematic basis, than we would be if the people had a chance to elect a convention that could express their will.
I think a national election for a convention would be a very serious affair. Ill bet it would be treated that way by the voters and it would be a remarkable opportunity to educate people about what our constitutional form of government should be. Im sorry, but I cant accept the view that we should do nothing. We mourn and we complain and we express regret at what is happening but we do nothing.
I say it is hard for me to imagine that we would be worse off than we are now with a vote of the same people who passed term limits, voted for Amendment Two in Colorado, voted for three strikes and youre out in California, and so on. <P>
Go ahead. Come at me. Lets debate this proposition. It sure is better than sitting around and ringing our hands. <P>

<h2>Clinton Dodges Another Scandal
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>







It is always nice to have friends on the Supreme Court. Bill Clinton had at least four of them which is why he won't be giving depositions this Summer in the Paul Jones sexual harassment suit. The court agreed to take up the question of whether or not a President can face a civil suit during his term in office. Now the court will decide in l997 if the decision by the court of appeals that the lawsuit may proceed is valid. Had the High court simply upheld the decision of the appeals court, the law suit would have gone ahead. <P>

But then we shouldn't be surprised. Bill Clinton's entire history is one of close calls and of voters giving him the benefit of the doubt. And it appears they are about to do so again.<P>

Of all the data I have reviewed on elections, which began with a tutorial the pollster Richard Wirthlin gave me in l970 right after then California Governor Ronald Reagan's re-election, I must say I consider some of the recent findings most remarkable.<P>

The public does understand that President Clinton is less than honest. The public believes that the White House is not telling the truth on filegate. The public believes that Hillary Clinton is lying. The public thinks that Bill Clinton is not a good role model for children. The public thinks that the Clintons have covered up their role in Whitewater. But the public says they want Bill Clinton to be President anyway.<P>

Because I rise at 4:30 every morning, I seldom watch the late night TV shows. But I didn't have to get up Saturday morning so I tuned in for a change. Non stop jokes about Bill and Hillary. Jokes about the President dating while in office. Jokes about the President's friends serving time in prison. Lots of jokes about the First Lady, and that was before the revelations about her conversations with long dead political figures. For example, in comparing music to politics, Jay Leno said that in music Dolly Parton does 9 to 5. But in politics Hillary Clinton will be doing 5 to 9. And so it goes, I am told, night after night and the audience cheers, yet they continue to favor the President's re-election. <P>

What gives here? How could voters believe someone is dishonest, has become a sort of national joke, and yet is favored to win in November.<P>

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson thinks the problem is that the media has so devalued the Presidency that voters now believe it doesn't matter who we present as our leader to the rest of the world. Author Kevin Phillips believes that the voters are so cynical, since they believe all politicians are dishonest, that they simply are inclined to be with the devil they know rather than the devil they don't know.<P>

I think there is a third factor at work. When you quiz voters about why they favor Bill Clinton's re-election, they will tell you that he understands their problems more than his rivals. Others will say he will do more for them than his opponents. I think what we have here is the ultimate conclusion of the "me generation". Bill Clinton is the defender of the status quo as far as government benefits are concerned. So voters are saying "I know this President is dishonest, but what the heck. He'll see to it I don't get hit too hard, so I'm going to support him and frankly I don't care what happens to the rest of the country." <P>

I think back to the young man who asked the l992 Presidential candidates at one of the debates how they were going to take care of him. Instead of telling the kid to go take care of himself, the candidates all fell over themselves telling him what they were going to do for him, but Bill Clinton gave him the most sympathetic answer. <P>

I think my driver John Blackwell, who also drives a taxi part-time in Washington and thus is in touch with the real world, has the right answer. Blackwell points out that over half of the population is now dependent on a government check of one kind or another. "The voters are just looking at their own pockets and thinking that Bill Clinton will keep their checks coming", Blackwell said. I am afraid he is right. <P>

It worked in Roman times. Bread and circuses kept the population happy as their freedoms were taken away. The public doesn't want to face the bad news that we are going bankrupt as a nation. That our debt is robbing us and especially our children and grandchildren blind. In a few more years, there simply won't be any money at all to pay the bills. But, hey, that's after Bill Clinton leaves office after his second term. Why should we worry? <P>

<h2>Hillary Talks to the Dead?
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>



According to Bob Woodward's new book "The Choice", Hillary Clinton held an imaginary conversation with the late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who died in l962. <P>

      Talking to Eleanor was the brainchild of Jean Houston, the Co-Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. <P>

      Now, of course, I wasn't present for that conversation between Hillary and Eleanor, but I can well imagine how it went. <P>

       "Oh, Eleanor", said Hillary," You just can't imagine what it is like being married to a man who almost never tells the truth". Replied Eleanor : "Come, come dear. I know exactly what it is like. In fact, that is why my husband is your husband's role model. And I must tell you it works. Take the Depression, for example. We never really did anything to solve it. In fact, things were worse in l938 than they were in l933 but people THOUGHT we had done something, and that's what is really important. You tell Bill to always sound confident. He should keep on saying things like 'the economy is in the best shape it has been in fifty years'. Now never mind that it isn't true. If he just says it often enough, people will believe it. Just think of how well he did by telling the voters in l992 that the economy was in the worst shape since the Depression. People believed him even though it was an outright lie. It's all in how you say it, my dear".<P>

           The conversation continued with Hillary asking for advice on Bosnia: "I'm not sure what we should do. My husband got us into the war over there. We promised to get our troops out before the election, but there is no way we are going to be able to do that. In fact, we may be there for years. What do we do?" Eleanor Roosevelt answered : "Well, that's a tough one. Franklin got us into the war by ignoring all of the warnings and failing to prevent Pearl Harbor. But you see, Hillary dear, we had Hitler and the Japs. You don't have enemies people can identify with. I'm afraid you have a harder task. About the only thing you can do is to start to remove the troops before the election. Send new ones quietly a few at a time and be ready to deploy lots of them the day after the election. But if people think they are coming home on schedule, they will go ahead and vote for Bill."<P>

             "Now let me ask you Eleanor, you don't mind if I call you Eleanor do you?", Hillary continued, "I feel as if I know you. I've read everything I can about you, I admire you so much." Eleanor replied "It's all right dear. We used to be more formal, but I understand the times, so go ahead call me Eleanor". <P>

               "Well", said Hillary, "I don't quite know how to raise this question. But I know you've had experience. You see Bill hasn't been exactly faithful. I mean dealing with the Paula Jones matter in public and all, how ever did you cope?" Eleanor turned somber. "Well I had one advantage over you. The press didn't pry into our personal lives in those days. The boys who covered Franklin all knew about Lucy. But they didn't say anything. All the things that have been published have seen the light years after Franklin died. In fact, decades after I died. So I never had to cope with the public humiliation of it all."<P>

               But Hillary persisted. "I'm sure you knew. How did you put up with it?" Said Eleanor in reply: "My dear. It is worth it being First Lady, especially when you have your own agenda. I did. Franklin didn't much agree with it. But he was in no position to object. In those days if I had left him, he would have been finished. So he let me do my own thing. I see that Bill lets you do what you want as well. That's good. Any time he gets testy about your doing what you want, you just remind him of what you know and how if you confirmed all the rumors, even in this day in age, he'd be packing for Tennessee". <P>

               "Arkansas", Hillary interrupted. "We're from Arkansas." Eleanor apologized. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I knew it was one of those states down there. Personally I preferred the North."

               Hillary went on : "I have other problems. There is the cattle futures issue and the billings at the Rose law firm and the allegations that I was the go between for people who wanted favors from Bill when he was Governor. Franklin was Governor before he was President. How did you manage these things?" Eleanor shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you. Women didn't hold down those kind of jobs when I was around. I will say this. I did get into trouble from time to time, and I found loss of memory to be an excellent way to handle things. No one can prove you remember anything." <P>

              "I've tried that and so far it has worked. But I'm worried", Hillary confessed. Eleanor broke into a smile. "My dear, so long as you have Bill to lie for you, don't worry. People want to believe their President. And even if his wife is unpopular, and believe me dear I was unpopular, so long as they are comforted by what their President says, they'll keep you right where you are."<P>

                "Even if I am indicted?", Hillary asked. "Well now", said Eleanor, "I don't know about that. I was careful. I never did anything they could get me for later."<P>

                "And what do I do if Bill loses?", Hillary whined. Eleanor looked puzzled. "We never had to cope with that problem. And I don't think you will either. After Bill's term, you run and then the two of you can serve longer than Franklin and me. But don't worry, there is life after the White House. I mean I did commercials for oleo margarine. I'm sure there are plenty of things you can sell. And you can always try writing a book."<P>

                  "I just did", Hillary replied. "I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. It's called 'It Takes a Village.'" <P>

                   "I'm terribly sorry", said Eleanor", But down here we don't hear about many new books. We do see MTV videos a lot, so if you make one of those I'm bound to see it. It is part of our punishment."<P>

                   "I think Bill is about to make one. Do you think he should wear boxers or briefs", Hillary asked. Eleanor pretended not to hear the question. <P>

<h2>For Less Than This Colson Went to Jail
</h2>
<P>
<P>

<P>
What a difference a couple of years makes. On May 22, 1994, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos said this of Craig Livingstone, the then director of the White House office of personnel security: "He does a terrific job. All I know is that anything that has to do with security or logistics  Craig's going to take care of it. You don't have to tell him how to do it, when to do it. Just that it needs to be done, and he does it. And he knows how to cut through the bureaucracy and get things done." Stephanopoulos told this to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Livingstone's home town newspaper.
<P>When confronted with the quote late last week, Stephanopoulos now says, "I don't know him that well. He's a guy that was around. He came up to me one day and said 'my paper's doing this and would you give them a quote' and I said 'sure.' I never worked with him on a campaign but he seemed competent. What can I tell you?"  As to the contention that Livingstone knows how to cut through the bureaucracy, Stephanopoulos says, "I just can't think of a specific thing he handled."
<P>Which version of the truth from the White House do you believe? This is, in fact, THE crucial question as we ponder the meaning of the issue over the hundreds of FBI files on Republicans turned over to the White House. The first spin put out by the White House was that Livingstone and Anthony Marceca were just low level bureaucrats who made a mistake.
<P>Now comes Denis Casey, the former Gary Hart for President campaign coordinator in Western Pennsylvania, who tells us that Livingstone and Marceca were busy gathering dirt on union officials who supported Walter Mondale in 1984.  They were doing this in an effort to try to blackmail the officials into switching to Hart's side to the point where Casey demanded that they be fired. The Casey testimony casts a whole different light on this issue. Livingstone and Marceca, it would seem, were professional political assassins who placed in charge of all of the sensitive material gathered by the FBI on their political opposition.
<P>Now the question is who put them in their positions? Who understood their background? To whom did they report? What did Bill Clinton know and when did he know it?
<P>Attorney General Janet Reno is absolutely right in asking that Independent Counsel Ken Strarr investigate this matter. It is not something which any person connected with the Clinton Administration can be trusted to handle. Let's remember that Chuck Colson, former Nixon White House aide, went to jail for showing a single FBI file to a reporter. We need to know why these FBI files were requested and exactly how the information therein was used.
<P>The fact that George Stephanopoulos could change his story on Livingstone so easily suggests that it is going to be very difficult getting at the truth on this issue. At the heart of the matter is no less than this question: Is the United States still a free nation where reasonable people can disagree and still continue to practice politics, or have we gone down the road to a dictatorship where if our opponents win the election, the rest of us have to live in fear over what comes next? <P>

<h2>Hope for Continued Democracy in Russia
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Russian people had themselves a remarkable election on Sunday. This is not a nation which has a tradition of democracy and yet turnout was higher than for most nations which do not make voting mandatory.
<P>Terrorists tried, with a series of bombs throughout the nation, to intimidate the voters. They did not do so. And while the election wasnt as fair as our elections, since the incumbent Boris Yeltsin controlled much of the television media, there is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that most of the Russian people followed the election.  There is also evidence that most of the Russian people were aware of the positions of the different candidates. 
<P>Since no candidate received the required 50% plus of the vote to be elected outright, there will be a runoff in three weeks between Yeltsin and Communist party boss Gannady Zyuganov. A word about that election in a moment, but first some thoughts on a few of the other candidates who ran.
<P>The surprise candidate who did far better than expected was General Alexander Lebed.   Lebed, on the one hand, is a supporter of democracy and free markets. On the other hand, he promises an authoritarian regime which will get tough with criminals. He often cites Chile under Gen. Pinochet as the appropriate model for Russia to prosper. The outcome in the runoff will probably be determined by where his votes go. Although Lebed is not pro-Communist, many of his supporters favor the Communist candidate Zyuganov because like Gen. Lebed, Zyuganov promises to bring back law and order. 
<P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the big loser in this election. The Russian voters apparently now see him for the fool that he is. He received only about 7% of the vote, a far cry from his showing in the last two parliamentary elections. No doubt he will favor Zyuganov in the runoff. But even if all of his voters go that route, it wont be enough to put Zyuganov over the top. 
<P>The democratic reformers did make somewhat of a showing with their candidate Gregory Yavilinsky who drew more votes than Zhirinovsky. Yavilinsky may reluctantly support Yeltsin in the runoff. Therefore, he could emerge in a new Yeltsin cabinet if there is one. 
<P>Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev got so few votes that he hardly made the charts. This comes as a surprise only to Gorbachev. When Gorbachev left office he was terribly unpopular but he never believed that. His place secure in history as the man who opened up the process in Russia, he would have been well off to try to play the role of elder statesman. Instead he insisted on running because he believed the people were demanding his return. Now his stature is so diminished that it is clear he will never again play a role in Russian politics. 
<P>The runoff election is likely to be very close. First of all, some who voted for other candidates in this round will simply stay home. They feel they have no choice between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Second, supporters of Yavilinsky, Sergei Filatov, and other Democrats will likely, very reluctantly, support Yeltsin. However, there are not enough of those votes to get Yeltsin the extra 15% he needs to win. 
<P>That is where Gen. Lebed comes in. Lebed will likely determine the outcome. If he goes with Yeltsin, he may be able to deliver enough of his vote to make the difference. If he goes with Zyuganov, he could give the Communist leader a real shot at being elected. 
<P>While the 35% of the vote is not exactly a ringing endorsement, it is remarkable that Yeltsin managed to get the most votes in the first round. Yeltsin has had to bear the burden of the enormous changes which have been visited on the Russian people these past five years. At one point he had sunk to only 8% in the public opinion polls and was written off as politically dead. The fact that he now has a fighting chance to win the runoff makes him the real "come back kid" of the democratic process. 
<P>The joke going around Moscow these days is that on the morning after the election, a Yeltsin aide comes to him and says he has good news and bad news.
<P>"Whats the bad news?" Yeltsin asks. 
<P>"The Communists got 55% of the vote," the aide says. 
<P>Yeltsin makes a terrible face and asks, "Then whats the good news?" 
<P>"You got 65% of the vote!" the aide declares.
This election may not have been totally honest, but it is a far cry from the rigged-in-advance kind of elections the Soviets staged for the 70 years they were in power.
<P>Russia took a major step forward in its fledgling democracy with this election. Now the voters in the runoff will have a choice between continuing to edge forward, no matter how erratically, or to try to restore the past. My bet is, that despite all the hardships they are enduring, the Russian people will not try to turn back the clock. <P>

<h2>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
</h2>
<P>
<P>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
<P>What is going on here? On the same day that a federal appeals court rules that the attempt by Congress to keep children from getting access to pornography on the Internet is unconstitutional, baseball owners have deprived Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott of the right to run her own baseball club for two years.
So let me understand this. It is okay to make all sorts of filthy material readily available to kids via the Internet, but the owner of a baseball team doesnt have the right to say stupid things.<P>

Far be it from me to defend the things Marge Schott has said. Most of her remarks display ignorance of history and disregard for the concept of the United States as a melting pot. But so what? Is this a crime?
Baseball owners have made it clear that Schott was disciplined, not for anything she did in connection with the management of the Reds, but because of "insensitivity." Wow! If insensitivity is a crime, some of our greatest athletic coaches will be soon out of jobs.<P>

It seems to me that the game of baseball, once known as Americas favorite pastime, has succumbed to a case of extreme political correctness. Schott has made some highly questionable remarks about Asians, for example. But no charge has been made that she discriminated against any Asian employee who might have worked for the Reds.<P>

It is quite one matter if Marge Schott were charged with discriminating against minorities who worked for her. That, after all, violates the law. But expressing her opinion? Louis Farrakhan has opinions which make me physically ill. No one, however, suggests he isnt entitled to his opinions even though they exude racial and religious hatred. So why pick on Marge Schott?<P>
If patrons are offended by what Schott says, they can boycott Cincinnati Reds games. Thats the American way. But to punish the lady by taking away her property rights because she said "insensitive" things is anything but American.<P>

I am sure that acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig feels good about himself now that he has exhibited this burst of political correctness. Well, he shouldnt.<P>

The precedent Selig has set may well come back to haunt him. Thats because the dictators of political correctness are always changing their standards. Who knows, maybe Selig will one day be deprived of the right to operate the Milwaukee Brewers because of something he says, which by todays standards is perfectly acceptable.<P>

As to Marge Schott, she ought to find the same ACLU lawyers who handled the Internet case. Ill bet the courts would overturn the decision of the baseball owners in a flash if they were given half a chance.<P>

<h2>"Dole Trashes his Base"
</h2>
<P>

<P>Bob Dole must have a death wish. His campaign seemed to get recharged when he announced his resignation from the Senate a few weeks ago. Last weekend he even seemed to forge a compromise on the abortion issue which everyone from Christie Todd Whitman, the liberal Governor of New Jersey, to Pat Buchanan, Doles rival for the GOP nomination, could live with. 
<P>The compromise would have retained the pro-life language in the GOP platform as it has been since 1980, but it would have included in the preamble a declaration of tolerance for opposing views on not only the abortion issue but other matters as well. It was a shrewd compromise which gave something to both sides who are deeply divided on the issue. Dole was widely praised for his leadership on the issue.
<P>No sooner had that matter been put to rest than the presumptive Presidential nominee re-opened the issue. Dole now insists that the so-called "declaration of tolerance" be included, not in the preamble, but as an amendment to the pro-life plank. That would have the effect of rendering the pro-life position of the party as meaningless. Moreover, such a declaration of tolerance wouldnt apply to other issues that divide Republicans including NAFTA and GATT to the assault weapons ban to term limits. Dole denounced Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in ferocious terms, the likes of which he has never unleashed on Bill Clinton. 
<P>This move was taken as a declaration of war by social conservatives. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who has been very friendly to Dole throughout the primary season, told Dole in plain English that what Dole was proposing was unacceptable. Later, a spokesman for the organization suggested that if that position prevails, Christian Coalition will have to sit out the Presidential election. Christian Coalition oriented voters constitute about a quarter of the Republican vote.
<P>As if that werent bad enough. Dole, in his departing speech from the Senate which was carried live by a number of the networks, went through a litany of the programs he had helped to pass during his years in the Senate. Almost all of them were liberal programs such as food stamps and the Americans for Disabilities Act which were fought hard by conservatives. As Steve Moore of the CATO Institute put it : "Some of us have tried hard to find a reason to vote for Bob Dole. By emphasizing terrible programs that we all fought, he is just reminding us why we cant vote for him." 
<P>Indeed Doles speech had that effect among his hard core base. "It is clear that in a Dole Presidency we will get the same policies we are getting under Clinton. The difference is that there will be no resistance to those policies if they are pushed by Dole," one veteran conservative Republican pronounced. "Let him get elected with the votes of liberals," said another.
<P>But Dole wasnt content in just alienating his activist base. He went on to put distance between himself and the freshmen House Members who have been the only breath of fresh air to hit the Republican party in years. In a broadcast interview, Dole said the freshmen had gone too far in the areas of education and the environment. That caused Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to send a message to Dole: "If that is the party line, let me know and Ill go and do something else. I have no intention of running against both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole this year." Neumann, who was elected in the closest race percentage wise in the nation in 1994, said Doles comments have put him in an impossible position politically, one which cannot be sustained in his district. 
<P>The freshmen, the only group to stand up and fight for principle in Washington in recent memory, now find themselves isolated from their party standard bearer. What Dole has done is to play right into the hands of the Democrats who have denounced the freshmen as "extremist." One Dole staffer suggested that Bob Dole wouldnt be all that unhappy if some of the freshmen were defeated for re-election because then Dole wouldnt have to deal with them when he becomes President. 
<P>There is a rule in politics which is almost never violated by successful candidates for President. First, consolidate your base. Then move outward from there. Bob Dole has spent the last week carpet bombing his base. If he wins the Presidency, it is clear that Dole wants to do so without the Christian right, principled economic conservatives, or the tough minded House freshmen. A Dole Presidency under those conditions, which no doubt would be accompanied by a Democratic Congress, would produce more victories for liberalism than Bill Clinton could ever hope to deliver.  As Eric Licht, President of Coalitions for America put it, "Bill Clinton couldnt pass national health insurance, but Bob Dole could well do so." 
<P>I guess I am always open to being shown new ways to put together a winning electoral coalition. If Bob Dole can be elected President by trashing the heart of the party which nominated him, it will truly be an election for the history books. <P>

<h2>Justice Thomas Bests His Detractors
</h2>
<P>

<P>
<P>Three cheers to Justice Clarence Thomas for ignoring my advice. I talked to the Justice last Thursday (he is one of the three I dont want impeached) and suggested that he not appear at an awards ceremony in suburban Washington because it would give too much of a platform to his opponents. Instead, I suggested, he ought to have a special picnic for the eighth grade students at the Supreme Court where he would be  in control of the situation.
<P>You will recall that Justice Thomas was invited by students at the Pullen School to speak at an awards ceremony held at Central High School in Prince Georges County, Maryland. The students had invited him after meeting with him while on a tour of the Supreme Court where he was the only Justice to take the time to visit with them in his chambers.
<P>When school board member Kenneth Johnson heard about the invitation, he went ballistic. Johnson said he would disrupt the appearance if Thomas came to the ceremony. That led the school Superintendent to un-invite Thomas. The school board, however, overruled the Superintendent and re-invited Thomas. Thomas was silent about his intentions right up until the time of the event last night.
<P>Armstrong Williams, the host of "The Right Side" on radio and on NET, and I both talked with Thomas late last week and got the impression that he was seriously considering not making the event. I suggested that if he went, the lead story would be the protest against him and his message to the students would be lost. Thats why I recommended the alternative, which would be a special event just for the students and no one else. Thomas could have legally kept the protesters out of the court.
<P>In retrospect I am glad Thomas ignored my advice. The likes of Kenneth Johnson should not have been able to silence the Justice by promising disruption. In fact, Johnson was able to muster only 80 protesters who were confined to another part of the building. Johnson complained bitterly that because Thomas had hinted, through Armstrong Williams, that he might not come, Johnson couldnt get people to turn out. Maybe Thomas should be in charge of our military strategy as well!
<P>Thomas told the parents and children who, by the way, gave him standing ovations, "I deeply regret having brought some unwanted attention to this wonderful ceremony." In fairness, Thomas didnt cause the attention. His detractors did.
<P>Late last night, following the appearance of Thomas at the ceremony, I did a half hour segment of Armstrong Williams syndicated radio show. Just about every caller was against Thomas. Williams and I did battle with them. The party line against Thomas is that he is a hypocrite because he is the beneficiary of affirmative action programs and now he wants them eliminated. I dispute that theory. Read Justice Thomas opinions. They are among the most profound ever rendered by any Justice.
<P>I do not think Justice Thomas needed affirmative action to get where he is. I think he succeeded on his own merits. One caller insisted, "I dont want Justice Thomas as a role-model for my daughter." I asked him if he wanted Louis Farrakhan as a role model, since the same Kenneth Johnson who promised to disrupt a Thomas appearance sponsored a resolution before the Prince Georges County School Board which would have given teachers and students a day off to participate in the Million Man March. The caller said my point was irrelevant.
<P>There is something to the intensity of some of these callers and protesters which is beyond all reason. Maybe the Rev. Imogene Stewart, a  Black Washington civic activist who appeared on "The Right Side" last Friday, is on to something. She contends that while some in the black community cloak their opposition to Thomas in the rhetoric of affirmative action, what they are really angry about is that he married a white woman.
<P>Well, whatever it is, Thomas showed up his detractors. He proved to be a man of his word. He was gracious and self effacing. He gave the students good advice  such as "remember that good manners will open doors that the best education will not and cannot. Even though you may have strong feelings about matters, that does not give you license to have bad manners." Great advice. Kenneth Johnson can you hear what Justice Thomas said over the clatter of your own rhetoric?<P>

<h2>
Some Freshmen Have Some Problems
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>Ive said a fair amount over the past year and a half about the freshman class of Republicans, that eager group of legislators that swept into office in the Republican landslide year of 1994. As a group they have performed well for the nation. Unfortunately, their elders for the most part were not as eager to make the changes these freshmen felt they had a mandate to make. So the overall record of the 104th Congress is disappointing to say the least, but as a group, the freshmen are not to blame for this unfortunate fact. 
<P>As I say, taken as a group, the freshmen Republicans are an impressive lot. Individually, however, some of them have problems. There is Congressman Jon Christensen of Nebraska, whose campaign centered around family values. He wasnt in office for a year when he filed for divorce and took the unusual step of forcing his wife to file an affidavit that she had been unfaithful. She now is contesting the divorce, saying she doesnt want to break up the marriage. He says it is all over. He is in one tough race for re-election. 
<P>There is, of course, the soap opera like drama of Enid and Joe Waldholtz. Joe is on his way to the federal pen and the big question is whether or not he takes Enid with him. She has already dumped Joe and has even changed her name back to Enid Green, but she wisely chose not to run for the House again. 
<P>Then there is the very strange case of Rep. Wes Cooley of Oregon. Cooley came out of nowhere to win a state senate seat in 1992. When Rep. Bob Smith unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1994, everyone and his mother got in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress. Cooley won a seven way primary with under 30% of the vote and went on to win the rural conservative district rather handily with 57% of the vote. 
<P>Cooley is as affable a person as you would want to meet. You can well imagine him operating a country store, sitting around the cracker barrel and spinning tales. The problem for Cooley is that he is a Congressman now and people take what he says for real. 
<P>Cooley already has admitted that he lied about being married to the woman he now calls his wife. It seems that if the couple wasnt married, she could still collect widows benefits from a previous marriage. But after he got elected to the state senate, Cooley thought perhaps they ought to regularize things. He had what was called an anniversary party, but it would appear that when he was said to be renewing his vows, he was, in fact, actually getting married. We dont know for sure because Cooley has gone to the extraordinary length of having the date of his marriage kept sealed by the courts. 
<P>Cooleys biggest problem stems from his claim that he served in a special unit of the military during the Korean war. He claims that the Pentagon lost all of his records. He also claims that every single person with whom he served is now dead. The unit was a secret one, he says, so he cant disclose anything about it. When asked to at least recite some recollections from his days in the service, Cooley says his memory fails him. 
<P>Cooley blames all of his troubles on the news media and left wing opponents. Now lest you think I have taken up unsubstantiated claims by a media out to get the Oregon Congressman, consider this: Coalitions for America, a lobby organization of which I am the national chairman, holds a weekly luncheon in this building which is attended by Members of Congress and various conservative and pro-family groups. Among the attendees of this luncheon from time to time has been Rep. Wes Cooley. So when the allegations against him broke, I expected that he would want to give his side of the story. <P>
Instead, Cooley said nothing. Finally I called on him and asked him if there wasnt something he wanted to tell his colleagues and philosophical allies. He said that all of the charges against him were false and made up by his enemies. I told him that if such charges were really false that we were the sort of people who would go to bat for him, we just needed to be equipped with the facts. He promised he would supply them just as he promised he would hold press briefings to refute the charges against him. No facts were produced and no such press briefings were held. <P>
Lets be perfectly candid about it. Wes Cooley is lying. Former Rep. Bob Smith, who campaigned hard for Cooley after he won his primary, now says he is embarrassed by Cooley and has called on him to step down. Cooley says he will let the voters decide. They will indeed. His Democratic opponent now has a commanding lead in a district which is solidly conservative and Republican.<P>
The fact that Enid Green and Cooley vote right is beside the point. Members of Congress need to be role models. People in the community should be able to look up to them as prototype citizens.<P>
Enid Green at least had the decency to retire, although she should have resigned from her seat because she clearly obtained it by fraud. Cooley deceived the voters of Oregon by making exaggerated claims about his service to his country, about his education, about his marital status, and who knows what else. Cooley, having just won renomination for second term, should now step down and permit the Republican party to name some one else to take his place. By the way, in his district more people voted for others on the primary ballot than those voting to renominate Cooley.<P>
This is clearly a case where "None of the Above" or NOTA is badly needed. These conservative voters should have an additional choice between Cooley and his Democratic opponent who will vote against their wishes. They ought to have the chance to vote for "None of the Above" and void the election. But since NOTA is not on the Oregon ballot, it is now up to Cooley. Former Congressman Smith says now that he has spoken out against Cooley, no doubt Cooley will label him as part of a great conspiracy against him. Thats what Cooley told us at our lunch  that a great conspiracy was out to get him. Sorry, Congressman. The only thing that is out to get you are the lies you have told, the stories you have made up, the deceptions you have concocted. If you care at all for your country, instead of just yourself, then resign.  Resign so that your district, as conservative as it is, doesnt contribute to the possibility of the Democrats re-taking the Congress. <P>
After so many years of telling so many lies, you may believe all of your own stories, Congressman. Thats fine. Retire to your ranch where no doubt the dumb animals will give you the attention you deserve.

<h2>
Third-party Candidate Would Force the Issues
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm has announced that he is joining the Reform Party of Ross Perot and has suggested that if Perot himself does not run for President, he (Lamm) just might do so. I hope he does. Not that I could vote for the former Governor of my adopted state. His positions on some of the social issues preclude that. But Dick Lamm is one very forthright and candid fellow. 
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Lamm is willing to frankly discuss the need to get entitlements under control. Dick Lamm doesnt mind touching the so called third rail of American politics, namely Social Security. Governor Lamm is willing to tackle the enormous problem of the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates. Lamm will discuss, while the others will not, the effect that our crushing national debt will have on future generations. Governor Lamm is not afraid to raise the conflict of interest questions which plague both political parties. He may be wrong on some things, but he is one honest fellow. 
<P>Dick Lamm, barring some remarkable turn of events, wont be elected President if he is out there running on a third party ticket. But Dick Lamm can do an immense service to the American public by forcing the major parties to face up to the issues he raises. True, Perot has raised some of the same issues. But Perot is regarded as an eccentric. Lamm is non-threatening, yet highly articulate. He was very popular among voters in both parties when he was Governor of Colorado, even though he frequently said the unthinkable. 
<P>Numbers, charts, graphs, and even the reality of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare have not forced the major parties to face the truth. Americas debt is killing its future. But Dick Lamm, if he turns out to be the Reform Party candidate, will force the debate which America should have been having on these issues since 1960, indeed since the 1930s. 
<P>America badly needs this debate. Our future depends on it. Thats why members of all parties, regardless of philosophy, ought to be cheering on Governor Lamm. If he runs, and raises the issues the other candidates refuse to face, the entire political landscape will change. Then maybe, just maybe, the 1996 election will have a lasting impact. <P>

<h2>
Virginia Primary a Test of Loyalty
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A visitor from another state who might have happened upon one of Senator John Warners television commercials, aimed at voters in next Tuesdays Virginia Republican primary, would probably think that Warner is the conservative candidate. The Warner commercial talks about tradition and how proud he is to be a part of Virginias venerable conservatism. But the record of three term Senator John Warner suggests he is anything but a true blue conservative. 
<P>Warners election was a fluke. In 1978, the newly found conservative majority in the Republican party nominated the young, articulate, and very attractive party chairman Dick Obenshain for the Senate. Obenshain seemed to be on the road to victory. But Obenshain was tragically killed when his light plane crashed in the Virginia countryside, leaving the party without a nominee for the Senate at the ninth hour of the election content. John Warner, who had spent a huge amount of money in trying to win the nomination, but who was gracious in defeat and had pledged to support Obenshain, was drafted as the GOP nominee.  
<P>Warners campaign was going nowhere and the conservatives who had picked Obenshain declined to support him. My longtime friend Dick Scaife of Pittsburgh called me and asked if I would put together a meeting of conservatives with Warner. I did so on October 7th of 1978. It was a contentious meeting which lasted two and a half hours. Warner ended up pledging to vote conservative on every issue that was raised from the Equal Rights Amendment to abortion and the SALT treaty with the Soviets. Conservatives got behind Warner and he pulled off the closest senate election in Virginia history. 
<P>Warner kept most of his promises during his first term although he had to be reminded of them from time to time. When he came up for re-election in 1984, he hardly had opposition. It was during his second term that he moved to the left. He opposed, for example, Ronald Reagans nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. On many crucial votes, he could be counted on by the liberals if they needed him. When he won his third term in 1990, nearly unopposed, he decided to go the distance. Up to that point, Warner had pretty much stayed out of Republican politics in the state of Virginia. 
<P>Looking at himself as invincible, the onetime husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, waded in knee deep. When conservatives prevailed and nominated home school association executive Mike Ferris as their candidate for Lt. Governor, Warner refused to support him. Ferris lost narrowly to Don Beyer, the man who will be the Democratic standard bearer for Governor next year. 
<P>Then when some conservatives put forth the candidacy of Oliver North for the Senate against Senator Chuck Robb, Warner backed Norths intra-party rival, former Reagan budget director Jim Miller. Miller lost narrowly to North. So Warner went out and recruited former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an Independent. Coleman drew just enough votes away from North to send Chuck Robb back to the Senate for another six years. So Miller, who had enjoyed Warners support in 1994, decided that was too much for him and declared his candidacy against Warner.
<P>Warners incumbency has drawn big bucks and Miller has not had the funds to run an aggressive campaign. Still, many conservatives are very bitter about Warners betrayal of their candidates. Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term to that post last week-end at a state convention, said that if the Republicans re-nominate Warner, "we ought to take up a collection and erect, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, a statue of Benedict Arnold." 
<P>Warner, for his part, is openly courting Democrats to vote for him in the primary. Virginia has no party registration so anyone may vote in this primary. Polls show Warner ahead by a large margin but the Warner folks are worried. Moral indignation against Warner runs so high among activists that if they turn out and Warner supporters take his election for granted, Miller just might pull an upset.
<P>Miller is a solid down the line conservative but a colorless campaigner who has failed to excite people. Warner enjoys so much support among Democrats, that the Democratic nominee for the Senate, Mark Warner (no relation) is given no chance to win. 
<P>Still the contest in Virginia boils down to this: in this last half of the last decade of the 20th Century, is loyalty still a virtue?  Many Republicans say that Warner turned his back on them and his party and he has no right now to turn to them to seek another term in the Senate. When the votes are counted on Tuesday, it will be known if dancing with the girl who brought you to the party is still in vogue or if Republicans prefer someone who is more loyal to the Democrats and to himself than to the party whose label he reluctantly wears.<P>
