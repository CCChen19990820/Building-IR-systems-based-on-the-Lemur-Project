The 'More So' Minority</H1>
<P><STRONG>Knoxville's Jewish community is getting new attention from its Christian neighbors</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Wendy Lowe Besmann</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Four days to Passover and I'm working through a bad case of holiday panic. My body cranks out leg lifts in an exercise class while two or three brain compartments independently obsess over the menu for seder. ("Mom's doing matzoh ball soup, Judy made chopped liver, Diane's got carrot tsimmes.... We still need a green vegetable. I have to round up three more chairs.")
<P>Seder--in case you didn't catch the Rugrats Passover Special on TV--is an elaborate Jewish service held around the dinner table at the start of this major spring holiday, also known as the Feast of Freedom. ("I can't believe Kroger is charging six bucks for a lousy jar of gefilte fish.") Perhaps the most widely celebrated ritual in the Hebrew calendar, it commemorates the Exodus from Egypt with songs, prayer, deep symbolism, children's games, four cups of wine, and enough high-cholesterol food to neutralize a dozen exercise classes. The Hebrew word means "order," which refers to the 15-part structure of rituals laid down centuries ago to anchor an often exuberant gathering of family and friends. ("Susan's brisket, my roast chicken, chocolate nut cake, macaroons ... need to check the tablecloth for wine stains from last year.")
<P>Maybe I've started to mumble out loud, because during the cool-down period a lady on the next mat squirms around to look at me.
<P>"Are you Jewish?" she asks politely. "We're doing a seder at the Unitarian Church and I don't know where to find kosher wine. Plus I'm in charge of an entree. Do you think chicken rolled in chopped pecans is Pesachdik?" 
<P>Pesach is the Hebrew word for Passover. You pronounce the "ch" with a kind of ragged, gargling huh-sound, as if you were exhaling inside Darth Vader's helmet. Something Pesachdik is fit to eat on Passover, which means it contains no grains or leavens except ground-up versions of matzoh, the crunchy, rather tasteless cracker that replaces bread, rice and legumes in our diet for the eight days of the festival.
<P>Just a few days earlier, my husband, Ted, was invited to speak about Passover at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension. As any good Bible student knows, the Last Supper was a Passover seder. It might have been quite similar to our modern version, minus chopped liver and matzoh ball soup. 
<P>Until recently, the only Jewish holiday that got much outside attention was Hanukkah, a rather minor celebration boosted by its proximity to Christmas. Now more and more churches are asking local Jews to help them understand Passover rituals. Rabbi Howard Simon of Temple Beth El put on a full seder down at John XXIII this year. It was "a marvelous sharing experience," he says.
<P>I'm sniffing a trend. Why is Christian Knoxville suddenly so curious about Jewishness? For 135 years, the Jews in this town have been a tiny, middle-class minority which practiced a cycle of ancient traditions while trying not to look too different.
<P>"We're just like everyone else in Knoxville, only more so," quips Knoxville native Barbara Bernstein, a longtime civic volunteer whose grandfather was the first full-time rabbi in the city more than a century ago. 
<P>Still, the neighbors seem remarkably intrigued by that little bit more so.
<P>"Especially in the South, there's an enormous interest in Jewish origins," says Rabbi Arthur Weiner of Heska Amuna Synagogue, who gets invited to speak with church groups 20 or 30 times a year. "Christians are beginning to look at their own roots, wanting to understand Judaism as it existed at the time of Jesus. They seem to love the symbolism. They love knowing that Jews face east to pray because it's the direction of Jerusalem. Or the fact that we put a stone on the grave when we visit, in order to show the dead are being remembered."
<P>"At least once a day, somebody calls up with a question about Judaism," puts in Marian Jay, office administrator for Heska Amuna. "Most are good Christians who came across something while reading their Bibles, but you also get your wackos--you know, like 'Just a minute, I'm gonna fax you something about the Messiah.' One guy wanted me to check our gift shop for a copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls"--possibly the Jewish equivalent of asking for Prince Albert in a can. 
<P>Conrad Koller, executive director of Arnstein Jewish Community Center and Knoxville Jewish Federation, says he frequently answers queries about our relationship with Israel, "but I've also been asked when the next sacrifice is being held" Just for the record, burnt offerings stopped about 1,900 years ago.
<P>Many questioners wonder about the strong sense of family and community that seems to bind Jews together, despite a propensity to argue about practically everything. (Classic Jewish Joke number one: President Dwight D. Eisenhower is talking to Israel's then-Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. "Listen, do you think it's easy being president of 170 million people?" Ben Gurion shrugs. "You call that hard? I'm prime minister of two million prime ministers!")
<P>"We're monotheistic, not monolithic," says Rabbi Simon. His congregation is the Reform Jewish Temple Beth El, whose building stands on the leafy Church Row section of Kingston Pike. My family belongs to Heska Amuna Synagogue, the Conservative congregation at the other end of Church Row (led by Arthur Weiner, who is leaving this summer for a pulpit in New Jersey).
<P>Unlike the various sects of Christianity, "Temple" and "Synagogue" Jews mainly differ on matters of practice, not doctrine. Halacha, the ancient system of Jewish law that governs both ethical and ritual conduct, is generally viewed by the Conservative movement as binding on a Jew's behavior, yet open to modern interpretation. The Reform movement considers halacha more of a guideline to be applied according to common sense. The strictest constructionists are Orthodox Jews, who cleave to the most traditional practices. But those few Orthodox willing to live in an isolated spot like Knoxville make do with Heska Amuna.
<P>In reality, its gets even fuzzier. For example, kashrut, the system of Jewish dietary laws, is a key tenet of the Conservative movement and is strictly observed in the synagogue's kitchen. Yet only a few dozen Heska Amuna families maintain kashrut at home, so they coordinate a regular purchase of kosher meat from a butcher in Atlanta. The weekly Sabbath services of both congregations actually follow the same structure, carved out centuries ago. Yet a visitor to Temple Beth El's Friday evening service will recognize more surface elements in common with church worship--an organ, a choir, a liturgy of about 90 minutes with a lot of prayers in English.
<P>Those who come to Heska Amuna's Saturday morning Shabbat services find a more exotic experience. Each man and some of the women wear a small head covering known as a kipah and the fringed prayer shawl called a tallit. Most of the service is chanted according to traditional melodies in Hebrew. This davvening (recitation of prayers) is accomplished by some with a traditional back and forth swaying motion that seems to be practiced by each to his own internal tempo.
<P>You also can't help noticing that the services are long--they last all morning and are therefore conducted with surprising informality. People feel free to wander in and out during various parts of the service and hold whispered conversations in the pews. Non-Jews invited to one of Heska Amuna's Bar or Bat Mitzvah ceremonies (the ritual coming-of-age for a 13-year-old boy or girl) are often cued by considerate Jewish friends to arrive an hour after the start of services, just as many congregants do.
<P>Temple Beth El is among the oldest Jewish congregations in the Southeast, founded during the Civil War when the death of Confederate soldier Joseph Schwab spurred a handful of German Jewish merchants to purchase land for a burial ground. This is the way most American Jewish communities began--as a mutual aid society to care for the sick, feed the indigent, and bury the dead. Shortly thereafter, Knoxville's Hebrew Benevolent Society began to hold worship services, under the lay ministry of a merchant named Julius Ochs. He moved away to help his son Adolph run the Chattanooga Times. Of course, Adolph eventually bought another struggling paper, The New York Times, and founded a publishing dynasty. Later, when the renamed Temple Beth El bought its first building on Vine Street, he paid for the ark that held its Torah, the sacred handwritten scrolls of the Bible.
<P>Heska Amuna was started in the 1890s by Eastern Europeans who practiced more traditional ways. The name of the synagogue is actually a grammatical error made by its immigrant founding fathers. They may have been unsure how to transliterate the Hebrew words Chazkei Emunah or "strongholders of the faith" into the Roman alphabet when they applied to the state for a charter. Once made legal, however, the name Heska Amuna stuck.
<P>During the first half of the century, small Jewish merchants gradually became a fixture on the downtown scene. Mary Lippner's father and uncle ran a butcher shop on Market Square--one side for kosher meat, one side for the Gentiles. A number of Jews ran small clothing or food businesses in the surrounding counties, so Barbara Bernstein's grandfather had to serve as the circuit-riding mohel, traveling around to perform the ritual circumcision of eight-day-old male infants. Endorsement letters from local Christian doctors certified that he did this surgery with "Haste and Care, resulting well."
<P>Though Max Arnstein had a fancy department store on the corner of Market and Union, it wasn't a wealthy community. In the late '20s, Rabbi A. J. Robinson supplemented his meager pay by running a used plumbing supplies store in what is now the Old City (his son Mitchell later turned it into Modern Supply, the wholesale bath and kitchen distributor with branches in four East Tennessee cities). It was a small, companionable community of several hundred, most of whom were related to each other. Barbara Bernstein's father, Ben Winick, was among the first to earn a law degree. He once covered the Scopes trial as a stringer for a Yiddish daily newspaper, writing back to his future wife, "From the look of things, this trial is going down in history."
<P>His personal trajectory was the shape of things to come. Courtesy of growing affluence and the G.I. Bill, the sons of Knoxville Jewish retailers went off to college and came home professional. Education has always been a top priority among the Jews. Heska Amuna built its educational wing before its sanctuary, and Jewish kids attend after-school Hebrew classes several times a week from the elementary grades to the teens. 
<P>Today, the vast majority of Knoxville Jewish households contain doctors, lawyers, engineers, middle managers--a cross-section of American meritocracy. The last remaining downtown Jewish businesses are Harold's Deli on Gay Street, the nearby Abrams' Mill Agent store, and Nathan Diftler's jewelry store in the bottom floor of the old Arnstein Building.
<P>The expansion of TVA, the Oak Ridge labs and the university brought even more Jewish professionals to Knoxville, bringing the population up to the low thousands. At least two-thirds weren't born here.
<P>"People used to move to the area because they had a relative here," says Mary Linda Schwarzbart, whose grandfather sold dry goods in Mechanicsville from the '20s to the '60s. "Now the educational level is much higher and they come to Knoxville for jobs. It changes how the community needs to function. Jewish friends end up creating their own extended families because sharing life-cycle celebrations is so important to us."
<P>"You get a lot of pushes and pulls for your volunteer time, for your financial support, for your attendance," says Rody Cohen, director of the Kids on the Block program for Child and Family Services. She serves on the Knoxville Jewish Federation's social services committee, which oversees the needs of the Jewish aged or distressed. With her husband, Neil, a UT law professor, she has also organized a group of a dozen Jewish couples to serve meals at the Volunteer Ministry once a month. 
<P>In fact, the roster of Jewish boards and committees in this town underlines the old adage that the best way to get something done is to ask a busy person. You see names such as Mary Beth Leibowitz, the Knox County Criminal Court judge; Marty Iroff, the drug and violence prevention specialist for Knox County elementary schools; Janice Woycik, who runs the employee assistance programs for UT Medical Center; and Barb Levin, the Madisonville doctor who has just been named national rural health provider of the year.
<P>"I've had people ask me why Jews are so active for causes such as HIV research," says Janet Gurwitch, the assistant district attorney who heads the domestic violence unit. "I think it's because we tend to be participatory rather than passive. We come from a community that organizes to get things done." Tikkun Olam--the repair or healing of the world--is the most basic tenet of the covenant with God, points out Rabbi Weiner. "The Jew's mission is to make the world a better place." We don't all do it, but it's definitely part of the programming.
<P>For a group with so many prominent professionals, the Knoxville Jewish community is remarkably quiet in the public forum.
<P>"We wield a considerable amount of influence for our small numbers, but it's always done very quietly," says Arnold Schwarzbart, a nationally known Judaic artist who moved here as a child after his parents survived the Holocaust. When something burns our communal toast--like the school board scheduling makeup days on Saturday--the community relations committee tends to make a discreet phone call or two. "There's a certain feeling of not wanting to rock the boat. It's just not the way people do things here." 
<P>At times, however, the audacity known as chutzpah will bubble up. Downtown lawyer Bernie Bernstein made the AP wire in the late '70s when he chained a mobile sign protesting Soviet anti-Jewish policies to the front of the City-County Building.
<P>Still, the social and political frictions that plague other Jewish communities are mostly absent here. Jews get along well though uneventfully with the African-American community and now maintain genial ties to the local Palestine Ramallah Club. The small Palestinian community holds an annual friendship picnic with Oak Ridge and Knoxville Israelis. They also joined forces with the Knoxville Jewish Federation to sponsor a Concert for Peace at Jubilee Community Arts. Jim Harb of the Ramallah Club remembers that one rousing set by an Arab band stirred a Palestinian woman to start dancing. She grabbed the hand of the Jewish woman next to her and soon a snaking line of dancers was going up the aisle. "It was a transformative moment," he says simply.
<P>There's a vintage joke about the autumn High Holy Days, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, when so many Jews show up for services that tickets are usually sold to ensure that infrequent attendees pull their financial weight. A man shows up at synagogue but doesn't have a ticket. The usher doesn't want to let him in. "But I have to deliver a vital message to Mr. Rosenberg who's inside," the man pleads. "It's a matter of life and death!" "Okay, go in," says the usher. "But don't let me catch you praying!""
<P>In reality, those who can't afford tickets are always included, but the joke represents a kind of fond pragmatism about spiritual matters. "It's like when I'm doing my pots, about 10 percent of the work is throwing pottery and the rest is cleanup and glazing," says Arnold Schwarzbart. "In Knoxville, being a committed Jew has more to do with the welfare of the community and the maintenance of that welfare than religious fervor."
<P>That helps to explain why a few hundred other Knoxvillians of Jewish origin may never join any congregation but keep a strong sense of identification with the group.
<P>"When there's a threat to the Jewish people, unaffiliated Jews come out of the woodwork," says UT microbiology professor Jeff Becker, one of about 65 Jewish faculty members who formed a loose coalition to respond to an anti-Semitic episode on campus several years ago.  Some of these faculty got involved in creating a chair of Judaic studies, currently filled by Professor Gilya Gerda Schmidt and partially funded by the Knoxville Jewish community.
<P>Even without a cause or crisis, the urge to hang together runs deep. Jewishness is not a religion nor even ethnicity, but rather a "peoplehood." Whether we're drawn into this circle by birth, marriage or choice, it's a complex, multidimensional way of belonging that affects every aspect of life, from humor and food to sex and social justice. (Classic Jewish Joke number three: An American banker who was Jewish by birth converted to Christianity. One day he was walking with a friend who was a hunchback. They passed a synagogue. "You know, I used to be a Jew," commented the banker. "What a coincidence," replied his friend. "I used to be a hunchback.")
<P>Very few Jews in America actually convert to Christianity, but their ranks are being dramatically altered by intermarriage. Only a generation ago, an observant Jewish family might actually observe the formal mourning period--known as "sitting Shiva"--for a family member who married out of the faith. Yet a recent population study estimated that more than 50 percent of all first-time Jewish marriages are to non-Jews. Some of this reflects a loosening of attitudes, but another cause is low numbers. Here in Knoxville, Jewish teenagers socialize together in various youth groups but tend not to date each other.
<P>"It's too small a pool," sighs Nancy Becker, education director of Heska Amuna. "They grow up alongside each other, so they're more like brothers and sisters." Intermarriage has also created an influx of converts, known as "Jews by choice," who tend to be some of the most involved members of temple and synagogue.
<P>Paradoxically, many born Jews who weren't part of formal congregations in their previous places of residence join temple or synagogue after moving to Knoxville. They crave Jewish culture and also realize that this a church-going town, where membership in a house of worship is considered the respectable thing to do. "Especially if you have children, they have to belong to something," Barbara Bernstein points out.
<P>This point was brought home to me four years ago, when our family home burned to the ground. My neighbor Susan Kaplan--who's married to a Jew and cooks the aforementioned brisket every year for our seder--quickly called Marian Jay, who knows how to spread news with lightning speed through an informal calling chain. Susan and my friend Ellen Kern--who is married to a non-Jew but is highly involved in synagogue life--mobilized teams of Jewish community members for a kitchen shower in which our friends literally crammed somebody's living room full of donated household goods. 
<P>The committee charged with resettling several dozen Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union scrounged through its warehouse to loan me temporary furniture. Meanwhile, Jews I didn't even know sent me checks for $18. Known as "giving chai," such cash donations are customarily made in multiples of $18 because in the Hebrew mystic numerology system, 18 corresponds to the letters which spell chai, or life.
<P>The Arnstein Jewish Community Center building on Deane Hill Drive, which looks like an aging brick elementary school, is the overworked forum where synagogue, temple, and unaffiliated Jews come together.
<P>"We're the most visible institution in town because so many non-Jews use the preschool, the pool, the tennis courts and the summer day camp," observes its current president Karen Robinson. "And when Jewish people are thinking about moving to town, this is usually the first place they visit."
<P>Her board is determined to spruce up the place, but it wages an uphill battle against cranky plumbing, the vicissitudes of messy toddlers and a constant parade of community. The cluttered office upstairs doubles as the headquarters of the Knoxville Jewish Federation, an umbrella organization which provides a variety of social services as well as being a kind of mini-United Way to raise and distribute funds to Jewish agencies here and in Israel.
<P>I'm standing outside the AJCC on a warm Sunday in early May, so gorgeous that people have nearly stopped kvetching about what a lousy spring it's been. School buses decorated with blue and white Israeli flags are bringing Sunday school children to the Jerusalem 3000 festival, a carnival to celebrate three millennia of King David's golden city.
<P>The kids on the bus are belting out a Jewish summer camp standard with hand motions that gradually fast-forward into chaos: Do-veed, Melech Yisrael, Chai, Chai, V' Ka Yom ("David, King of Israel, lives, lives today"). They spill out like unruly puppies into a broad island of grass and big trees surrounded by the standard West Knoxville flock of minivans.
<P>The Sunday school kids are claimed by their parents, fueled with strips of 25-cent tickets, then turned loose on the homemade ring toss and beanbag games, the inflatable moon walk, the arts and crafts tent, and a giant WJXB bumblebee, sweltering graciously in his fuzzy stripes. It looks like any other community fair, but I know the hot dogs are definitely kosher, and the ladies selling those homemade cabbage-potato rolls are some of several dozen immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in the former Soviet Union to be resettled here with the help of Knoxville Jews.
<P>I wave to Josh Gettinger, the family practitioner who now serves as our local mohel and also teaches kids to read in Hebrew from the Torah. He's eating a plate of goodies under a sun canopy lent by Rose Mortuary, the local funeral home that buries all the Jewish dead. There they are, just a couple of the everyday elements that bind a tiny minority together from the cradle to the grave.
<P>One final Jewish story: Heaven, say the sages, is like a table spread with all the most delicious foods in the universe. Everyone sits around the table, but their arms don't bend at the elbow, so none can reach his or her own mouths. Hell, add the sages, is also like a table spread with delicious foods, crowded with people whose arms don't bend at the elbow. What's the difference between the two? In heaven, people feed each other.

The Silent Community</H1>
<P><STRONG>As the debate about mainstreaming vs. ASL rages, a culture and a historic Knoxville institution are at stake</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Val Pendergrast</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>The excitement is palpable inside the First Baptist Church as proud parents beam and friends chat animatedly, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the graduates-to-be. Small boys cut up and make faces from the balcony; spectators look around curiously, seeking anyone familiar. 
<P>The melodic strains of "Praise Ye the Lord of Hosts" cue the processional and the graduates appear, resplendent in purple robes and mortarboards, tassels swinging with each step up the aisle. It's a graduation like any other--a rite of passage marking the beginning of adulthood for the 11 young men and women of the Class of 1996. Just like other high school graduates, some will go to college, some will go to work; some will marry, some will embark on rewarding careers; some will succeed, some will fail.
<P>But in at least one respect, these graduates are unlike most others. These nine young men and two young women are graduates of the Tennessee School for the Deaf, a residential school were they have spent much of their lives learning a language all their own--a language that binds them tightly together, yet in many ways isolates them from the hearing world.
<P>This language, American Sign Language, and the setting in which it is taught, residential schools for the deaf, have pitted many in the deaf community against those who believe in mainstreaming--educating deaf children in public schools with their hearing peers.
<P>The dichotomy of a language that both unites and separates reflects a deeper concern and raises questions that are not easily answered: Does sign language isolate the deaf from the hearing world? Is the concept of separate-but-equal attainable in a hearing world for those who cannot hear? Are the deaf truly handicapped, or have they been unfairly labeled by a society that cannot--or will not--speak their language? Can the deaf attain what hearing people consider a normal quality of life if they use a language different from their surrounding community? And perhaps the most basic question of all: What constitutes a normal life?


<H3>Normal Is as Normal Does</H3>

<P>Sheri T. Moran bristles at the suggestion that she is handicapped, and dismisses, with a wave of her hand, the politically correct term "hearing-impaired" as well. Instead, Moran writes carefully, she is deaf with a capital D. While "deaf" (small "d") is an audiological term that indicates she cannot hear, "Deaf" defines her culture as well as her community. Hearing-impaired, she explains, is too vague to suit her. 
<P>"Impaired means brokenness," Moran says, and "our ears are obviously not broken."
<P>Moran, a graduate of the Tennessee School for the Deaf and Maryville College, and now a 36-year-old American Sign Language instructor at Maryville College, has little patience with the arrogance and ignorance of hearing people who consider the Deaf pitiful, helpless and handicapped. Indeed, there is nothing in her manner that hints of handicap: She is bright, charming and mischievous, and exudes an air of self-confidence many would envy.
<P>Moran's deafness was not detected until she was two because she mimicked the movements of her identical--yet hearing--twin sister. Born to hearing parents, she read lips and learned to speak with her family until, as a teenager, she rebelled against the hearing culture and asked them to learn to sign. Her frustration with their unwillingness to learn her language is written on her face. Her sister is the only one of all the family who can sign--even her mother knows only the basics.
<P>But Moran doesn't seem to sweat the small stuff. Her life is full, she emphasizes, and she has no desire to hear. She rattles off a list of Deaf activities and confesses that of all her close friends, only one can hear--her husband of eight years. 
<P>Her language is slightly stilted in translation, as though English is her second language. And with good reason: English is her second language; ASL (American Sign Language) is her first. She relaxes noticeably when Peggy--her secretary/interpreter--appears and she is able to express herself in her native tongue. Leaning back comfortably in her chair, she signs with the grace and fluidity of a conductor leading an orchestra. Her vocabulary, like her face, is rich and expressive. The only thing missing is sound.

<P>It was Latin that convinced Michael Prochaska to stick to signed English instead of learning ASL. Although the 31-year-old newlywed attended the Tennessee School for the Deaf for three years before transferring to public schools, he was taught the Rochester method of sign (signed English and fingerspelling) instead.
<P>"When I started junior high and started taking Latin," he writes, "I figured it'd be easiest to learn straight English so I'd have to deal with only two languages." He reads lips "a little in context" but does most of his communicating with the hearing world via pen and paper. 
<P>The fifth of seven children, Prochaska was born deaf after his mother contracted rubella when she was pregnant. Having six siblings "helped a lot in terms of education" since all the kids attended the same schools.
<P>Prochaska is a testament to the merits of mainstreaming. He graduated from Bearden High, attended Haverford College--a small Quaker liberal arts college outside of Philadelphia--and spent a couple of years at UT studying English. He is married to a hearing woman, and works with hearing people exclusively at Lawson-McGhee Library, where he was hired after leaving Whittle Communications about three years ago. Mainstreaming was good for him, he says.
<P>"I feel like I've benefited from it, in that I had more access to more advanced education, i.e. Latin, and advanced placement classes in high school, so I had a more comprehensive education than I might have if I'd gone on to TSD." But he's quick to point out that he's not against schools for the deaf. "TSD works for many people, and mainstreaming works for some others. I feel like I was in the latter category."

<P>Prochaska is in sharp contrast to Mark Allen, a 47-year-old biology, physics and chemistry teacher at TSD. Allen, who spent most of his youth at an "oral" school in Michigan learning to read lips and speak, says "the deaf should be here (at TSD) for social reasons." Like many other deaf people, Allen firmly believes that deaf kids should be educated with other deaf kids and taught by deaf teachers exclusively. "If you want to learn about deafness, learn from us," he says emphatically. 
<P>Allen, who went deaf at three months after a bout with spinal meningitis, wasn't raised with sign--a teacher once told his mother that signing was a sin--but has used it since coming to TSD nearly 20 years ago. He's married to a deaf woman, has a seven-year-old hearing daughter, loves to camp, go out to dinner and the movies, and has a black belt in karate. Like most other deaf people, he doesn't think of himself as handicapped; and he, too, lives a normal life. 

<H3>Hearing Children in a Deaf World</H3>

<P>Though not deaf themselves, children of the deaf are more than honorable members of the Deaf community. They're considered Deaf because they sign. Despite their physical ability to hear, Children of Deaf Adults (CODAs) who use ASL are permitted entry into an otherwise closed society. Signing is as natural as breathing to them, and constitutes the only significant difference in their upbringing.
<P>Alice McBride Lowe, Marty Marine, Larry Mynatt and Mary Ellen Carr Vaughn, now in their 30s and early 40s, laugh and tell stories about their Saturday nights at the Silent Club--a weekly outing for deaf parents and their deaf and hearing children. The roughhousing and rambunctious kids were barely aware their families were different.
<P>The members of the Silent Club have no memory of their first signs. All four signed before they could speak, and they took on the responsibility of interpreting for their parents. Mary Ellen was three when her parents installed their first phone; as an only child, she became the family receptionist and message relayer.
<P>Life at the Carr home was little different from any other. Mary Ellen relates matter-of-factly--her father was a mechanic at Reeder's Chevrolet and her mother was a sports fanatic. They watched TVs--one on top of the other (one of the perks of growing up in a deaf household)--read the paper and went out to dinner like most families. She was not aware that her family was different until her first year of school.
<P>"I had three teachers who got me up in front of the class--singled me out--and said, 'Everybody, this is Mary Ellen. Her parents are deaf and dumb. Doesn't she talk good?'
<P>Confused and embarrassed when one teacher asked, "How do you all live? Where do you get money?" she stammered and answered indignantly, "My daddy works! My momma and daddy went to school!"
<P>Marty suffered through a similar experience that resulted in a three-day suspension from school. When a teacher told the class that his parents were deaf and dumb, he jumped up defiantly and retorted, "They're not dumb! They know sign language! Do you know sign language? If you don't know sign language, you're the one that's dumb!" The association of the words deaf and dumb was an ingrained prejudice in the hearing world of the early '60s.
<P>A dinner outing to Shoney's underscored that prejudice for Marty when he was eight. Silently signing with his parents as they sat down to order, he was surprised and shocked when the waitress appeared and began to make derogatory comments about the deaf. Without thinking, he began to sign her words to his father.
<P>"My dad jumped up and screamed," Marty recalls. "He could say a few choice words, and he did." The waitress, unaware that Marty could hear, burst into tears of embarrassment. 
<P>"In its own way, it was racist against us. It didn't have anything to do with color, but it had everything to do with a person's ability to hear."
<P>Mary Ellen nods sympathetically. Personally, she's never understood the hearing world's "oh-I'm-so-sorry" attitude toward the deaf.
<P>"I got so tired of people--like when we'd go out to eat and someone would come to take our order--who'd say, 'Oh, I'm so sorry.' I got so sick of hearing that. I just wanted to say, 'Why? We're eating out--you're the one taking our order!' "
<P>The conversational tone changes as they reveal the ways in which their families were different from hearing families. Marty had to interpret spinal tap surgery for his father; Mary Ellen had to tell her father he was dying; Alice was asked to interpret at her grandfather's funeral. Larry recalls growing up and accompanying his parents on doctor visits. Because interpreters weren't readily available, the responsibility fell on him, and frequently, on family friend Alice. In the early '60s and '70s, the deaf were frequently on their own, depending primarily on family members for communication with the outside world.
<P>Larry, the son of the late R. B. Mynatt, owner of Mynatt Shoe Shop on Cumberland Avenue, inherited his strong work ethic from his father. His dad, Larry says, was a determined, hot-tempered entrepreneur who established high standards for himself and his children. Deafness was never an obstacle, just an inconvenience. Indeed, all four kids describe their parents and their other deaf friends and acquaintances as the hardest working people they know. 
<P>The kids of the Silent Club continue to work together as interpreters: Larry and Marty at the Tennessee School for the Deaf, Alice and Mary Ellen at Pellissippi State. Their focus is vocational training--teaching the deaf skills that will enable them to achieve independence.

<H3>TSD at Risk</H3>

<P>The Tennessee School for the Deaf has been an integral part of Knoxville's Deaf community for over 150 years. A residential school, TSD provides training, socialization and structure for deaf youngsters from all parts of the state. But TSD is currently embroiled in a controversy that threatens its very existence.
<P>Barry Swafford, a history, government, economics and Spanish teacher at TSD, as well as the head basketball coach, is third-generation Deaf. His newborn son is fourth-generation Deaf. Swafford attended TSD and intends for his son to attend, too, if the school still exists.
<P>"The question about TSD--Will it exist?--I think it will, but you know, for how long depends on the philosophy of education for deaf children," Swafford explains through Alan, his interpreter.
<P>"There's always a big controversy over mainstreaming versus residential programs," Swafford signs. "There are those that think the Deaf school shelters children from the real world. Personally, I disagree with that."
<P>The push to mainstream has political and financial roots, Swafford believes. In his opinion, Public Law 94-142, (also known as the Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975)--which says that deaf children can't be denied the opportunity to participate in mainstream programs--is frequently misinterpreted. Swafford thinks that in local educational districts throughout the state, the law is used to keep federal funding by keeping deaf kids in public programs. 
<P>As a result of that, Swafford says, TSD is suffering. Enrollment at the school in 1971 was 400; for the past five or six years, enrollment has hovered between 180 and 200.
<P>"We're stuck with the concept that mainstreaming is better and deaf kids can function better if they learn to function in the hearing world, and that TSD is more isolated and doesn't give them that opportunity. Personally, I think we need to sell the idea that TSD (and residential schools in general) is not isolation," he says.
<P>Madeline Kline, a sensory communication consultant for Hearing Services Programming of Knox County Schools, and a hard-core proponent of mainstreaming, disagrees with Swafford. She says she believes PL 94-142 was intended to desegregate residential schools for the handicapped, and that it's working.
<P>"I think the thrust toward mainstreaming has been an attempt to desegregate the residential environment in such a way that you don't have all the blind together, all the deaf together, and all the mentally retarded together," Kline says. "What you're doing is taking them away from the institution and from the segregated environment and offering them opportunities to deal with other handicapped--other disabilities--in other environments."
<P>Bob Furman, Deaf Studies teacher at TSD, and a Deaf Culture and ASL Linguistics instructor at UT, argues that despite good intentions, desegregation winds up being segregation instead. The mainstreaming programs were designed primarily for kids with other handicaps--blindness or other physical disabilities--and deaf children tend to be lumped into the same category.
<P>"What happens is that we've been given that label of handicapped as part of a much larger group and we feel like we're stuck," Furman says. "We encourage our children to be normal. We don't consider ourselves handicapped." 
<P>"The mainstreaming programs may be good for those folks, but because of the language and the cultural differences, it's not necessarily what's best for the deaf student," Furman continues. "When you put the deaf kids into the mainstream, they lose their language."
<P>ASL is at the heart of the mainstreaming controversy. Proponents of mainstreaming say it's detrimental for deaf children to focus on sign language exclusively and that the opportunity to associate with hearing people provides them the least restrictive environment in which to learn. 
<P>For Kline, the least restrictive environment is one in which deaf and hearing students learn together in a hearing and speaking environment. Mainstreaming for youngsters in the Knox County School System begins as early as three, an age Kline thinks is too old. Ten to twelve months old would be ideal to begin the evaluation process, she says. Kline believes institutions such as TSD are necessary only when quality mainstreaming programs are not available.
<P>"I'm a firm believer that counties and school systems should co-op and offer opportunities for the deaf and hard-of-hearing and the hearing-impaired so that they may learn to work side by side with hearing people, deal in a hearing environment and be productive members of society," she says.
<P>"I'm not an advocate of separating them or isolating them in their neighborhood school with just an interpreter," Kline emphasizes. "I do think they need to be grouped for a certain period of time and to be trained initially by teachers who are skilled in deafness."
<P>Furman and Swafford fear Kline's attitude and believe the push toward mainstreaming is robbing the deaf community of its future leaders.
<P>"Back in our time at the Deaf school, the kids knew how to function," Furman explains. "The (mainstreamed) students are very smart right now, but they can't function. What we're afraid of is that we're losing our leaders--our Deaf leaders of the future. We see very few of them, and we're starting to look for who's going to help us when we get too tired and too old. Who's going to do the community service? Who's going to do all this stuff?"
<P>Swafford, the current president of the Tennessee Association of the Deaf, reiterates Furman's concerns. 
<P>"In the past, most of the presidents (of TAD) were people who graduated from Deaf schools, TSD or others, and those were the people who have been instrumental in going to the Legislature and changing laws and making life better for deaf people. And when they're gone, we're afraid that Bob and myself are the last of our breed."
<P>The fight over ASL is a serious worry for Furman, Swafford and many others in the Deaf community.
<P>"My concern about ASL: It's got to be accepted as a language, and then we can use that to help deaf people communicate better and have more open communication with hearing people, improve reading skills, improve English skills." Furman says "We've had many obstacles throughout history and,  basically, I believe it's because hearing people don't understand sign language. It's an attitudinal thing. They think it's inferior or something. They say 'Deaf people have to learn signed English so they can be like us.' It's easier for hearing people."
<P>Kline's argument against ASL is that it doesn't provide deaf students adequate skills in English.
<P>"The problem I see with people who use ASL," Kline says, "is that they have very poor written skills and they have a very difficult time competing in the educational environment because they can't write a grammatically correct sentence. In reading and comprehending what they read, they require an interpreter," Kline says. She believes it's fine to use ASL to teach the deaf English, but that ASL alone is not sufficient in a society that uses English almost exclusively.
<P>Why do the deaf prefer ASL over ESL (signed English)? Swafford and Furman say ASL is an innate and integral part of Deaf culture. English--signed or otherwise--is not.
<P>"ASL is our native language," Furman explains. "We're born with it in our hearts. It's part of us. But there's a resistance (in the hearing world). And we understand."
<P>Furman understands more than most. His two children are hearing. Though their first language was also ASL, as hearing adults they speak English as well. 
<P>"When I was born, there wasn't a choice for me--spoken language was not a choice," Furman says. "But as a deaf parent, my children learned sign language as their first language. But because they could hear, they also had the hearing environment where they developed and learned language in a natural order. I have no problem with that. I know English is their language. Sometimes, if there's a problem with ASL, we go to English so that they understand. The point is, I'm changing to meet their needs. That is their language. I respect that. And I want hearing people to respect our language. That's all we ask for."
<P>Kline and other mainstreaming advocates insist that training the deaf to speak and to operate verbally in the hearing world is the only way to ensure their success.
<P>"Most of our students who use other forms in addition to ASL, whether it be signed or spoken English or whatever, are academically more successful and have better test scores," she says. "As far as their future, and how they make it in the real world, the oral/aural ones are the ones that fit in."
<P>But fitting-in in a hearing world is not a primary concern for Swafford and Furman. Having a separate language and a separate culture are. The two men are eloquent in their plea and resolute in their determination to retain their language.
<P>"We have a message. ASL is here to stay. You can't get rid of it-- it will always be our language. How can anyone try to take that away from us?"
<P>Speaking for the Deaf community, Swafford and Furman say the equation is obvious and simple: ASL equals independence. Swafford's summation is swift, expressive and poignant. Touching his wrists together, he signs a simple message: No chains. Don't tie our hands.

<P><STRONG>Southern stock car racing spins out the motorsports competition and moves into the lead lap among all spectator sports</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>It's Race Day in Charlotte, N.C., and a withering Carolina sun fights through the gray malaise left over from a midday shower, exploding off the hoods of assorted wide-bed pickups, dusty Blazers, gutted church buses and space-age Winnebagos topped with satellite dishes and sun decks.
<P>All those sturdy chrome-and-steel road horses are grazing the massive infield of Charlotte Motor Speedway, each one saddled with a crude platform of two-by-fours. Clusters of shirtless men and women in bikinis stand on each platform, a sea of sunburned flesh dotted with faded flag-and-banner buoys--Confederate flags, black number threes, beer and Chevy signs and other heartland stock car totems.
<P>More than 165,000 racing fans are here for the Coca-Cola 600, a National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) Memorial Day staple. Right now they're all on their feet, hooting and stomping, craning their necks and straining to keep up with the 43 Day-Glo plastic toys careening around a 1.5-mile black-tar oval at breakneck speed.
<P>Through three days of preliminaries, Charlotte has played host to all the wanton revelry that is NASCAR, an orgy of all-night barbecues, tailgate keggers and unmitigated noise. This is the Main Event--dozens of fearless Winston Cup cowboys on six-cylinder steeds, endlessly circling the track.
<P>For fans like Dewayne Nolan, a 29-year-old Knoxville bartender watching his third Coca-Cola 600 from the Charlotte infield, "it doesn't get any better than this. We've got plenty of beer, food everywhere and cars going by at 200 miles per hour."
<P>There's nothing new about down-home folks watching fast cars run around big tracks, but there is a new fervor surrounding NASCAR, the 48-year-old privately owned corporation that sponsors the popular Winston Cup circuit as well as 11 other racing series.
<P>Evolved from moonshine running in the backwoods of the Carolinas and Tennessee, stock car racing was given structure and promotional unity when Maryland-born mechanic William France founded NASCAR in 1947. The popularity of southern-fried racing burgeoned under its sanction; by 1976, the NASCAR Winston Cup (the 31-race gantlet that determines the sport's champion) had become the world's best-attended motor sports series.
<P>Although North Carolina is generally regarded as the Mecca of stock car racing, portions of the Holy Land extend into Tennessee. Winston Cup drivers like Darrell Waltrip (a three-time Winston Cup champion), Bobby Hamilton and Sterling Marlin (a sideline regular at UT football games) all hail from the Volunteer state, and NASCAR faithful have been making the pilgrimage to hallowed Bristol International Speedway for more than 35 years to watch drivers navigate racing's steepest turns on the world's fastest half-mile track.
<P>In Knoxville, the Pilot Corporation sponsors a racing team owned by a NASCAR legend, and several entrepreneurial aficionados own businesses that cater to racing fans. Furthermore, you'll find as many fans per square inch here as anywhere else in the country--just ask your favorite local TV sportscaster how many angry calls he gets when he omits racing highlights from the six o'clock news.
<P>But what was once a sport of predominantly regional interest is now a national phenomenon. Forbes magazine estimates that between the NASCAR corporation and its sundry speedways and racing teams, the sport now pulls in more than $2 billion a year. Races in such distinctly non-southern places as Dover, Del., and Sonoma, Calif., draw as many fans as those at more traditional outposts like Charlotte and Talladega. And according to NASCAR, attendance at all 31 Winston Cup events more than doubled between 1980 and 1994.
<P>Most people affiliated with racing say NASCAR really took off when Fortune 500 companies awoke to the sport's marketing possibilities in the early '80s and turned stock cars into high-speed billboards by sponsoring individual racing teams.
<P>"Unlike football or baseball, sponsors are crucial to racing," says NASCAR spokesman Andy Hall. "The sponsors are entities in and of themselves, just like the cars and the drivers. They are the game."
<P>While corporate America was infusing the sport with new money and tapping its southern and heartland fans, ESPN was turbocharging its Neilsen ratings and exposing NASCAR to a whole new audience by offering flag-to-flag coverage of almost every Winston Cup event.
<P>"All the media cared about before that was sticks and balls," says Lake Speed, a former world go-cart champion and a 17-year NASCAR veteran. "But when ESPN took off with the Winston Cup around 1981, everyone started paying attention."
<P>Hall believes NASCAR was always a phenomenon waiting to happen. For starters, he says, NASCAR drivers are among the most accessible athletes in sports, renowned for clean-living and fan-friendly behavior at a time when sports stars often receive more press for sexual hijinks and contract disputes than for game-day heroics.
<P>"They don't charge for autographs," says Hall. "They don't go on strike. They've taken it upon themselves to take care of the fans and bolster the image of the sport."
<P>Or, as Speed puts it, "It's a much rarer thing for someone to do something stupid off the track in Winston Cup. We don't have too many loose cannons."
<P>And given the country's decades-old love affair with the automobile, arguably the single most enduring icon of 20th-century American culture, Hall says it was inevitable that people would eventually flock to a sport where everyman drivers crawl into souped-up cars that look almost like they just rolled off the showroom floor.
<P>"Everyone drives a car, and everyone can relate to it," Hall says. "Everyone can look out there and imagine themselves behind that wheel and say, 'I could do that.'"
<P>The conference room at Pilot headquarters on Lonas Road is an air-conditioned tundra, barren save for a few reporters and a handful of executives trying to straighten a scroll-out projection screen that's been wrenched hopelessly askew (Jerk! Bang! "Damn!" Jerk! Bang! "Damn!"). But the red-faced bigwigs stop floundering when NASCAR team owner Bobby Allison and Winston Cup driver Derrike Cope walk in and flood the frigid hall with people.
<P>Allison is a racing legend. A former Winston Cup series champion, he's third on the sport's all-time victory list with 84 wins, and a seven-time winner of NASCAR's Most Popular Driver award. But today he looks humble and grandfatherly in silver-rimmed specs, black slacks and a white shirt with no tie. He patiently signs autographs and fields questions from all comers, his craggy countenance etched with a warm, indelible smile.
<P>Cope, a full-time Winston Cup driver since 1988, is likewise unfailingly polite. A broad-shouldered Washingtonian with a Clark Gable mustache and a tousled brown coif, he's flanked by a gaggle of pretty girls in flowery dresses, lots of suppressed giggles and pregnant smiles. Before the press conference is over, he and Allison have even signed autographs for most of the executives and P.R. flacks on hand.
<P>Chief executive Jimmy Haslam announces that Pilot will become an associate sponsor of Allison's Motorsports racing team. For the oil giant, the partnership means a choice display on Allison's Cope-driven Number 12 rainbow-colored Ford, and exposure to a notoriously brand-loyal audience; according to a survey conducted by a Rhode Island research firm, more than 70 percent of racing fans consciously choose NASCAR sponsors' products over competing brands.
<P>But Haslam says Pilot chiefs didn't need extensive marketing research to figure out that a NASCAR affiliation would strike the right chord with the company's service station clientele.
<P>"We just knew from being out there in the stores and truck stops that this was a natural fit," says Haslam. "It was almost a no-brainer. You'd have to be asleep at the switch not to notice how successful NASCAR has been the last few years."
<P>For Allison and Cope, the deal promises quick cash. Some mid-season shakeups left the team scrambling for new sponsorships, until Allison managed to sign both Pilot and Badcock Furnishings of Tampa, Fla., within the space of a few days. Sometimes, even a legend needs a helping hand.
<P>"It's become so important to be able to afford the most modern innovations to help that car go a little bit faster," Allison says. "It's at a stage now where if you blink your eye, you miss the show."
<P>According to Lake Speed, most Winston Cup teams keep about ten cars in rotation, each with its own specs, so drivers can meet the challenges posed by different tracks. And with the average team spending about half a million dollars every year on tires alone, owners and drivers have to solicit anywhere from $3 to $6 million in corporate sponsorships annually just to keep up with the field.
<P>The system casts a bright, perhaps sweltering spotlight on Winston Cup drivers. With millions of corporate dollars banked on their reputations as well as on their driving skills, racers can't afford the public missteps and blights on their image that their stick-and-ball counterparts seem to take in stride.
<P>It's one of the reasons that drivers often spend hours signing autographs after races or at sponsor functions. It's why every Winston Cup race winner performs the "hat dance" ritual on victory lane, posing for as many as 30 different promotional photos wearing caps from sponsors of both the NASCAR corporation and his own racing team; and why, aside from occasional post-race grousing, drivers generally keep their dirty laundry to themselves.
<P>"You understand that if not for those sponsors, you stay at the house," says Speed. "They're the difference between being there or being on the outside looking in."
<P>NASCAR is unique in the world of sports in that its athletes share their celebrity status with sponsors, team owners and even the cars themselves. Richard Childress, owner of the infamous black Number Three Chevrolets piloted by seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, was assaulted by dozens of autograph-seekers on a recent trip to Pigeon Forge.
<P>And Steve Grissom, a young Alabama racer with only a handful of top-ten finishes to his name, often takes a back seat (so to speak) to his popular car--the banana-colored Number 29 Monte Carlo is sponsored by the Cartoon Network and sports a hood-sized rendering of Fred Flintstone decked out in stone-age goggles and racing scarf.
<P>On a gray afternoon at the Food City grocery in Halls, the sinister black Number Three Chevrolet draws dozens of racing fans eager to peer in at the spartan iron latticework of the roll-barred interior, or to peek under the hood at the brooding 358 cubic inch engine. Of course, this isn't actually "Dale Earnhardt's car"--it's the "No. 3 Goodwrench Service/Food City race car" (that it was driven by Earnhardt seems almost parenthetical.) And its pilot is nowhere in sight; he's more than 2,000 miles away, gearing up for the Save Mart Supermarkets 300 in Sonoma, Calif.
<P>"Is this actually a car he won a race in?" asks an eager gent wearing a ball cap, with three cherubic tots in tow.
<P>Indeed it is, says Food City Sports Marketing Director Barbara Beard. This particular version of the Number Three GS/FC cruised Victory Lane at the 1995 First Union 400 in North Wilkesboro, N.C. It's what NASCAR folks call a "show car"--a retired racer, or a at least logo-perfect facsimile of one--and Beard and driver Rocky Thomas (who happens to be a dead ringer for Earnhardt) shuttle the onerous 750-horsepower speedster to Food City stores in Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee every weekend.
<P>For sponsors, a show car is the next best thing to having a driver on hand, and Beard says the black Number Three is a three-ton magnet for racing fans on a lazy summer afternoon. It's not uncommon for fans to haunt the parking lot for hours, she says, camcorder in hand, videotaping every logoed inch of their favorite driver's car. A woman in Richland, Va., once waded through an eight-hour downpour and took more than 200 pictures of the Earnhardt machine.
<P>A former employee of three-time Winston Cup champion Cale Yarbrough's racing team, Beard says she understands the particular stripe of wide-eyed curiosity that pastes little noses to the driver's-side window, or sends grinning, know-it-all daddies poking around that muscular engine.
<P>"Our cars are like our babies," she says. "A big car that goes fast is something almost everyone can get excited about."
<P>On a scrubby hill above the Exit 407 ramp, the King looks out over westbound I-40 traffic streaming toward Sevierville. No, Pigeon Forge's Elvis tribute theater hasn't changed locations. In NASCAR parlance, the King is Richard Petty, the sport's all-time victory leader with 200 wins, and a seven-time Winston Cup series champ (only Earnhardt has as many season trophies.)
<P>The 15-foot plastic Petty bust, complete with trademark feathered cowboy hat, black shades, red STP jacket, bushy mustache and toothy smile, announces owner Bruce Riggs's Victory Lane Texaco convenience mart/NASCAR collectibles shop, a cluttered little white two-story shack which is home to cars, trailers and assorted NASCAR memorabilia.
<P>A chain-smoking Virginia native with a pickled voice and jet-black hair, Riggs says the NASCAR shop was an outgrowth of his hobbies--going to races and collecting stock car souvenirs.
<P>"I go to 8 or 10 races a year, and I'd spend three or four hours buying T-shirts and hats for other people," he says. "I finally said 'Why not make a profit off this?' 
<P>"It's really more a hobby than a job. You get to meet your customers, and you get to talk your racing."
<P>Riggs confesses that the giraffe-sized cowboy head isn't really Petty, but rather a carefully disguised refugee from a Morristown country music billboard. But the Number 48 Darrell Waltrip Orange Blossom Special, a '65 Chevelle sitting a few feet from the gas pumps, is authentic, and so is the black Number 11 Gene Glover one-seat racer, a weathered '30s relic with obese rear tires and jutting chrome pipe whiskers.
<P>In all, Riggs has five racers from as many decades lining the outer curb of the Victory Lane parking lot, as well as a trailer-load of frayed and gritty used tires from this year's Daytona 500 stacked in threes near the entrance to the store ("$20 apiece--people make coffee tables out of 'em") Inside, you'll find a sprawling range of NASCAR merchandise, from posters to ball caps to miniature die-cast cars.
<P>According to Forbes, racing fans purchased more than $200 million worth of NASCAR merchandise in 1994, and Riggs's shop is only one of several NASCAR-related businesses in or around Knoxville. Nearly 15 miles up the road in Pigeon Forge, Winston Cup Race World boasts what might be the South's largest NASCAR souvenir store, with products from 25 different racing teams. The massive warehouse looming behind Castle Golf on the Parkway also houses 16 show cars dating back to 1935, an arcade with plenty of simulated racing, and 80,000 square feet of indoor go-cart-style racetrack (tiny stock cars or Indy-style minis--the stock cars go faster, of course.)
<P>In the Kroger Plaza off Chapman Highway, former South Knox beer truck driver Burt Graybeal opened Victory Lane Collectibles shortly after attending his first race in Charlotte and "falling in love with the sport." And Bristol regulars Dwight and Carolyn Moreland opened Fast Lane Racing in East Towne Mall in 1992 after more than 20 years of going to tracks. Last year, the couple opened a second store in West Town.
<P>It would be a grievous understatement to say the diversity of NASCAR merchandise is merely mind-boggling. All the standard collectible frivolities are accounted for--the commemorative plates and key chains, the coozies, caps and coolers. But then there are the NASCAR baby jammies, the NASCAR bow ties, the stuffed animals and train sets, even high-end stock-car jewelry. 
<P>And who could do without a limited edition mint Bobby Allison knife set  (two gleaming pocket knives and a monstrous 12-inch Bowie)? Listed at $700, Graybeal offers the set at a bargain-basement $599.
<P>But the biggest sellers are still the old souvenir stand-bys--the caps and shirts, preferably emblazoned with a favorite driver's mug. "When you go to a race, you can't go in an old shirt," says Graybeal. "You've got to get you a new T-shirt and a new hat every time."
<P>There's a checkered-flag umbrella in the back seat of the maroon Caprice Classic parked in front of Conner Concepts at Franklin Square, and it's only the first of several clues that something race-related is going on inside. Sure enough, the walls in Mike Conner's plush executive suite are covered with blueprints, menus, maps and artist renderings of Conner Concepts' pending NASCAR Cafe.
<P>Scheduled for a Labor Day opening in Myrtle Beach, S.C., East Tennessee's biggest NASCAR project won't happen in East Tennessee--at least not right now. Conner and company plan to open 10 of the racing-theme restaurants by the year 2000, with a Sevier County site under consideration for 1998. 
<P>An 18,500-square-foot octagon laden with show cars, video screens, interactive kiosks and sundry shrines to drivers and cars, the restaurant was designed by Hard Rock and Planet Hollywood architects with the intent of moving the theme restaurant concept into the 21st century.
<P>"I don't think we could have a better theme," says cafe president Mark Dyer, himself a lifelong racing fan. "NASCAR is still a very young sport in many ways. It's been stereotyped as a southern redneck phenomenon. But now that the media is starting to catch on, the growth potential is enormous."
<P>Conner, whose company owns the Chop House restaurant in Franklin Square, says developer Harold Pierce first suggested the NASCAR  project in 1994. A shrewd businessman who helped build the Grady's chain, the dapper 40-ish restaurateur counted himself a racing illiterate but was intrigued by the prospect of tying in with a sport that more than tripled its merchandising revenues between 1990 and 1994.
<P>Since earning franchise rights, he's met with NASCAR officials, attended races and consorted with the likes of Dale Jarrett, Kyle Petty and Earnhardt, who broke bread at the Chop House a few months back. After a year and a half of NASCAR saturation, does Conner consider himself a fan?
<P>"I definitely wasn't before," he says with a smile. "I am now."
<P>Moments later, he's on the phone to Charlotte, confirming travel plans.
<P>Southern NASCAR fans are notoriously argumentative sorts. They debate the merits of various drivers ("You put Earnhardt in a wheelbarrow and he'll still finish in the top five!" "I'd never own a goddamned Bill Elliott hat!"). They ponder the finer points of engineering ("All the chassis are the same." "No they ain't." "Well, all the frames are the same."). They argue on general principal ("Bobby Allison signed my sleeve--I'm never gonna wash my shirt again!" "You don't wash your shirt any damn way!"). And most of all, they love to assert the stylistic and mechanical supremacy of their favorite make of car ("Ford! That's all I'm gonna say! Ford! Ford! Ford!"). It's a grand old tradition, sitting around the infield or the gas station or the diner and waging war over these issues of far-reaching--no, make that cosmic significance.
<P>But one thing all the cantankerous pork-rind didacts seem to agree on is the appeal of their favorite sport. It's a had-to-be-there deal, they'll tell you, something you can't experience from a newspaper account or by watching cars the size of fists buzz around a tiny track on a 25-inch TV.
<P>"Most people have no idea what's going on with stock car racing until they actually go to the track," says Speed. "Then they go one time, and they're hooked."
<P>And in many ways, the souvenir stands and collectibles, the go-cart tracks, the ubiquitous corporate logos and the profligate show cars at coliseums and grocery stores represent a larger recognition of what racing's core audience, those folks on the Charlotte infield stomping and hooting and bleating rebel yells, have known all along: Racing is more than the sum of its parts. It's bigger than its red-blooded drivers (sorry, Number Three). It's bigger than the Gottrocks owners and sponsors. It's even bigger than all those neon rainbow cars, those iridescent Warholian speed boxes with the 750-hp motors and gleaming enamel shells.
<P>In the end, NASCAR is truly the All-American sport--rampant capitalism and cars and red meat and beer. It's girls in bikinis and midnight milk-wagon races and summertime air sluggish with hickory smoke and diesel fumes, all of it rolled into one big noisy package and staged in modern-day Coliseums grand enough to hold three or four of those piddling little stadiums from any lesser sport. 
<P>On Aug. 24, the Goody's Headache Powders 500 will drop the green starter's flag at Bristol. If you've never been to a NASCAR race, choose a driver, buy a cap and a T-shirt, hop in the Winnebago and give it a try. But be forewarned: If you come back a fan, you have only yourself to blame.

Trouble in Three Colors</H1>
<P><STRONG>Blacks who wear police blue aren't very welcome among white officers or in black neighborhoods</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>What he remembers most about the night the white cop hit Jeff Eastern from behind was the sound of Eastern's deep voice on the radio.
<P>"Once you hear Jeff's voice, you're going to know it the rest of your life," says the young black officer. "He said he was in plain clothes westbound on 40 in his cruiser. Then he says they're bailing and he's in foot pursuit."
<P>Next thing this officer knows, Jeff Eastern is on the ground. When he gets up he's limping. (He was disabled for months from falling down an embankment after a blow to his shoulder administered by a heavy flashlight.)
<P>No disciplinary action has been taken against the white cop, whose supporters claim he can't be faulted because Eastern didn't identify himself as an officer, resembled the description of the suspect, didn't stop running when ordered and had a gun in his hand. Others say that Eastern had a radio, not a gun, in his hand and that officers are trained not to draw weapons when in pursuit.
<P>The incident started when Eastern, whom more than one source describes as a "poster police officer," witnessed a car theft in the parking lot of his east side apartment complex and mounted a full-bore chase, complete with blue lights and siren.
<P>Did the white cop know Eastern was an officer? If not, another question is raised: Is it standard police procedure to whack black guys from behind? 
<P>"After that, morale went so low you'd have to reach up to touch the ground," says the black officer.
<P>Low morale among the city's black police officers is only one facet of the problem that race presents to law enforcement in Knoxville. Black cops are mixed at best in their reviews of their status inside the city's police bureaucracy, but their situation is just as murky in the communities they serve. The rewards of such public service must sometimes seem small and distant to officers who appear to be beset from all sides by indifference, if not by outright hostility.
<H3>Giving black cops a bad name?</H3>
The mood in the Austin East auditorium is so angry that the politicians, the police brass, the movie actor, and the football star on the stage above the crowd can feel it.
<P>The police officers are lined up at the base of the stage in folding chairs, like cannon fodder between the big shots and the ticked-off, mostly African American crowd of 200 citizens. Knoxville Police Department Chief Phil Keith and the cops present, many of whom are also African American, bear the brunt of the crowd's fury.
<P>This is the first of several Inner City Town Hall sessions organized by County Commissioner Diane Jordan to address problems between the police department and the black community. Some of the crowd's anger focuses on an evidently notorious white officer who isn't present. They say he uses racial slurs and harasses black people for simply being on the street. (It turns out later that not everyone is critical of this officer--some say he is simply a hard-nosed, aggressive cop who has helped clean up the neighborhood and is appreciated.)
<P>Some of the anger focuses on Sgt. Dick Evans and Patrolman Myron Massey, the two black street officers sitting on the front row.
<P>Fingers point. Accusations fly. Name-calling starts.
<P>There is a schizophrenic quality to the discussion. On one hand, the inner city is caught in a spiral of escalating violence. Folks are afraid to go out on their porches at night and everyone is appalled at the crime wave being wrought by a small but flourishing number of juvenile predators. These are kids whom everyone fears.
<P>East Knoxville asked for more police protection, and now residents are complaining that they're getting too much of it. Some complain that they're living in a police state.
<P>"There's been a misunderstanding of our outcries," says Minister James Mohammed.
<P>Before the night is done, Chief Keith has been thoroughly battered, and it is clear that the black cops are caught in the middle of conflicting social interests.
<P>A speaker demands that the cops quit busting young men loitering on the street corners. Applause.
<P>Another speaker says the police should do something about the street-corner nickel bag dealers who wouldn't be tolerated in West Knoxville. More applause.
<P>At one point, the invective so rankles Evans that he starts to come up out of his chair and is restrained by Lt. Charles Coleman, a 29-year veteran and the highest-ranking African American in the Knoxville Police Department. Massey, stocky, bespectacled and studying to be a pharmacist, sits impassively as a young man from Lonsdale accuses him of giving "black officers a bad name."
<P>A young mother in the front row berates the officers, saying that her child is "terrified of police." And sure enough, every time the mother gets up, the little girl, left sitting face-to-face with a big white man in blue, shrieks in undiluted terror.
<P>Some in the audience demand to know how many black officers are on the police force. Keith says about 10 percent (At the end of 1995, 9.2 percent of sworn officers were minorities, according to KPD officials).
<P>Others want to know why it's so hard for black officers to get promoted. Keith says it's hard for everybody. A man says he works nights and has been stopped by the police six times since December. Someone wants to know what's been done about the white officer who hit the black officer with the flashlight.
<P>Renee Eastern takes the microphone and demands to know why "the man that hit my husband is still working for the police department." Keith says the matter is under investigation. Later, however, he says there is no investigation under way in Internal Affairs.
<P>James Rowan, a retired KPD captain who is UT head football coach Phillip Fulmer's bodyguard and a frequent critic of the department's lack of ranking black officers, sits in a back row and scowls. Afterward, Rowan, one of the most respected figures in East Knoxville, says he didn't find the meeting particularly constructive. Others disagree, saying it gave them a chance to bring their grievances straight to the chief. Others wish the mayor had been present.
<P>Keith says later that he has tackled the morale problems within the department. He says the department has offered cultural diversity training, sensitivity training and, most recently, training in mediation. "If we can mediate our problems internally, it will help prepare us to solve problems in the community."
<P>"Part of the morale issue is that at a couple of community meetings, black officers have been singled out more than white officers," Keith says. "That can't make them feel good about the job they do."
<H3>No easy walk</H3>
Some black officers say problems with Knoxvillians of their own race are no easier to deal with than problems within the department.
<P>Last fall a group of black community leaders, including Commissioner Jordan, local NAACP President Dewey Roberts, and City Councilman William Powell, went to see Mayor Victor Ashe on behalf of several of the city's black police officers. They had a long list of grievances.
<P>"I chaired the meeting," says Roberts. "We discussed the problems and arranged to come back again with a delegation of officers. But the younger ones, the ones with the most to talk about, were afraid to come. They feared retaliation."
<P>Roberts and Jordan say they were disappointed with the second meeting, because the officers whom they were able to persuade to go with them--Coleman, Evans, and Nate Allen (since promoted to lieutenant)--told the mayor that whatever problems the minority officers had could and should be solved in-house.
<P>"I called Coleman an Uncle Tom right in front of the mayor," says Jordan.
<P>"It made us look bad. We looked like fools, troublemakers" says Roberts.
<P>Coleman says that maybe the shoe fits.
<P>"Dewey should not be led into things he doesn't know anything about," he says. "I'm not saying there aren't things that are wrong going on in the police department, but there are things that happen inside that you can't come in from the outside to correct, and you can cripple an officer, make him unable to function because he ultimately depends on other officers for his survival.
<P>"Have black officers been hindered? Yes.
<P>"And all those gripes? Some of them I've stuck my nose into. But Diane and Dewey cannot be the spokespersons. They can't come in with the NAACP and expect to make any real changes. They shouldn't have gone to the mayor. He doesn't run the department. They should have sat down with Phil (Keith) first. It's no easy walk to be a black officer."
<P>Coleman says that perhaps the black officers should try (again) to form their own association (it's been tried before without much success).
<P>Roberts says that he was asked to get involved by black officers who had lost faith in their ability to affect change from within.
<P>There was a time not long ago when police brutality was the police issue with which the NAACP was concerned.
<P>"We really went after Phil Keith in the beginning and as a result the police brutality complaints have gone down," Roberts says. Now, he says, the NAACP is focusing on seeing minorities hired, retained and promoted on the police force.
<P>"And black police officers are in a difficult situation," he continues. "They need to become more organized. They have fears regarding backup, fear of who signs their check.
<P>"We have not seriously done the kind of promoting that would encourage blacks to become police officers. It's not seen as a career path. We think it's important that they fast-track some of these young black officers, people who know the community, into positions where they can investigate."
<P>At this point Roberts begins to sound as much like a hard-line anti-crimer as any conservative Republican.
<P>"We think if they had more investigators who know the territory, they could solve some of this crime," he says. "And when they do, we need to send the message that killing is unacceptable and prosecute them to the max."
<H3>The dark narc</H3>
"I love putting my people in jail. I love putting your people in jail. I love catching them. I'm not a counselor, I'm not a social worker. I'm a police officer--if it took hiding in a trash can or laying on your roof to catch you, I'd do it."
<P>When Charles Coleman, now 50, first decided he wanted to be a police officer, he put an application in with security at the University of Tennessee. Seemed like a good idea, since he wanted to go to college. He got a letter back telling him thanks but they weren't ready to hire blacks.
<P>So he looked to KPD, where he was told he was too short.
<P>"I'm five-nine and had a big, bushy afro that probably made me about five-ten," Coleman says. "(Former chief and sheriff) Joe Fowler is a lot shorter than I am." 
<P>Eventually Coleman went to work for the fire department and after awhile the KPD called. 
<P>"You tell me the door is closed, and I'll keep pecking on it," he says.
<P>He worked the streets, did undercover drug work (where he was called "the dark narc"), and built a reputation of legendary proportions. (One erroneous story persists that he busted his own wife for drugs.) Now he heads the Organized Crime Unit, which includes Metro Narcotics, Auto Theft and the Vice Unit. He says his working life hasn't been untouched by racism. 
<P>"Have I heard the word nigger?" he asks. "Yeah. It's not a word that provokes me." 
<P>Does he believe there are racists in the organization?
<P>"As long as I've been here, I believe I know who's who." 
<P>He recalls an old supervisor who used to say, " 'Put Officer Jones here, put Officer Smith there, and put this boy walking.' Finally I figured these old geezers just aren't going to change." 
<P>Today's young minority officers could use a dose of that kind of pragmatism, he says. While he believes there is likely some unfairness in the interview board that weeds out applicants and he sometimes quietly intervenes or asks questions about incidents he gets wind of, he still sees KPD as a place of opportunity where "a young black officer can come in, keep his nose clean and move right up because there just aren't too many of us. And you don't have to be a yes man."
<P>He's not an infinitely patient guy, and he says he doesn't cut black officers any particular slack.
<P>"When blacks come to work for me, often they think I owe them something because they're black. I don't. I tell them, 'Y'all didn't just get on this road and start walking. Somebody walked it before you--police work's not for everybody, and sometimes you gotta pack your bags and cut your losses. You can't live in the past.' "
<P>While other officers have been roundly bashed at the community meetings Jordan organized, Coleman has been lavishly praised.
<P>"Promote this brother!" Phil Keith was urged last month. Coleman has been a lieutenant since 1978, and Keith is frequently asked why Coleman has been stuck in grade so long. Keith usually replies that he too is enthusiastic about Coleman, who is free to apply for promotion any time he chooses.
<P>Coleman says he has little interest in "the hassle of going back to school at this stage of my career. It (the promotion) just doesn't mean that much to me. I'm happy with what I'm doing."
<P>Other sources say the department has the ability to waive some of the educational requirements in some circumstances, pointing to the promotion of Rudy Bradley to assistant chief despite his lack of a college degree.
<H3>"This one broke me."</H3>
A young black officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, says the May drive-by shooting in Lonsdale that killed a five-year-old girl "broke me. This one broke me."
<P>He believes KPD could do a better job at solving and even perhaps deterring such crimes if there were more minority officers from inner-city neighborhoods. He says he became a police officer "because I really thought I could help out my people" but found it impossible to do so.
<P>"After awhile, it (his job) had me hating white folks. I was hating my own people, too, for being stupid. "
<P>He'd like to see more effective diversity training within the department and more blacks being given the opportunity to be detectives. Currently there is one black detective.
<P>"We're told all the time you're not one of 'them.' We're not black, we're not white--we're all blue. I know that's wrong. If a black officer is out talking to a known drug dealer, he's conspiring against the police department. He's a traitor. If a white officer does it, he's everything positive."
<P>Roberts has been involved in problems concerning individual officers, including Eastern, Myron Massey, Marshall Eskridge, and Anna Marie Martin. 
<P>Roberts says he has spoken to city brass on behalf of Massey, who reportedly has problems getting the backup he needs on calls (Keith says that issue has been investigated and is "absolutely not true") and has protested racist language within the department. Eskridge, a Lonsdale native, was accused of stealing a wallet from a suspect and was taken off the street as a result. He has not worked in recent weeks due to health problems.
<P>His difficulties are of particular concern to a number of westside neighborhood activists. Mildred Westfield, who lost two sons to murder and a third to a murder charge and a long prison term, has made a full-time crusade of combating drugs and gang violence, particularly in her Mechanicsville neighborhood. She says she worries about Eskridge, who is under medication for stress-related blood pressure problems.
<P>"I'm close to Marshall," she says. "And they are so against him. Marshall was trying to make a difference. Our officers have to have an extra sense of strong stamina. They go into the job with compassion, but pressure from within and without makes them targets."
<P>A Lonsdale leader who does not want her name used says black officers are afraid because "if they speak out they are gone. I talk to officers, and they're scared. They don't get backup. I believe they could get into the black community and solve more crimes if they had local black officers. They really give Marshall a hard time. I do not believe Marshall stole any wallet."
<P>She also says she doesn't approve of the cop bashing she's been hearing in recent months, and has not attended Jordan's meetings because she thinks they have been, to some extent, a front for thugs.
<P>"It's hard on these black officers when they're getting flack from the community and the department, too," she says. "When neighborhood people start jumping on an officer, I'm one of the first to jump up and say, What'd he do wrong? Did you see  him hit anybody?"
<H3>'I didn't sign on for that'</H3>
Anna Marie Martin, 29, speaks as precisely as a school marm. She is smart, well-groomed, and physically fit. She is fluent in sign language and qualified as an expert marksman. She was fired in January after refusing to resign at the end of her probationary period as an officer. She served 14 months with KPD.
<P>She believes she sealed her fate last summer when she complained to her supervisor about a field training officer. She says the white male training officer with whom she was required to ride was behaving in a manner that made her uncomfortable.
<P>"I didn't file a formal complaint," she says. "I simply asked to be removed from the control of that officer."
<P>The training officer demanded a lie detector test, and Martin volunteered to take it also. He passed and Martin failed. She has doubts about the polygraph machine, which a secretary told her had been down all that day.
<P>With the benefit of hindsight, she now believes she didn't have a chance after she complained.
<P>"There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't find myself in the sergeant's or the chief's office. We (the rookies on the Power Squad) had a little joke about me having my own chair in the chief's office." 
<P>The training officer was promoted to sergeant during this time and has since been suspended on a complaint from a white female officer.
<P>"I worked under constant stress and always performed above standard," Martin says. "I went to work and held my head up while being barraged with scriptures about liars."
<P>She remembers the training officer instructing her in running radar by having her squat on one side of the cruiser while he stood on the other side with a radar gun. Speeders would approach, "he'd give me a signal, and I would run out and try to stop the car. They'd go VAROOM right past me."
<P>Determined to do it, Martin says she hunkered down in a runner's ready position, awaited the signal, then dashed out and caught one.
<P>"I scared that lady to death," she says. "I went back to my FTO and told him I wouldn't do it anymore." She says she was written up for insufficient aggressiveness.
<P>She says she had trouble getting backup when she needed it. "I'd call for assistance and the dispatcher would call, 'Officer 475 needs assistance.a She'd get the answer 'What does she have?' or 'We'll have to walk back to the car.' "
<P>On one occasion, she says, she waited in vain for backup after stopping a stolen car near East Towne.
<P>"I called for backup--didn't get it until an off-duty sheriff's deputy stopped to help."
<P>The car turned out to contain four thugs, a cache of stolen property and a loaded 9-mm pistol.
<P>"Something told me not to approach that car. Afterward five cars showed up and it was 'Good job, Martin.' "
<P>She saw the KPD as a place where she'd have the opportunity to finish her college education, have a career.
<P>"But that was not an option. When I signed on, I knew that meant being willing to take a bullet for someone else, to put my life on the line. But I didn't sign on for those obstacles placed in our way unnecessarily, such as racism, sexual harassment, retaliation, ostracism, and defective equipment. Such things we did not bargain for, and we did not raise our hand to.
<P>"People will say, 'There's a disgruntled individual.' Yes, I am disgruntled, because I have been treated unfairly and unjustly. Do I hold hostility? No I do not. And if you want a statement, just tell them Miss Martin will continue to stand by what she said today as being nothing less than the truth."
<P>Asked about her case, Keith said the investigation is closed. "I don't have a comment about a fired employee."
<H3>The law of the streets</H3>
It is the end of May and time for another of Diane Jordan's inner city town hall meetings. She means for this one to be a seminar in something she calls "street law." She has gathered six lawyers, KPD officer Sam Brown, and couple of law students to give practical advice.
<P>Before the meeting, she says that Chief Keith, who was a lightning rod for criticism on previous occasions, has not been invited to attend this one.
<P>Keith believes it his duty to show anyway and is praised by Jordan for being "more than willing to work with us." Despite everyone's best efforts, however, his presence turns the meeting into another beat-up-on-the-cops session, although the crowd is not as large or as angry as before.
<P>But it is clear that a good many people still have complaints, and that black officers are still those who draw the most complaints. A young man claims East Knoxville is policed by officers who would not be acceptable in other parts of town.
<P>One elderly man calls some black officers "Rambos. Clint Eastwoods."
<P>Sam Brown, a black officer who is a member of the SWAT team, gives a talk about what not to do when you're stopped in traffic. Don't jump out of the car; don't reach under the seat; do be patient.
<P>He is an impressive figure, tall and soft-spoken and dressed in his black SWAT-team pants, shirt, and boots.
<P>He further counsels the crowd: "Remember. We get scared just like everybody else."
<P>Likely few in the crowd realize that it was Brown whose supervisor once told him that "niggers are OK--everybody ought to own one."
<P>The next week, parents of children at a Lonsdale daycare center are told that the kids can't play outdoors anymore. The following night there's a race riot on the Cumberland Avenue Strip. It begins with a fight among black kids wearing rival gang colors and marks a milestone. Gang violence is moving out of the 'hood.
<P>Summer is here, and the thin blue line of black officers will be sure to feel the heat.

Collective Behavior</H1>
<P><STRONG>Meet four Knoxvillians who redefine the concept of "collecting"</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Coury Turczyn</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H3>We have become a nation of collectors. </H3>
<P>Today, every citizen is a collector and every product is collectible.
<P>Just walk into your nearest Wal-Mart edifice and witness the never-ending stream of baubles meant to entice us with their sure-to-increase value: telephone cards, Happy Meal toys, Elvis dolls, ceramic knickknacks, POG caps, Star Wars  action figures, movie posters, Pez dispensers, comic books, Hot Wheels, NASCAR knives, special "limited edition" Barbies, sport and nonsport trading cards. Not only is it implicit that these are all collectible, but each and every object has an entire magazine or web site devoted to the joys of collecting it.
<P>But all that's just amateur stuff, millennium-induced hoarding that will supposedly pay off years from now when the owners dust off the still shrink-wrapped items and truck them down to the post-apocalyptic flea market. There are others among us driven by impulses far more demanding than mere monetary appetite, whose collections of sundry objects border on the obsessive. You've probably heard of a few.
<P>For instance, there's that guy in Old North Knoxville with hundreds (or was it thousands?) of beer cans lining the walls of his fine Victorian home, row after row of empty aluminum vessels depicting the history of hops. From out west come reports of a fellow who's built an entire warehouse to shelter his car collection of over 100 Lincoln Continentals--spanning the '61 through '68 model years only, thank you. And what about that upstanding family practitioner with the mystifying collection of miniature farm tractors? How can such behavior be explained?
<P>UT's Department of Psychology made a small foray into examining the phenomenon last year. In a phone survey of 694 randomly selected Tennessee adults, it found that 45.8 percent consider themselves collectors. A nearly even percentage of men and women claimed to be collectors. Race, age, years of education, and community size did not discriminate collectors from noncollectors.
<P>Collecting would appear to be a universal pursuit, with the reasons given starting with "nostalgia" (38.3 percent) and "beauty or esthetics" (17.3 percent). Others included "home decoration," "complete a set," "investment," and, of course, "other." Men were almost twice as likely to collect for investment as women.
<P>"Some people honestly do collect for investment purposes--if you offered them a good price, they'd sell it in a heartbeat," says Dr. Wes Montgomery, a UT associate professor of psychology who co-authored the study with Jodie Sutton Castellani. "But this is not true of collectors who do it for the love of it, who are content to see the collection have a life past their own."
<P>This would describe those in the "other" category, collectors who cannot explain their actions as they amass their huge accumulations of stuff. These are people who simply follow their own impulses, without self-doubt or fear of alienating loved ones. They do what they do because they have to.
<P>Here are four of Knoxville's collecting elite, individuals who have committed themselves to fashioning collections that tower above those of lesser devotees. They have all created one-of-a-kind monuments to their own magnificent obsessions.

<H3>Scrap-Hauling Urban Archeologist</H3>

<P>When Andy Whitaker cranks up his ugly old '71 Chevy pickup, he is a man charged with a special mission. It might appear that he's only hauling scrap metal for a living--cleaning up dumps, moving stuff out of demolition sites--but in reality he's making an expedition to the distant past, sifting through fragments of history and rescuing artifacts cast away generations ago. 
<P>Where others might just go about their scrap-hauling business without much thought, Andy is a seeker. He crawls through century-old dumps digging up bottles and shards of ornate china. He locates long-forgotten ruins like Highland Park in Fountain City and uncovers their secrets. Whenever an old building or home is torn down, he tries to intercept the debris before it all ends up in a landfill, saving 18th-century bricks, fluted columns, hexagonal floor tiles with linked patterns. 
<P>Some would say that to gather these bits of cast-off history is enough. But for Andy, it's just the beginning. For him, they are destined to become part of his ongoing architectural project: Kingwood Terrace.
<P>Drive along Kingwood Street in Fountain City and it's hard to miss. In Andy's yard is his monument to the ages: 60-foot-long garden terraces that decorate a small grade above street level, built from the flotsam and jetsam of Knoxville's past. Since 1989, this slim 33-year-old with the sandy mustache has almost single-handedly constructed the masterpiece, topped by an 11-foot-tall archway. Made of stone, brick, cement, and steel, it looks able to withstand history itself.
<P>"I think the spirits in those dumps have been gettin' ahold of me to immortalize their fragments," Whitaker explains softly, half joking. "I don't know if I'm an archeologist or nothing. I'm just more of an anthropologist in a way."
<P>He points out a sliver of smooth white China imbedded in the terrace's cement, rubbing it with his thumb.
<P>"I often wonder, like, why did this plate break? Was it a lover's quarrel, or did a child drop it? It's got a lot of psychic energy, it seems like."
<P>It's the found objects cemented between the bricks and stones that make Andy's Kingwood Terrace so fascinating. As you walk by the walls, long-forgotten fragments demand your attention: a bronze mold of a yearning baby's hand ("I guess it's a sample for bronzing your child's hand prints"), a stone wheel with concentric grooves ("It's a stone polisher that came from a little mill off Tazewell Pike"), nude art deco figurines, a white clay jar with black lettering ("Only Prize Medal for Marmalade, London, 1862, Great Britain"), an old brass pot from Civil War times ("I found it on Van Heart's Ridge--that's where Fort Adair used to be"). Practically every era of the region's habitation is represented.
<P>The project started about seven years ago when a tree fell down and broke a birdbath in the yard. "So I thought, 'Well, I'll just build a little wall through here,'" he says. "Then all of a sudden it metamorphosized into this monstrosity.
<P>"Sometimes I work on it regularly, but sometimes I go months at a time and do nothin' to it. It depends on what kind of influences are around me, as in people. I'm kind of lonely, so I worry about women too much. I get obsessed with that and I end up being alone all the time. You know how it is, the old classic story--the single guy. But I try to use my extra energy on something creative, as you can tell."
<P>He hopes to complete it by the year 2000--still to come are a heart-shaped bridge, another stairway, a multi-level fountain, and a three-in-one fireplace with a pottery kiln, a grill, and a Dutch oven. Thus far, city inspectors have given him the green light, though he's had to "straighten up" his yard a few times.
<P>"I'm not a perfectionist when it comes to straight lines, but I focus on making it structurally sound and interesting," says Whitaker. "I'm a big nut on structural soundness, I overdo everything."
<P>To Andy, Kingwood Terrace is not only a bit of neighborhood improvement, it's also an expression of his own philosophy of recycling the past. Whenever he sees an old building come down and its materials sent to landfills, he feels torn.
<P>"I often think 'What a waste.' I say that because I see some good architecture go down. Like the Christenberry Heights Junior High, which they're turning into a magnet school. Which is good--if the buildings are outdated and they weren't energy efficient. But they could've at least saved the auditorium part because it had some really cool stonework. 
<P>"I guess it depends on what you call progression--some people call progression fixing up the old town, and some people call progression tearing down the old town and building a new town. It all depends on the building--you can't say one basic thing for the whole thing. Like during the Cold War on Gay St., people put that ugly-ass siding on it and it looked awful. Then they took it down years later and said 'Whoo, look at that!'"

<H3>The Glass Menagerie</H3>

<P>On this particular Sunday, you won't find Donald M. Fiene, Ph.D., in any of the usual places. As others gather in various houses of worship, places of brunch, and assorted fishing holes, the retired UT professor of Russian is instead attending to his own rituals. He'll be at the police shooting range picking up bullet casings.
<P>This is because the dapper 66-year-old with the neatly trimmed gray beard has yearned to gather them ever since he sold his prized collection of .38 shells to Billy Fritz at age 12. Now he has giant bottles brimming with bullet and shotgun shells of every size, color and make.
<P>"I hate guns and shooting and all the rest of it, but I do recognize that when you see 'Winchester,' you're talking about America," he says, gesturing to one of his many antique metal signs. "This is a nation of shooting the shit out of people who walk anywhere near you. And that is our culture, that's the way we live. So that's partly why I do it."
<P>This particular allegiance to violent Americana is but one of Dr. Fiene's many pursuits, however. He manages to devote himself to the creation, organization and perpetuation of some 50-odd collections that populate his house from basement to attic. He is a collector of collections. 
<P>If you have the time to tour his and his wife Judith's Fort Sanders home, the most immediate evidence of his obsession is the vast number of power line insulators--cylinders of glass and porcelain--that are arrayed on every horizontal surface available: shelves, window sills, tables, mantles. He's got 5,000 of them. He's not particularly sure why.
<P>"Well, I found a few along a railroad track, and I liked the shape and color of them, so I brought them home," he says. "It became a hobby." That was in 1970, when at age 40 he suddenly discovered within himself a desire to gather stuff. Since then, he has kept very busy satisfying that urge.
<P>There are, for instance, the 10,000 Russian stamps ("I think I have about three left to go--and I'll probably get them"), the kitschy John F. Kennedy plates hung above the sink ("What is that? Is that a true hobby?"), the 80 slide rules ("If there's ever a total electronic wipeout, I'll be fine"), the autographed books (Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Kurt Vonnegut, J. D. Salinger), the 128 banana stickers kept in alphabetical order ("They're just like collecting postage stamps--there's a certain colorfulness there"), Sunday School pins ("Catholics never had those; Protestants do"), red tail light lenses, Russian icons, doorknobs, furniture coasters.
<P>Then there are the hundreds of seashells set in glass display tables and shelves ("This represents another area I've let slide--I like it the way it is. I don't want to add anything to it because I don't have the room. Well, I could take a couple more"), the 150 typewriter ribbon tins ("It's really amazing that we have found a place for these things and show no sign of stopping"), the 60 toilet bowl sanitary seals from around the world ("They put them in the Russian hotels. I just decided I liked those strips"), and the hundreds of "flower frogs," those multi-holed objects you place in vases to prop up flowers. Could it be the world's biggest collection? Maybe.
<P>But those are just minor dabblings compared to Dr. Fiene's other major obsessions. First, we have the skulls. There are the small ones, tidily affixed to display boards--beaver, squirrel, snapping turtle. Then we come to the ones on the walls: ram, buffalo, longhorn steer. Finally, there are the ones in the basement: South African water buffalo, lion, panther, bobcat, alligator, yak, camel ... and, yes, human.
<P>"I find them in the woods, at flea markets, I buy them in the mail," he says. "I'm more interested in laying out real money for those than anything else I collect right now. I just got interested in them. I keep telling myself, 'You're not going to do any more.' They're fairly expensive, $100 typically for bigger ones. But right now, though, if I run into an opportunity to buy one, I do it."
<P>Finally, and most defiantly, Dr. Fiene collects metal signs of a very specialized sort: chain link fence signs, those signs fence manufacturers affix to their products. In particular, he is obsessed by the Cyclone Fence company. He has begged, borrowed, stolen and bought 350 of the company's signs, which he has linked together to form great metal sheets that hang from his basement ceiling.
<P>"Nobody collects them that I know of," Fiene reports. "People are all the time picking up these kind of porcelain enamel signs, but they're looking for soft drinks. Why they aren't looking for Cyclone Fence signs, I don't know.
<P>"I went after these because they were cheap. Nobody cared. You can go and ask a guy who's the owner of some fence and say, 'Can I have that sign?' And he'll say, 'Fine, take it.' Nobody wants them--they don't care about this advertising for someone else. I like the way these things look. I like the way I have put them up in tiers. And behind them are other porcelain insulators. You see there's more there, and there's more on the other side of the cellar. It's just unbearable."
<P>Also winding its way through Fiene's cellar is a wisteria root that comes in through one window and exits on the opposite side only to climb up another tree in the back yard. Why did he nurture such a thing?
<P>"You'd have to figure that out yourself, because I can't say. It's like doing something that no one has ever done. I try to do something like that every a year--something that absolutely no one has ever done. How many people do you think have forced a wisteria to do that? I don't think too many."
<P>Will he ever stop? Considering that he's also writing two books--one an autobiography, the other a study of Russian icons depicting divine wisdom--one might think he'd run out of time for such collecting. His answer is simple: "Never, sir!"

<H3>Not Mad, Really</H3>

<P>As Bobby Beaty tools along County Farm Road in Friendsville, out near Maryville, he'll most certainly point out that once upon a time this was all rural land--there were no mini-marts, no housing developments, no big power lines. But as you near his property, the great masses of trees and hills still look vibrantly green, striking a beautiful contrast to the clear blue skies. If it wasn't 95 degrees out, you'd swear it's a small chunk of heaven.
<P>The slim, neatly groomed 57-year-old owner of Beaty &amp; Waters Used Cars has seen a lot of change in the past 30 years--in fact, one fairly new construction is his own warehouse built near his home. He put it up in 1987 to house his ever-growing collection.
<P>"When I started collecting, I put 'em in boxes," he says. "And I just kept puttin' 'em in and closin' the box up. Everywhere I go, if they had a box, I'd get it. And I just kept stackin' 'em up over there in the house. Why, I had 'em in the closets, under the beds, and everywhere else. Mrs. Beaty wasn't likin' it too well, you know."
<P>The problem was momentarily solved with the construction of the warehouse. But, wouldn't you guess, he had to expand it two years later. The collection was getting bigger, and it needed display space.
<P>You see, Bobby Beaty collects baseball-style caps. He has 6,400 of them. Or thereabouts.
<P>Shelf after shelf, they line the walls of his warehouse in perfect rows, like bodiless soldiers marching in single file. They aren't stacked on top of each other, they aren't doubled up on the shelves--they sit at attention in unbroken lines, stretching the entire length of the warehouse. There are caps with sports team emblems, political slogans, addresses from stores of every sort, car dealerships ... every kind of baseball-style cap you can think of. And they're all neatly sealed in plastic.
<P>Beaty's obsession with caps started in 1983, when a friend of his gave him a Beaty Seed &amp; Feed cap from Cleveland, Tenn. 
<P>"And it was so pretty, I decided 'I'm just gonna start collectin' 'em,'" he says. "It just hit me. It's different, you know. So I got started on it and I couldn't quit."
<P>Is there any particular kind of cap he searches for?
<P>"No, just any cap--I don't care what it is," he says. There are no especially valuable ones in the collection, though there are a few notables. He's got one from Junior Samples, "just like he wore on Hee-Haw," political ones from former Gov. McWherter and Presidents Bush and Clinton, ones from companies no longer in business like Blount National Bank and Clayton Lincoln-Mercury. He estimates that 90 percent of them have been gifts from friends and family.
<P>"You know what a friend is--it's somebody who likes to do something for you. Your friends'll take care of you. I've been in business out there at Beaty Used Cars for 33 years and I might go in the morning and there'll be two there on the desk that somebody dropped off--you don't even know who brought 'em to you. They just know you collect 'em and they'll bring 'em to you."
<P>While caps are certainly Beaty's primary obsession, his warehouse shelters plenty more collections in various stages of organization. He has Coca-Cola trays, beer cozies, tobacco cans, Velveeta cans ("I bought those in stores an' laid 'em back.), sport cups, and several antique bicycles, including an old Huffy with rocket-ship styling. 
<P>"Just anything I thought was different or odd, I kept it," he says in mild understatement.
<P>There's his complete collection of every Thrifty Nickel published ("I've kept them from day one"), the hundreds of old car manuals ("Here's one for a '78 Chevy Malibu"), baseball cards in unopened boxes, old push mowers, Vol memorabilia. Most impressive is his car collection, which uses up most of the warehouse's floor space. He's got clean Volkswagen Bugs, pickup trucks, and a number of '50s Chevrolets, including a '52 Powerglide coupe with 21,000 miles that he's had since 1965. Situated among these prime examples of automobile engineering are probably the last two mint-condition Yugos in the country.
<P>"These two little Yugos are supposed to be the worst cars ever built," he muses, "and they probably are, I don't know. But I remember when I was a kid they had a Henry J., and the Allstate. You could buy one of 'em for a song and a dance, $5-600. Now they're probably worth $30-40,000. I just thought maybe these might hit. My grandkids might get something out of 'em."
<P>But caps are still first on the collecting agenda--after all, he says, "It's hard to quit collectin' when your friends go somewhere and bring a cap back." He'll be running out of shelf space soon, though he hasn't yet formulated a plan.
<P>"I don't know. I haven't any idea what to do," he says. "I'm pretty proud of 'em--I mean, it's a feat. Now, it'll take you a long time to put that many caps up, if you just sit down and think about it."

<H3>On the Air</H3>

<P>Julian Burke lives in a museum. Although from the outside it looks like your typically large rancher nestled in a West Knoxville subdivision, inside is a storehouse of radio and television history. Crowding every square foot of available floor space are studio microphone stands, art deco radios that look like ornate furniture, early television sets with pop-up mirrors. But these aren't your every day flea market finds--these are pieces of electronic equipment from the earliest stages of the industry's evolution, and all are of museum quality.
<P>"I've seen a few collectors around Knoxville who have a ton of stuff--I mean a lot," says Burke. "The average person might say, 'Wow, you look like a radio collector.' But I'd say 95 percent of it is just junk. Just run-of-the-mill rough stuff."
<P>Burke, who owns his own coin-op machine business, specializes in collecting early electronic rarities--one-offs, prototypes, equipment from companies that didn't last long. A huge glass case in his living room contains scores of microphones, vacuum tubes, and odd bits of broadcasting flotsam--Lowell Blanchard's mike from the Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round, Mel Blanc's "skunk mike" from Warner Brothers Studios, two sets of official NBC chimes, a one-only prototype of an iconoscope tube built by hand in the RCA labs in Camden, N.J., an NBC flag of solid wool, original batteries from the '30s. 
<P>The living room itself is like a wondrous department store of like-new equipment from the earliest years of radio and television. Marconi ship-to-shore spark gap sets from 1912 share space with a 1946 RCA television set that was in production for only 20 days, its sleek cabinet designed by the renowned Raymond Loewy. Burke flicks on a 1951 Spartan TV ("It's a little later than what I like to collect, but it was my family's first set") by raising its mirrored lid. After a short humming warm-up, the screen softly glows and Jimmy Durante appears out of the ether, tap-dancing in a black and white mist, singing "Now everybody throw your arms in the air..."
<P>Burke estimates that he's got about 5,000 pieces stored in his house and two warehouses. His fascination with radio history started when he was growing up in Seattle in the early '60s--walking to grade school, he would stop at the local TV stations on the way there and talk to the old engineers. They taught him about the equipment and about radio and television itself--having been there from the start of the medium.
<P>"I was in a very unique position in that I not only got to see these people on a daily basis, but I got to learn stuff from them," he says. "People today don't have this kind of understanding. So that's kind of how it started--when I see an old piece of equipment, I know exactly what it is."
<P>Although he started collecting electronic equipment in 1968, he doesn't recall making a conscious decision to make it his life's pursuit. 
<P>"I think like with most collectors, all of a sudden one day you realize you've got shelves and shelves and boxes full of this stuff," he says. "And then you start trying to segregate it so you can keep it in a logical order, because if you just keep it in boxes, you don't know what you've got and you keep buying duplicates. You just try to keep up with it--it gets harder and harder, but all of a sudden one day you go, 'Wow, I've really got just a ton of junk.' I'd hate to move all this stuff."
<P>But it's not only the hardware that captivates Burke, it's also the talent these pieces of equipment used to broadcast--talent that's no longer around in mass entertainment today.
<P>"Oh, I miss a lot of it. There's material back then that is absolutely solid gold. Back then you had entertainers who had to be funny for a living--there was no bad language, no four-letter words being spoken on radio and TV. You had to be genuinely, honestly funny to make it. And good examples of that would be Groucho Marx, Jimmy Durante, Milton Berle--I mean, you could sit there and watch them for hours and they could keep coming up with one-liners that'd keep you laughing. 
<P>"Talent like that is gone forever because today with videotape technology they can delete, add special effects, and doctor it up so you really don't have to have talent anymore to be in the media. They can doctor your voice, alter your appearance, make something out of you that you're really not."
<P>
<P>Although our TV entertainers may be mere constructs today, there are still people here who really are what they are. Collectors like the above gentlemen don't amass their collections for profit or for profiles in the local media. They do it because they find some sense of their identities in this work--they are what they collect.

What's on your mind?</H1>
<P><STRONG>Feeling stressed? Tired? Frustrated? For many, meditation is the solution</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Hillari Dowdle</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>"Oooooooohhhmmmm ..." I'm chanting over and over again, struggling to force my squeaky, slurry voice into a deep resonant bass to match the sounds emanating from my classmates as together we seek an escape from the stresses in our lives through meditation.
<P>"Oooooooohhhmmmm ..." I'm sitting in the lotus position on the lawn of Laurel High School as dusk settles over Fort Sanders, my legs twisted up pretzel-style into my lap, as if in some grotesque caricature of a hippie--the kind Sergio Aragones might have hastily sketched out in the early '70s in the margins of Mad magazine. And I'm pondering my personal motivation. I've learned that thousands of Knoxvillians are seeking out meditation of all sorts--Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu, Christian, and a surprising number of other variations on the old spiritual theme. Can this ancient method of relaxation and enlightenment work for me, a woman who sifts for nuggets of transcendent wisdom by watching reruns of Seinfeld? I can only hope.
<P>"Oooooooohhhmmmm ..." I've just finished a yoga class, a series of stretching exercises designed to release energy--both physical and spiritual. 
<P>"Oooooooohhhmmmm ..." And now, I'm supposed to be meditating--freeing my mind from the shackles of the day-to-day thoughts that keep it busy, releasing what the Buddhists among us might call the "monkey mind," the stream of consciousness inner babble--screeching, jabbering, and jumping nonstop from tree to tree--that keeps us all from experiencing inner peace and achieving personal enlightenment.
<P>"Oooooooohhhmmmm ..." The last of our series of five ohms completed, our instructor pauses to exhort us to let our minds relax, quiet down, to focus on our breathing, to listen to the "higher self." We sit in silence, our ears ostensibly tuned to the voice within.
<P>For me, this is impossible. You'd think that your higher self would be pondering all kinds of deep thoughts, would have some perspective on your life, if not at least something interesting to say. But what I hear going on is this: I bet I look stupid ... I was supposed to call Linda--I'll bet she's mad ... A cold beer sure would be good right now ... My thighs are fat ... I wonder what the cats are doing right now ... Oh shit, I'm not supposed to be thinking ... Maybe I should be thinking, 'ohm'...It's not working ... OHM!!! ... Oh, hell, maybe I can fake it ... Then what's the point? This is for your own good! ... My nose itches ... Don't scratch--mind over matter, mind over matter ... I'm thinking again ... This story is going to suck ... I'm hungry ... But wait, I'm on a diet ... That weenie Bob--I hope he gets thunked in the head by the great Karmic Wheel ... I wonder if I can get a job at HGTV? ...  Who cares, you're supposed to be not thinking! ... Who can not think? ... Geez, maybe I can't do this ... This story is going to suck ... hard! ... Well, at least I can write it in first person...
<P>And that was just a 30-second excerpt.
<P>As class breaks up, folks stand around talking about how great that was, how refreshed they feel. I join in but with serious reservations. Truth is, I do feel more relaxed and even--Dare I say it?--refreshed. But at the same time, I'm filled with angst. I'm wondering, Was I doing it right? Did I achieve anything? And exactly what was the point of the meditation?
<P>Later that evening, over beers at the Longbranch, I share my dread with a pal. Between knowing sips, he pauses to say, "So you don't have a point. Isn't that the whole point of meditation--not to have a point?"
<P>Suddenly, I am enlightened. He's right, I realize, to a certain degree. I've been working too hard, been too worried, been trying to make logical sense of something that's neither logical nor easily definable. And in a flash of clarity, I realize that my ohm-humming experience at Laurel High, far from being a waste of my unfocused time, has been a microcosm of the whole meditation experience. Maybe I'm on the right track after all.

<H3>What the Heck Is It?</H3>

<P>Meditation is an age-old practice, one that runs through nearly every spiritual and healing tradition the world has ever known. Sadly, it's one that's been largely suppressed in the go-go West, worming its way into national consciousness only now and then--like when the Beatles took it up in the early '70s, or when Dr. Dean Ornish released his groundbreaking book on reversing heart disease in the late '80s.
<P>From Dr. Ornish--and indeed from a plethora of published medical findings--we learned that  if we meditate, we can produce all kinds of positive benefits for our physical bodies: We can lower our blood pressure, reduce our cholesterol, control our stress, cure our headaches, etc. Sounds great--there's no question that these are benefits we could all stand to take advantage of. But that only leaves us wondering, What the heck is it?
<P>I pose this question to Joan Harrigan, a counseling psychologist who also happens to be one of Knoxville's foremost authorities on meditation, having studied it for 25 years in the U.S. and in India. A teacher of an ancient form of meditation in the Yoga/Vedanta tradition (which means, roughly, union and transcendence) anda practicing Christian, she settles back into her armchair to consider.
<P>"Meditation," she says slowly, "is the objective study of the mind. In meditation, the individual focuses inwardly, and observes the mind at work."
<P>As if sensing my next question (which, f.y.i., was, "Yeah, so?"), she continues. "The point is that it trains the individual to concentrate, to relax, to not be reactive to the self-talk going on, to be aware of the deeper-level impressions of the moment so that they can understand themselves better."
<P>Harrigan periodically teaches an eight-week course in meditation. She's even listed in the phone book under "meditation." She describes the experience most of her students have with the process.
<P>"Meditation opens the flow of material in the mind so that ... in the beginning stages, you get a lot of chatter and replay of the day," she says, assuring me that my own baby steps are not uncommon, and that better things are right around the corner. 
<P>"In the second phase, as you become more peaceful, you get the replay of sort of old home movies," she continues. "And you do life review so that you really have a clearer perception of what your context is."
<P>"Then you get an opening into the unconsciousness," she concludes. "You really get to understand the underlying themes and archetypes of your inner structure. And you get to know your temperament, style, purpose .... You become more aware of your personal values and I think in time more decisive--decisions are based on who I really know myself to be and what my purpose in life is. ... rather than who my friends and family think I am, or what society seems to be pushing me to be."
<P>All this sounds good to me, really good to me. But in the final analysis, I'm still confused. So I pose the question to my good friend Barbara Roberts, a Zen Buddhist who is gifted with the ability to simplify matters significantly. She explains it this way: "In meditation, you're simply trying to get acquainted with how your mind works. When you sit down and start to look at that process, you start to get an idea of just how busy our minds are all the time, and how they leave us so little peace. A lot of the stuff is self-critical, it's worrying, it's fear-based ... and you're not even aware of it. "
<P>"It's just sitting down and shutting up, maybe," she concludes.

<H3>How Do You Do It?</H3>

<P>Maybe. But first, a word about what meditation is not. It is not daydreaming, it is not letting the mind wander, it is not actively thinking about a problem or a circumstance, it is not sleep, it is not a trance. It is a state of calm, relaxed alertness, preferably reached while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed, spine straight and muscles generally relaxed, and breathing deeply and smoothly from the diaphragm rather than the chest (lotus position optional).
<P>This method is called "calm abiding" meditation, or "one-pointed focus" meditation. And though the ultimate goal is to reach a state of not thinking, that does not necessarily mean automatically blanking out one's mind altogether--it's a worthy goal to work toward, but one that most never meet.
<P>Father Terry Ryan, pastor at John XXIII Catholic Church, teaches meditation (or "contemplative prayer," as it's known within the church) to any of his parishioners who are interested. "[Meditation] is just where we stop clinging to the thoughts that are going through our mind," he says. "It's like sitting on the side of a river--and coming down the river are various boats. You're aware of the boats, but you don't think about the boats. You don't climb on the boats, see what's on the boats, see where the boat is going."
<P>In order to stay off the "boats," Ryan employs what he calls "centering prayer," a method of distracting the mind through repetition of a word. Often, he says, he teaches his students to focus on a "centering word"--the name Jesus, for instance. When their minds start to wander, they simply--and gently--return to their centering word. "You could also use the word open," he says. "It doesn't have to be a religious word--just one that doesn't make you think."
<P>In Eastern traditions, including the widely popular Transcendental Meditation (or TM) championed by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the '70s, this "centering word" is called a "mantra." A mantra consists of Sanskrit sounds and words, in which the meaning is carried in the actual vibration of the word. "In using a mantra, the actual sound of the phoneme or phonemes is important because the subtle vibration of mentally repeating that sound pattern over and over has an effect on the mind," says Harrigan. ("Ohm," "Hare Krishna," and "So Hum" are mantras frequently used for general purposes.)
<P>Another popular method that is often suggested for beginners in do-it-yourself books and tapes is focusing on the breath--either counting the breath (try one to four and back again), or simply paying close attention to how the breath feels as it enters and exits the body. And, oh yeah, let your thoughts pass out of the mind as you exhale.
<P>Mary Roberson, another psychologist who teaches meditation, takes the broad view of meditation methods. "One can transcend through any of the senses," she says. "Some people do mantras--or chanting--and transcend through the sense of hearing. Others listen to music and focus 100 percent on the music. Some people do candle meditation--they'll dim the lights and stare at the flame in a certain way. I also believe that one can meditate in activity as well--t'ai chi is one form, walking meditation another."
<P>Meditating in a group is helpful, too, Roberson says, especially for beginners. "You have a better chance of actually meditating in a group," she says. "If some people in your group are transcending, that will actually facilitate your transcending."
<P>At any rate, it's worth a little experimentation to see which, if any, of these forms is right for you. "I think it's a very creative process," says Barbara Roberts. "And even though other people can tell you what they do or what other people have done, it's your own mind you're working with."

<H3>And Then There's Mindfulness...</H3>

<P>There's another form of meditation, one that is less esoteric,and perhaps more understandable than all of the above. Pioneered by renowned Buddhist scholar and writer Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Hospital, mindfulness-based stress reduction is a program that has, for the last 18 years, been employed throughout the U.S. as a way to help people deal with injuries and illnesses of all sorts--from cancer to HIV to back injury to depression. The program is being taught in Knoxville by clinical psychologist Diane Lemieux, a private therapist who also works in conjunction with Wellness Community outreach coordinator Debby Ames to offer the program to cancer patients
<P>"Mindfulness is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness," Lemieux says. "What we focus on is the present, where you are--being aware of what your thoughts are, being aware of what sensations you have in your body. A lot of stress and anxiety is generated by people living too much in the future or the past.. It's really an acceptance of the full catastrophe of your life--the good, the bad, and the ugly."
<P>The first thing Lemieux and Ames ask their students to do is eat a raisin--and they mean really eat a raisin. Spend 15 minutes looking at a raisin, feeling a raisin, chewing a raisin, tasting a raisin. From there, they move on to a variety of other techniques--a full body scan in which the student focuses on every muscle to see how it feels, a walking meditation to focus on the body's motion, and a yoga meditation to focus on its range of movement. Then it's on to more informal practices: If you're brushing your teeth, really focus on brushing your teeth; if you're petting your cat, you're with your cat.
<P>In each meditation, the two work to break down the barriers to relaxation. "People have these preconceived notions that in meditating they should feel blissful. That's just not so," says Lemieux. "If you're meditating, you're just aware of your feelings. So when I'm doing a body scan I don't tell people to relax, because that will only add to their stress. I just ask that they pay attention to the muscles--to where there is tightness and where there is pain."
<P>"We're not trying to escape," says Ames. "We're trying to deal with what's there. If it's a feeling that seems to be pervasive, we sit with it, try to locate it in the body. And that's where we're different from mantra forms of meditation. We're moving closer to the source of feeling."
<P>"The same is true for distractions," she continues. "Let's pull them out and take a long hard look at them. It's a way for people to begin looking at distractions they may have been avoiding or afraid of. And it's not always positive--not always floating or la-la. It can be very stress-inducing. But the understanding we gain--Oh, that's why I did that--can reduce stress. "
<P>Their program has profound implications for people dealing with disease--and for people just dealing with life and it's attendant hassles. "What starts to happen is that there are shifts in people's lives," Ames says. "You begin to reprioritize. You give yourself space. Instead of being overwhelmed, you find pockets of time. People are amazed at how much more they can do and how much more fulfilled they feel than they did when they were still on the treadmill."

<H3>Why Bother?</H3>

<P>The health benefits of meditation are well documented and undeniable. In preparation for her course, Joan Harrigan has done extensive research into meditation's physiological perks, and, in fact, cites them as the primary reason clients seek her services. "Because meditation has the primary effect of relaxing the autonomic nervous system, all functions of the autonomic nervous system are benefited," she says, proceeding to rattle off a rather lengthy and impressive list. "It has been proven to be helpful in stress-related diseases, like reducing high blood pressure, lowering cholesterol, regulating glucose levels, decreasing the incidence of headaches, psychosomatic disorders, and the negative effects of chemotherapy. It can also reduce insomnia and ease gastro-intestinal disorders."
<P>As if that weren't enough, Harrigan then launches into a list of psychological benefits. "Meditation enhances mental clarity, concentration, and a variety of personality characteristics," she says. Meditators are more self-accepting, more positive, more empathic, more creative, and report a decrease in anxiety. They tend to be less defensive, less neurotic, and have decreased irritability."
<P>Phew--an impressive list of claims that can be easily verified by the briefest of literature scans at a library near you. Susan Thompson, a local acupuncturist and herbalist, recommends meditation to nearly all of her clients--whether they come to her with chronic fatigue syndrome, tendonitis, or excessive gas. "Your body wants to heal itself," she explains. "And it knows how. If you can sit down and let go, that's when healing takes place."
<P>But both Harrigan and Thompson acknowledge that anyone undertaking a serious and sustained meditation practice will find another reason: spiritual enrichment. "Meditation is a very natural thing," says Thompson, who's been meditating herself since 1972. "But in our Western, fast-moving, thinking, analyzing culture, we've forgotten it."
<P>"We've lost our connection with spirit," she continues. "And we are at the core spiritual beings. We are more than our bodies. We have a physical part, and a nonphysical part. And in the West, we've forgotten about the nonphysical part. Meditation naturally leads to a remembering."
<P>Roberson remembers her "remembering" quite clearly. "I got into it for health reasons," she says. "But as I progressed, I came to discover that I was settling for less in my life psychologically and spiritually than I need to. Now I meditate for spiritual reasons."
<P>"Spiritual reasons" can incorporate just about any philosophy and/or religion you can imagine. Most, if not all, are represented in Knoxville somewhere, somehow. We've got meditation groups formed around Catholicism, Buddhism of all stripes, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and a healthy interfaith Protestantism. For the bold and the brave, we've even got a group that centers on a channeled astral entity known as "The Teacher," and a group of highly devotional Siddha Yoga adherents who worship a guru with a copyrighted name (guess they're striving for Enlightenment).
<P>"I just like experimenting with different beliefs and different cultures," says Jill Burman, a speech pathologist with the Sevier County school system who's been meditating with her husband for the past three years. "There is something to be gained from all of them."
<P>Unfortunately, the spiritual aspects of meditation can lead to off-putting, new-age blather about oneness with the universe, the transcendence of mysticism, the interconnectedness of everything (you are the Metro Pulse you hold), and references to "that which is beyond description."
<P>And though follow-your-nose resources seem endless, it's still very much a caveat emptor market. "There are a lot of sideshows out there," says Dr. Bruce Seidner, another psychologist who is a member of Knoxville's Tibetan Buddhist Group, Losel Shedrup Ling. "And sideshows are typically contemporary synthesizers of wisdom traditions. Some teachers will pick and choose among traditions, then talk about how special they are for having done that.... And that only serves to aggrandize [the group's] members rather than help them develop compassion and wisdom."
<P>Local meditation instructor and Sikh, Seva (the artist formerly known as rock jock Commander Dave Ball on WIMZ), agrees, to a certain extent: "Saying you know a secret about meditation is like saying of a screwdriver that you know this secret device to put screws in the wall."
<P>But outside of warning folks away from what he calls the "sage on the stage" approach to meditation, Seva takes a laissez faire approach: "If this is a way for you to connect with yourself, or if it's a way for you to connect to the universe, then good for you. I know people who claim to be atheists who meditate on their own personal spirit. As my grandmother used to say, if it blows your skirt up, that's good."

<H3>Practice Makes Perfect</H3>

<P>Think of meditation as a drug, one with no harmful side effects and powerful positive potential. It literally has no downside, outside of what some might judge a waste of a perfectly good 20 minutes each day. If you don't like it, you just don't do it.
<P>But if you do like it, take all that you can get--what the hey, there are no F.D.A. regulations to slow you down. But realize it takes time and effort to, ahem, be all that you can be. "Perseverance is the major drawback," says Harrigan. "Meditation is not a quick fix--it takes regular, steady practice over time to get results. And though initial results may be beneficial, it really takes a strong commitment that this is going to be part of your life every day."
<P>Most meditators agree that 20 minutes twice a day is about the right dose, and are full of metaphors to describe the whys and wherefores of the undertaking. You should think of it as part of your hygiene, they say, just like brushing your teeth. You should think of it as money in the bank--more is better, though some is good.
<P>But Roberson, a soft-spoken and understated sort, has the best metaphor of all. "It's like how they used to make colorfast yellow cloth," she says. "They'd take the cloth and dip it in the yellow dye, and it would become brilliant yellow. Then they would hang it out in the sun, and it would fade almost all the way back. The next day, they would dip the cloth again, and then hang it out in the sun--and this time it would fade just a little less. And they kept doing it over and over again, until the dye no longer faded back."
<P>"Well," she concludes, "the dye is pure consciousness, and the sun is our daily activity. So what we are doing as we meditate is dipping ourselves into the yellow dye. And when we achieve this state of being completely yellow and colorfast ... we are enlightened."
<P>Me, I'm only the palest shade of ivory. But I'm working on it.

Judgement in Delaware</H1>
<P><STRONG>The loss of a child was horror enough, but a vicious, political prosecution multiplied the suffering of the Mike Chase family</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The ocean pounds the Delaware beach east of 42 Columbia Avenue; the sound washes through the loblollies and over the blue hydrangeas in the yard. Gulls wheel overhead in the sunlight that brightens a little white-painted chair at the edge of a brick-lined flower bed.
<P>The garden, a dapple of sunshine and shade, is the work of 83-year-old Nicholas Chase, a retired law professor and attorney who is "Pop-Pop" to his grandchildren.
<P> "I was teaching him about flowers," says Nick Chase, whose family has summered here for decades. "He sat in that little white chair and I taught him how to say the word flower. I was teaching him colors. It was just a quiet little place to relate to him. Now it's a memory garden."
<P>The boy who sat in the little white chair was his grandson, Michael Oakley Chase, who died last Aug. 22 after being left for three hours in a parked car with the windows rolled up. Even reporters swallowed tears when Nick, from the witness stand, said he'd been teaching the boy to shake hands properly instead of using the palm-slapping high five he'd picked up from the big kids.
<P>He would have turned two this January. He was Mikey to those who loved him, "the deceased" by order of the judge who presided over the prosecution of his father. 
<P>Mike Chase was indicted, tried, and ultimately acquitted of criminally negligent homicide for Mikey's death. The decision to prosecute has been denounced up and down the state of Delaware.
<P>"This wasn't about Mikey," says Donna Chase, wife of Mike and mother of Mikey. "This was about how to get Mike."

<H3>Verdict at 10</H3>

<P>Getting Mike proved to be a job. By the time closing arguments rolled around, lead prosecutor Mark Bunitsky's pre-trial puffery that he had "more incriminating evidence than has been released in the paper" had proved an empty boast. He was scrambling to salvage his case.
<P>But nobody is ever certain what a jury is going to do.
<P>Co-prosecutor Stephanie Tsantes gave the first summation, instructing the jury to "flush" emotion out of the case and see the world in black and white--no colors, no polka dots. She lectured the jury (most of the members of which have children) on what children do when they're put in car seats (failing to mention that they usually go to sleep--something a childless yuppie prosecutor would be unlikely to know much about). She smeared Mike's friend, Jay Prettyman, one more time, advancing the monstrous theory that within five minutes of Mike's discovering his dying child, Prettyman was coaching the Tennessean to save his skin and change his story from "I forgot about him" to "I didn't know he was there."
<P>She ended with the brusque command: "Convict him."
<P>After lunch it was defense lawyer Joe Hurley's turn. The jury began to smile as he tweaked Tsantes by asking them never to forget polka dots. He was wearing, as always, a polka-dot tie. After trial, jurors would remember his use of a quote from the movie Dead Man Walking--"When you lose a child all memories get sealed; sealed in a shrine"--to show why Mike would remember some details, like buying Mikey ice cream with sprinkles on top, while forgetting other details.
<P>"Those sprinkles didn't break his heart."
<P>Hurley dismantled the testimony of ambulance attendant Ryan Myers, whose statement that Mike said "I forgot" was crucial to the prosecution, since he had no relationship to other witnesses. Hurley painted Myers as a callow youth and reminded the jurors that almost every part of his cocksure testimony was contradicted:
<P>"Impeached all over the ball yard.... Twenty-one years old and thinks he knows it all."
<P>Bunitsky was the cleanup man and went to work with his customary ham-fisted zeal. Like Tsantes, he warned of the "emotional trap" and he labored mightily to show that "I didn't know" could really mean "I forgot." He finished up with an admonition, perhaps culled from some old-time prosecutor's book of hackneyed tricks, to remember Mikey Chase's coffin.
<P>When the jury polled itself, the vote was eight for acquittal, three for conviction, and one question mark. The judge excused them overnight. The next morning, after another 20 minutes, Hurley appeared in the hallway outside the courtroom and mouthed the word "verdict." Someone ran to get Mike, who was out back smoking Luckies. 
<P>Finally the judge took his seat; then came the jury. Donna Chase was flanked by her sister-in-law, Toddy Chase, and by the family priest, the Rev. James Manion, who, unable to sleep, had stayed up praying most of the night and had a vision in the early morning hours: 10 o'clock.
<P>Seconds crawled like slugs. Hurley slumped in his chair, crying openly. Mike stared at the table. John Sandy searched the juror's faces. They didn't look back. 
<P>They were looking elsewhere.
<P>They found Donna and they smiled.
<P>It was 10 o'clock.

<H3>Beaten up by thugs</H3>

<P>Donna Chase was the sad-eyed lady of the courtroom. Sitting outside the door waiting to be called to testify against Mike, directing her gaze downward, watching the beige carpet. She is blonde and stylish, long-legged and slim. Although Bunitsky asked whether she could read and write, she is an interior designer with a degree and a portfolio. A Delaware columnist called her "stunningly attractive" but said she looked as though she'd been beaten up by thugs.
<P>Small wonder. Consider the night when Mikey, more dead than alive, was being loaded onto a helicopter to fly 80 miles to a better hospital and the police chief decided it was a good time to make her go down to the station and give a statement. And consider that Delaware State Police investigators bullied her into leaving Mikey's deathbed to speak into a tape recorder. 
<P>But she got through it with help from family and friends--just, she says, as she will get through the difficult days ahead. She knows about rumors that she and Chase were fighting when she put Mikey in the car; that they put up a front for the cameras during the trial. That it's splitsville now that the verdict is in.
<P>Wrong.
<P>"Mike and I might be best friends. We probably are. We have loved each other for 13 years and been friends for years before that. The rumors are garbage. We've been dealt a lot. But my gut feeling?
<P>"We're gonna make it."
<P>Now that the legal ordeal is over, her family must start working through the stages of grief--again.
<P>"Mikey was one of the most beautiful children ever put on this earth," she says. "People used to stop and ask 'Is he always this happy?' Mike and I used to say he only had two speeds: full-throttle and totally stopped.
<P>"And now we're right back to where we were the day after the funeral. We've been there once. Now we have to go there again."
<P>Donna Chase is aware that not everyone wishes her family well. There's a vocal minority of self-styled family advocates who still say Mike must answer for something. She wonders how people who claim to be defenders of family values can be so judgmental.
<P>"I saw a bumper sticker that says 'Hatred is not a family value.' To me, that says it perfectly. I'd really like to get one of those stickers," she says. "We answered to a higher power the night we held Mikey as he died. Mike and I were together when all of our children were born and we were together when Mikey died. But their judgments don't hurt me; losing Mikey hurts me, and it hurts Mike and it hurts Mikey's sisters. There were only three things that were really precious to us, and we still have Kara and Kelsey. Maybe now we can get back the memories."
<P>She says Mike is an extraordinary father.
<P>"He was the king of diapers. He knew the state-of-the-art diapers, where to get the best wipes, formula. He knew the prices. The only thing was, he never felt comfortable with diaper bags, and China Inn used to have this little blue carry-out bag that he'd pack up and use.
<P>"He gave the kids breakfast every morning," she remembers. "He'd take them to the office. We'd all go down there. We'd order pizza, pull chairs together for nap time. To lose our child because we work too hard? That's garbage. We believe you're supposed to work hard so you can be secure and give to your children. We lost our child because of a tragic accident
<P>"Somehow, we've got to go forward. God, pity the people who aren't strong. People need to reach out, not be afraid. You don't just live day by day. You have to live hour by hour."
<P>She recalls Hurley's remarks about Ryan Myers and believes they apply to her husband's prosecutors, as well.
<P>"Ms. Tsantes, Mr. Bunitsky, they think somebody has to be to blame. I can't play in the league of the people who have done these things to us but I know some day some of them will look back and be forced to make changes in their lives. Mr. Bunitsky is old enough to know better, but he doesn't have the life experience."
<P>She feels her family has taken a beating by the media. "Some of the television people have been respectful but some I don't understand. I don't understand things they did at the funeral [a TV camera crew blocked the funeral procession], at the church, at the cemetery, in our neighborhood.
<P>"And I don't know what to say about the [Knoxville News-] Sentinel. As far as they were concerned, Mike was a headline and I was a nonperson," she says. "Somebody's got to write those headlines, but there was a cruelty in some of them that I just don't understand. Why tell the same story over and over and over and over and just keep going on and on and on?"
<P>The Chases have saved all the stories for Kara and Kelsey to read when they are older, to spare them the heartache of having to search for information from outside sources.
<P>"I've put away letters to them, too, in the event something happens to us," Donna says. "It's important they not forget about their little brother."

<H3>A series of commonplace events</H3>

<P>It's the "if onlys" that drive Mike Chase crazy.
<P>"It took a million little tiny things to make it happen," he says. "If I hadn't gone to the Rudder that Friday we wouldn't have been invited out to the farm on Sunday and we wouldn't have put our trip home off to Tuesday. Or if I wouldn't have called [family friend] Craig Belitz on August 5th to borrow the Suburban, or if Jay hadn't had horses and corn..."
<P>Nobody could have know that the commonplace, profoundly ordinary series of events that would end in tragedy had already begun to unfold last Aug. 18, when Mike and Donna took Mikey to the Rusty Rudder, a restaurant and bar in nearby Dewey Beach. They wanted to look up an old friend who now works for Jay Prettyman, owner of the Rudder and adjacent RudderTowne, a bustling complex of shops and restaurants with a marina out back.
<P>Prettyman had met the Chases only a couple of times before but invited them to bring Mikey and his two sisters--Kelsey and Kara, then 8 and 5--out to his farm for a Sunday afternoon cookout. The Chases had planned to head back to Knoxville on Monday but decided to delay their departure by a day to enjoy the weekend. 
<P>The August visit to Rehoboth Beach, founded as a Methodist camp settlement with a Hebrew name meaning "room enough," is a family tradition. Mike and Donna and the kids get together with Mike's brother Steve and his wife Toddy at their house on Park Avenue, just around the corner from Nick and Louise's. There are bicycles to ride and the beach just blocks away.
<P>For Mike, August means beach plum season, and he had picked enough that year to go through 100 pounds of sugar making the jelly that he planned to give away at Christmas. He says it is the world's best. (Nobody who knows Mike Chase would expect a less extravagant claim. He is a big, intense man given to big, intense enthusiasms.) He still had a gallon of plum juice.
<P>But that could wait until Monday.
<P>He went crabbing Saturday, and on Sunday there was the trip to the Prettymans. Donna piled Mikey into the blue-ruffled car seat that had been passed down from Kelsey and Kara, and they all got into the clunky, 1993 maroon Suburban with the high-backed seats and dark-tinted windows. Mike had borrowed it so his family would be safe and comfortable while traveling.
<P>Jay and Patti Prettyman have a pond with ducks and a little tractor to ride on. There is a big, friendly golden retriever, a garden, and horses and cows. The kids got to pick corn and tomatoes to take home to their grandparents.
<P>That Sunday afternoon remains stamped into Patti's memory.
<P>"That little boy, he just stole your heart," she says. "Mr. Energy, smiles for his dad, eyes for his mom. He left little handprints of corn all over everything. We had steamed clams. And Mike just kept feeding little Mikey those clams. He'd never had them before and Mike was just amazed that he'd eat them. He kept saying, 'Look at my boy!'" 
<P>She remembers something else, too.
<P>"He'd been running all over the place, but soon as they put him in that car seat to go home, he was asleep, just like that! I remember commenting on it."
<P>Patti took a picture of Mikey and his red-haired sisters with Mike on the tractor. Mikey is sitting on Mike's knee, his white-blond hair glowing in the late afternoon sun. It would become a defense exhibit at the trial.
<P>Jay blames himself for what happened.
<P>"If they'd never come out here on Sunday, Mike wouldn't have gone down to the Rudder on Monday," he says, wiping his eyes.

<H3>A last day at the beach</H3>

<P>The Chases tried to make the most of the last day of vacation. Donna took Kelsey shopping, Mike took Kara and Mikey for a bicycle ride on the boardwalk. Kara fell off and skinned her knee, so they had ice cream cones with sprinkles on top to cheer her up. Mikey made an ice cream mess.
<P>When they got home, Donna scrubbed Mikey's face and changed his shirt and diaper. He was ready for a nap. Mike needed more sugar to finish his jelly, Donna was taking the kids for one last day at the beach.
<P>Nobody knows exactly what happened next. Grandmother Louise offered to watch Mikey, who loved cars and riding with his daddy. Mike was going by the Rudder to thank Prettyman for Sunday's outing. Contrary to 10 months' worth of stories saying Mike was at the Rudder for "a business meeting" (also the prosecution's contention at trial), Prettyman says he dropped in unexpectedly.
<P>In her taped statement, Donna recalled Mikey running around in the yard. She remembers saying that he "sure would like to go."
<P>She said Mike had "one foot on the ground, one foot in the car," a phrase prosecutors would use to build their case. She also said she "didn't tap him on the shoulder." Finally, she would say Mike didn't know the baby was in the car.
<P>In that confused and disjointed statement--coerced out of her around 10:30 Monday at duPont Institute in Wilmington while Mikey lay dying and Mike was still in jail--Donna recounted strapping him into the car seat, which was secured to the driver's-side seat in the second row even though Mike always insisted on putting the seat up front when he and Mikey were alone in the car. She said she'd expected Mikey "to be asleep before they got around the block."
<P>At some point Mike went inside and asked his father to come along. Nick was reading and declined the invitation. Mike fixed himself a sandwich and read the sports page. When he went out and climbed into the Suburban, Donna came over to get her purse. Mike complimented her on her new blue bathing suit and drove away.
<P>When Mike got to the Rudder, Prettyman was in a bad mood, and told him he'd had it and was going to sell the place. In his videotaped statement, Mike recalled telling Prettyman, "You don't want to sell your business. You just gotta control it."
<P>Before long, Prettyman's friend George McMahon called about going to look at a piece of real estate. They invited Mike along, and he offered the use of the roomy Suburban. 
<P>But McMahon wanted to drive, since his son George Jr. was in the car waiting. It was parked near the Suburban. Because of the tinted windows, no one knew that they were within a few feet of Mikey.
<P>Later, George's wife, Sharon McMahon, would testify that Mike said the kids were "all at the beach with my wife." She says she remembered wondering how many "all" were.
<P>Upon their return to the Rudder, Mike resumed the pep talk. Later, he went out to the car and retrieved some computer printouts he'd brought with him from Knoxville and stashed in the back of the Suburban, once again coming within feet of Mikey.
<P>Prettyman sobs aloud when he relives that afternoon.
<P>"For me to talk to him, to get advice from him; it's like a young kid talking to Troy Aikman. I feel I kept him at the Rudder. He was trying to help me. It's a tragedy, tragedy, tragedy.
<P>"And I know if Mike had known he was in that car, he would have just loved to bring him in, he'd have the biggest smile all over his face. He loves his children."
<P>Mike, Prettyman says, "likes underdogs. If I'd been this big successful guy, he wouldn't have liked me as much. When he finally walked out of my place, he was saying 'PMA [positive mental attitude], Jay. PMA. Be nice to your help. You gotta be nicer.' Fifteen seconds later, he discovered Mikey. He tried to help me or he'd have been long gone."
<P>Patti Prettyman was called as a witness. Jay wasn't, and the prosecution labored mightily to discredit him. Some years back, he got into trouble with the Internal Revenue Service and pleaded guilty to skimming on his taxes. The insinuation that he either bribed or threatened witnesses into giving testimony favorable to Chase was essential to the state's case.

<H3>'What kind of man are you?'</H3>

<P>After Mike discovered Mikey and ran screaming into the restaurant with the barely breathing child and after the ambulance came and after Mike was taken to the police department, he would spend more than three hours chained to a bench, wild with grief, begging someone, anyone, to tell him what was happening with his son.
<P>"Just SOP [standard operating procedure]," Dewey Beach Police Department officers would testify. But evidence shows they assumed Mike was drunk and informed hospital personnel of their belief.
<P>Mike thinks the four witnesses who encountered him in the parking lot and said they heard him say "I forgot" also assumed he was drunk. "Those people, they pick up the paper the next day and see that I'm saying I didn't know he was in there, and they say, 'Hey, this old drunk from Tennessee....'
<P>"If you opened the car door and found your child, what would you say?" Mike says. "My first thought was 'How the hell'd you get here?' My mind was running like a slot machine--you got two strawberries up and you're looking for the third one. Bananas, pineapples going by. The third one is the jackpot; the third one is the one that makes sense."
<P>Jay Prettyman says Mike grabbed him by the lapels, slammed him against the wall and yelled, "I didn't know he was in there!"
<P>Others testified that Mike said lots of things, including "I forgot;" "I murdered my boy;" "How could I forget?" and "How could I not know he was in there?" And "I didn't know. I didn't know. Oh my God, I didn't know."
<P>"There's one thing I do know," Mike says now. "Everything happened so fast, and it was so crazy. There isn't anybody that really knows, with all the commotion. They all said I was over there talking to myself. I've thought about that a million times. But there was one word I never used: remember. I didn't say 'Boy, I don't remember this, I don't remember that.' I never used the word remember.
<P>"What's imbedded in my mind is opening that door and finding my son."
<P>Prettyman did what he could to help. He went to 42 Columbia and told Mikey's grandparents there had been an accident and they needed to find Donna. 
<P>"I didn't want to alarm them. Some things that happened that day will never leave my mind. So horrifying," Prettyman says. "I went back to the police department. There was Mike, chained to a bench, tormented, beating his head against the wall. I pleaded with them to let him go with his son but they put me back in this other room and wanted me to fill out an accident report. I did it the best I could, called my secretary and told her to get [attorney] John Sandy."
<P>He also called Patti, who hurried down to Beebe Medical Center. There she saw Nick and Louise Chase, whom she did not yet know, at the front desk.
<P>"I walked over and asked the lady behind the desk what had happened," Patti recalls. "She answered in a very loud voice, 'He was drinking all day at the Rudder while his baby was locked in the car.'"
<P>The woman behind the desk may have been the same woman who denounced Nick and Louise: "What kind of people are you?" Louise Chase remembers a large, angry woman yelling at them. Rumors were all over the hospital.
<P>Meanwhile, Prettyman's secretary got hold of John Sandy, who arrived at the Dewey Beach Police Department around 5:30 p.m., before the state police. A former prosecutor, he insisted on a breath-alcohol test.
<P>"I'd been saying, 'I'm not drunk. Would someone please listen to me?'" Mike says.
<P>He says Sgt. Robert Berry, the officer who manacled him to the bench, had a rapid change of attitude once the test was performed. "You should have seen Bob Berry's eyes when they gave me that balloon and it was zero-zero," Mike says. "He was the meanest cruelest cop to me I ever saw in my life until he realized I wasn't drunk. He kept yelling, 'What kind of man are you? Go in there and drink while your son is in the car...'"
<P>The next day, after Mikey died, Sandy accompanied Mike to the Delaware State Police office to give a videotaped statement. Afterward, two detectives embraced Mike and tried to give him the keys to the Suburban. A state police spokesman would call it an accident resulting from a "miscommunication" and the devastated Chases would fly home to bury Mikey.
<P>The service was at the Church of the Ascension in Knoxville, and they sang "Jesus Loves Me" and "Tears in Heaven,' which Eric Clapton wrote after his own small son's accidental death. At the cemetery, they sang the "Barney" song--I love you, you love me. We're a happy family.
<P>The little boy who so loved cars and riding with his daddy was buried with a set of keys in his hand.

<H3>Torment after the tragedy</H3>

<P>Meanwhile the Delaware Department of Justice, headed by state Attorney General Jane Brady, started moving. Mike was not aware that anything was afoot.
<P>"I left Delaware thinking it was okay, that the investigation was over," Mike says.
<P>Mike's brother, Steve Chase, who lives in Rehoboth, monitored the situation.
<P>"September, October, November, they say, 'No problem. Just cleaning up the investigation--no indictment.' In the meantime, they were preparing for Pearl Harbor. They had all this information lined up all that time," Steve says.
<P>Brady's office started getting phone calls from Mike's friends, including, an informed source says, Vice President Albert Gore (Mike is a prominent Democrat). But there were others as well. In particular, Brady wondered why she was getting daily calls from the Knoxville News-Sentinel.
<P>The phone at Delaware State Police headquarters was ringing, too. David Ford, a Blount County bail bondsman, claimed to have witnessed a similar incident shortly before Mikey's death.
<P>Mike started smelling trouble. 
<P>"Two weeks after we got home, I heard through the grapevine that Holland Ingram had called Delaware," Mike says.
<P>Ingram is a former Copper Cellar Corporation employee who filed suit against Mike within weeks of Mikey's death alleging that she had been sexually harassed for more than a decade. She told investigators she saw Mike leave one of his children in a hot car.
<P>Mike believes the combination of Ingram's charges and the News-Sentinel's avid interest helped turn the case into a runaway train.
<P>But Mike's attorneys had affidavits from two people swearing they'd heard Ingram vow last March to get Mike Chase. She wasn't called as a witness.
<P>Ford testified in a pre-trial hearing and the judge ruled that the relevance of his testimony was outweighed by its inflammatory nature. Defense arguments turned on the legal research of Mike Chase's secret weapon--Nick Chase, who ranked first in his class at Georgetown University Law School in 1939 and taught there as well. 
<P>For months, Mike barely functioned. 
<P>Finally, he decided life was worth living. 
<P>"What am I gonna do, die? Take a Glock and blow my head off? That ain't gonna help Kara or Kelsey or my wife," Mike says.
<P>In November, he went back to work as CEO of the Copper Cellar Corporation, just before Brady announced that her office would take him to the grand jury.
<P>John Sandy petitioned successfully for Mike to appear before the grand jury. Bunitsky asked the judge to reconsider and got his way. Mike was denied the right to tell his side of the story; the grand jury didn't even see his videotaped statement. Bunitsky refused even to inform the jurors that Mike was available to speak to them. Then he attempted to have the record of these transactions sealed from public view.
<P>The family passed a bleak Christmas and Mike was indicted in January. Joe Hurley joined his defense. Bunitsky extended a plea bargain. Mike refused and requested a trial before a judge. The motion was denied and a trial date was set. They were riding the runaway train.
<P>After the acquittal, it was Jane Brady tied to the tracks: Why, Delawareans asked, did she prosecute based on such flimsy evidence?
<P>She started looking for cover. First, she used the grand jury. Then she said the state police urged her to push the case forward.
<P>There are many theories. Some say Brady--a prominent Republican who once ran for Joe Biden's Senate seat--saw political advantage in prosecuting a wealthy man who was an out-of-towner. Delaware lawyers point out that the Chase case could have gained her national prominence. Others suspect a darker motive: might someone, seeing an opportunity to eliminate a powerful Democrat, have picked up the phone and called in a favor?
<P>Brady says she was damned if she did and damned if she didn't.
<P>Steve Chase recalls the old legal clich that a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich if she so desires. "She conveniently ignored all but four witnesses who heard 'I forgot' and got a ham-sandwich indictment. My brother had the resources to fight this one-sided onslaught. What about the person who doesn't? When government avoids the truth in the interest of winning, the only people who do have a chance are the wealthy."
<H3> </H3>
<P>The whole Chase clan worked hard to insulate Kara and Kelsey from their parents' trouble. But children always know too much. And on the night Mike was acquitted, when the grownups were finally able to breathe again, there was a kids' squabble over some spaghetti. Kara pitched a fit, crying inconsolably.
<P>Her mother explains it like this: "It was the nightmare all over again. The food came and the people came. But she's seen the turmoil that comes after the food and the flowers. I just want my children to smile and to know they don't have to take care of Mommy and Daddy anymore."

<P><STRONG>There's no emergency the highly-trained Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad can't handle</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Chief Tony Blair looks tense as he holds fast in the jolting cab, barking into two radio transmitters at the same time, his arms crossed in a tangle of flesh and spiral cord. He and Medical Captain Dean Roberts are answering the day's first call and, thankfully, they're still inside what Blair calls the "golden hour"--the critical first 60 minutes of any rescue operation.
<P>Attended by siren squalls and the burnt-rubber stench of harried brakes, Roberts steers an unwieldy green first responder truck through narrow curves and densely populated intersections before hitting the I-40 westbound on-ramp from Rutledge Pike and burying the speedometer needle past 85. He, too, understands that in this business, every second counts.
<P>When the pair pulls up to the sun-bleached skeleton of a home-in-progress off Clinton Highway, KVRS Assistant Chief John Whited is already on the roof, helping four Rural Metro Emergency Medical Technicians strap a shirtless construction worker into a Stokes basket--a stretcher used for lifting and lowering emergency patients. Whited deftly hitches a canvas "spider" harness to the basket and guides the construction crew's crane operator as he hooks the spider and lowers his stricken co-worker to the ground.
<P>"We treat him like he has a broken back," Roberts says of the worker, who--it later turns out--suffered relatively minor injuries when a roof truss collapsed and pinned him. "You always treat for the worst and hope for the best."
<P>Most of the 80-plus members of the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad have seen the best, the worst, and all shades in between. From the brutal and horrifying (in 1994, Roberts helped extricate a West Knoxville youth who was castrated and crippled when 75 feet of guard rail tore through his out-of-control pickup), to the tragic (the squad's dive team once worked for six years to recover the body of a drowned child), to the comic and the outright absurd (cats in culverts, puppies in ditches, keys locked in cars), they've probed the outer limits of human experience in the caves and quarries, hills and highways of East Tennessee.
<P>But despite a four-decade run as Knox County's reigning rescue specialists, despite the daunting credentials and scrolling certifications of members, despite tens of thousands of unpaid man-hours logged every year, KVRS remains an unknown quantity, a footnote at the end of newspaper stories or a passing reference on local TV. At a recent emergency services meeting held to discuss the fate of local emergency medical services under the proposed city-county unification charter, Blair says the officials present "didn't even know what we did. They didn't even realize we needed to be invited."
<P>For the record, the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad has been serving Knox and surrounding counties since 1956 and is the region's largest volunteer organization. What sets KVRS apart from similar squads is its single-minded, pro-active approach to rescue operations.
<P>"Basically, rescue squads came into being in Tennessee to help look for lost people and to drag rivers," Blair says, noting that membership was often made up of retired and volunteer firemen. "They were usually 'good old boys' clubs. We've always striven for a generally younger, more innovative membership."
<P>Adds Whited, "We don't have ambulances. We don't have tankers or any of that other stuff. We specialize in rescue. We don't want to duplicate services provided by other local agencies."
<P>In 1982, KVRS further separated itself from its backwoods brethren--and most rescue squads across the country, for that matter--by creating specialty teams so that members could cultivate expertise in one or two areas rather than spread limited time and resources across the spectrum of rescue techniques.
<P>While all members are skilled in basic disciplines (especially vehicle extrication--about 55 percent of the squad's 3,000 yearly calls are car accidents), everyone joins at least one of the specialty crews: the cave and vertical rescue team; the heavy rescue team, for building and trench collapse; the ground search team; the water and dive team; the communications team; or the support team, which provides everything from food to medical equipment to lights and power generators for KVRS and other emergency agencies during long-term operations.
<P>The team's innovative training approach, as well as its success in the field, has garnered plenty of attention outside Knoxville. Over the last few years KVRS has worked on several internationally distributed textbooks and demonstration videos; in 1995 it was spotlighted in two syndicated television programs (Rescue 911 and Emergency Response) as well as toasted on the cover of Rescue, the field's most prominent national magazine.
<P>That list doesn't include the accomplishments of individual team members, many of whom have taught national seminars, published instructional literature, and even trained members of other area emergency departments.
<P>"Our training and our equipment really set us apart," says Whited, one of four members who will teach at this year's Tennessee Association of Rescue Squads convention. "You won't find better--especially not for the money."
<H3> </H3>
<P>Like slain Nordic warriors supping in Valhalla, KVRS members gathered at the station on a lazy afternoon are given to blood-stained reminiscence. But in these all-too-vivid recollections of battles past, the horrors of torn flesh and lifeless bodies are lightened only part of the time by rays of redemption and triumph. Whited remembers his first trench rescue, digging out a utility worker buried up to his chest in dirt and raw sewage, his leg twisted around a ladder at the bottom of a 19-foot trench.
<P>"Fourteen hours in some very nasty conditions," Whited says. "He lost his leg, but he survived. We have an annual Christmas party and he comes by every year to thank us."
<P>Training Captain Matt Lovitt recalls a wreck that sent an 18-wheeler and a Mustang loaded with passengers over a steep bank, pinning the truck driver against a tree and scattering mangled bodies across the hillside: "Everywhere you'd start to walk, you'd find someone else."
<P>It's an endless, wretched litany--the high school student whose car was crushed like an empty can by a cement mixer; sandwiched car seats pried apart in search of victims; the man who was found wrapped in crimson-spattered sheet metal, standing at rigid post-mortem attention in the cab of his overturned pickup.
<P>"If you've ever seen a dog with its insides hanging out on the side of the road, remember that it happens to people, too," Roberts says. "It's the sickest thing you've ever smelled, and it stays in your nose and on your clothes for hours. Jeff [Beeler, vehicle captain] calls it the 'smell of death.'"
<P>When some of the members talk about their experiences, they speak with an air of casual detachment, as if the things they've seen actually happened to characters in a book or actors on TV. At times, there's even a trace of sunless humor in off-hand references to decapitations and severed limbs.
<P>"Some might say I'm morbid," says Roberts. "But if you don't have a release, you explode. You can't let the ugly parts get to you."
<P>But some tragedies inevitably hit closer to home, such as the local diver who drowned near Cherokee last year when he inadvertently swam inside an underwater cave and lost his way. "I lost some sleep on that one," says Roberts, "because I knew it could have just as easily been me."
<P>In one sense it did happen to Roberts, as well as every other member of the water rescue team and perhaps the entire squad. Last summer, KVRS's Corey Berggren was diving in the Blount Avenue quarry when he suffered a seizure brought on by an improper mixture of gases in his oxygen tank. When Berggren shot straight to the surface from a depth of 212 feet, his body couldn't withstand the stress of such a brutally rapid pressure change and he died of heart failure on the scene.
<P>Whited says Berggren had authored instructional scuba-diving manuals and was considered one of the best-trained divers in the southeast. He was also the first member in the squad's 40-year history to die on the battlefield. When asked about him today, his teammates speak with a strange mix of detachment, muffled sadness and restless unease. A shiny, wood-mounted commemorative plaque, inscribed with Berggren's name, stands alone in the center of the squad's front-room trophy case, part memory and part reminder.
<P>Berggren's death and the other attendant horrors and pitfalls of the rescuer's world seem to raise doubts as to the sanity of the 60-some-odd men and 15 women who--for little recognition and less pay--regularly stick their necks on the chopping block in the service of KVRS. The reasons members give for volunteering vary as much as their names and faces, and the psychological profile isn't an easy one to peg. But there is a certain stripe of benevolence, tempered in varying degrees by vicarious urges, tinkerer's instincts and competitive spirit--a mutant strain of altruism that seems to run throughout the entire squad.
<P>"It's a way to channel your competitiveness--there are a lot of ex-athletes around here," says Whited. At 29, the slender former Farragut High School football player may not be a linebacker anymore, but that man-in-the-middle determination is still chiseled in the obstinate set of his jaw.
<P>"You have experiences you won't get anywhere else in any field. It's an addiction. You can't get any higher than when you've just saved a life."
<H3> </H3>
<P>The parking lot of KVRS headquarters off Rutledge Pike is full of he-man four-wheeler Jeeps, pickups, Blazers and other rugged off-road stalwarts. Inside, however, there's a surprisingly diverse group of raw recruits--pretty young girls, grizzled men in ball caps, middle-aged housewives, dudes barely of college age in T-shirts and khakis--seated in a half-circle listening to squad member Kevin Burns explain the finer points of rappelling equipment and technique.
<P>After the lecture, Burns, Whited and Lovitt lead the group to a 30-foot wooden tower out back for a hands-on demonstration. Several squad members clad in trademark gray T-shirts, white helmets and green pants swarm the tower, which is crisscrossed with canvas straps and dangling sundry nylon ropes.
<P>Fifteen minutes later, five yellow climbing ropes are hanging from the rear of the tower and a thicker blue one extends diagonally down the front, the far end having been wrapped around a phone pole in the corner of the yard some 70 feet away. The slanting blue rope is called a traverse line, a device used by rescue workers to lower accident victims from high places. In this particular demonstration, the make-believe patient happens to be an unsuspecting young reporter.
<P>Strapping the dupe securely into a Stokes basket (a surprisingly flexible plastic shell with a spare aluminum skeleton), Burns connects patient to rope with a canvas spider and a pulley. Guided by two additional lines--one hanging directly beneath it and one leading back to the tower--the basket descends slowly and smoothly through a crown of leafy branches and into the sun-dappled yard below.
<P>Properly edified, the 20 recruits file back inside for a written test. They're in the middle of a 16-week orientation program, and they'll each go through more than 100 hours of training before pulling their first shift. KVRS orientation is an exercise in forbearance, as even recruits with prior specialty training must rehash the rudiments before strapping on scuba tanks or climbing up ropes on official business. No one in this class will so much as touch a rescue truck (unless it's with a squeegee or a sponge) before September.
<P>According to Lovitt, each trainee also has to be certified in several basic skills, including CPR and emergency vehicle operation (imagine driver's ed with fire trucks). Those who endure and become full-fledged members will have to complete "first responder" medical training within the year.
<P>"We started out with 100 people when we signed up this class," Lovitt says. "I expect 10 to 15 will actually finish and be assigned to a shift, and several of those will end up resigning. It gets tough when you're working eight to 10 hours a day, and you're required to volunteer at least 12 hours a week."
<P>But even for seasoned veterans, the training never really ends. Each member must be recertified in basic disciplines every two years, and it's not unusual to pull up to KVRS headquarters on a scorching afternoon and see squad members in helmets and heavy yellow canvas jackets systematically ravaging a dilapidated junker with crowbars, saws, and the famous "jaws of life."
<P>And then there are the specialty teams, which meet once a month for practice and coordination. The dive team runs its paces plumbing the depths of flooded quarries, while the vertical rescue squad hops off the tower or pokes around local caves.
<P>For both heavy and vertical rescue team practice, squad members built "the tank"--a system of narrow plastic pipes and metal cylinders that feed into a car-sized concrete box and a rusted-out septic tank beneath the tower. Would-be rescuers rappel from the top or crawl in through the side while sadistic squadmates pump in smoke or water, simulating the hazards of confined space operations.
<P>"Each team has basic standards and protocols that have to be met before they will allow new members to take an active role on calls," says Blair. "But there's no single level of 'readiness.' There's always another level of experience you can attain."
<P>Some of the teams rely heavily on outside training. Although Water Rescue Lieutenant John Yu is a Public Safety Diving Instructor, the squad sends new trainees through courses taught by Dive Rescue International. All of the vertical rescue basics, however, are administered by Whited, who boasts countless certifications in his specialty, all of which reaffirm that this is a man who really knows the ropes of ropes.
<P>But Whited isn't the only savvy veteran on the squad. Vertical rescue team members speak in reverent tones when they mention Jack Thomison, a rugged, square-jawed spelunking enthusiast who, someone jokes, "took God in his first cave." Thomison, along with wife/fellow squad member Nancy, has been exploring muddy nether kingdoms for more than 25 years, and his subterranean grace, agility and sheer economy of motion are legend at KVRS. "When Jack caves, there's no wasted effort," says Whited. "And if he's got a spare moment, you can bet he's probably underground."
<P>As head of the squad's highest profile team, Yu is one of the few KVRS members who occasionally receives public recognition--he was recently nominated and selected as a torch-bearer for the 1996 Olympic Games through the United Way's Community Heroes program. But no one begrudges this bright-eyed Chinese American his due--hundreds of pounds of water pressure can wreak havoc with the fragile human body, and diving is probably the most dangerous job in rescue.
<P>Even though the water rescue team was called 37 times in 1995 alone, Whited says the squad hasn't had to drag for a body in more than three years--thanks in large part to Yu and powerhouse divers such as Roberts.
<P>Speaking to a class of recruits on a warm Wednesday evening, Yu is colorful, vibrant, and often spell-binding, holding the trainees rapt with stories, jokes, and impromptu demonstrations. He compares diving Fort Loudon Lake to "sticking your head in a toilet bowl" (referring to the visibility, not the stench); describes an automobile accident that tore out his transmission and broke his arm in 100 places ("My arm looked like my last name, but now my car has air conditioning"); and recommends Crest toothpaste as a mask defogger ("It works better and its smells pretty good--if you like Crest").
<P>But the most riveting moment of his presentation--the one that will probably convince all of these wide-eyed rescue neophytes that life holds no grander drama than that which is enacted on the emergency diver's dark watery stage--comes when Yu describes the big rescue call that dissipates a sleepy fog in the dead of the night.
<P>"The first thing out of my mouth is always 'Oh, shit!'" he says with characteristic joviality. But as quickly as his broad grin had materialized, it disappears. Slowly, with deliberate, penetrating clarity, he continues: "Then you lay back, and it sinks in. You look at your watch and you say to yourself, 'The clock is ticking.'"
<H3> </H3>
<P>The same unyielding determination that sends John Yu plunging into murky depths or John Whited clambering up the side of a mountain also fosters in the two men a dogged protective instinct when it comes to the future of their squad. And they may need every ounce of fighting spirit they can muster; with the city-county merger looming and local government purse strings drawing ever tighter, KVRS faces threats far removed from uncharted quarries or cascading trench walls.
<P>At present, the squad is funded by a mixture of city and county monies, United Way allocations, and private donations (the 1996 budget breaks down to about $45,000 city, $100,000 county, $89,000 United Way), and Blair says procuring new revenue gets a little bit tougher every year.
<P>In the meantime, Blair says the proposed city-county unification charter doesn't address the oversight and funding of KVRS. The charter calls for the consolidation of county emergency services, but it doesn't say whether volunteer organizations will be receiving any public funds.
<P>And although Blair says county officials told him the proposed merger probably wouldn't affect the squad's status, lingering jurisdictional questions may yet spell trouble for the organization as the Knoxville Fire Department--the only other large agency equipped for vehicle extrication--takes point on more and more calls that fall within county borders. (In an ironic twist, KVRS taught KFD's first vehicle extrication class.)
<P>"Nine-one-one will send a city fire truck to an extrication or traffic injury call that's closer to the rescue squad," Blair says with a note of exasperation. "The best answer I've gotten is that the city is required by law to send one of their trucks. You can still send KFD, but you should always call the closest unit first. You can't let politics play a bigger role than the patient's well-being."
<P>Blair says those calls are the glue that holds the squad together, the bread-and-butter that nourishes volunteer interest and sustains membership, and he offers compelling reasons why it's in the public's best interests for KVRS to flourish.
<P>The squad's 1996 annual budget of less than $250,000 will enable more than 80 volunteers to keep $1.8 million worth of trucks, boats and other assorted rescue equipment in operation (almost all of the organization's maintenance and upkeep chores are done in-house), performing services that, save for small-scale vehicle extrication, no other local agency provides.
<P>"The money we get would barely pay for our man-hours if all our people were paid an EMT's minimum salary," Blair says. "Unless you just forego those services, it would cost a lot less to have us than not to have us."
<P>Given the nature of politics and the uncertainties of the proposed city-county merger, it's probably too early to predict what might happen to KVRS in the coming years--whether its day-to-day functions will be swallowed by other local agencies with less specialized training and equipment or whether some new hybrid government will decide it behooves us to continue channeling limited public funds into an organization that provides a vital but esoteric service.
<P>But it's probably safe to predict that sometime--maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe next month--somebody somewhere in Knox County or its rugged hinterlands will slip on a rock coming down a steep mountain trail, or try to swim after one too many drinks at a summer lakeside party, or maybe wrap a car around a tree when a malignant country road pulls the asphalt out from underneath the wheels. When that happens, it's a pretty good bet that some cool-headed Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad veterans will hop in one of those bright green first responder trucks laden with tools and ropes and state-of-the-art gear, and do their damnedest to make a difference.

Truth, Justice, and the American Way</H1>
<P><STRONG>Will a new justice center provide a happy home for our city and county law enforcement agencies?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>A handful of grim new inmates sit on their hands on the three worn metal benches that line the walls of the Knox County Jail intake center. The attending officers work from a cluster of open desks; the booking equipment sits in a promiscuous huddle in a far corner. Once an ordinary office space in the City-County Building, this makeshift facility now serves as the registration desk for all of the county's new overnight guests.
<P>"The intake facility is inadequate in every respect--size, layout, design, and security," says Dwight Van de Vate, the director of planning and development for the Knox County Sheriff's Department, surveying a small carpeted waiting room (now a holding cell) that obviously wasn't designed with volatile criminal offenders in mind. "We had one escape attempt where an inmate went up through the ceiling tiles and crashed through the light fixtures in the hallway."
<P>Should a detainee become violent during intake, Van de Vate notes that officers would have to wend their way through a maze of narrow halls, around several metal detectors and onto an elevator before they could deposit the struggling inmate in a real holding cell in the jail one floor below. 
<P>If the intake center looks like an old Night Court set, the jail itself is straight out of Eastwood's Alcatraz. "Now you see why this is called a linear facility," Van de Vate says as he strolls through a seemingly endless black corridor, flanked on either side by menacing rows of heavy iron bars. "A layout like this requires much more staff and affords much less control over the inmates."
<P>There's little question that Knox County needs, and will eventually have, a new intake center and jail with all the electronic steel doors, vacuum-sealed holding tanks and concentrically arrayed inmate dormitories ("podular direct supervision housing") that constitute cutting-edge correctional design. There's also a general consensus that the new facility needs to be free-standing, separate from the 17-year-old City-County Building.
<P>But as county commissioners move tentatively toward fulfilling a nine-year-old federal mandate, other local officials are gridlocked over whether the proposed facility should also include law enforcement offices, courts, and other branches of the legal system.
<P>Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison insists that a new jail should have new administrative offices for the Sheriff's Department, the organization responsible for its oversight. Others maintain that it also needs easy access to the criminal courts which, in the City-County building, are only an elevator ride away.
<P>But given that many criminal cases are tried in general sessions courts, and given the overlapping jurisdictions of the county's three court clerks, some officials believe that it behooves the county to put the entire system in a single location--a Justice Center, a sprawling downtown campus with space for detention, courts, clerks, the attorney general's office, and all branches of law enforcement.
<P>According to Jeff Wilkins, county director of facilities planning, a study committee will choose one of several downtown sites, including blocks at Hill Avenue off Henley Street (site of the Lord Lindsey dance club), the Gay Street block that was once the proposed site of a new federal courthouse, and the two-block stretch along State Street currently home to Manpower Temporary Services and a handful of other businesses.
<P>Complicating those plans, however, are a host of squabbles and animosity between several county officials, and a county budget pinch that will only get worse if the city-county unification charter (which contains a three-year property tax moratorium) is approved in a November referendum.
<P>"I think it will eventually boil down to money," says County Commissioner Frank Leuthold, chairman of the Justice Study Committee and the Commission's Finance Committee. "And whatever we end up with, somebody is probably going to scream."
<H3> </H3>
The roots of the proposal go back to 1987, when Knox and several other Tennessee counties were targeted in a class action suit (initiated by Knox inmate Wayne Carver) that sought to alleviate overcrowded jail conditions precipitated by yawning gaps between state and federal detention standards. Then-County Executive Dwight Kessel responded by promising Federal Judge James Jarvis that the county would build an intake center and detention facility by 1990.
<P>The county made good on half of that promise when it opened a new penal farm on Maloneyville Road in East Knoxville two years ago. Plans for the intake center, however, floundered. "Every site we chose, someone had a reason not to use it," Van de Vate says.
<P>Sheriff Tim Hutchison is more blunt. He places the blame for any delays squarely on the shoulders of County Executive Tommy Schumpert (who took office in 1994.) Hutchison charges that Schumpert stalled the intake center by scrapping the work done by Knoxville architecture firm Barber and McMurry, with whom the county had contracted for the project in 1989, and by micro-managing plans for the intake center without consulting him.
<P>"I think (Schumpert) just halfway believes he's everyone's boss, that elected constitutional officers are just department heads who work for him," Hutchison says. "That's not so. This is another one of those cases where (the Sheriff's Department) has to operate it solely, be responsible for it, be accountable for it.
<P>"We are still under court order to complete this facility. Mr. Schumpert's stopping the process to start all over from scratch has delayed it considerably."
<P>Schumpert responds that while the Sheriff's Department may have to wait on new administrative offices if the project runs over budget, the plans for the intake center have proceeded with "due diligence."
<P>"We've gone in with the consultant and moved as quickly and efficiently as possible," Schumpert says. "The intake center is our overriding concern. I'm sure the sheriff would like to see plans for the administrative office move a little faster, but the intake center is our number one priority."
<P>Other officials point to the fact that Kessel's original capital plan didn't call for the intake center to be funded until the latter part of the decade. And it was Kessel, not Schumpert, who appointed the Justice Study Committee--the group of 20-some-odd lawyers and public officials charged with crafting plans for a new intake center.
<P>In any case, the Committee eventually hired CGA Consulting Services of Columbia, S.C., to help shape the proposal that will go before County Commission in September. Although consultant Bob Goble isn't due to submit his recommendations until August, his preliminary findings suggest that the county would be best served by a facility that consolidates the entire legal system--detention, courts, and all arms of law enforcement.
<P>"The study is headed toward the idea that everything be located in a single downtown site," Goble says. "Justice systems have tremendous interrelationships, and it's very inefficient to split those functions up across different buildings."
<P>But putting all components of the justice system in one location is much easier said than done. Presently, Knox County has three chancery courts, four circuit courts, three criminal courts, five general sessions courts and one juvenile court. (Located on Division Street, the juvenile court and offices would not be involved in a move.)
<P>The chancery courts, which handle some civil suits and all questions of law (wills, contracts, etc.) are located on the first floor of the City-County Building, along with two of the criminal courts (the third resides on the third floor). The circuit courts, located on the main floor, handle most lawsuits, save for the Fourth Circuit (with presiding Judge Bill Swann), which hears domestic cases.
<P>The general sessions courts, which handle small claims, misdemeanor offenses, and arraignments, are split between City-County and the old courthouse next door. That layout is already a source of public confusion; as one J.S.C. member quips, "sometimes, even lawyers don't know where to go."
<P>Should the courts be split between a new justice center and the facilities already in use, the arrangement will be further complicated by the fact that court clerks Martha Phillips (criminal courts and domestic relations) and Lillian Bean (circuit court and general sessions) each handle both civil and criminal cases.
<P>Given current budget constraints, most J.S.C. members feel the courts will probably face some sort of unwieldy division. "More criminals appear in sessions court for arraignment than in criminal courts," Leuthold says. "Even if you leave criminal courts where they are now (in City-County), you need at least one sessions courtroom, plus room for clerks and attorneys."
<P>And if the justice system's sundry parts are like blood relatives, different branches of the same family tree, they're also subject to rampant domestic disputes. "It would be hard to get them all to agree to celebrate Christmas on December 25," says another official connected to the study committee.
<P>So what are the wish lists of the players involved? Most observers say criminal court judges will readily embrace relocation, eager to leave behind the open halls and low-security design features of the City-County Building. "They want tight security, and City-County just wasn't built for that," says lawyer Bruce Anderson, chairman of the J.S.C.'s civil court subcommittee.
<P>Fourth Circuit Court Judge Swann, who presides over often-volatile domestic cases, shares that outlook. Swann characterizes pending efforts to retro-fit the City-County Building with walk-through metal detectors and other security devices as too little and too late.
<P>"The present building is an airy cathedral, as open as the marketplace of ideas," Swann says. "A new facility would be architecturally designed for security, as opposed to a cut-and-paste job on our old one."
<P>But Swann's civil court brethren apparently prefer City-County's accessibility and have resisted the notion of moving. "Some judges are just very comfortable working in this building and don't see the need for a new courthouse," says Wilkins, the facilities director. "The trouble with separate courts is you end up splitting the clerks and you end up splitting the juries. That creates problems."
<P>Court clerks, says Anderson, would benefit most from having a consolidated justice facility, as the unified system would allow them to staff fewer branch offices. "Privately, I think they all want their offices consolidated," says Anderson.
<P>But Bean, who says she's pleased with the J.S.C.'s progress, notes that her office's functions are already split among five branches (in City-County, the old courthouse, and the juvenile center on Division Street) and says the new facility will probably neither increase nor reduce her workload. 
<P>"I think we also need to ask whether separate courthouses are in the best interests of the public," says Anderson. "I haven't heard anyone talk about public convenience so far and I think that ought to be a factor."
<P>All of these considerations may be rendered moot when the study committee presents its findings to County Commission in September. The county's most recent capital improvements plan, which maps out expenditures from 1997 to 2001, allocates $50 million for the project. Most committee members are reluctant to speculate how much justice center those millions will purchase until Goble makes his final recommendation.
<P>"When they were formulating the capital plan, there had to be some kind of price tag put on (the project)," says justice systems administrator Cynthia Chapman. "That $50 million came with all kinds of disclaimers. It could cost less or, with the way building and planning often go, it could cost more."
<P>According to Leuthold, county commissioners aren't likely to be pliant when confronted with the prospect of stretching the budget. He notes that several must-do school projects in the capital plan have already seen requests for new funds denied.
<P>"The real question is, Do we build a dream palace no one can afford, or do we build what we have to and do more on down the road?" says Leuthold. "At some point we will probably have to start ranking what we want and what we need, and it's unlikely that we'll be able to provide everything the participants want."
<P>In all likelihood, says Leuthold, the Commission will fund a new intake center and jail with administrative offices for the Sheriff's Department and choose a site and a design that will facilitate expansion.
<P>But even plans for the intake center--the only clear mandate in the entire proposal--are mired in charges that progress has been hampered by procrastination and interdepartmental meddling. Leuthold worries that County Commission's incessant fiscal hand-wringing will further delay the project. If the federal court isn't satisfied with their progress, Leuthold says, the county is subject to draconian sanctions, including fines and jail time for officials. 
<P>"I don't intend to go to the pen so people don't have to pay taxes to pay for something the federal judge says they have to build," Leuthold says. "But I think he'll be lenient if we just keep the project moving." The clock is ticking: most committee members agree that the new facility won't host its first detainee before 2001.
<P>Officials at the Sheriff's Department charge that the new center's grand opening has been pushed into the next century by interference from other departments. Van de Vate points to a list of department heads--court clerks, civil judges, data processing officials--invited to a subcommittee meeting to discuss such issues as cell-block size and inmate laundry procedure at the new jail.
<P>"By law, the Sheriff's Department is the only organization responsible for the care of county inmates," Van de Vate says with what can best be described as polite exasperation. "But we've had encroachment from other county officials who don't have any experience in this particular specialty. When that happens, you end up with delays and flaws in both procedure and design. These people simply don't have a contribution to make where these issues are concerned.
<P>"In the end, it may not make sense to unify all functions of the legal system. We're talking about very different interests, and there are inherent limits in how much these things can be brought together. the idea that you have this building where you walk in one side, pay your ticket or serve your time and walk out free on the other side is an extreme oversimplification."
<P>The one issue that doesn't seem to cause much concern amid all the finger-pointing and logistical confusion is the fate of any empty City-County space left in the wake of relocation. Given the fertility rate of most bureaucracies and the claustrophobia that seems to have afflicted everything from the public works department to the local veterans affairs office, no one seems worried about leaving a useless seven-story husk off Hill Avenue.
<P>"There's plenty of departments that need extra room, and we could alleviate some of the overcrowding," Wilkins says. "Over the years, I'm sure all the vacated spaces would eventually be filled with other government offices."

A Man of Many Causes</H1>
<P><STRONG>Environmental activist Stephen Smith is challenging one of the most firmly entrenched Republican Congressmen in the nation</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Bill Dockery</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Stephen Smith is not afraid of big tasks or daunting odds. He seems to relish the role of underdog, a David who, as quick as he gets a lick in on Goliath, goes looking for another giant to rock.
<P>In the late '80s he took on the United States Department of Energy over the manufacture of nuclear armaments and the toxic pollution that results. Some, including people on the other side of the issue, credit him with making a lasting difference in the nuclear-environmental debate, not only in East Tennessee but nationally.
<P>His next opponent was the Tennessee Valley Authority, the country's largest utility. He fought them over nuclear power and conservation policies, and his efforts have been met with increased citizen input into advance planning at the federal agency.
<P>For years, he's been fighting that intractable human trait, cruelty to animals, most recently as a veterinarian at the Knox County Humane Society.
<P>But for all the visibility his activism has brought him on the news pages of East Tennessee, Smith's most recent challenge to a giant has garnered him precious little attention.
<P>He is taking on U.S. Rep. John Duncan Jr. for the Second District congressional seat that has been virtually a Duncan family heirloom for over three decades.
<P>That challenge may be the most daunting the Nashville native has taken on in his 34 years of life. He'll not only have to defeat the popular conservative lawmaker as a Democrat in one of the country's most Republican districts--going up against a Duncan-centered power structure that is deeply embedded in Knoxville's civic life--but he's also trying to make the race from within a local Democratic establishment that is (a) not sure he's their man, and (b) despairing that any Democrat can win the seat.
<P>As a man with a public history of involvement on important issues, Smith is the first serious candidate to take on Duncan in several years. And to a large extent, the story of Stephen Smith's candidacy is also the story of his causes.

<H3>Mr. Smith wants to go to Washington</H3>

<P>Stephen Smith made his first appearance on the East Tennessee stage in 1988, when he entered the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. He had grown up in Green Hills, a well-to-do community in Nashville where his father was a cardiologist at Vanderbilt University Hospital.
<P>"I grew up," he says, "in a family that was well off, but I was always aware of people struggling and not getting by."
<P>He quickly established himself as one of the area's most passionate and articulate environmental advocates, and he has made his reputation as a leader with a string of activist groups: OREPA (the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance), TVERC (the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition, in which he serves as executive director), and FGS (the Foundation for Global Sustainability).
<P>Now Smith wants to turn from his outsider role as critic because, he says, of his concerns about where the country is headed under its current leadership, especially after the victories of conservative Republicans in the 1994 election.
<P>"I asked myself the question: What would be the most important thing that I could be doing?" Smith says. "There's nothing else I could think of that's more important than turning back the radical right and gaining some sense of sanity in Washington."

<H3>The growth of an activist</H3>

<P>Smith's move toward activism started while he was an undergraduate at Kentucky Wesleyan College in Owensboro in the late '80s. He worked with the local humane society there, and also joined the Bridge Alliance, a group opposing a PCB processing plant near Henderson, Ky.
<P>No sooner did he arrive in East Tennessee than he co-founded, with Ralph Hutchison, a group that opposed the manufacture of nuclear weapons in Oak Ridge and the attendant pollution the plants brought. OREPA soon became one of DOE's most persistent critics, and Smith and Hutchison led various protests, including annual Hiroshima Day gatherings.
<P>"It was not pleasant going to work and having all those organizations criticizing us," remembers James T. Alexander, who retired a couple of years ago as the head of DOE's public information office in Oak Ridge. "They were tough. It was not very comfortable. We were put on the hot seat."
<P>But Alexander developed a high degree of respect for Smith and Hutchison, and now feels that the attention they forced on Oak Ridge environmental issues put the local office way ahead of other DOE facilities across the country.
<P>"Steve was a very sharp individual who always did his homework, a very quick study, a bright individual," Alexander says. "I credit the kind of scrutiny that Steve and OREPA placed on us with preparing us for the future. Only through that scrutiny did dollars come to Oak Ridge for cleanup."
<P>The group would pore over governmental documents and question conflicting statements in phone calls or at press conferences. Smith and Hutchison became so well-versed in the environmental issues that they would take visiting journalists on their own tours, visiting the accessible parts of the DOE reservation.
<P>"Sometimes the events would be heavy in emotion, reflecting the intensity of their cause," Alexander reflects. "But if everyone had done their homework and study like that. . . ."
<P>From Oak Ridge, it was but a hop, skip, and an activist jump to TVA. Smith became a board member of TVERC in 1992, and in 1993 became its executive director. His attention to nuclear matters did not waver, and under his leadership TVERC became one of the agency's most outspoken critics, especially on the Watts Bar nuclear plant, which had been under construction for two decades.
<P>When Craven Crowell became TVA board chairman and began to seek public involvement in planning for TVA's future, Smith became TVERC's representative on the review group that critiqued that process. Some of the TVA people who worked with Smith on the agency's Integrated Resource Plan remember him as diligent and sharp.
<P>"He was very thoughtful and worked real hard," says one TVA staffer. "He read everything we sent, and we sent tons of paper. Toward the end of the process we were quite frankly struggling to come up with a good solution. Stephen and a few others pulled into a subgroup working with TVA staff and came up with excellent solutions to what we were trying to do."
<P>Smith's activism almost damaged his cause as he worked on the TVA document. As the review process neared its completion, Earth First, a radical environmental group, staged a protest at the Watts Bar nuclear plant, trespassing and vandalizing government property. Though Smith was not arrested during the protests, he was nabbed when he went to see protesters who were being held at the Rhea County jail. TVA investigators later linked him through phone records to the people staging the protests.
<P>"He erred in judgment in participating in the Watts Bar protests," says a TVA staffer. "It hurt his credibility inside TVA and with some of the people in the group. There were real strong opinions about whether he should continue in the review process, but management ultimately decided to allow it."
<P>Not everyone remembers Smith's interactions with TVA so positively. John Waters Jr., former TVA board member and chairman, recalls not being so impressed with Smith and other activists.
<P>"My general impression was that they are very anti-nuclear people," he says. "They were very careless with the facts. That organization said people were dying as a result of nuclear power, but there's no record to prove that."
<P>TVA staffers still talk about one especially intense meeting when both Waters' and Smith's tempers flared into a yelling match. "It was ugly," one says.
<P>Waters, one of the region's leading Republicans, admits to a bias in assessing Smith's campaign. "It's difficult to be objective. John Duncan has done a fantastic job. He's more than proven himself outstanding, beyond what his father did."

<H3>Taking it to the voters</H3>

<P>A group of mostly African American seniors has finished their supper at the Martin Luther King Center in Alcoa. They settle back to hear a selection of candidates, including Smith.
<P>The challenger's points are simple and most sound like the issues common in races across the country:
<P><LI> Protecting senior citizens from cuts in Medicare and Medicaid that would also provide tax cuts for the wealthy. "I'm not rich enough to vote Republican, and you're probably not either."
<P><LI> "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work." Smith says he deplores trends indicating that while productivity has gone up for American businesses, the majority of working people have not shared in the resulting profits.
<P><LI> Promoting education and research in the Tennessee Valley, linking federal agencies, universities and schools in cooperative ventures.
<P><LI> Environmental protection, especially for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Here the challenger feels that his environmental activism clearly distinguishes him from the pro-business congressman. "You can't push environmental protection back on the states. You can't tell each state to do its own thing. There must be a coordinated effort, and the best group to do that is the federal government."
<H3> </H3>
<P>For a man who has spent much of his adult life protesting government policies, he comes across as very supportive of federalism.
<P>"You'll never hear this from Jimmy Duncan, but the federal government has been good to East Tennessee," Smith elaborates later. "We have Oak Ridge, the national park, TVA, the national forests. . . . As taxpayers we get more from the federal government than we pay in."
<P>"It's high time we spoke the truth. We're fortunate that people had the foresight to make investments in East Tennessee. We're still reaping the benefits. It's supremely ironic to have an incumbent trying to cut back on federal programs when our region is so dependent on them."

<H3>"Congress is sick as a dog..."</H3>

<P>Smith often uses a slogan as an ice-breaker when he's introduced to potential voters. "Congress is sick as a dog. We need to send a vet to Washington."
<P>As involved in causes as Smith has been, it's easy to forget that he actually completed his veterinary degree at UT and is now practicing. After two years with an animal hospital in Newport, he now is the consulting veterinarian for the Knox County Humane Society, a part-time job he's held since 1994. He supervises the medical care of some 15,000 animals the society takes in every year.
<P>One recent Thursday morning finds him at work at the society's headquarters deep in the back reaches of Vestal. With the society's director, Vicki Crosetti, Smith is inspecting some of the animals belonging to a well-known "collector" whose animals have been seized by the city because they are neglected.
<P>A red dog, more Pekingese than not, has what Smith calls "cherry eye." The dog is stiff as the doctor begins his inspection, but as Smith gently cleans infection from its eyes, it relaxes a little. He drops a fluorescent yellow dye into its right eye, which has an ulcer on the cornea itself.
<P>"This will let us see how deep the ulcer goes," he explains. He talks to the dog softly as he flushes the shining drops out of the eye, and its tail begins to wag.
<P>Another dog of similar parentage is brought out limping on a right forepaw.
<P>"This leg has been broken some time ago and has healed without medical care," he says after palpating the floppy paw. "In fact, the broken bone didn't knit back together, and now the bone in the foot is no longer attached to the leg."
<P>"Will we need to amputate it?" Crosetti wants to know.
<P>"No, the dog's adjusted and is making some use of the leg," Smith says.
<P>The morning continues with inspections of other animals seized from the collector as Smith pursues the concern for animals that first sparked his activism.
<P>"I've never been a vet full-time. Helping animals in a clinic is one part, but I soon found that working to protect their habitat is another large piece of it," he says. 
<P>
<P>The "send a vet to Washington" joke is a humorous hint at Smith's fifth plank--campaign reform. He supports term limits and wants campaign financing reformed. He proposes a plan that would make television stations offer free or low-cost TV time to candidates as a return for the stations' access to the public airways.
<P>"Republicans don't have a patent on term limits," he says, pointing to what he calls the Duncan dynasty, the 30-plus-year-total that Duncans senior and junior have represented the Second District. "Democracy, not dynasty," is one of his rallying cries.
<P>For all that, he does not categorically reject support from political action committees, though he has not yet received PAC money. His donations have generally been small and from individuals, and workers say privately that the campaign coffers are shallow.
<P>"I don't like PACs," he says, "but I don't like it more that we've got an important message to get out and I'm afraid it's not going to get out."
<P>Smith candidly admits that he's not expecting much support from the Democratic Party nationally, since the accepted wisdom among Democrats and Republicans alike is that beating Duncan is, at best, a long shot.

<H3>Looking for weaknesses</H3>

<P>Smith pins his election hopes on his analysis of Duncan's strengths and weaknesses. He praises Duncan for personal services to the people of the district.
<P>"So many people have had an interaction with him," Smith says. "His staff has helped many get passports or social security checks. People feel almost indebted to him. I give him credit for constituent services."
<P>Duncan's weakness, in Smith's judgment, is in representing the real interests of the people. In every talk he points to zeroes the congressman has earned on scorecards published by environmental and senior citizens groups. (To be fair, Duncan also rates 100s with Christian and conservative groups). But Smith makes the biggest distinction between himself and his opponent by contrasting their vision.
<P>"No one has heard a vision of East Tennessee from Jimmy Duncan," the challenger says.
<P>His own vision for the region revolves around what he calls "the three E's--energy, environment and economics."
<P>"With the infrastructure that's in place, we could advance technologies in energy and environment that would let East Tennessee define itself for advanced energy-efficiency technologies," he says. He envisions a technology corridor that would include agencies in Chattanooga, Oak Ridge and Knoxville in cooperative research and development agreements on energy efficient, environmentally responsible technologies.
<P>"There's a gold mine here," he says. "With TVA as a living laboratory, we could catapult the developing world over a lot of the mistakes we made."

<H3>Young David's Achilles heel</H3>

<P>Smith has already had a sample of how vicious the campaign could get. As he answered questions on a call-in show on WUOT-FM, one caller accused him of failing to pay child support for his two children, who live with his ex-wife in Nashville.
<P>The reference to child support angered his ex-wife, Rhonda Smith, when she heard about the exchange later.
<P>"It bothered me when he was called a deadbeat dad. I wouldn't want anyone to think that," Rhonda Smith said. "He pays his child support. We had a disagreement at one point. Whoever said that didn't finish reading the case; they took bits and pieces out of the [legal] papers." The dispute apparently involved whether the support payments would include money for private schooling.
<P>Rhonda Smith lives in Nashville now with the couple's two sons, Andy, 13, and Taylor, 10, and works in animal care. She says Stephen is always with his children on his weekends and every other chance he gets. "It's hard for him not to be with his children."
<P>Rhonda Smith is more than willing to talk about Stephen, whom she met when they were 15 at Hillsboro High School in Nashville. They married at 20 and divorced about three years ago. She reflects for a moment on Smith's motivations: "He's not doing this [running] for personal ambition at all. Steve has never been one who's money-seeking. When we lived in Knoxville, we didn't have a lot. We grew our own food, kept a compost pile, and managed to take care of our kids and our animals."
<P>Would she vote for her ex?
<P>"Yes, I would."
<H3> </H3>
<P>The ambush on WUOT may have been more an effort to trigger Smith's temper than to spread untruths about him. Both Republican and Democratic insiders perceive him as quick to anger, even petulant, in the words of one observer.
<P>Early in the campaign, in a call to Hallerin Hill's talk show on WIVK-AM, 990, Smith lost his temper on the air as he sparred with Hill and political commentator George Korda on TVA. Democrats listening were disturbed that he seemed to lose his composure.
<P>"What he says is passion comes across like he's angry or spoiled," one observed. "If George Korda can get your goat. . . . "
<P>Republican insiders say the Duncan campaign isn't very worried about Smith. "He's not even a blip" in early polling, one claims. "He hasn't been here long enough."
<P>Lobbyist and former newspaper editor Ron McMahan is characteristically more outspoken. "I don't think he has a chance in hell--in no shape, form, or fashion. Any poll that I have looked at shows Duncan is 20 points ahead of everybody, including Victor Ashe. Duncan is ahead of [Sen. Fred] Thompson."
<P>McMahan, a pillar of Howard Baker Republicanism, estimates Smith would have to raise three quarters of a million dollars just to get his name known and, he says, "that might not be enough to make a race of it." McMahan doesn't expect the Duncan camp to come after the challenger.
<P>Old-line Democrats have advised him to focus his message on Duncan's record and not confuse this race with his earlier causes.
<P>"Jimmy Duncan is on the ballot, not TVA," says one long-time Democrat. "He [Smith] has got to remember he's not running against TVA. He's already got the green vote and the anti-Duncan vote. In order to get elected, he's got to look to the people he has to have."
<P>His current campaign shows that Smith has taken some of that message to heart. When he talks to groups now, environmental issues take a back seat to concerns about health care, wages and education. He's proving to be just as quick a study in the nuances of campaigning as he was in nuclear issues and energy policy. Early in the campaign he tried an informal look, with turtle-necks instead of the traditional suit-and-tie look. One older woman gave him some motherly advice, telling him the turtle-necks weren't appropriate for the campaign trail.
<P>"Now he's actually wearing suits and stuff," says a Democratic woman from Oak Ridge.
<P>Supporters and campaign workers still complain that he tries to crowd too much into his day. "He's punctuality-impaired," one observes, and others note that, as he attempts to get in just one more stop, he's habitually late for evening coffees and campaign events like his Fourth of July fund-raiser at the Foundry in Knoxville.
<P>Smith expects Republicans to go into attack mode later in the campaign, especially on the issue of his arrests. He's been arrested during various protests, including the Watts Bar protest and one in then-senator Al Gore's Washington office right before the Persian Gulf War.
<P>"I disagreed with Sen. Gore about the use of force in the Persian Gulf," he explains. "I was arrested in Al Gore's office the day after the vote to use force. Al was the swing in a tight vote. My opposition to the war was in no way against the men and women in the service."
<P>As Smith takes on Duncan and the district's GOP political structure, he does so virtually single-handedly. Early on he rejected professional fund-raisers and campaign managers, and people inside his organization say he has no close personal advisers. He admits as much himself: "I don't have a circle of friends that I consider to be my advisers. I look at the issues myself, and no one person has a lot of influence on me. I have a tendency to want to talk to a lot of different people."
<P>That solitariness worries some of the old-line Democrats, who don't see any critics in his own camp to help him make judgments. They sense that he doesn't take advice well, that he won't listen to criticisms meant to help him hone his campaign.
<P>"Steve is a determined person with a broad vision of what ought to happen in the Tennessee Valley," Smith's fellow activist Ralph Hutchison says. "He's able to articulate that very well. But because he is driven, he moves fast. One of the challenges of leadership is to continue to move fast but go slowly enough for people to get on board.
<P>"Sometimes our greatest strengths are also potential weaknesses. Because of the depths of his beliefs and his passion for the issues, he comes on really strong. That's a great strength, but it also sometimes scares people.
<P>That passion is evident in the campaign Smith is waging. Though he is realistic about the challenge he is facing, he is confident of the outcome.
<P>"We're not going to lose," Stephen Smith says. "We may not get as many votes as he does, but we're not going to lose."

Parks in Transition</H1>
<P><STRONG>Often underused and underdeveloped, Knoxville's parks could soon see better days</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Val Pendergrast</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>The view is spectacular from the Ridge, even on a hazy Sunday afternoon. Perched atop one of the highest peaks around, Sharp's Ridge Park overlooks the city, offering visitors a panorama that extends beyond downtown to the blue-gray outline of the Smokies. 
<P>But the park is oddly devoid of a park-like atmosphere. A lone woman strolls down the hill, glancing over her shoulder nervously, a huge German Shepherd loping along at her side. A red-roofed pavilion sits among overgrown weeds, looking neglected and forlorn. Single adult men cruise up and down the ridge road in their cars, obviously seeking something more than a glimpse of scenic skyline. The park's beauty is marred by a proliferation of radio antennas that jut skyward.
<P>What could be a glittering diamond of a park more closely resembles a lump of coal. In a word, Sharp's Ridge Park is creepy.
<P>It's understandable that Sharp's Ridge is virtually deserted on a summer afternoon--its reputation as a place of sexual trysts is notorious--but an excursion to Lakeshore Park yields similar results. Parks are for people and people are for parks. So where are they?
<P>A passing comment from a non-native Knoxvillian sheds some light on Knoxville's park problem. When asked what he thinks of Knoxville's parks, Mike Verzosa retorts, "Knoxville has parks?" 
<P>Sure, we have parks--more than 100 inside the city limits if you're counting the ones currently under construction--and our park land-to-residents ratio (city and county combined) has grown from a paltry one acre per 1,000 residents in the 1930s to a much healthier one acre per 119 residents in the 1990s. It's clear the city's been making progress. But something is still missing.
<P>What makes for a good park? It all depends on what you're looking for. If your idea of a park is an acre of land with a couple of trees and a picnic table, most of Knoxville's parks fit the bill. But if you're yearning for 300 acres of open, comfortable green space, or even half that, you'll have to look elsewhere for now.
<P>The concept of passive green space is one that's been explored and exploited in cities throughout the States. New York City's Central Park, Atlanta's Piedmont Park and Nashville's Centennial Park are excellent examples of park design that encourages unlimited activity. These parks offer equal-opportunity recreation. Grandmothers in wheelchairs are as welcome as teenagers on roller blades; power-walkers make room for baby strollers; old men play chess under shady trees as matrons walk their poodles and young lovers steal kisses. In these parks, a microcosm of society interacts and shares a sense of belonging--a sense of community. 
<P>Somewhere along the way, have Knoxvillians forgotten that there's more to recreation that physical fitness and team sports?

<H3>WHAT'S THE DEAL</H3>

Knoxville seems to understand and respect organized sports. This is, after all, Vol Country. Sam Anderson, the city's director of Parks and Recreation, boasts that 800 to 900 teams use the city's baseball and softball fields, more than 1,000 use its basketball courts, and some 200 use its soccer fields. It may be called the Department of Parks and Recreation, but the emphasis is almost exclusively on recreation--strictly organized, team-sport recreation at that. For those who participate in organized sports, for those in need of referees, coaches, umpires, and ball fields, Knoxville provides.
<P>Parks and Recreation also provides recreational programs for lower-income kids in need of regulated summer activities in a safe, controlled environment. Anderson makes no bones about his opinion that as far as public recreation is concerned, Knoxville scores high.
<P>"I don't think there's any question that our summer program for public recreation is far better than Chattanooga's or Memphis's or Atlanta's, or anybody else's," Anderson says. "Summer programs? We're the best anywhere. The city made a conscious decision to provide programs for kids who would not (otherwise) be able to have programs. That's what we're good at." 
<P>But Anderson admits that with recreation geared to a more diverse group with broader interests--what he calls "the glamorous things"--his department falls short. Nashville, for example, has a $12 million facility with ice-skating, bowling, and an Olympic-size pool, all in the recreation department. Operating on a limited budget--Knoxville's was just over $4.5 million this past year--the city opted to provide for a specific segment of the population. "We don't try to compete with Court South," he says. 
<P>Some would say Anderson is missing the point. No one expects city parks to compete with private facilities and few begrudge the money spent on lower-income kids. The complaint increasingly voiced is that orchestrated recreation is only part of what Knoxville residents want.
<P>Bo Townsend, director of Ijam's Nature Center, speaks for many when he acknowledges the community's need for a wide-open, passive, public space.
<P>"A community the size of Knoxville really needs a large passive park, and maybe not just one," Townsend says. "I think we need a park, or at least open space, of 500 acres or more, where people can go ride their bikes, walk, or take their families for an all-day outing."
<P>There is at least one park in town that comes close to Townsend's ideal in spirit, if not in acreage. Tucked inside one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city and tended like a favorite child, Sequoyah Hills Park shines like an emerald in a 24-karat setting.
<P>Snuggled against the Tennessee River, brimming with towering, well-tended trees, Sequoyah is 87 acres of prime park land. Flanked by rows of expensive houses on one side and an impressive view of Cherokee bluffs on the other, Sequoyah enjoys a popularity that no other park in the city can boast. Even without amenities--there are no restrooms, one water fountain, few benches or tables--its natural beauty entices visitors to walk the river path, toss a Frisbee, spread a blanket and bask in the sun, or fly a kite when the wind is up. If ever a park demanded appreciation and respect, Sequoyah is it.
<P>But one 87-acre passive park is not enough for a city with a population of 170,000. Ball fields are fine for some, but others are looking for accessible, open green space suitable for a variety of activities. "If they'd just have one big park where you could do what you want--play flag football, volleyball ... just hang out in the grass," downtown merchant Jim Ray Cole says wistfully.
<P>Sam Anderson estimates that 18,000 to 20,000 people visit city parks an average of three times per week. But on a Sunday afternoon in July, Lakeshore Park, one of the largest in Knoxville, and undoubtedly one with great potential, is all but empty. Anderson says it's the heat that keeps people away, but critics say it's something else.

<H3>LAKESHORE PARK</H3>

There's something oddly disconcerting about a park that shares its grounds with the mostly abandoned, ghostly remnants of a mental institution. No doubt initially intended to provide residents a serene setting in which to soothe their jangled nerves, Lakeshore Park today is a series of ball fields encircled by a paved walkway called a greenway. A deserted swimming pool beckons like an oasis on this sweltering afternoon, but closer inspection reveals that it is not for public consumption. A small sign reads: "Swimming Pool use for LSMHI only."
<P>Unquestionably, Lakeshore is on a beautiful piece of land, centrally located and easily accessible. But though the park provides exquisite views of the river that winds through the valley, the only visitors enjoying the sprawling hundred acres are walking or running along the track. The ball fields are empty, the parking lots nearly vacant.
<P>Anderson says that during the season, Lakeshore ball fields are packed and brimming with activity. So why, on a sunny summer day, is the park virtually deserted?
<P>"Well, it's a mental institution," says Nicole, out walking her Boston terrier on the two-and-a-half-mile paved track that circles the grounds. "People usually just come out to do their business and leave. It's not the kind of place people come to sit under a tree and read a book." A sad commentary on human nature, perhaps, but the sad fact is that mental illness makes people uneasy. As open and green as it is, unless you've a specific activity planned or a sport to play, Lakeshore doesn't invite you to linger.

<H3>OTHER PARKS, OTHER PROBLEMS</H3>

"Knoxville parks are really small, with maybe a basketball court and a small playground," Oregon native Dylan Harbin groans. "Everything around here is dirty and small." Old City cook Mike Amissah says Knoxville parks are "too small and there's nothing to do. In Jersey, we have parks."
<P>A full two-thirds of Knoxville's parks are situated on pieces of land so small that communing can easily become crowding in a city our size.
<P>Pocket-sized neighborhood parks can be charming, like the nooks and crannies in Victorian houses that add what architects and historians like to call character. Krutch Park, at the south end of Market Square, is a masterpiece in miniature and a delightful place for downtowners to eat lunch under the shade of a gazebo. But character can't compete with usable acreage when it comes to attracting a broad base of visitors. And underuse frequently leads to disrepair and disrepute.

<H3>FORT DICKERSON</H3>

If you're not looking for the sliver of a sign that points the way to Fort Dickerson, chances are you'll miss the turn off Chapman Highway that leads straight up the hill. And if you didn't realize that a short walk to an observation deck would provide a breathtaking view of the quarry hidden from sight by the landscape, you probably wouldn't want to go anyway. Aside from the picnic table and lonely gazebo, there's little to be found but trouble. 
<P>"Drunks and degenerates. That's all I've ever seen there," says Jim Ray. 
<P>Fort Dickerson has potential. But it won't be realized without money, dynamite, and a massive public relations campaign to work on its image. An historic Civil war site, in recent years the Fort has developed a history of a different kind: a place for homosexual trysts and drug deals, and a camping site for the homeless and miscreant teens. 
<P>At the back of the quarry is a weed-eroded road, blocked by concrete barricades and stamped with no trespassing signs that have largely been ignored. The barricades went up after a drunken man stumbled to the quarry's rim after dark and died from the fall into the turquoise basin. His death served as one more warning to the public that the park was unsafe. And once a park has developed a reputation for danger, little can be done to alter that image in the public mind.

<H3>SAFETY</H3>

"A lot of people don't feel safe," says Kristie Smith, a bicyclist plying her trade at Interwheel Sports on Sutherland Avenue. She's talking about biking on the Third Creek Bike Trail that links Sutherland to Tyson Park and beyond to the UT campus. Fellow biker Chad Huskey shares Kristie's sentiments. "Third Creek is scary," he says.
<P>The bike trail, part of Knoxville's expanding greenway system, is considered by many to be unsafe at any time of day. Sergeant Bobby Hubbs, supervisor for Crime Analysis at the Knoxville Police Department, says "the more (greenways) they build, the more calls we get."
<P>"'Nineteen ninety-one. White male, six feet, 250 pounds, observed walking naked along the trail,'" Hubbs intones, reading from a list of bizarre incidents that have occurred along Third Creek. "'1991. Man on four-wheeler trying to run people down.'"
<P>A jogger in his 70s was beaten pretty badly along Third Creek last year, and the now-infamous killers of Colleen Slemmer used the trail to get to the murder site on the UT Agricultural Campus. But despite a perception that Knoxville's parks and greenways are scary and dangerous, statistics indicate otherwise. 
<P>As research for his doctoral thesis, Sean Michael, a student in the Virginia Tech Department of Forestry, studied crime statistics in a half dozen cities in the Eastern U.S. and found Knoxville's parks to be safer than most. Michael looked at park crime in Indianapolis, Kansas City, Nashville, Savannah, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and rated Knoxville low on the crime list. 
<P>"I would have to place Knoxville further down on the list in terms of number and severity of offenses," he says. An accounting of crime in Knoxville's parks shows 26 offenses ranging from rape (2) to aggravated assault (16) with a smattering of firearm violations and thefts, committed over a 16-month period from May 1994 to August 1995. That adds up to 1.6 offenses per month. For a city with more than 169,000 residents, that's considered small-time crime. 

<H3>WE KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE</H3>

Knoxville does have a select group of functional parks--clean, safe and cherished for their diversity. Ijams Nature Center, Fountain City Park and Tyson Park are among the most used and respected parks in the city. 
<P>
<P>Ijams Nature Center's name implies nothing about its status as a public park. That's unfortunate, because this jewel of a park offers patrons the opportunity to commune with nature in a setting found nowhere else in town. Technically a city park--the city owns the land--Ijams is operated by a private, non-profit team that does an exemplary job of managing the peacefully serene wooded acreage.
<P>Located behind the Island Home community across the Gay Street Bridge in South Knoxville, Ijams is an educational facility as well as 80 acres of riverside property hosting a mile of mulch-covered trails bordered by lush vegetation and sheltered by a canopy of trees. Additional trails are being added and by completion next spring, the trail system will grow to nearly three miles. Its continuing growth and community support are testaments to its popularity.
<P>Located in the north Knoxville suburb of the same name, Fountain City Park is the Velveteen Rabbit of Knoxville city parks. Loved so well for so long that it's slightly frayed around the edges, it's become real--an integral part of the north Knoxville community. Kids kick off their Keds to wade in the small, river rock-lined creek that trickles through the park; moms sit in the shade of a pin oak and caution their toddlers to go slow; teenagers segregate themselves from adults and stake a claim to their own personal pavilion. This park hums with harmony and innocence. The only pests to be found are the wasps hovering over the trash barrels, trying to score some lunch.
<P>Tyson Park is probably the most visible park in the city, located as it is right off Kingston Pike near the UT campus, and its location makes it convenient for a cross-section of Knoxville's population to find and use.
<P>At Tyson, families cook out and eat burgers at a sheltered table while they watch the kids frolic in the grass. Students play tennis and jog or coast along the greenway on their bikes. Bathrooms on site make it easier for folks to come and spend the day, unhurried by nature's departure call. Though small--only 33 acres--Tyson offers the things that encourage people to leave their houses and come out to play.

<H3>HOPE FOR THE FUTURE</H3>

Like a kid in a candy store, Donna Young, the city's landscape architect, can barely contain her glee as she rattles off her plans for the future of Knoxville's parks. 
<P>"I'm pretty sure I can figure out a way to fix Fort Dickerson," she says animatedly. If Young has her way, she'll dynamite the hill to create a walking trail along the top of the quarry's rim and stock the quarry with fish. But those plans will have to wait; her priorities are established by projects already in the works and her near obsession with greenways.
<P>With the latest addition to the greenway along Neyland Drive across from the Ag Campus, Knoxville's greenway system has expanded to almost seven miles of paved trail. Young dreams of connecting every park in the city with greenway. She's already devised a plan to line the World's Fair Park along Second Creek to the backside of campus, adjacent to the River Landing development, and wants to open access to Fort Dickerson by connecting it to Mary Vestal Park about a half mile away. A trail extending from West Hills Park all the way to Farragut is also in progress.
<P>"The best use for your money is a trail," Young says, and she has at least one big gun backing her opinion. "The mayor is extremely supportive of greenways," she says.
<P>It's easy to see why Young has gained the support of politicians and citizens alike. Her unbridled enthusiasm and obvious love of her job have worked some minor miracles in getting the cooperation of the public and private sectors.
<P>Like Townsend, Young dreams of a vast expanse of public space--hundreds and hundreds of acres.
<P>A park that size, she explains, would provide myriad recreational opportunities, like walking, running, canoeing, and fishing, to name but a few. It would be big enough for Frisbee golf and impromptu touch football games. It could serve as a venue for concerts and festivals like the World's Fair site currently does, but on a larger scale.
<P>It's a dream with potential. Young is convinced that the new Holston River Park development is the start of something really exciting; a Sequoyah Hills with a mission and a mandate to be the park Knoxville has been waiting for.
<P>Holston can be found at the eastern edge of the city limits, where Riverside Drive turns in to Delrose and runs along the Holston River just north of where it meets the French Broad. Only 44 acres, Holston is tiny when compared to, say, Piedmont Park, and only half the size of Sequoyah. But the lay of the land is inviting, even after a four-day monsoon has turned the fields into a mud pie that has rendered heavy equipment impotent. 
<P>The vision in Young's mind is that Holston will be the passive park that will outshine even Sequoyah. If she can convince the powers that be to unite the park to 331 acres of land run by the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency, she envisions a dynamic regional park that will attract visitors who might otherwise head for the mountains. 
<P>Unfortunately, the decision to place soccer fields in the midst of what many had hoped would be a truly passive park has tarnished the Holston project even before the land has been completely cleared. And the location--the eastern outskirts of a city that has been expanding ever westward--means that the majority of the population will have to travel to enjoy the fruits of the park. 
<P>There are reasons for these decisions, of course. The soccer fields will keep a steady flow of people coming through the park. "I would have been delighted to build it without soccer fields," Young says, but "the more people that use it, the less crime we have." The availability of affordable, usable land eliminates more centralized locations. These are the woes of urban park planning.
<P>Holston River Park--and its hotly debated alter-ego, River Landing--will give Knoxvillians a chance to validate the city's decision to experiment with heretofore untried forms of recreation. Maybe we'll discover that there's more to it than physical fitness and organized sports, and that there's more to community life in Knoxville than football and fireworks.

"A" is for Abstinence</H1>
<P><STRONG>And "F" is for Fear - which is what many Knox County sex-education teachers feel about what they can and can't teach</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Janet Tate</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>The slanting sun of an early August morning lights their way as health teachers James Hudson and Susan Perkins walk through the familiar glass-lined, cinderblock corridors of Bearden Middle School in west Knox County. 
<P>Within one very short week, these eerily quiet halls will be chaotically wall-to-wall with Hudson's and Perkins's sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade charges: adolescents representing just about every socioeconomic, cultural, and religious background to be found in Knoxville, all of whom are stumbling with leaps and halts from childhood into adulthood. They wear chains that jingle-jangle-jingle when they walk; they sound like Beavis and Butthead when they talk. They play soccer and sing in the choir. They'll be football stars and drug dealers and parents and teachers someday; right now, they're potential class presidents, possible dropouts, cheerleader wannabes, Courtney Love imitators. 
<P>Somehow, at some time during the next nine months, the two health educators will do their best to teach crucial information to each of these kids in the one subject area that interests them all: sex.
<P>Along with their spiral notebooks and No. 2 pencils, these students, like middle-school and high-school kids everywhere, bring to school as many different levels of sexual knowledge and experience as human nature allows. An unfortunate few will have already been introduced to sex involuntarily, perhaps at the hands of a family friend or relative. A fortunate few will have felt comfortable enough with their parents from early childhood to have asked for and received straightforward, nonjudgmental information about sexual behavior, contraception, and responsible decision-making. But many will be relying solely on whatever information they've gleaned from the usual sources: disinclined parents perhaps, the media probably, and most certainly other kids. 
<P>It's not as though Hudson and Perkins and their colleagues particularly relish their state-mandated mission of filling the gaps in their students' sexual knowledge. Some health teachers are admittedly reluctant to talk about human sexuality in school; they'd rather be teaching gym. Others ache to reach beyond the boundaries of the school's core sex-ed curriculum but, frustrated and intimidated, they check their attitudes at the classroom door and stick with the basics. All, however, must adhere to the sex-ed components of what's known in middle school as the Family Life curriculum and in high school as the Wellness curriculum--programs that are heavy on "just say no" and skimpy on specifics of when or how to say yes intelligently.
<P>Regardless of what Tennessee's adolescents learn about sex in health class in middle school, by their first day of high school half of them have already had sex, according to the state's Youth Risk Behavior Survey. By the time they're seniors, three out of four will have had sex, and more than one-third of them will have had at least four sex partners. 
<P>"By the time we get them, it's really too late," says one high school health teacher. "There needs to be a broader spectrum of what these students hear in eighth grade--and more consistency among what they hear--than what we're seeing on the whole when they enter ninth grade." 
<P>Unfortunately, most of the school administrators, teachers, and concerned community health directors we spoke with agree that's not the case, and it's not likely to be anytime soon.

<H3>Sex Ed 101</H3>

<P>What exactly can Knox County teachers teach? In a nutshell, here are the state-approved Family Life guidelines for middle schools: 
<UL>
<LI> Sixth-graders study hormonal changes and puberty
<LI> Seventh-graders discuss peer pressure, family relationships, and "various forms of love," such as puppy love, platonic love, and family love
<LI> Eighth-graders hear about emotional needs and the opposite sex, "defense mechanisms," once again puberty and physical and emotional changes, proper grooming, various forms of dating, date etiquette
</UL>
<P>"The Family Life program is abstinence-based," explains Dave Huntsinger, supervisor of health, wellness, and physical education for Knox County Schools. "We stress abstinence as the main thing in preventing unwanted pregnancy and communicable diseases; not just AIDS, but STDs [sexually transmitted diseases] as well. We pretty well follow the state curriculum guidelines."
<P>"We say, 'these are things that are out there and the only way you can be sure of no pregnancy [is through abstinence],' " says Perkins.
<P>Now, Tennessee's public schools are also required to teach HIV/AIDS prevention in grades kindergarten through 12. It's a separate requirement, and it's also abstinence-based. But nowhere in the Family Life curriculum for middle school is the actual topic of sexual activity really broached; that doesn't happen until high school, when, along with how to break a date and reasons for abstaining from sexual activity ("fear of unwanted pregnancy, guilt, fear of contracting disease, and fear of disapproval of family and peer group," reads one content blurb), teens are offered a "Sexuality and Family Life" component in health class, which does include exploring "alternatives to and consequences of teenage pregnancy, including adoption, abortion ... and teenage marriage" and "comparison and contrast of various methods of contraception and the degrees of effectiveness or lack thereof." 
<P>But compare these state guidelines--which are, admittedly, the bare-bones requirements--to the recommendations for a successful sex health education program put out by the Sex Information and Educational Council of the United States (SIECUS), a national nonprofit organization of health educators and medical professionals. Their suggested topics for age-appropriate discussion throughout the elementary, middle, and high school years include: marriage and lifetime commitments; abstinence; sexuality throughout life; contraception; abortion; sexual fantasies; sexuality and religion; sexual dysfunction; sexuality and the media; STDs and HIV transmission; and masturbation (yes, the very taboo that ultimately toppled ex-surgeon general Jocelyn Elders). 
<P>The school officials we talked to are familiar with the SIECUS framework for a comprehensive sex education curriculum. Nearly all agreed that their recommendations are sensible and would go a long way toward improving Tennessee's sex education curriculum. And each expressed the opinion that there is no way such guidelines would ever find their way into our state-approved curriculum. 
<P>"Technically, there's no board policy prohibiting [those topics], but it's never going to happen in Knoxville," says ex-school board member Ann Woodle. "I wouldn't even advise a teacher to do that, because of the [political and religious] climate."
<P>Says Huntsinger: "That's just not going to happen in Knox County schools, much as we might want it to. Teachers in middle school cannot talk about contraception or abortion unless it's brought up by a child, and then it's usually discussed by them privately. There's no problem with giving that information to a child one-on-one; that way you're not offending those people who don't want to hear that--and there are some people who don't want to hear that." 
<P>Indeed there are, but then, they don't have to hear it if they don't want to (or, more to the point, their children don't have to hear it if they don't want them to).
<P>"There are provisions in the state law that say, if a parent does not want their child to participate in family life or AIDS education, it's automatically granted," Huntsinger points out, "as long as we have publicized the fact that the state law says that a child can be exempt from those portions of the wellness curriculum." 
<P>And in fact, it's an option that's rarely exercised, says Perkins: "I'd say in the past five years we've had maybe 10 or 12 [students] whose parents have opted for them to be out of the program. A couple of those were sixth grade students, and then by seventh grade their parents decided maybe they ought to be in it; by the eighth grade most of those kids went through the program." 

<H3>Conservative Hot Topic</H3>

<P>Still, that's apparently not good enough for the Christian Coalition and other conservative political-religious pressure groups that have noisily shown up at Knox County school board meetings in the past and otherwise captured media attention with claims that condom-hander-outers have taken over the public schools. 
<P>"Sex education has become such a hot topic in this area, as I'm sure it has everywhere, with the influence of conservative Christian groups that do not want sex education addressed at the school level but feel very strongly that this is moral education that should be dealt with at home," says one Knox County school board member. 
<P>But school officials claim conservative religious influence is not really so pervasive that teachers aren't protected by what they choose to explain beyond the state's basic guidelines.
<P>"It's not as though the school board would fire somebody, even if the majority didn't agree with what the teacher had done," says Woodle. Still, even the perceived threat of conservative religious disapproval is enough to intimidate a lot of teachers into playing it safe. 
<P>"It's a very real concern," says Woodle. "They're afraid of parents getting angry with them, then making their complaints public by going to the principal, then to the school board, then to the media. The feeling is that somehow that would cast aspersions on their morality or their teaching qualifications. It's a pretty powerful fear."
<P>Health teachers can supplement the state guidelines with outside speakers and programs if they want to and if their principal agrees with their choice. Part of the problem with that is timing. Teachers with a higher comfort level may devote two or three weeks to the subject; others spend as little as two days. If they choose to use outside speakers and programs, they'll need to add as much as one to two weeks for the really comprehensive, decision-making-to-contraception series. 
<P>Then there's the plethora of resources to choose from. The Knox County Health Department's Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Initiative (KAPPI) has a program. The Junior League offers TAPP, an AIDS awareness program. There's STARS, the Florence Crittenton agency's well-received teen peer group presentation; a puppet show known as Kids on the Block; Planned Parenthood's Sexuality Education series; Campaign for Our Children; Free Teens; Teen Aid; Sex Respect, Safe Sex, Reasonable Reasons--the list goes on and on. 
<P>The programs usually fall into one of two camps: abstinence-only or comprehensive. The theory behind abstinence-only thinking is that if our children just don't have sex, there's no need to get into all that contraception and disease-prevention stuff. Comprehensive programs, on the other hand, tend to regard teen sexuality as inevitable; they stress abstinence but also explain contraception--barrier methods, condoms, birth control pills, Norplant--and disease prevention, and feel that educators should be value-neutral with regard to sexual activity. 
<P>"One of the biggest problems with abstinence-only programs is that they seem to emphasize guilt, shame, and fear," says one health department official. A high-school health teacher adds: "The messages of the [abstinence-only] Sex Respect approach and other programs like it conflict with mass advertising and consumerism aimed at teens to be sexually attractive, that sexy is healthy and good. This only reinforces the idea in many teenagers' minds that adults can't really be trusted, that what you're taught in school and what you see in real life are often two very different things."
<P>Nevertheless, in 1991 the Knox County school system purchased the Sex Respect materials, ostensibly as a resource for health teachers but primarily as a sop to the Christian Coalition, whose loudly held (and wildly inaccurate) claim that schools were handing out condoms sufficiently intimidated educational officials into buying (literally) the religion-based, abstinence-only program materials.
<P>Now, five years later, school officials and program providers are quick to distance themselves from it and other abstinence-only agendas. 
<P>"Sex Respect does not fulfill the state mandate," Huntsinger points out. "It's available for teachers to use to supplement the family life/wellness curriculum mandated by the state of Tennessee."
<P>"It's fear-based," says Debbie Blair, executive director of Planned Parenthood of East Tennessee. "It's not explaining and educating; it's controlling by intimidation." 
<P>"It's old, outdated," says Cynthia Hudson, KAPPI's coordinator. "I don't even know if anybody uses it anymore. When Sex Respect first came out, it had a religious connotation. I think they've since pulled most of that out, because they knew it was shutting doors to them."

<H3>Purity Only?</H3>

<P>Quasi-religious, abstinence-only sex ed may be becoming passe, but groups such as the East Tennessee Nurses for Health Education, with their self-described message of "purity only," are still a favorite choice in many area schools. The organization, formerly known as Tennessee Nurses for Life, claims to have spoken to 7,000 area school students during the past school year. 
<P>"We talk about the medical facts from a purity standpoint," says director Nan Sprouse. "We do get into contraception, and we don't make any judgments. We're not fear-based; we're reality-based. Purity is our goal, and we encourage girls [who have already had sex] to start over." (Revirginate themselves, if you will.)
<P>"If you talk about abstinence or purity, how do you deal with the teens sitting in the classes you're giving who are sexually active?" asks Hudson. "We know what reality is--that it's virtually impossible for some of our teens in abusive or statutory rape situations--so how does that make them feel?"
<P>Judith Roitman of Planned Parenthood echoes her concern: "Purity is an odd way of putting it, especially in view of the fact that for many young women, the first sexual encounter isn't necessarily a voluntary one."
<P>While claiming to have no religious affiliation and to be school-board approved, the East Tennessee Nurses for Health Education insist that the "facts on abortion" are among the information they offer. 
<P>"We wouldn't refer [a pregnant girl seeking information about her options] to a provider," says Sprouse. "We don't do that. It's not in our mission statement to do that, and we don't believe from a medical viewpoint that that's a good choice for a girl."
<P>What they would do and have done, though, is refer a pregnant teen to the Crisis Pregnancy Center of Knoxville--an outfit that is clearly religiously-oriented and adamantly antiabortion.
<P>As to their claim of being school-board approved, "We do not have a preapproved list of outside speakers," says school board member Margaret Maddox. "The gamut would be so vast we'd be constantly adding to and deleting from it. I don't remember that issue ever coming before the school board. I don't really know where they get that, to tell you the truth. [The approval of outside sex education programs] is an on-site decision made by the individual school administration." (Hudson and Perkins note that Knox County's school system maintains a library of approved resources for them to choose from if they want to supplement the core curriculum.)
<P>In response to the "fear-based" criticism, East Tennessee Nurses for Health Education's Mary LePage, a psychiatric nurse, says: "Well, it's so dangerous out there now. You're not just talking about possible unwanted pregnancy but all these diseases and viruses there are no cures for, that you're left with for life. Very often females end up with cervical cancer, or infertile. The diseases, the emotional pain ... we in mental health have for years looked at sexual promiscuity in youth as a sign of depression. Now it's become more like a normal developmental thing: You know, they're all doing it, so let's just throw birth control at them and throw up our hands. There's far too much discussion over it and visibility of things sexual on TV; it's all over the place. It's harder and harder to keep children focused on things that are developmentally appropriate for them."
<P>"I think we have to be open to all points of view," says Maddox diplomatically. "We've tried to provide the broadest base of resources for the teachers that they feel comfortable with ... but it's always going to be frustrating because we're talking about, in some cases, extremely conservative beliefs, yet we're talking about the need to educate these children."

<H3>Fear of Contraception Information</H3>

<P>But if the fear is that talking about sex will encourage kids to become sexually active, why do we have drug awareness programs in schools? And since when did it become a good idea to withhold information from students in schools? A 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute study showed that half of the 15-to-19-year-olds it surveyed felt that the average student today doesn't get adequate, accurate sex and reproduction information. (One-third of the 15-year-old girls said neither parent had ever discussed birth control with them.) 
<P>Henry Foster, President Clinton's would-be surgeon general who now acts as the president's special adviser on teen pregnancy, recently told an appropriations subcommittee considering funding for abstinence-only education that such sex ed just doesn't work unless  information on contraception is included. But abstinence-only advocates insist that including contraception information sends kids a mixed message: Why tell kids they shouldn't do something, then tell them how to do it safely? 
<P>"Well, how could it be a mixed message if they're already engaged in sexual activity?" Huntsinger posits. "If they're already sexually active, we can say, look--and we don't preach this to them, I don't necessarily advocate this--but if you are engaged in sexual activity and you're not going to cease, then you need to take some kind of precaution to protect yourself. I think you look at it from the standpoint of, if you get a person pregnant, then you have another responsibility. I think that's what we've got to make them aware of. There are all these other repercussions. For one thing, I think we don't put enough emphasis on the male responsibility; we're trying to alleviate that."
<P>The way it's set up, middle-school teachers cannot bring up contraception on their own in the classroom. They must wait for an individual student to ask a particular question, which is then answered in private by the teacher. That's the theory, anyway. (Planned Parenthood answers presubmitted, anonymous questions.) 
<P>"We've had several eighth-graders after we've had the Nurses' program come up and stay after class and ask questions," says Perkins. "They're really worried because they've already done something."
<P>But this is a theory that presupposes a certain amount of adult knowledge and articulation on the student's part: that they already know enough about how, for example, fertilization of the egg occurs to pose a pointed question about how to prevent it from happening during sexual intercourse. And as teachers and parents well know, kids will say the darndest things. So instead of asking, "If I use over-the-counter spermicide in addition to a condom, does this increase the likelihood of avoiding disease and pregnancy when I have sex?", they're more inclined to want to know, "Is it true if I have sex standing up I won't get pregnant?" (Among the questions Blair has fielded during her sex ed presentations: "Can you get pregnant the first time?" "When you're on your period?" "Can you get pregnant from oral sex?" and, inevitably, "How do you get pregnant?" "And these are high school students!" she exclaims.)
<P>"We're in a real Catch-22," says one health teacher, "damned if we do, damned if we don't." 
<P>She and many of her colleagues express great frustration, not only with the current state guidelines, but also with what several term the conservative element in our community. Adds Hudson: "We may talk about condoms, but we can't show how they're used. We can't do demonstrations in the classroom. There's a great video that features Arsenio Hall and Sinbad that talks about condom safety, and Sinbad is shown wearing a full-body condom. But we can't show that in class; it's not approved. The best we can do then is say, 'go home, ask your mom or dad.'" 
<P>"I think if there's an organized effort on behalf of people who are advocates for children, and those people who believe that knowledge is power, there could be some changes made," says Woodle. "I think kids could certainly receive more concrete technical, physiological information without stepping into morality issues. We teach kids from elementary school how to protect themselves in case of fire: stop, drop, and roll. Yet this crucial information about how their bodies work, it gets limited by this whole issue of controversy. It's unfair to the kids. Morality, the issues of abstinence--those things belong at home and in church, but the information about them needs to be taught in the classroom."

Paupers on the Playing Fields</H1>
<P><STRONG>While the colleges, the coaches, and the broadcasters make out like bandits, student athletes can't enjoy the fruits of their own talent. Should they?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Brooks Clark</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>So you're Peyton Manning.
<P>Today your earning power as a football player is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) scholarship worth thousands of dollars. When you turn pro, you will be worth a thousand times more.
<P>The difference between now and then isn't determined by supply and demand. Then, as now, millions will pack stadiums and watch you on TV. The thousandfold difference is artificial.
<P>By the rules of the NCAA, a college football player cannot receive a dime more than his room, board, books, and tuition in payment for providing entertainment that--here in America--is valued and sold for millions of dollars in tickets and TV contracts.
<P>Nor can Manning endorse his favorite shoe. He can't babysit for $5 an hour. He can't even benefit from the 12-foot images of himself being used to advertise automobile dealerships on KAT buses.
<P>A year from now, will he be here in Knoxville for another season in orange and a last halcyon moment of college life? Or will he increase his compensation a thousand times? No wonder UT coach Phil Fulmer wishes for rule changes, so that top draft picks can get loans or find another way to get a half-step up the earning graph.
<P>No wonder, too, that lately people in college sports are talking seriously about paying student athletes.

<H2>'Increasing benefits'</H2>

"Please," implores Katherine Reith, Director of Public Information for the NCAA, "don't call it 'paying.' Call it 'increasing their benefits.' A number of college presidents would be upset at the former and not the latter." 
<P>Whatever you call it, the unthinkable is getting a little more thinkable every day. This summer NCAA Executive Director Cedric Dempsey has been floating ideas in his speeches to athletic directors and in conference meetings, "just to get people thinking." He's brought up theoretical possibilities like allowing players to earn money from endorsements and salting those bucks away in future-use trust funds, or getting loans tied to future earnings as pros. Not surprisingly, Dempsey says he's gotten very mixed reactions. 
<P>"I think he's doing a good job of defining the problem and not alienating the members," says UT hoops coach Kevin O'Neill, who is serving on a special committee assembled by the NCAA to look at ways to help the welfare of student-athletes while protecting the amateurism of college sports. The committee, chaired by William E. Kirwan, University of Maryland president, met July 17-18 in Kansas City. Says O'Neill, "It was the best, most worthwhile committee I've ever been involved in, by far. Going into those meetings I was a huge proponent of, 'Let's just pay scholarship basketball and football players.' When I saw what it would cost and found out some statistics on athletic departments around the country, I understood a lot of the issues a lot better."
<P>Still, O'Neill thinks there are ways it can eventually be worked out. 
<P>"The problem is adequate compensation, doing what's fair for the athletes in a way that people can stomach," says Doug Looney, longtime college football writer for Sports Illustrated, whose recent Sporting News article laid out 10 "solid ideas" for increasing the benefits of college athletes--from monthly stipends, unlimited pay for stars, trusts, sharing 10 percent of the net profits of individual sports, and allowing outside jobs and endorsements to giving 50 home tickets to each athlete, to be sold or dispensed as he or she pleases. "The market for that sport would determine the level of compensation," says Looney. "That's capitalism."
<P>And nobody can deny that capitalism is what's driving this train.
<P>History will show that somewhere between Dink Stover at Yale and the advent of the Tostitos, Poulan Weedeater, and Outback Steakhouse bowls, major-college athletics became a tsunami of money. The revenue sports (hoops, football) and their TV contracts are washing ashore with huge bucks--enough, fortunately, to irrigate all the other sports, notably the laudable, unfunded gender-equity mandates of Title IX. 
<P>Coaches are bringing down bigger bucks than ever--some just to go away when they lose. An anointed few--Rick Pitino, for example--get seven figures from shoe contracts alone.
<P>Players, in the meantime, are among the most regulated individuals in America, living by Postal Service-sized rulebooks ensuring fairness of competition and consistency of scholarship benefits among NCAA institutions. Athletes are not allowed to get part-time jobs, take gifts, get treated to meals, sign contracts, endorse products, appear in charity calendars, or drive shiny cars provided by grinning boosters. (Hence the NCAA motto: Fermus Oculae ad Sooner Macadamus, which translates as "Close your eyes when you walk through the Oklahoma parking lot.")
<P>Until Herschel Walker left Georgia for the USFL a few years ago, players weren't even allowed to leave early, by mutual agreement between the NCAA and the leagues. That agreement would have withered if exposed to our nation's rigorous restraint-of-trade statutes, so superstars are now heading for the pros in record numbers, where they're getting signing bonuses surpassing the gross national product of all but a handful of nations in the Southern Hemisphere.  
<P>Amid this Kmart shopping frenzy, evil agents are luring callow youths away from the land of amateurism with loans, contracts, promises and worse. Specifically, athletic programs are trembling over the case of Massachusetts star Marcus Camby and agent Wesley Spears, who allegedly let Camby and some friends charge $1,800 worth of clothes on his credit card, then tried to blackmail Camby in a failed attempt to woo him as a client.
<P>The NCAA is the impartial arbiter of this carnival. It and its member institutions believe in strict adherence to its rules of amateurism--for players. Some 80 percent of the NCAA's entire $240 million operating budget for next year will come from its seven-year, $1 billion basketball contract with CBS.
<P>Even Walter Byers--for 36 years the NCAA's Pope, J. Edgar Hoover, and Pete Rozelle rolled into one--sees the landscape differently in retirement from the way he did a few years ago. "The wheel of fortune is badly unbalanced in favor of the overseers and against the players," wrote Byers. The powers in intercollegiate sport, Byers told Looney, which include some 25 football and 35 basketball schools, don't want to change because they "are doing very, very well. The beneficiaries of monopoly practices don't want to change the monopoly." 
<P>"What we have with major-college athletics nowadays is two separate philosophies," says O'Neill. "One is amateurism and academic ideals. On the other hand, we're talking about making money and winning national titles. We have a conflict of interest even within our philosophy behind major-college sports."
<P>"It's philosophy versus some students' realities," says Reith.

<H2>Two Points of View</H2>

Like all complicated issues, there are at least two sides to the touchy questions in big-money college athletics. As spokesmen for the extremes, let's use two imaginary, though strangely familiar, characters. To tell us what's right, what's best for the integrity of the institutions and the moral fiber of the nation, let's turn to Buzzcut Goodposture. 
<P>Buzz has been around a while. He wears thin lapels and yearns for the good old days--when Knute Rockne was paid as a chemistry professor and coached football for the glory of God; when Roger Staubach fulfilled his obligation to the Navy and had youth enough left over for all those Super Bowls; when Bear Bryant sat Joe Namath down for the Orange Bowl and taught America that rules apply to everybody (sorry, Tom Osborne, you're no Bear Bryant).
<P>For another perspective, let's give a fair hearing to another breed of cat--let's call him Vitalis Tassleloafer. 
<P>Vitalis is a good guy, even if he talks fast and his car has all that chrome on it. He believes in free enterprise--just like Bob Dole. He wants to help the kids. They work hard. They need a break. When they hit the pros, they'll have to match wits with those hard-boiled team owners. Vitalis wants to help 'em get a good deal and figure out where to put all those millions. This guy is on a lot of college coaches' minds right now--because he's all over the place (ask Marcus Camby). 
<P>Since the special NCAA committee has just gotten started, the members are resolved not to make official comments about the items on the table. But we can talk about the issues and make our best predictions. 
<P>"I don't think there's any doubt that everybody wants to do more for the student-athlete," says O'Neill. "Everybody wants to do the right thing. Everybody wants to help. It's just finding feasible ways to do it that can go ahead and not break the rules and not put the student-athlete in a position where everybody can't be treated fairly, in terms of gender equity and different sports. It's a lot more expensive adventure than people realize, even if you're talking about a monthly stipend."

<H2>Discretionary Money</H2>

Back in 1993, a poll at the American Football Coaches Association annual meeting found that 71 percent of Division I-A coaches thought that some form of monthly payment should be provided for their players. "The problem is they have no walk-around money," said Virginia Coach George Welsh. "It's hard to be in the social part of the college. You should be able to go see a movie a couple of times a semester or go for a pizza once a week." At that time, an athletic director sounded like Marie Antoinette when he said, "Athletes that meet federal criteria are eligible for Pell Grants. Also, athletes have three months during the summer when they can be gainfully employed."
<P>So what would be a fair stipend? Until the late '60s, NCAA athletes got "laundry money" of $15 a month (roughly the cost of a Stealth Bomber in today's dollars). In 1984, Johnny Majors came out openly for paying $50 a month, and he predicted the NCAA would adopt the necessary rule changes within four years. Recently, Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who earns $975,000 a year (including $225,000 from Nike) recommended $75 a month to the NCAA. 
<P>Realistic talk bounces between $100 and $200 a month. "Do I favor paying the athletes?" asks UT Athletic Director Doug Dickey. "No, not at this time, because 80 percent of the schools in the country can't afford it. That's been up on the flagpole for review a number of times, and I have never seen anybody put forth a plan that appeared to be feasible in light of a couple of things:
<P>"Number one, gender equity has added a significant number of women participants in the last five years and the cost has been rather significant to athletic departments. That has got everybody in the status of, 'We're just not going to do anything until we get all that balanced out and get our revenue and expense streams under control.'
<P>"Number two, athletes who do not have private funding from home have access to the Pell Grants. These are available to all students whether you're on scholarship or not. Of 350 scholarship athletes at UT, about 80 of them draw Pell Grants to one extent or another, up to $2,700 a year. That's money to be used for transportation, entertainment or whatever else you choose. If you qualify, you can get it.
<P>"Number three is the NCAA Emergency Fund. This is money from the basketball contract that at UT has distributed about $27,000 to our athletes for eyeglasses, emergency transportation home, other needs, which can mean an additional $200 or $400. In the past this has only been for athletes on the Pell Grants, but it's been expanded this year so that people who are not on Pell Grants can qualify."
<P>(Time out: Pell Grants to needy athletes, while the institutions get TV bucks and the coaches get millions from Nike? Cut to a nightmare: an NCAA official, tossing and turning as he dreams of budget-busting Congressman John Kasich (R-Ohio), dressed as Casablanca's Captain Renault, who blows his gendarme's whistle and exhorts, "I'm shocked!--Shocked!--to learn that federal money is subsidizing the commercial excesses of big-time college sports! Round up the usual bureaucrats!")
<P>Goodposture: "You can't pay only the revenue-producing athletes. You've got to give the same to everybody, and that would bankrupt most athletic departments. Where is this money supposed to come from?" 
<P>Tassleloafer: "Hey, I think they can figure it out. Gender equity says 'opportunities,' not dollars. And maybe a salary cap for coaches would loosen up the budgets a little."  

<H2>Amateurism</H2>

Since this issue cuts to the heart of the NCAA's reason for existing, it's understandable that many are reluctant to hastily throw amateurism in the trash can.
<P>The NCAA came into being in 1906 because Teddy Roosevelt was concerned about (a) the number of young athletes being killed each year playing football, and (b) the widespread practice of hiring nonstudent ringers. Right under "Basic Purpose of the NCAA" it says that the whole idea is to make sure athletes are "a vital part of the education system and an integral part of the student body," and to draw "a clear line of demarcation between intercollegiate and professional sports."
<P>"We are in amateur athletics," says Dickey, "and we are very tough on individuals who try to violate that. Consequently we live with a rather Puritan attitude about it, but we do have room, board, tuition and books."
<P>Goodposture:  "The NCAA athlete enjoys the priceless opportunity to drink from the fountain of learning and live the life of the mind, to form bonds of camaraderie in the rigors of physical exertion. He is getting room, board, tuition and books. Let's keep college sports what they were meant to be--a healthy adjunct to academic and student life."
<P>Tassleloafer:  "Okay, Plato. Education is great. But these kids are worth a lot. They bring in beaucoup dineros, and they are walking ad campaigns. Whoever heard of Boston College before Doug Flutie? Why shouldn't they get their share? Or at least have a few bucks to go to the movies like every other kid on campus? What's the big deal? The Olympics gave up amateurism, and the synchronized swimming looked better than ever." 

<H2>Cheating</H2>

"The cheating is out of control," says Doug Looney. "It reminds me of Prohibition and the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit, when Congress passed laws Americans simply didn't obey." Are some players paid under the table? Are boosters still sliding bucks under the table, despite the NCAA's all-out jihad against the practice? 
<P>"I don't know if it's any different than it's ever been," says Kevin O'Neill. "In real estate, some people cheat. In banking, some people cheat. On the stock market and the securities exchange, people cheat. I think some coaches and schools cheat. That doesn't mean everybody does or that everybody's bad. There are bad things going on in every business. We're no different." 
<P>Goodposture: "Athletic departments have done a great job of controlling boosters, and college sports is cleaner today than ever. Every time there is a violation, we hear about it in the papers for months. Those are good rules, and there's no reason to change them."
<P>Tassleloafer: "I wouldn't know about anybody breaking rules. But I can't even take a kid out for a hamburger. What's the point?"

<H2>Free Enterprise</H2>

All these discussions have talked about need. But we're talking about value and competition. Athletes are valuable and college sports are now in competition with pro sports for talent. "I make no apologies for the fact that I am a capitalist," wrote Georgetown Coach John Thompson in a recent Washington Post piece. "And I am not saying that money is bad." Thompson was decrying the flood of underclassmen (including Georgetown sophomore Allen Iverson) pouring into the NBA mostly because of the message it sends to the kids in the street. "We've got to be realistic about how we keep players in school," says Thompson, who's not talking about the stipend. "An allowance for kids to go to the movies pales in comparison to a multimillion dollar pro contract." Instead, Thompson gently advocates a re-examination of our definition of a student-athlete. "An accurate definition of today's student-athlete would mandate new (and hopefully simpler) NCAA rules."
<P>Presumably, Thompson's new definition would allow his players to receive a share of the millions he receives because the Hoyas wear Nikes. Of the 64 teams that made the NCAA tournament this year, 63 have shoe deals with either Nike (30), Converse (15), Reebok (9), Adidas (7) and Asics (2). The vast majority of those shoe deals are with individual coaches and not schools. (Notable exceptions: North Carolina and Michigan in basketball, Miami and Southern Cal in football.) College presidents recently put their feet down and ruled that coaches must get approval for outside income. They didn't go so far as to say that the money should go to the schools. Why shouldn't it go to the players?
<P>This is a question that may come up again.
<P>"I can't wait for the next big surprise: the strike," says ABC News correspondent Armen Keteyian, author of several eye-opening books on college sports. "There has been a lot of talk about that. And no wonder. What happens if five minutes before a Final Four game Arkansas just says, 'We're not coming out'? All it's gonna take is one kid too many who's seen his jersey sold for $100 at the school store to say, 'I've got $11 in my pocket. I'm turning down agents left and right, and I've had enough.'"
<P>An NCAA Players' Union? That idea has been thrown around for a decade by a former Duke hoopster named Dick DeVenzio, but it's never stuck to the wall. The idea sounds far-fetched, but so does the Weedeater Bowl.
<P>"We give 'em a college education," says Doug Looney. "But that's just part of the whole picture. Why do we put a cap on what they can earn?" If Neill Sandler Ford wants to put 12-foot paintings of Peyton Manning on K-Trans buses, why shouldn't Peyton have a say about it? Or at least be allowed to get a shiny new Escort out of the deal? That may not be fair to the linemen who block for Peyton. But free enterprise is not fair. Rational homo sapiens might argue that a ticket to the Final Four isn't worth $6,000. But that's what scalpers were getting in Charlotte two years ago. 
<P>If we pay football and basketball players, shouldn't we pay field hockey players? By Title IX laws, you'd have to. The way around that would be to place big-time sports in a different category. 
<P>Goodposture: "So recruits go where they can get the best promo deals. I think I'm going to be ill."
<P>Tassleloafer: "To tell you the truth, Buzz, that's pretty much the way it is now."

<H2>The Super Division</H2>

Eight years ago, in his first year as coach at Marquette, Kevin O'Neill wrote a guest column in the Chicago Tribune advocating a Super Powers Conference, and he still thinks it's a good idea. The NCAA has discussed a restructuring of Division I-A to reflect that some schools operate with considerably more resources than others. You could argue that a super-powers conference already exists, since about 20 percent of Division I-A athletic programs make money and the rest don't. "Is there as much money at Prairie View as there is at South Carolina?" asks O'Neill. "There's not. Until we have some sort of division, we can't truly address these problems anyway. We may make some modifications, but we've got to set some parameters down eventually."
<P>Might that new division be a quasi-pro conference, with separate rules and practices for the top football and basketball programs? "We don't want that," says Doug Dickey. "We are part of the Southeastern Conference and we have no interest in doing anything else." 
<P>Goodposture: "The danger is that this would be a minor league, where the athletic dog wags the academic tail. Is that what we want?' 
<P>Tassleloafer: "This is just acknowledging that some schools are in different categories than others. There's Division III and the Ivy League, with no athletic scholarships at all. There's Division II for smaller budgets. A few years ago they put the in-between schools in Division I-AA, and it worked out fine. This is the same thing." 

<H2>The Superstars &amp; the Agents</H2>

All the previous discussions, says Doug Dickey, are separate from the issue of the high-profile, $5 million player. "Should Todd Helton have been allowed to borrow $30,000 or $50,000 as he went through his senior year?" asks Dickey. "Should he be able to borrow the money to insure himself? I think there are some possibilities that President Kirwan is looking into." 
<P>"You're walking a thin line between making sure you capture that amateurism that has been great in college athletics," says O'Neill, "and then going ahead and singling out an elite few and separating them from the rest of the athletic department. Is that right? Who knows? That's why guys go pro. That's their option."
<P>Goodposture:  "Slimy sleazeball agents have no business within 50 yards of any NCAA event. They should be banned and punished and exiled to beneath the rocks they crawled from."
<P>Tassleloafer:  "Ouch, Buzz. You're hurtin' me, babe. Who's out there looking out for these kids when they're making these tough decisions and dealing with all these big numbers. If a kid needs a little help, why shouldn't I help him out with a loan? Who does it hurt?"

<H2>Education</H2>

Two decades ago, James Michener shook everybody up with his book Sports in America. "The testimony of former players is overwhelming that no young man can go all-out for a serious football or basketball team and carry a full load of studies," wrote Michener. "To require him to take three or four serious courses, as is attempted now, is ridiculous; worse, it is damaging, since it corrupts the academic process at the same time it initiates the player into a sense of academic failure."
<P>Back in the 70s, there were enough examples of non-student-athletes to back up Michener's opinion. Since then, the NCAA and its member institutions have made a valiant effort to improve the graduation rates for scholarship athletes.
<P>Each year the NCAA gathers and distributes the schools' graduation results for that year's entering class (allowing six years to graduate) along with the totals for the most recent four classes. Being especially tough, the NCAA now counts transfers, kids who are kicked off teams, who leave early for personal reasons and who leave early for the pros as non-graduates, so percentages anywhere near 80 are fabulous, and anything above 50 percent is pretty good. 
<P>In general, scholarship athletes--including tennis players, swimmers, golfers and gymnasts--graduate at about the same as the student body as a whole.  At UT, athletes posted four-year figures of 44% among the men and 65% among the women for a 50% overall average. This compares to student-body averages of 51% for the men, 56% for the women and 53% overall. 
<P>Some schools do better than others, but they're all trying. The most recent four-year numbers for SEC football are unstartling. In ascending order, they are Arkansas 31%, LSU 39%, Tennessee 41%, Florida 45%, Auburn 45%, Georgia 46%, Alabama 47%, Ole Miss 56%, South Carolina 57%, Mississippi State 58%, Kentucky 61%, and Vanderbilt 82%. (In a league with Vandy, the usual suspects of egghead football programs around the country logged the following four-year averages: Stanford 75%, Rice 76%, Notre Dame 76%, Michigan 76%, Northwestern 76%, Virginia 76%, Wake Forest 77%, Penn State 82% and Duke 93%.)
<P>There are statistical highlights and lowlights around the country, but college degrees are a possibility for those who choose to pursue them. This area is another minefield of good intentions and bad results. With Proposition 48, the NCAA made an honest effort to up the entrance requirements to make sure high school youngsters were better prepared for college. Such high-profile names as Anfernee Hardaway had to sit out their freshman years of college because they didn't "pass" the ACT. Hardaway says it was humiliating, but he learned from the experience. Kevin O'Neill says the new admittance requirements simply close opportunities, mostly to minorities. "I don't think that's right," he says. 
<P>But what about those who have no interest, preparation or intent to do anything but play sports? The most radical suggestion in Looney's Sporting News article was to stop requiring athletes to take full academic loads, especially in season, and "tailor the academic regimen" to meet the needs of each athlete. For some that might mean school after eligibility, or graduate school. For others that could mean a "sports development" track--in other words, virtually no school at all.
<P>"Never," declares Katherine Reith. "The NCAA will never go along with the idea of athletes not going to school." Even the idea of not going to school during the season--with the practices, workouts, road trips, film sessions--is anathema. "We've got to recognize that 99.9 percent of NCAA athletes will never make it to pro sports. It's still that one percent in a highly visible group that is really driving these discussions."
<P>Goodposture:  "All this talk is completely irresponsible. A college degree is the most important thing to a young man's future, whether he goes on to make millions or not. Student-athletes should stay and complete their educations. Red Grange never finished at Illinois when he went pro. Too many youngsters leave before they receive their degrees, and it's a shame." 
<P>Tassleloafer:  "Who needs a college degree with $5 million sitting in the Global Manifest Destiny Stock Fund? I'm all for getting a degree, but these days pro athletes can come back and buy a school if they want to." 

<H2>What's Going to Happen</H2>

It's possible that in two or three years Division I-A could restructure into a top league of--pick a number--60 schools who want to go full-bore. Football and basketball players at these big-time schools might receive stipends of $100 a week during the school year as part of their scholarships. They'll be allowed to sign with agents, and they'll also be allowed to earn money from endorsements that will be put in trust funds that can be borrowed from while the player is still in college. They may even share in the revenue from the licensing of jerseys. It seems likely that someday NCAA athletes will be allowed to appear in TV ads and be paid for them, as any other student can do right now.
<P>Will revenue-producing players be treated differently that non-revenue-producing players? Will marquee players be treated differently than non-marquee players? Perhaps this new, elite Division I-A could place these revenue-producing athletes in a new classification--university employees perhaps?--that will distinguish them legally from other scholarship athletes and sidestep expensive gender-equity snarls.
<P>Beyond all that, though, college sports will remain pretty much as they are, and pretty much as they have been for well over a hundred years. The most productive outcomes may be that, in repelling the barbarians at its gates, the NCAA might a) send a clear message to John Thompson's kids in the street that only a handful of athletes win the Publishers' Clearinghouse and make big money in the pros,  and b) spark a widespread re-commitment to the idea that a college degree is the goal and not merely a necessary inconvenience for intercollegiate athletes. Or maybe that's just Buzzcut Goodposture talking.

North by Northwest</H1>
<P><STRONG>As Growing Pains Mount, What Do Our Northside Communities Stand to Lose?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Betty Bean</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>No Knox Countians are more intimately connected to their roads than the people in the north. There are the big east/west arteries: Oak Ridge Highway in the northwest supplies the backdrop for a major landmark-- the Karns Red Light, the North Star by which Karnsites direct outsiders to points of interest in their community ("Turn left at the Red Light and go about a mile...").
<P>To the east, there's the crazy aunt of all Knox County roads, Clinton Highway, sprouting trailers, juke joints, churches, dirty bookstores, used car lots (one of them lavender-themed), and a building shaped like an airplane.
<P>Then there's Maynardville Highway, which changes its name from Broadway when it shoots the gap going north at Black Oak Ridge and gets the killer Halls traffic shoved down its throat. The two-lane stretch between Halls and Maynardville is the deadliest of county roads.
<P>But the grandmother of all the roads in the north, the one that ties these communities together like pearls on a string, is Emory Road, which showcases the charms and the problems of living in an area that is being rapidly urbanized.
<P>It is a road along whose vast lengths the country boys used to fly, looking for Saturday night. By day, it belonged to slow-moving farm vehicles that crawled along, heedless of what was in back of them. But that was decades and a hundred subdivisions ago, and now traffic on Emory is so heavy that only the besotted or the foolhardy try to fly, and only the most oblivious take to the road to trail strings of tooting, ticked-off motorists behind their ponderous John Deeres.
<P>One of the oldest and longest thoroughfares in the region, the former Emory Pike slips down into Knox County from Grainger County, through Corryton in the gap between two mountains, and slides in a westerly direction through the heart of North Knox County. The ancient road, once a 10-foot wide wagon trail stretching from Virginia to Texas, bumps its narrow-shouldered way almost 40 miles across the county, adjusting its personality to suit the neighborhood. At the extreme eastern end, where Emory sports a historical marker commemorating the site where Col. John Sawyers, veteran of the Battle of Kings Mountain, established a fort on Big Flat Creek, it could be the country road setting for a John Denver video. Shortly it crosses Washington Pike, veers sharply west and comes to a stop at Harbison's Crossroads in Gibbs. It picks up speed and sophistication as it hurdles down to traffic-choked Maynardville Highway in Halls, where it slides on past Halls High School and the site of the original Halls Cross Roads at Andersonville Pike. It breezes by the new St. Mary's Hospital, crosses Norris Freeway and meanders along past Dry Gap Pike, just north of Sterchi Farms, the soon-to-be largest subdivision in the state. A short distance west there's Hoff Drive, the entrance to a subdivision built by former Schools Superintendent Earl Hoffmeister, who also lives there. Emory Road grows momentarily fat and mighty as it shoots by the I-75 exit ramps and fast-food purveyors that service the interstate. Here there are large industrial sites: Plasti-Line, a Prestige Cleaners plant, and vast piles of earth being moved to make room for more. 
<P>The old road scoots past the airfield locals call the Powell Municipal Airport. Soon it is bisected and stymied by the railroad track that once ran to Powell Station; then it squeezes through the heart of the business district and past Powell High School. It passes by the homes of the Powell Brahmins, respectfully skirting the rolling front lawns of the Gills and the Weigels on the left and the teeming 'burbs of Broadacres (formerly the state's largest subdivision) on the right, before it proceeds to garish Clinton Highway, where it doglegs north and continues down the Beaver Creek gap toward Karns.
<P>Ambitiously-named subdivisions--Barrington, Imperial Estates, Norte Villar--slip by. A left turn at Beaver Creek funnels traffic toward the Karns Red Light, while Emory meanders northwest and dissolves temporarily into Oak Ridge Highway, reappearing a few miles north in Anderson County near the Bull Run Steam Plant after residing in Knox County for almost 40 miles.

<H2>On the BRINK</H2>

In recent years, Powell and Halls have boomed, with Karns growing at a slower rate. Leaders from all three communities have grown more vocal about demanding their fair share from county and state governments. Public officials like County Commissioner Mary Lou Horner have complained so long and so loud that it has become an accepted fact that if north by northwest has not yet quite supplanted the west as the new boomtown, it is at least the Next Big Thing.
<P>Industrialist Pete DeBusk, whose famous mega-house is still a work in progress on Cunningham Road in Halls, who has purchased the property for a Girls and Boys Club near Brickey School, and whose DeRoyal Industries is in the Powell business district, says he wants to see action in advance of expected growth.
<P>"It's a known fact that infrastructure will dictate the development of your city... And what we have is a situation where North Knox County is beginning to grow extremely fast... Typically, metropolitan planning and county planning leave a lot to be desired... It took me longer to get from Halls to the interstate other day than from there to the airport... We need major improvements, not another band aid deal..."
<P>DeBusk is a strong supporter of a group called BRINK (Better Roads in Knox County), which is pushing for the state to adopt a sweeping road plan including a northern bypass to hook the Sevier County resort areas to outlying areas.
<P>BRINK President Clark Hamilton agrees and says northenders from Halls, Powell, Karns, Fountain City, Norwood, Alice Bell, and points in between banded together in December 1993 when they finally came to the realization that there hadn't been any major road projects in the north since 1982. It became clear to them in 1994 when former Gov. Ned McWherter came to town for the dedication of the riverside park named in his honor.
<P>"There was an article in the paper where the MASH (Make Alcoa a Safe Highway) people were asking for all state road funds to go to making Alcoa Highway safe... We blew up," Hamilton says.
<P>One of the first orders of business was to infiltrate the Metropolitan Planning Commission (the body that plans roads in Knox and Blount Counties), which was skewed in favor of South Knox County and Blount County and had no advisory board members from North Knox County. BRINKers Hamilton and Earl Hall got themselves appointed, and Mayor Victor Ashe obliged by appointing Norwoodian Helen Heatherly.
<P>In 1994, the group pestered candidate Don Sundquist, who asked them to name the top priority on their wish list. They requested Emory Road be widened at the interstate, and the wish was granted. Construction is ready to commence on widening Emory to the west, as well.
<P>"Sundquist spent two hours looking at roads and made a strong commitment," Hamilton says. "They do now know we exist."
<P>Other BRINK priorities are improving Western Avenue to Oak Ridge Highway, Broadway at I-640 to Tazewell Pike, Dry Gap Pike from Sterchi Hills to Emory, and Emory Road through Powell.
<P>Northenders say BRINK has been a highly effective public relations tool for the area, structuring the long-held desire for road improvements into a political force.
<P>"Before BRINK, everybody wanted them (roads), but nobody had an organized way to push for them..."
<P>BRINK has also captured the attention of Knox County Executive Tommy Schumpert. The county's strategic transportation plan identified serious deficiencies in the roads running east and west. To relieve these problems, plans have been approved to widen Dry Gap Pike in the near future and, longer range, to widen the Callahan Road corridor to the west, eventually bringing it into Halls.
<P>Another important BRINK sympathizer is Allen Gill, who is as responsible as anyone for the growth of the north. His trademark flat-top haircut brands him as a man who doesn't easily surrender to the vagaries of fashion, and he figures his 'do is bound to come back in style if he keeps it long enough.
<P>His pedigree is pure Powell. Born in the old brick house on Emory Road that belonged to Columbus Powell before the Civil War, his grandfather, George N. Gill, started Gill Water Supply at the spring on Beaver Creek in Powell in 1916. Gill has headed its modern successor, Hallsdale-Powell Utility District, since he founded it in 1954. 
<P>Hallsdale-Powell stretches from Gibbs in the east to Powell in the west and serves 20,000 water customers, including 13,500 sewer customers in a 200-square-mile area. He says growth is "nip and tuck" between Halls, which has more than 150 businesses, and Powell, which has 100-plus businesses, including big operations like DeRoyal, Levi's, Plasti-Line, Mutual Forms, and Travis Meats.
<P>One key to the growth of Halls and Powell is infrastructure: Halls has had sewers since 1963, and Powell since 1966.
<P>"Back then, we didn't have any conception of what would develop," Gill says, "although we knew sooner or later it (growth) would swing North. 
<P>Gill says he's got 2,000 lots already developed and another 900 in the making.
<P>"If the economy stays put, there'll be growth," he says.

<H2>North Sector Boom</H2>

Powell and Halls make up the statistical area the Metropolitan Planning Commission has dubbed the North County Sector, the combined population of which has nearly doubled from 19,501 in 1970 to 37,122 in 1995; by the year 2000, the North County Sector population is expected to hit 41,020.
<P>Karns is the easternmost section of the Northwest County Sector (the Pellissippi Corridor westward is not included here because that area is more closely identified with West Knox County than with the north). Karns, called census tract 60 on the MPC books, had a population of 4,520 in 1970, 6,460 in 1980, and 7,753 in 1995.
<P>Impressive as these numbers are, however, northside growth rates still haven't caught up to those in the west. In 1970, for example, 13,129 Knox Countians (less than in the North County Sector at the same time) called the Southwest County Sector home. This is the chunk of pricey real estate stretching from Gallaher View in the east to Loudon County in the west, from I-40 south to the river.
<P>By 1995, the Southwest population had more than tripled to 47,863, and by the year 2000, the number is expected to hit 56,895.
<P>Subdivision lots approved in 1995 show a parallel trend. There were 181 Karns lots approved last year; 694 in Powell and Halls compared to 1,065 in the Southwest County Sector.
<P>Other statistical measures of growth are consistent with the above numbers, says Gretchen Beal, MPC director of information services.
<P>"They (Halls, Powell, and Karns) have been third in development permits forever. It is picking up out there, and that indicates a trend. Eventually the Southwest will fill up, but whether that growth goes north or into Loudon County is unknown.
<P>"But I think the North is getting more attractive, and I can see why they want to get their traffic in order. There's no doubt there have been a lot of subdivisions started out there over a 10-year span--but in terms of growth, it's still the Southwest, the Northwest and then the North in the county. Then comes the Northwest part of the city."

<H2>Karns</H2>

Myron Stooksbury does TV repair in Karns, and a few years back, the late Arthur B. Seabolt called to get his television set fixed. He left the following message with Stooksbury's mother:
<P>"This is Seabolt up here by the traffic light. Tell Myron to come over and fix my TV set first chance he gets."
<P>When the message got delivered, it came out "That old loudmouth up at the traffic light wants his TV fixed."
<P>So Stooksbury showed up at the home of Charlie Verboon (also now deceased) and paid no attention when Verboon told him "Myron, I didn't call you."
<P>"You don't have to call me," Stooksbury said. "I know when your TV's broken."
<P>He replaced some tubes and gave Verboon a bill.
<P>A month later, Seabolt, mightily ticked off, called Stooksbury back.
<P>"Moron; what does a man have to do to get his damn TV fixed?"
<P>County Commissioner Mark Cawood has heard the story maybe a thousand times, but it still makes him laugh. It captures, he believes, the old-time essence of his community.
<P>"I always thought Karns was the Mayberry of Tennessee," Cawood says. "Everyone knew everyone, and nobody had to give a signal because everybody knew where everybody was turning."
<P>There's good reason to remember it that way. In spite of the subdivisions springing up in the area, Karns is proud of its volunteer fire department, and it is still the place that has won the Tennessee Valley Fair's "Top Community" award for so many years running that the community club budgets for it annually. Aunt Bea's Kerosene Cucumbers wouldn't be out of place at the Karns Fair, an annual event that is a must-attend for candidates from school board to U.S. Senate.
<P>In its earliest days, it was "Karnes" until the superfluous vowel got dropped somewhere along the way. It narrowly escaped being called "Oggville," after a service station owner who pushed to name the community after himself.
<P>Like most communities in East Tennessee, Karns is heavily Southern Baptist; Grace Baptist boasts the largest congregation. Beaver Ridge Methodist has a woman minister now, and the Karns Church of Christ has largely recovered from the scandal occasioned a few years back when its semi-famous preacher was forced to publicly confess seducing various female parishioners who went to him for counseling. 
<P>Everyone follows the football fortunes of the Karns High Beavers, and by the way, Cawood says he saw a beaver in Beaver Creek behind his house just last year.
<P>There's a one-lane railroad underpass on Byington Road, and most every kid who ever grew up in Karns has added something to the graffiti-laden concrete. Currently, the doggerel "Party Hardy, Rock And Roll. Drink A Fifth And Smoke A Bowl" rules, but space is limited, so it probably won't be long until it's painted over in favor of some other adolescent profundity.
<P>There are limits to youthful rebellion, though.
<P>"One Christmas, somebody wrote 'Happy Birthday, Baby Jesus,' and everybody was afraid to paint over it," says a Karns source who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of being thought blasphemous.
<P>The underpass is just about a mile west of that one-and-only Karns Red Light on Oak Ridge Highway, the reference point for anyone giving directions to other points of interest. Of the three major communities along the Emory Road corridor, it is Karns that has changed the least, partly because of the traffic congestion on Western Avenue, which becomes Oak Ridge Highway after it passes the city limits.
<P>It's not that Cawood wouldn't like to see infrastructure improvements, but he figures that Karns residents have most everything they need: a barber shop, a couple of restaurants, an art gallery, video stores, a grocery store, and Myron Stooksbury's TV repair.

<H2>Powell</H2>

On one recent morning, School Superintendent Allen Morgan had worked the 7:30 breakfast crowd at Humphammer's. Nobody bragged on him until he left, but once he did, proprietor Gerry Neely allowed as how Morgan had probably been Powell High's best principal ever.
<P>"He really turned things around," says Neely, who is a real estate developer on the side. "The first thing people looking for a house ask is 'What school district is it?' I sold a lot yesterday because it's in the Powell school district."
<P>Humphammer is an old football nickname, and Neely is still a Panther through and through. With all due respect to his cuisine, it's probably safe to say that the breakfast crowd doesn't show up there primarily for the food. It's the conversation that fills the parking lot at the Clinton Highway convenience store; it's Hump himself who presides over the early morning confabs, where the issues of the day--fishing, football, unified government, and neighborhood problems--are thoroughly dissected. (Think of it as the Pinkston's Motors of Powell.)
<P>Mostly old-timers gather there, Neely says: "New people don't tend to hang around. Seems like they all got jobs."
<P>Being a devout Republican, he has discouraged those who urge him to run against sitting County Commissioner Ralph Teague. He also disapproves of Mayor Victor Ashe's "finger" annexations, which have moved the city limits out the interstate to the Emory Road exit:
<P>"He didn't say what finger--we've got a finger right back for him..."
<P>Neely says.
<P>He relishes the friendly rivalry between Powell and its sister community, Halls, whose trademarked slogan is "Halls Has It."
<P>"Penicillin'll cure it," he says, throwing out the gauntlet.

<H2>Halls</H2>

Hubert Larue is the official unofficial Halls historian, and he sounds almost envious when he asks if Karns still has the Red Light.
<P>"I remember when we used to have a red light," Larue says.
<P>He worries about the rapid pace at which farmland is being devoured by growth, and he has collected thousands of old pictures to preserve the memory of lost landmarks.
<P>Particularly distressing has been the desecration of the Thomas Hall Cemetery on Rifle Range Road and the demolition of the Ernest Mynatt House, which used to stand at the original crossroads before it was knocked down to make room for the Beaver Dam Baptist Church expansion.
<P>Sheriff's Deputy Roberta "Bert" Roberts has a ringside seat from which to observe some of the new Halls traditions, like the influx of country boys who come there to cruise on weekend nights:
<P>She proceeds to Black Oak Plaza to roust out some boys in muscle trucks gathered there. The chromed-up vehicles bear license tags from Knox, Union, and Anderson Counties, and those in them appear so stupefied by the thrumming bass of their overheated rap music that they don't notice the cop car. Finally, Roberts puts on her blue lights, and almost as one, the trucks rev up and begin to circle the parking lot, Roberts falling in right behind, heading them up and moving them out like a cowpoke.
<P>"That's what they do," she says. "They make a big circle."
<P>She herds them for awhile, then proceeds east on Emory Road to answer a burglar alarm call.
<P>Asked if she ever has any trouble working a community where burning crosses have shown up on the front lawns of black families twice in the last few years, Roberts says no. Despite the fact that Halls High has no African-American students or faculty members, the cross burnings remain unsolved, and sources in the sheriff's department say the community was less than cooperative in the investigation, Roberts seems to feel no discomfort about being a black female officer working Halls.
<P>The biggest thing in Halls' late-night nightlife is weekend drag racing down Maynardville Highway. Kids and, strangely, parents, gather at Hardee's on the north end of the business district. The starting line is marked off, and the old folks sit on the shoulder in lawn chairs to watch the action.
<P>The Halls business district has boomed in recent years; residents now have a Wal-Mart and a K-mart, and a vast assortment of fast food restaurants. Zoning problems have been surprisingly few and far between: there was a dustup when a developer was accused of trying to build on a flood plain and a problem with a tree-trimming operation working out of a residence on East Emory in an agricultural zone.
<P>But mostly, folks mind their own business in Halls.
<P>"Halls isn't like Fountain City where this whole stream of people go out to protest," says a Hallsite who wants to remain anonymous. "We just welcome new neighbors."
<P>"It's the uniqueness of these communities," says Mary Lou Horner. Everybody comes together in a spirit of oneness... All three of these communities do things for themselves instead of waiting for government. Halls built our own park. Powell built its own playground. Karns built its own library. They don't sit back and wait for somebody else..." 
<P>Another thing that gets them involved is school issues. Halls Middle School Principal Bobby Gratz says his school, which is brimming over, enjoys more community participation than any school to which he has been assigned.
<P>"We have strong parental support, an active PTA, volunteers who come in and help the teacher," he says. "Often a simple phone call to a parent will solve the problem. The more stable a community, the better the test scores in the schools; and Halls Middle School is a community school with low mobility and a strong faculty."
<P>There was a crisis this summer at overcrowded Halls High, when 150 HHS students were rezoned to Gibbs High School. The community revolted, and County Commissioners Horner and Leo Cooper led the attempt to reverse the rezonings. The effort failed, despite a desperate offer by Halls parents to build temporary classrooms on the campus at their own expense.
<P>And more problems are looming in the future.
<P>New subdivisions keep on coming, and the school board has braced itself for the first onslaught of Sterchi Farms kids by rezoning them south to the Sterchi Elementary School, then northeast to Powell Middle and High Schools. There is a new Brickey school in the county's master plan for schools, but many fear the money will run out before the north end can be addressed.
<P>Allen Gill is sanguine about the future, however.
<P>"Yes," he concedes, "we've grown faster than services can keep up with us... But too much growth?"
<P>He smiles.
<P>"We don't have any problem with that right now."

The Power Is Yours</H1>
<P><STRONG>The hours are bad, the pay is nonexistent, but mediators are solving some tough problems in our courts and classrooms</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Bill Dockery</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>The issue sounds suspiciously like a divorce, but it isn't.
<P>Courtney and John, friends since childhood, had lived together for five years as apartmentmates with little romantic relationship. Now Courtney is suing John for $1,600 in Knox County Sessions Court because he moved out with no warning, sticking her with rent on their apartment and taking with him some furniture that both of them had bought.
<P>This evening the pair is meeting with two mediators, Richard Zivi and Amparo Salinero, who are trained in the techniques of conflict resolution. The sessions court judge has suggested that mediation might offer a better solution to the couple's problems than a trial would.
<P>At the start of the session, Courtney is anxious about how she will pay her rent and angry and hurt that John moved out without giving her any notice. John is frustrated at being sued and just wants to get the session over with.
<P>The four spend two and a half hours together exploring their disagreements and looking for a way to reach an agreement that both can endorse. At the end of the session, John and Courtney have settled their monetary disputes, divided their joint property, and even agreed to host their traditional Halloween party together.

<H2>New cures for conflict</H2>

<P>Common in other parts of the nation, mediation is a process that has a small but growing place in the landscape of conflict resolution in East Tennessee. 
<P>Unheard of in these parts a decade ago, mediation is now being used to broker divorce settlements, resolve disputes between landlords and tenants or business people and their customers, end neighborhood feuds between juveniles, help public school students settle their differences peacefully, and even reconcile victims with people who committed crimes against them.
<P>Seen as an alternative to the adversarial, me-vs.-you framework of the legal system, mediation is a carefully controlled process that aims to help both sides in a dispute craft an agreement they can live with, on the theory that any pact made willingly by two opposing parties will be more durable than a ruling imposed from above by a judge or an arbitrator.
<P>The mediators are highly trained volunteers who have not only studied the process but sat in on hundreds of hours of actual mediations as observers and participants.
<P>Smack in the middle of this emerging movement is the Community Mediation Center, a recently formed nonprofit organization that has absorbed three programs which originally grew from independent mediation efforts. The center has combined the divorce mediation started as the Knoxville Bar Association Mediation Service (affectionately pronounced "K-BAMS") with mediation efforts in juvenile and sessions courts that the University of Tennessee Conflict Resolution Program helped initiate.
<P>"This is the first time we've consolidated all the programs under one umbrella," says Karen Dorn, the center's first full-time director. "This should make it available to a lot more people."
<P>The services are free to anyone who needs them with the exception of divorce mediation; for that service, a sliding-scale fee is charged that is capped at $250. The center is funded entirely by grants.
<P>Dorn says that CMC's 90 volunteer mediators donated roughly 4,000 hours last year.
<P>The commonly accepted fathers of mediation in Knoxville are three University of Tennessee faculty members: Grayfred Gray in the law school, Marcus Armbrester in speech communication, and Steven Martin, who oversees the university's program. They interested UT Knoxville Chancellor Bill Snyder in the topic, and the university now offers various conflict resolution classes in several departments.
<P>The mediation movement is occurring statewide, and the Tennessee Supreme Court is preparing to issue its Rule 31, a policy statement that will govern the uses of alternative dispute resolution in state courts. The rule will lay out the qualifications required of mediators and other neutral parties involved in resolving disputes.
<P>Penny White, the associate Supreme Court justice who recently lost a vote for a full term on the court, has headed up a judicial commission drafting the language of Rule 31.
<P>"The perception in the states where there is alternative dispute resolution is that the public is more satisfied when they have a choice," White says. "It provides a basis for reducing stress and trauma in cases where a relationship has to go on."
<P>White says she has seen unprecedented enthusiasm in the state's legal community for alternative dispute resolution, but she thinks its most important contribution may come from nonlawyers.
<P>"This brings lawyers and nonlawyers together," she says. "It has a chance of bringing new notions into the system from people who aren't in the system.
<P>"If the public response is what is expected, I'd foresee expansion of mediation to other courts and other kinds of cases."

<H2>"The Power Is Yours"</H2>

<P>What has people so excited is the process itself.
<P>The mediation between John and Courtney has been staged by the CMC to illustrate this nonjudiciary way of resolving conflicts. The two, who are taking a mediation course at UT, play the role of disputants in the scenario because the confidentiality provisions of the guidelines prevents outsiders from witnessing an actual mediation.
<P>Theirs follows the typical pattern of mediations. Zivi and Salinero introduce themselves, seat the young couple opposite them at a table in the City County Building, and then get down to explaining what the two friends-at-odds will face as they seek a nonjudicial solution for the conflict that has brought them here. Zivi starts.
<P>"Can you make your own decisions?" he asks both people. "Do you need to confer with anyone else to make a decision?"
<P>When they acknowledge they are able, Salinero jumps in.
<P>"The difference between mediation and court is that here either of you has the power to fashion your own solution," she says. "If you both agree to something different from the judge's law, you are free to do that.
<P>"The power is yours. The agreement you make will be legally binding on both of you."
<P>Zivi then reads over the ground rules for the mediation: Interruptions are not allowed when the other person is speaking. Complete honesty is required. With the exception of revelations of abuse against children or handicapped or older persons, which must be reported by Tennessee law, everything said during the mediation is utterly confidential (mediators can't even be subpoenaed into court to reveal what they have heard). The rules of evidence and of civil procedure do not apply.
<P>The mediators take questions and then ask Courtney and John to sign a document agreeing to these principles. When the signed paper returns to her hand, Salinero says, "Congratulations on reaching your first agreement."
<P>Then the two mediators begin to draw out the source of the conflict between the pair. The students put on a convincing show of disagreeing over bedroom suites, televisions owned in common, and the central problem, the rent difficulties John's unexpected departure has caused Courtney.
<P>Salinero carefully restates the facts of the argument, then probes further for the emotions underlying the dispute. She reflects the feelings back to the couple.
<P>Zivi takes great pains to make sure he understands exactly the financial arrangements concerning the couple's lease and other debts they owe, because any agreement they reach will be a contract binding on both of them. Everything goes on poster papers on the wall so that everyone can keep up with the finances and with the progress of the discussion.
<P>Pointing to the poster, Zivi says, "The problem is that these are facts, but you need to vent emotions. These are the reasons we are here, as far as the court is concerned."
<P>Salinero follows up on Zivi's hint. "We've written nothing about your feelings of loss or the future of your friendship. What do you want your relationship to look like when we're through here?"
<P>"This is an issue we can address that wouldn't be dealt with in court," Zivi says, writing "#6 future relationship" on the paper.
<P>Systematically the mediators lead the pair through the issues, starting with finances and moving toward the ultimate relationship question. Finally all the money matters are settled and the friendship is all that's left on the table.
<P>"I don't know if he still wants to be friends," Courtney says. "I'd like to get together a couple of times a month to eat dinner. After all, we've lived together for five years."
<P>"Be careful," Zivi cautions. "You don't know what your future relationship will be." He points out that either or both of them may develop other relationships that will alter the nature of this one. The couple agrees to cooperate on their traditional Halloween party and see how the rest of the year goes.
<P>With an understanding reached on the relationship, Zivi focuses on performance of the agreement. He points out that the judge will expect dates and details of exactly how the agreement will be achieved. When those matters are settled, the contract is signed and ready to return to the judge.

<H2>Another arena for success</H2>

Divorce and sessions courts are not the only venues in which mediation can  make a difference. Some of the most successful and significant conflict-resolution work has been done with children and youth, especially in juvenile justice arenas.
<P>Larry Gibney is the chief probation officer for the Knox County Juvenile Court, and he is one of the staunchest supporters of mediation. He sees it as a way to stop a dispute dead in its tracks, to keep it from recycling from the neighborhood into the courts and back to the neighborhood in a chain that foils easy solution. "The basic idea is that with kids, any number of situations are just not amenable to litigation," Gibney says. "In court there'll be a winner and a loser, but the dispute goes back out into the community.
<P>"Mediation is a way of bringing a final solution to those kinds of problems."
<P>Most of the cases coming to mediation from juvenile court are assaults--fights between kids. Gibney says the parents come into the picture wanting to win the issue; but even after a judge renders a decision, the conflict rages on in the community.
<P>"A neighborhood dispute can be one of the most costly and time-consuming cases to come to court," he says. "Everyone brings all the people on their side. It can go on all day."
<P>With mediation, the court now mandates that both parties to a dispute sit down together and make a good--faith effort to resolve the issue. One of the key elements of the mediation is, of course, confidentiality.
<P>Efforts at mediation are largely successful, Gibney says. In July, for example, nine cases were referred to mediation. Six of seven assault cases were successfully mediated, and agreements were reached in both vandalism cases. The mediated cases save the cost of an appointed attorney, plus the time of court personnel from judges through clerks.
<P>"If you looked at mediation in this court from a cost-effectiveness standpoint in dollars and time, you could justify hiring someone to do it," he says. "If the mediators disappeared tomorrow, it would be worth looking into hiring someone."
<P>Gibney is working toward establishing a victim-offender reconciliation program but hasn't gotten one off the ground yet, because VORPs take more up--front preparation. What Knox County wants, Anderson County already has a decade of experience with.
<P>The Victim-Offender Reconciliation Program of Anderson County was founded in 1986 by two people--Margaret Burns and Charles Barton--who were working with adult prisoners but wanted to get closer to the roots of the process that put people in prison. They heard of the victim-offender mediation movement and, through the Anderson County Center for Community Justice, developed VORP. The program is the oldest in the state.
<P>Sandy Snyder, the executive director of VORP, says the program gets between 250 and 300 referrals a year from the Anderson County courts. (Each crime against an individual victim counts as a referral.) Many of the juveniles have committed multiple offenses, and some 70 percent are first-time offenders.
<P>"We have individual and separate meetings with the victim and the offender," Snyder says. "We explain the process in advance, that it has to be a respectful process. There can be some very strong feelings expressed, but they must be expressed in a way that is respectful.
<P>"Then we begin talking about making the situation as right again as possible. Future intentions are written up as a contract, and we monitor the contract."
<P>VORP keeps in touch with the offender to make sure he or she is living up the agreement and turns to the probation officer if problems begin to develop.
<P>"In our 10-year history, we've had only a half-dozen cases go back to court," she says. "Ninety--seven percent of our contracts have been fulfilled successfully."
<P>The program publishes a newsletter that details some of its successes, using fictitious names. There's the letter of apology a group of juveniles wrote to one of their victims after they restored the yard they had vandalized: "Just because we have the urge to do something doesn't mean we have the right to do it. We all had to work together in order to fix what was broken. Property wasn't the only thing damaged; people's trust was damaged. People now fear what things may happen to their property when they sleep. On behalf of the group which participated ... we apologize deeply for our actions."
<P>There's 14-year-old Melanie, caught shoplifting to show off before her friends. She tells of being terrified when three police cars pull up to the store. As a result of the incident she did community service for the court and also did some at the suggestion of the store manager. The incident and her referral to VORP "taught me my actions can hurt other people. It made me think about what I had done. It brought my mother and me closer. Also my grades improved."
<P>The Anderson County group has a full--time director and a part-time worker. The actual mediation is done by 45 active volunteer mediators. "They don't even get mileage," Synder points out.
<P>The program has won recognition for its record of effectiveness and innovation. The Anderson County VORP was the Tennessee nominee for a crime-fighting award from the National Association of Attorneys General.
<P>"Our program is two-pronged. It benefits both the victims and the offenders," she says. "It puts the power back in the hands of the people who are most directly involved."

<H2>Peer mediation in the schools</H2>

If mediation is showing positive results with children in legal settings, it is being received with at least equal enthusiasm in some Knox County schools.
<P>On a recent September afternoon, a group of middle--schoolers are gathering noisily in the library at Northwest Middle School. Guidance counselor Janet Brown and school social worker Ellen Lawson have called the student mediators together for a refresher to the training they received as last year's peer mediation program wound down. The 1995-96 program, the first year of peer mediation, was heavy on eighth-graders; and of the 27 peer mediators in the room, only three are returnees, so the program will be short on experience until later in the year. Blacks and whites and both sexes are pretty evenly represented in the group.
<P>Audrey, Jill, Roger, and Stephany are assigned to practice with a table with Steve Martin, the director of UT's conflict-resolution program. Martin was instrumental in getting peer mediation started in Knox County schools and still takes an active role in advising the participants.
<P>As Martin watches, the four plow into the first scenario, a disagreement between two girls, one of whom has pushed the other's little brother down steps. Following a simplified written script, the mediators--Stephany and Audrey--introduce themselves, lay out the ground rules, and elicit an agreement to participate from the other two, who are acting as disputants.
<P>One mediator asks the aggrieved party to outline the dispute and then carefully rephrases the complaint for the four. The second mediator then asks the second disputant to respond, then follows the second version with another careful restatement of both the facts and the statements the disputant made about feelings.
<P>Pretending to be the girl who pushed the child, Roger explains why the little brother was pushed and sums up his feelings: "The little kid was kicking me. I'm glad he got what he deserves."
<P>Then the first mediator asks the two disputants to brainstorm for solutions to the dispute. Each is to consider what she can do herself to resolve the conflict, not what the other person can do to make it right.
<P>The mediators work to get palatable solutions out of the pair, writing them down as they go. Finally the two agree to apologize to each other and Roger's character agrees to stay away from the hypothetical little brother. The mediators draft a written agreement and then lead the disputants in a discussion of ways to prevent the controversy from resurfacing in the future.
<P>Real mediations, which are confidential, are much like that practice session. Two student mediators are always used, and an adult trained in the process sits in as an observer.
<P>For guidance counselor Janet Brown, who invited the program into Northwest, peer mediation has been a godsend.
<P>"I was one guidance counselor to a thousand kids," she says. "There was a lot of stress dealing with so many conflicts."
<P>When the program got started, graduate students from UT served as mediators, but last year the students were trained to take over. In its first year with peer mediators, the program handled scores of disputes.
<P>"The students are much more willing to go to other kids instead of adults," Brown says. "They've handled a lot of their own conflicts. Kids can be very insightful."
<P>Brown says that most of the disputes are of the "he said/she said/they said" variety and can be provoked by the hint of a "your mama" statement or an odd glance.
<P>Referrals to the program usually come from the principal. If the dispute flares up after a mediation, officials may look back at the written agreement to see which student has lived up to his or her promises. The school mediation program also has different exceptions for confidentiality: The student mediators promise to hold everything in confidence except information involving drugs, guns, or abuse.
<P>The impact of the program is not limited to the successfully resolved disputes, Martin notes. The peer mediators themselves gain considerably as they ply their new skills. Studies have shown that the mediators have better leadership skills, handle conflict more successfully, develop higher self-esteem, and perform better academically after participation in the program.
<P>"Plus, the whole mediation process helps people think creatively and analytically," Martin says. "Peer mediators don't get the easy ones. It requires good, creative decision-making skills to do it well."
<P>The students are not volunteers; they're recommended by their teachers as children their peers respect. The ones selected for this year were trained before school was out last year and sat in on some mediations.
<P>Other Knox schools have mediation programs, including Sara Moore Greene Elementary, which was invited to make a presentation on peer mediation to the annual meeting of the East Tennessee Education Association last year.

<H2>The conflicts within mediation</H2>

If mediation is turning into a successful way to defuse conflicts, it's also capable of creating some of its own friction. One of the hottest issues is whether a career in mediation is possible and whether the volunteers are being taken advantage of.
<P>Debbie Almquist, one of the early KBAMS mediators, ultimately opted out of the program in frustration. When she got involved in mediation, she was completing an undergraduate degree at UT as an older student and was looking to gain skills that might make her more employable.
<P>"The training was good, and the program was never misrepresented," she says of the KBAMS program. "I didn't think initially about money-making, but I did think I was getting involved in something important."
<P>Instead she found that the program was logistically disorganized and early directors were seriously overworked and underpaid. "Volunteers put in a lot of time and didn't get much support."
<P>Others, both lawyers and mediators, question the degree of commitment the Knoxville Bar Association has had to the process. One mediator says KBA staffers felt it was their responsibility to serve lawyers, not the general public, and there was no public-service component in the KBA mission. That may have played a role in the folding of KBAMS into the Community Mediation Center. Some mediators say privately--and some lawyers privately agree--that lawyers have a hard time turning loose of paying clients and want divorce mediation programs only to avoid having to take on clients who can't pay.
<P>For most people in Knoxville, mediation is clearly not a career choice. Ann Barker, a lawyer who is active in mediation circles, has supported her mediation habits by offering training, but no other mediators seem to be making a living solely from their dispute-resolution skills. There may also be lawyers who use mediation as part of their services to their clients, but mediation is probably not the primary part of the services provided.
<P>"There are a few mediators listed in the phone book," says Victor Vaughn, the principal mediator in Family Mediation Services of East Tennessee, "but I don't know of any of us who are able to do it full time."
<P>Vaughn, a chemical engineer, has been offering his conflict-resolution services to the public since 1990, shortly after he retired from Martin Marietta Energy Systems in Oak Ridge. Despite the difficulty in making it pay off, Vaughn remains enthusiastic about mediation.
<P>"It's a much more humane, much less stressful way to resolve a conflict," he says. "The agreement is much more durable. When the courts are involved and the clients need to consult with attorneys, the attorneys become advisers rather than advocates.
<P>"The people are the ones working this out. I help them choose the options they want to follow and then help them write it up."
<P>Some lawyers raise another, more philosophical issue. Mark Jendrek, whose wife, Mary, is a CMC mediator, questions whether mediation programs can actually distance themselves from advocacy.
<P>"Who decides what a fair agreement is," Jendrek says. "When the savvy slumlord comes into a dispute with one of his tenants, he can wear he tenant down." In such cases, Jendrek says, the tenant may be entitled legally to much better treatment but may be willing to agree to less just to get a settlement. He maintains that invariably the mediators will try to make the agreement fairer, which is not part of their neutral role in reaching a solution.
<P>If not money, what?
<P>If money doesn't motivate most mediators, then what are the rewards? The answers are as varied as the people answering the question.
<P>For CMC volunteer Richard Zivi, who has a mortgage company, it's the sense of personal satisfaction that comes from seeing a mediation succeed.
<P>"I know I'm taking time away from my business; but when we get an agreement in a mediation, I feel so good," he says. "I'm high for the rest of the day.
<P>"When there's no agreement, I feel lousy for the rest of the day."
<P>For Tamara, one of the up-and-coming peer mediators at Northwest Middle School, the issue is simple: "I'm interested in helping my fellow students with problems."
<P>Amparo Salinero's motivation is similar yet much more complex; it has its roots in a personal crisis. The lawyer describes herself as "a typical hedonistic New Yorker" until she and her husband discovered that one of their three children was autistic.
<P>"I had to say, what is the point to life when you can be so happy one day and the next day your world is destroyed because all your dreams you have placed on one of your children have just collapsed," she says. "You can only ask God 'Why, why, why?' for so long before you think, maybe there is something I need to do.
<P>"Since then, I've tried to make everything in my life as significant as possible. I can go home and see my little boy and say, if I'm making it better for children, then I'm making it better for him."

<P><STRONG>Are Knoxville's Independent Used Car Dealers the Last of a Dying Breed?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P><STRONG>It's the Sale of the Century, the close-out to end all close-outs, the hottest cars and coolest deals in the ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE! It's our Post-Labor Day Back-to-School Holiday Blow-out Sale Spectacular and EVERYTHING MUST GO! CARS! TRUCKS! MINI-VANS!

<H3> </H3>
Used car dealerships. In East Tennessee, and especially here in Knoxville, this particular slice of classic Americana has been generously apportioned. It's almost as if the gods of commerce looked down and saw too many hikers running amok through our fair Appalachian countryside and commissioned the prophets of low interest financing to preach the Gospel and save the heretics from their impending doom.
<P>Used car lots smother our landscape, blinding innocent passers-by with the reflected glare of sun on polished chrome. Our local airwaves are shrill with the sound of dealers' brimstone rants. And the weighty weekend automotive supplement of our esteemed daily newspaper seems on the verge of bursting at its folded seams, barely able to contain the explosive volume of block-letter flash and zero-down hyperbole inside.
<P>Nowadays, almost every factory dealer in town offers an expansive selection of buffed and polished pre-owned vehicles in addition to endless rigid rows of marginally nicer but substantially pricier new ones. But the soul of the used car business lies not with the brand-name brokers, but with small independent dealers, those maverick yokels who ply their trade without factory backing or seven-digit credit lines.
<P>You've seen them, dug in against the torrential commuter flow on Alcoa Highway and Kingston Pike, spooned in next to cheap motels and karate schools on Chapman and Clinton Highways. They lack palatial showrooms, those gleaming geodes full of space-age sports coupes and Jurassic pickups. Their grounds are often chaotic, spliced by gaudy streamers and pastel penant chains. Even their office quarters fall well short of posh manufactured cottages and aluminum sheds announced by removable letters on yellow cafe signs.
<P>But these dealerships, with names like Auto Village and Merle's Motors and Great American Wheel Ranch, represent the grass-roots faction of a business that by its very nature seems to seek a certain symbiotic connection to the people it serves. And in an era when dealer-affiliated lots are consuming an ever-increasing share of the used car market, many small dealers believe those gaudy streamers and roadside gravel pits may also represent the last outposts of a distinctly American phenomenon.

<H3> </H3>
There are nearly 200 independent used car dealers in Knox County alone, truly a staggering figure when you take into account dozens of other new/used dealers in town and God knows how many more spread throughout surrounding counties. And once you've paused to mull the motivations of these colorful folk, you may also wonder just why there are so damned many of them.
<P>According to Wayne Kenner of Classy Motors Company, Inc., the answer lies in the fact that the need for automobiles is unrelenting, even in the face of skyrocketing prices.
<P>"I think what happened is that new cars got so expensive that a lot of your market was shut out," says Kenner, a short, powerfully built man with a high-pitched voice that belies his stubbly countenance and gym-wrought physique. "More used car lots started opening and offering on-site financing for people who didn't have lots of money or good credit."
<P>Kenner and his staff count themselves among that group. Classy Motors is a so-called "buy here, pay here" lot, used car shorthand that signifies on-site financing. Kenner says even though more than half of his customers have credit problems, he rarely turns down an application.
<P>But promiscuous financing isn't the only reason Classy is arguably the best-known used car lot in town. In a business that thrives on razzle and chutzpah, Classy Motors is as brash and garish as they come. The lot on Clinton Highway is a lavender vision, blanketed by a canopy of light purple streamers and set about with matching banners.
<P>And Classy television commercials are the stuff of local legend, trailer-park vaudeville classics overrun with homespun characters such as the Credit King (decked out in regal robes, wearing a crown and holding a scepter) and Judge Otto Deeler. Other ads have featured regional grappling stars from the now-defunct Smoky Mountain Wrestling Federation, including "Nature Boy" Buddy Landell, who, flanked by two bikinied models, tosses his platinum blonde mane, thumps his beefy pecs, and blusters with all the boisterous ringside machismo he can muster. (Classy is a former sponsor of SMWF, and Kenner even stashed the federation's championship belt as a keepsake.)
<P>And then there are the drag queens; that's right, some of the buxom, scantily-clad women you see vamping through Classy Motors car ads aren't women at all but are rather stunningly realistic imitations of them. Kenner says he included local drag sensation Shannon DeVaughn and nationally-renown female impersonator Sable Chanel (a former "Showgirl of the South" winner) in Classy ads specifically to appeal to the local gay community.
<P>"We try to make this a place where everyone fits in," says Kenner, perhaps understating his case. "If you watch our ads, you'll eventually see someone you relate to. Smoky Mountain Wrestling was a particularly good marketing strategy for us. I bet we sold 500 cars because of the wrestling tie."

<H3> </H3>
For Classy, 500 cars is roughly equivalent to a year's worth of sales, and that statistic qualifies the business as one of the brightest success stories in an area where the competition is so unrelentingly fierce that even the most reckless entrepreneurial spirits may pause and shudder; there are now more than 50 used car dealerships along the 640-to-Clinton stretch of the highway, marking it as perhaps the area's most fertile breeding ground for car lots.
<P>But it wasn't always so; Knox County commissioner Howard Pinkston remembers a time, some three decades past, when Chapman Highway was Knoxville's used car row, populated by the likes of Cliff Pettit Motors, Parkway Motors, and the first outpost of Delmar Haynes.
<P>By Pinkston's reckoning, the growth of outlying communities eventually pushed the car biz to points north and west; and during the late 1970s, dealers began swarming Alcoa and Clinton Highways like fleas on strays, even as many Chapman lots gave up the ghost. Today, all that remains of Chapman Highway's old guard are Waddell Motors, Knox Motors, and Pinkston Motors (a partnership run by Howard and brother Paul), a tiny lot a half-mile past the Henley Street Bridge just this side of Auto Zone.
<P>If Classy is the used car business's baroque, ostentatious Yin, then Pinkston is its folksy, low-key Yang. Howard Pinkston ("Nookie" or "Pinky" to friends) refers to his dealership with its neon pink sign and inviting little office porch as a "spit 'n' whittle club" for South Knoxville. "Sometimes they call this place the House of Knowledge," 86-year-old regular Conrad Loy says with an expansive grin, savoring his own droll hyperbole. He also refers to Paul as "the man who rode a mule around the world."
<P>On a given Friday afternoon, you're apt to find the Pinkstons and assorted South Knox neighbors kicked back in the small air-conditioned office, drinking coffee and munching snack cakes, expounding on everything from hound dogs to football to the country's precipitous moral decline under philandering Bill Clinton and his shameless cronies. (One mild-mannered elderly gent, a widower, causes quite a stir when he breaks in and asks "Sol, did you ever commit adultery?" and then adds, matter-of-factly, "Boy, I sure did.").
<P>The atmosphere at Pinkston Motors is so laid-back and gracious (Howard greets you with a warm and fervent "Hey, buddy!" in his pinched voice every time you walk in the office door) that you don't doubt it for a moment when the brothers say honesty is one of the keys to their success. Howard figures the prevailing notion of used car salesmen--as silver-tongued swindlers and ace-up-the-sleeve con men--is a holdover from the days of horse trading.
<P>"The joke now is that politicians and TV preachers have moved ahead of used car dealers," Pinkston says with a chuckle. "That whole image was around before I even got into the business, but some of the finest people I've known sold used cars."
<P>But according to A.C. Carmichael, a third-generation dealer and proprietor of Carmichael Motors on Fifth Avenue, the rep hasn't always been undeserved.
<P>"We do have some people we wish weren't in it," he says. "People who sell autos that are shot, wore out, and should've been buried. And those are the ones who prey on people with bad credit."
<P>Carmichael grew up whiling away his afternoons at the same lot he now runs, a lot then owned by his grandfather, "Big A.C." He remembers other local proprietors who used less than scrupulous methods to "pour a man into a car," including one old dealership whose salesmen would often "lose" customers' keys during test-drives or even wholesale their old cars out from under them, then offer deals on new vehicles to make amends.
<P>In these days of Naderism and heightened consumer awareness, Carmichael says the game's more predatory strategists are apt to stick to classic hard-sell tactics, with a touch of playground psychology thrown in for good measure.
<P>"The key is to get you on the lot and then get you in that office," says Carmichael. "Some dealers will let you take a car home overnight. The thinking is that a neighbor invariably comes over, you brag, and then your male ego won't let you drive your old car home again the next day even if you get slapped with a bigger price tag than you were expecting.
<P>"But sometimes it's a Catch 21. You've got some people selling cars that might not run too good to other people who might not pay 'cause they don't have good credit. Then it's hard to say who's doing who. The bottom line is that you get what you pay for, and if someone offers you a $10 bill for $5, something is wrong."
<P>John Waddell, whose Waddell Motors with its small but spiffy red-white-and-blue showroom has existed on Chapman Highway for 45 years, is more blunt when he addresses the bad rap used car dealers often get in popular discourse.
<P>"The independent auto dealer performs an important service for working men and women," he says with stony resonance. With his sharp features, penetrating eyes, and tidal swell of ungovernable gray locks, Waddell has the look, as well as the lot, of a classic car salesman.
<P>"Not everyone can afford a new car. That's where independent dealers come in. Most of these stories you hear are exaggerated."
<P>Waddell may have a point, because small dealers, even more so than their factory-affiliated counterparts, have a vested interest in fostering goodwill and encouraging repeat business.
<P>"If you sell 'em junk, it comes back on you," says Tim Beeler of A&amp;A Auto on Maynardville Highway. "Bad news travels a whole lot further and faster than good news."
<P>After just one year with his own business (he spent several years as a salesman at Cars Etc. just up the road), Beeler says more than a quarter of his sales come from referrals or repeat customers. At Classy, Kenner estimates the figure at well over half. But nowhere is the phenomenon more evident than at Pinkston Motors, where the line between buyer and socializer is so indistinct that it's almost nonexistent. Here, almost everyone who stops by to prop their feet up on the front porch rail or sip coffee from a styrofoam cup in the office has bought at least one car from Howard and Paul over the years, and probably three or four.
<P>Howard points to Loy and guesses that the South Knox native has purchased more than a dozen cars at Pinkston in the last 25 years. Loy agrees that it's been "at least that many" and starts counting on thick fingers, enumerating various grandchildren, cousins, and miscellaneous acquaintances in a gruff, smoky voice.
<P>"I know I've bought three Volvos here alone," Loy says after considerable deliberation. "Or maybe it was four."

<H3> </H3>
A.C. Carmichael still tends his account at the same Broadway financial institution that employed his grandfather some 50 years ago (he says he still can't keep the tellers' names straight, so he calls them all "honey"). His Wednesday morning ritual always includes a stop at the bank to make a deposit and check his balance before heading out for a day at the auction.
<P>The ritual is an important one, because for used car salesmen, auctions are a chief source of product, providing small dealers with access to big dealers' trade-ins and leasing company cast-offs at prices that (usually) leave enough room for mark-ups. Around Knoxville, three auction companies--Airport Auto Auction on Alcoa Highway, Mid-South on Chapman, and Odessa in Lenoir City--offer dealers-only "rolling sales" (meaning the cars are ready to drive off the lot) every week.
<P>But Carmichael Motor Co. specializes in Honda parts and service, and all of the cars on its lot are Hondas that have been recycled--rescued from the scrap heap and refurbished with used nuts and bolts in CMC's mammoth garage. Carmichael's auction of choice is run by SADISCO, a national company that sells wrecked and stolen cars to dealers and junk men.
<P>Roughly the size of two football fields, the SADISCO lot off Gov. John Sevier Highway is a great elephant burial ground for cars, filled with row upon infirm row of ailing automotive pachyderms. But if the cars at SADISCO have a few more battle scars than those at other auctions, Carmichael (whose background includes selling both new and standard used cars) says the song remains the same once the bidding starts.
<P>"Dealer auctions are the biggest gatherings of 50-year-old 10-year-olds you'll ever see," he says, rubbing his coarse red beard. "It's a lot like the playground, and the auctioneer is the one who settles the fights."
<P>Auctions are where the real wheeling and dealing takes place, says Carmichael, where dealers vociferously note grievous flaws in cars they intend to bid on, hatch furtive conspiracies with one another when the stars align on a mutually agreeable sale, even gouge up the bidding on competitors in response to real or imagined slights.
<P>"They always tell me I know what I'm doing at these things, but there are times when I leave wondering," Carmichael says. "It's like Vegas, except you don't have to take the plane ride. I doubt Vegas has anything that raises your heart rate any more than standing under an auction truck with a $2700 bid on a car worth $2000."
<P>But that sense of risk and brazen entrepreneurial endeavor seems in many ways to be more intrinsic to used car brokering than any purely financial consideration, and the threads that run through different small dealerships are often more metaphysical than monetary, encompassing familial traditions, ineffable social mandates, and maybe more than anything else, an abiding fondness for four-wheeled automatons.
<P>"I wasn't even what you'd call an average student," says Carmichael, who raced hotrods before he settled into his first sales job at a dealership. "I just wanted to lay under cars and sell cars and drive cars. I was ate up with the business all my life."
<P>Beeler, a former drag racer himself, echoes the sentiment almost verbatim, and adds: "My uncle built Cobra replicas; my dad was a paint and body man for 30 years; this was my way of dealing with 'em."
<P>But in recent years, Beeler says fewer factory dealer trade-ins have been showing up at those mammoth auctions, leaving small dealers such as himself to fight over an ever-shrinking piece of the pie and rely ever more on the vagaries of their own customer trade-ins. It's a trend he believes may one day bring an end to the spit 'n' whittle clubs, the chuckle-inducing signage, the homespun advertising gimmicks, and the general backwater quirkiness that have become synonymous with the selling of used cars.
<P>"The new car lots are slowly squeezing out the independents," he says. "They all have used car lots these days, because it's more profitable to recycle their trade-ins than take them to the auctions and sell them. They've figured out that if someone comes in who can't get financing on a new car, they can do the financing themselves on a used car with only $400 or $500 down."
<P>Carmichael also sees it coming--a day when all cars, both new and used, are sold under the haughty specter of corporate autocracy--and his ruddy complexion flushes a blazing crimson at the thought.
<P>"That's where your high-pressure tactics really come into play, when you've got great big lots where all the salesmen have to meet a quota, where they need cellular phones just to stay in touch with the office," Carmichael snorts. "I would never buy a car at a place where I couldn't walk in and talk to the owner."
<P>But those same aspects of corporate car culture that Carmichael so despises may also help ensure that small independent dealers never go the way of the dodo, Walter Mondale, and the Edsel. A significant portion, maybe more than half, of the men and women who now own their own car lots kickstarted their careers hawking new vehicles for factory dealers, and Carmichael admits that most of them eventually sought an escape from the stupefying pressures of commission sales and hard-sell methodologies.
<P>And given that reality, it stands to reason that as long as there are a few cars to be had from public auctions and finicky leasing companies (not to mention the occasional humdinger of a trade-in), you'll always find someone like Howard Pinkston or A.C. Carmichael, sitting in a tiny office with an old air conditioning unit humming in the corner, drinking coffee and watching the withering Tennessee sun shimmer on the hoods of the cars outside.

For Arts' Sake</H1>
<P><STRONG>Knoxville Artists Explain the Ups and Downs of the Local Art Scene</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Artists are a curious lot. And art, as a subject of conversation, is often more dreaded than religion or politics in these parts. Still, Knoxville remains home to a handful of some of America's finest artists--both successful and those aspiring to greater success. And opportunities to encounter art are greater than ever. The Knoxville Museum of Art has become a destination for art seekers from all over the region. A<\h>1 Gallery, home to challenging and controversial exhibits of all sorts, is going on a year old. Before the leaves turn, Bennett Galleries, local purveyors of high-end art and decor, will swell to fill its new location and become "the largest gallery of its kind in the Southeast."
<P>Is Knoxville a good place to make art? Is Knoxville a good place to appreciate art? We barged into some studios and offices to find out.

<H2>Art Travels</H2>

Tommie Rush and Richard Jolley are accomplished glass artists. Rush's functional art and Jolley's whimsical, more sculpture-oriented work are shown in galleries across the country, including Bennett Galleries here, and have become prized by collectors. They are artistic partners, sharing a sprawling hacienda of modern studio space in West Knoxville that is illuminated and warmed by an array of natural gas-fired small hells. They are also married. 
<P>Rush tells a favorite story that helps to illustrate the role and visibility of the visual artist in Knoxville.
<P>"This was a few years ago, when Whittle was still going strong," says the bouyant, ever-smiling Rush. "Richard was showing at a gallery in New York. A Whittle executive, who apparently worked both in Knoxville and New York, saw the art and was very impressed. He asked a gallery employee where the artist lived, and they told him 'Knoxville, Tennessee.' 
<P>"The Whittle executive then argued with the person who worked at the gallery--'That's impossible. I live in Knoxville, Tennessee. If an artist was doing this quality of work in Knoxville, I would know them.'"
<P>Jolley has been working in Knoxville since 1976, and still is. One can only speculate on the whereabouts of the Whittle chap. But the fact that a person sensitive to Jolley's work might have been the artist's neighbor, or possibly stood in the same grocery line with him and never knew it, tells something about the often disparate lives and livelihoods of Knoxville's artists. Their work is world famous, but they still have to flash ID to cash a check. 
<P>Jolley says that for artists, like everyone else, the decision of where to live is a matter of personal choice.
<P>"I jokingly tell people who haven't been here that Knoxville is not very nice at all," Jolley says. "But you have to admit we live in God's country. And we're in a growth area. The arts tend to thrive in growth areas."
<P>Making glass art on the scale that Jolley and Rush do, in order to supply more galleries than they can remember the names of, is both time consuming and labor intensive. The multiple processes involved (melting, coloring, annealing, blowing, shaping, etc.) often call for more than one pair of hands. But since Knoxville is not exactly a hot spot for glass art, it's been a challenge for them to find and keep studio assistants.
<P>Selling, however, and getting the finished work out of Knoxville is another story altogether. Reliable shipping services can get their work anywhere in the world.
<P>"Artists and their careers are twofold," Jolley explains. "Vision and aesthetics can be developed anywhere. Then there's the career, which can be enhanced by living some place like New York or Seattle or the Bay area. I believe that there is the same proportion of people interested in the arts in Knoxville as there is in Atlanta or New York, though. The quality of life is pretty good in Knoxville."
<P>Rush says that there used to be advantages to living the loft life in New York's seedy art enclaves, but most of them were social. Now, the trend is for artists to endure the hardships of the city only long enough to become established in galleries there, then flee to the outskirts, or further. As far as culture is concerned, the urban centers no longer corner that market. Jolley refers to a recent Sunday New York Times.
<P>"Three days after B.B. King and the Neville Brothers played at Carnegie Hall," he points out, "they played at the World's Fair Park in Knoxville."
<P>Robin Surber graduated ten years ago from UT with a BFA in ceramics. The manner in which she expresses herself, along with an immersion in other arts provided by the opportunity to work and shop for Hanson Artsource, another Knoxville gallery, led her from clay to canvas and wood. A solo exhibition of her work, titled "Mostly Sunny," now fills a gallery at Hanson. In a brief decade, her work has become so popular that collectors were waiting in the parking lot, calling dibs on new works, as she unloaded them for the show.
<P>Surber's passion for her art led her to adapt her talent in innovative ways so she could afford to continue her own creative painting. She calls her business Clinch Avenue Studios (after her first studio in Fort Sanders) and markets her impressive talents as a mural artist through an area interior designer. She is typically booked for mural work three months or more in advance and works all over the country. You'll see her distinctive, Matisse-like lines in Knoxville's Italian Market and Grill, as well as plush new mansions in the Florida Keys. 
<P>Surber and her husband live on a lush recycled farm in south Knox County. Their home is a renovated barn, and her studio was a shed in a former life. In her kitchen, she smoothes a wrinkle in a rug with her foot just to make sure it's not a snake. ("We get them in here," she says matter-of-factly. "Copperheads.")
<P>"I knew when I graduated that I would find a way to work as an artist," says Surber. "I tried the craft fair thing. But I'm not mass production-oriented at all. I couldn't match a cup to save my life."
<P>Surber's muralist livelihood is only marginally separated from her studio painting. Her style, however, is consistent throughout her work. She used the same bold, dynamic lines to create a harbor scene at Chesapeake's downtown that she used to capture Black-eyed Susans for her Hanson show.
<P>"You just have to sell yourself," she explains of both endeavors. "I think it's hard to be an artist anywhere. Different people find different opportunities. People usually leave not because of Knoxville, but because they have an opportunity elsewhere. I'm that rare bird that's making a living at it."
<P>"I wish the university was more involved here," Surber adds. "As far as artists learning how to promote themselves, that's not really taught. Talent is such a gift, and it's too bad when people can't use it because they have to do other things."

<H2>Art Is Taught</H2>

"I think Knoxville is the norm," says Beauvais Lyons, "in that artists have to do other things to get by, just like actors and artists in New York."
<P>Lyons is no exception. An active studio artist, he has spent most of his days for the past 11 years as an art professor at UT. He teaches printmaking, but judging by the works that fill his west Knoxville home (which he shares with his wife, photographer Diane Fox, and their son Benjamin), he can express himself in just about any way he pleases. 
<P>Lyons agrees with Surber, that university art programs have a responsibility to prepare students for making their way in the real world.
<P>"I think something every artist needs to learn is to be a generalist," says Lyons. "You need a big toolbox to get by in the world. Some artists frown on corporate art or selling out because it compromises your artistic integrity. Well, not eating or not having health insurance compromises you artistic integrity too."
<P>He emphasizes and shares professional standards with his students, along with examples--of which Surber is one--of adapting one's art to create a livelihood. Teaching, like creating murals, is a way to do that. He sees the university system as a vast and established network of arts patronage. 
<P>"It's just like having a historian in the community," he says. "You want that person's knowledge, but you can't really pay them to read books all the time. So you find ways to make them useful."
<P>It is hoped that university faculty artists will cultivate reputations that flatter the school. Lyons and most of his colleagues make good on that expectation, showing and writing for a national audience. Photographer Baldwin Lee, painters Thomas Reising and Marcia Goldenstein, and many others have exhibited and been collected far and wide.
<P>"You can see the glass as either half empty or half full," says Lyons, considering Knoxville as a place for creating art. "It seems half empty when you realize that the community basically ignores the arts. When you look at what we spend on art compared to what we spend on bass boats, you can become disheartened. That suggests that the university isn't doing its part as far as arts education is concerned."
<P>Any shortcomings in the university's enlightenment of the masses are sure to get shorter. Studio classes are full of art majors. So the odd accountant or nurse wishing to round out an education is likely to be disappointed. Last spring, two faculty positions in the art department were sacrificed to budget cuts, and more are sure to come. 
<P>"You see the glass as half full," Lyons says, "when you think of someone like Andrew Saftel."

<H2>Art Gives</H2>

People involved in the arts all over Knoxville used the same two-word argument to affirm that an artist can thrive in Knoxville: Andrew Saftel.
<P>Saftel came to Knoxville in 1986 after living on both coasts and in the Rocky Mountains. He moved through Knoxville's art community as if he were guided by a divining rod--he hung shows for the Ewing Gallery on campus; he taught school children in KMA's Meet The Masters program; when he had an idea that no one was ready to buy, like his imaginative architectural friezes, he'd make one to give away so people could get used to it and then come looking for more. 
<P>His divining rod, he'll tell you, was his art. In 1994, less than 10 years after hitting town, Saftel was the first Knoxvillian to exhibit solo at KMA. And now, if you could find the right banker, Saftel's paintings would make for extra collateral against just about any new sport utility vehicle. 
<P>"I feel like Knoxville's the best place in the world to live," says Saftel. "You can make anything happen."
<P>Just over a year ago, Saftel followed love (he married art writer Susan Knowles, who works in Nashville) and more suitable studio space to the Sequatchie Valley.
<P>A cynic who'd never seen Saftel's distinctive work or met the man might be suspicious of an artistic spirit so successful but untainted. Yet the 37-year-old is modest and unassuming. Ask him what led him through different turns in his career and Saftel will quote for you voices he heard in dreams or unrelated advice from uncles that just happened to apply to a current problem.
<P>"I feel like it's a gift," he says. "If it's coming from the right place and with integrity, the art will lead you. And you can just follow it through the world."
<P>Saftel's first gallery show was in Atlanta, in1988. A dealer with ties to the Ewing had seen his work and invited him to try it. Even after several sales and a sizable check, Saftel says it took a lot of convincing when another dealer tried to persuade him to abandon his part-time Knoxville construction job and go full-time in the studio. His most recent return to Atlanta was to install a large mixed- media work in the international concourse of that city's airport.
<P>"The gallery life is a hard life," says Saftel. "You've got to be hard ass. You've got to go to the openings and talk about the art with people you just met. That's a hard thing to do."

<H2>Art Is Business</H2>

The gallery life is a hard life for just about anyone involved. Knoxville's art spaces are another glass that can be considered half empty or overflowing. Local yellow pages list more than 50 "art galleries," which doesn't take into account rooms that don't sell art.
<P>On September 29, gallery space in Knoxville will increase considerably. Bennett Galleries, which currently occupies 3,000 square feet in Western Plaza, will expand to fill the 20,000-plus square foot Capri building. The fine arts space that gallery director Marga Hayes Ingram can fill will increase significantly. Along with two large downstairs galleries, the new location has a sprawling mezzanine, illuminated by the wall of glass that faces Kingston Pike.
<P>Ingram says that the 80 studio artists she currently sells (over half of whom are local) will make it easy to fill that space with fine work.
<P>Rick Bennett, proprietor of Bennett Galleries, is making no assumptions about the local market for the massive new store.
<P>"Knoxville's a good place to do business," says the man from Nashville who hung his shingle here 23 years ago. "I don't know that there's a market; I just believe in what I'm doing."
<P>The gallery space at the renovated building is enormous and, even unfinished, impressive. Artists, including those who show elsewhere, look to Bennett's new space as a way to make more Knoxvillians sensitive to art in general.
<P>Saftel remembers the Atlanta dealer who first sold his work. He says the man's sales-speak was new to him, but made sense.
<P>"He would elevate the collector to the same level as the artist," says Saftel. "He would say that the artists create the art, but the collector creates the culture in which that art is meaningful and can support artists. I think Rick also does that very well. He's a businessman, there's no doubt. But I think he's in the business for the right reasons."
<P>Bennett downplays the business importance of sales through his gallery, using another artist as an example. 
<P>"Look at Rick Jolley," says Bennett. "I work for Rick. Rick doesn't need me, he doesn't need to sell in Knoxville at all. He can show anywhere. But I want Knoxville to have access to Rick's work. I'm just trying to make Knoxville a better place to live."
<P>Ingram says one thing that has allowed Bennett Galleries to expand is the fact that their customers have grown with them.
<P>"A lot of our customers are young people," she explains. "They buy less expensive items, whatever they can afford. That's the same way it was 20 years ago when Rick was selling posters at the frame shop. But many of those customers have stayed with Rick, and now they're buying $10,000 paintings.
<P>"It's been wonderful to watch the cultural maturation of Knoxville. KMA has certainly helped in that respect."
<P>So Knoxville is home to a large, diverse group of art buyers that has grown with the city's art opportunities. Ingram says that she knows of no hard-core investors, like the buyers in Chaim Potok novels who salt away Stellas and Pollocks in the attic in lieu of savings accounts. "People here tend to simply buy what they love," she adds.
<P>Another catalyst for arts appreciation has been KMA's Collector's Circle, beginning its third year. Members pay a premium membership fee ($500--90 percent of which goes towards acquisitions for the museum--on top of the $150 or greater Patron museum membership). Currently, there are around 75 members, mostly couples who, through lectures and excursions, learn about buying art and also make selections for KMA's permanent collection. An upcoming jaunt for KMA's collectors will be to Atlanta, to view Saftel's installation. 
<P>Bennett Galleries is what Ingram calls a small town gallery, and can't afford to specialize the way galleries in larger cities do. For some, however, the juxtaposition of fine art and furniture in the (almost) same space sticks in the craw. It's an objection with which she is familiar.
<P>"At first, some of the artists from New York were like, 'Oh? You do that too?'" Ingram recalls. "But once they realize exactly what we're doing, that we're keeping the galleries pristine, they're more open to it. Plus, while the more specialized galleries that represented those artists in places like New York were going out of business, we were selling their stuff."
<P>Saftel expects the new Bennett gallery to affect Knoxville positively, as much as KMA has. Jolley says that Bennett makes it easier for people to comprehend owning art by placing it near familiar household objects.
<P>And it deserves to be said that the Bennett venture is fanning the flames of the Knoxville gallery landscape in general. Hanson Artsource, the gallery that represents Surber in Knoxville and specializes in fine, craft-oriented arts, will be hosting a show of nationally renowned glass artists this fall. Diane Hanson says it's the largest, most important show they've hosted since she and her husband Doug opened their gallery in 1988. Hanson will also be changing its name from Artsource to the more direct Hanson and Hanson Galleries, as well as collaborating to show work by faculty at Arrowmont School in Gatlinburg, one of the region's richest and least easily reached sources of art.

<H2>Art Is Art</H2>

While finishing carpenters are scurrying to make the new Bennett Gallery presentable in time for its first opening, Faye Boston is hanging her work in the old Rebori building on North Gay Street. As a participant in A-1 Gallery's Members' Show, Boston, mother of two, is installing a large work that incorporates a toddler's toilet trainer, a projected image of the pouting artist when she was young enough to need one, and a recording of a strident mother-daughter conversation. 
<P>A-1 is operated by LAB, a Knoxville artists' cooperative. LAB's goal for A-1 is to provide a space for visual arts caught, by choice or circumstance, in the gap between retail spaces like Bennett and more restricted non-commercial spaces. Boston's work, difficult to imagine almost anywhere else in town, is a fair measure of A-1's success. Other member artists participating in the show at A-1 include UT faculty members (perhaps most notably Art Department head Norman Magden), retirees, and UT undergrads. 
<P>If Knoxville does indeed have a community of artists, it may be the network provided by LAB that binds it. Members are both accomplished and struggling artists. Supporters come from all walks of the community. KMA's preparator Joel House is on the board of directors. Knoxville's professional artists use A-1, and its nearly constant, challenging programming, to keep tabs on adventurous or up-and-coming artists. And A-1 is a regular stop for Stephen Wicks, KMA curator.
<P>"Before A-1 came along there weren't a whole lot of opportunities for artists who were doing art that was more about ideas than pleasant imagery," says Wicks. "As a former artist myself, I know that the one thing you want is an opportunity to have your work seen."
<P>Sharon Kangas is another example of how A-1 interconnects the varied camps of Knoxville arts and artists. She's a curator at A-1, a UT graduate painter, currently working in projection-oriented installations, a part-time member of KMA's staff, and a church organist. She's also attuned to the brutal economic realities of working in media that, in Knoxville presently, aren't especially marketable.
<P>"Finding a studio space that I can afford in Knoxville is a big problem," says the artist, who lives at home with her parents. "The jobs keep me busy, but none of them are high paying. The combination of not having a lot of money from the jobs to rent a studio space plus not having a lot of time because of that stuff, my artwork hasn't been progressing as much as I would like."
<P>The hardship of multiple jobs coupled with minimal opportunities to make art has Kangas casting an eye elsewhere for the kinds of opportunities Surber mentioned. She'll be leaving as soon as she's able to pursue her MFA. Whether or not Knoxville gets her back will depend on how favorably Knoxville compares with the opportunities she encounters abroad.
<P>KMA, one of Kangas's part-time employers, has played an enormous part in Knoxville's growth as an arts town, even without selling. Artists or art lovers with an itch to see Rodin or Robert Longo or Julian Schnabel six years ago would have needed a plane ticket. Even though "Knoxville Museum of Art" means that the institution is charged with bringing important art of the world to Knoxville--not to highlight Knoxville artists--over 80 local artists have shown there. Since many of the museum's staff members are artists themselves, Wicks says he receives a steady stream of positive feedback relating to inspiration and encouragement provided by its programming.
<P>The Ewing Gallery at UT also makes great use of its space and freedom, with a whirlwind pace of changing exhibitions and thought- provoking work. Usually faculty or alumni, many local artists show at the Ewing in the course of a year. 
<P>Both Lyons and Wicks opined that community leaders could do much more to promote the arts. The commissioning of works for public spaces or providing incentives for those who own public spaces to incorporate original local art would be ways to do that. Wicks is hopeful that recent endeavors by waterfront developers to involve local artists will set a precedent.
<P>Some Knoxville businesses and restaurants also provide alternative spaces to show and see art. Places like JFG Coffeehouse, Tjaarda's, the Stir Fry Caf, the pal'it, and many others show original, local art and even provide minimal selling services. Chroma, a self-serve gallery space on the mezzanine of the Bijou Theatre, is another great place to see local art.
<P>The Tomato Head on Market Square shows art by a different artist each month and has top-notch facilities for showing. The Tomato Head has also become something of a regular venue for the family of Steve Pogue and Kathi Freeman. Pogue and Freeman have lived in art-heavy environs like Manhattan and Los Angeles, but have found a way to balance art and a more satisfying lifestyle in and around Knoxville. Both Freeman and Pogue say that the social distractions in those places precluded artistic productivity and that East Tennessee has been a much better place to raise their two artist sons, Charles and Ollie.
<P>"The best places to make art aren't necessarily good places to live," says Freeman. "Knoxville's not a great place to make art, but it is a good place to live."
<P>A good deal on a house recently led the family from Mechanicsville to nearby Loudon. Freeman is a painter and silk screen artist--if you own a Tomato Head T-shirt, you own a collaboration between her and Charles or Ollie. Pogue paints portraits by commission lately, in a unique hard-edged style, to supplement his income. He commutes to his day job at McKay's CDs on Kingston Pike.
<P>Pogue says that even though art is not his primary means of support, selling the art remains the main incentive to make it.
<P>"I couldn't really support myself working the kind of lame jobs I work," he says, not entirely in jest. 
<P>"The question you have to ask," says the down to earth but not discouraged Lyons, "is when they excavate Knoxville, what are they going to find? They'll find some great elevated highways. But will there be any prints or paintings?"
<H2> </H2>
There are great works of art in Knoxville, and many more outside of Knoxville that began here. Are there things Knoxville could do to make it easier on artists around here? Oh yeah. Support local artists. If you own a business or other public space, consider or recommend original art as decor. You can do the same at home. If you desire something that you can't find created locally, ask groups like LAB, the Arts Council, the Art Market, Jubilee Community Arts, Chroma, or others in Knoxville who might make what you're looking for. Call UT's Art Department. The fact doesn't flatter anyone involved, but great art can often be had on campus for the monetary equivalent of a textbook or sack of groceries. If you don't need art, contribute to artist groups. Or, contribute directly to your favorite artist. 
<P>When you find a piece of art that sings to you in every way art can, you'll find it impressively affordable, no matter how much it costs. Lyons says you'll spend more to have a tree removed from your yard than you will investing in original art. And you probably don't even need a tree removed. Do you?

Whole Lives</H1>
<P><STRONG>Carolyn Jordan throws her life and passion into a film she hopes will make peace</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>In the wee hours of July 11, 1994, members of the eco-terrorist group EARTH FIRST! and others locked themselves to barriers blocking the road that provides access to the Watts Bar nuclear power plant. A ruckus was raised, attracting national media attention, and workers were delayed in their arrival to jobs related to the completion of that controversial TVA project.
<P>The woods of Rhea County were thick with environmental activists before dawn on that day. College-aged men and women from all over the country and even some Knoxville notables were arrested. Several hardcore, gray-whiskered, and shadowy figures--those who couldn't afford to be arrested or even have their presence in East Tennessee documented after previous run-ins with the FBI--stayed in the mountains away from the action.
<P>The goal of the protesters was to increase public awareness of the issues surrounding nuclear power, which they managed to do for a brief time. Since those arrested had no assets to compensate for the expense of delayed work, their cases were quickly dispatched and ceased to be interesting to the media. The power plant the environmentalists so adamantly opposed has since been completed and is now operating. 
<P>Of all the radicals present that day, the one who will probably influence the dialogue involving nuclear science (weaponry, medicine, energy, etc.) more than any other would have seemed the least likely to any observer. Her name is Carolyn Jourdan, and she lives in Strawberry Plains. She's shy, unassuming, and on that morning, was tagging along after the scrambling film crew that was gathering footage for her film, Half Lives.
<P>Half Lives is a balanced look at the 50-year history of nuclear science in America. Without editorializing, it sets the never-before-filmed insights of Manhattan Project scientists and workers alongside the industry's unforeseen problems and the comments of anti-nuclear protesters, including those who locked themselves to barrels at Watts Bar. Review attention to the film has spread its message to over 15 million readers, in publications as diverse as Scientific American and People. Select PBS affiliates near the laboratories involved in the Manhattan Project, as well as stations in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., have already aired Half Lives. Cable in the Classroom, a consortium of cable networks that provides programming to some 82 million school children, will be distributing the film over the next school year. A PBS network broadcast appears to be imminent. And the film will be broadcast on Knoxville public television on Friday, October 4. 
<P>Here, near one of the nurseries of atomic energy, Jourdan hopes her film will help shape the dialogue over one of the most divisive issues of our age.

<H2>The Filmmaker</H2>

<P>"It was a very radical thing to do," says Jourdan, who spends most of her time these days pitching the film to distributors. "Some people did everything they could to prevent the making of this film. I was told over and over by so-called spokespersons that the less people knew, the better. That's a big mistake. Look how well that's worked."
<P>Jourdan is soft-spoken, a far cry from most filmmakers promoting their finished work. She makes it clear that she'd rather be at home than chatting with a reporter. But she's made a film, and it won't do any good unless people see it. She thinks maybe this conversation will help. 
<P>Perhaps the most radical thing about Jourdan's decision to make this film is the departure it involved from her previous career. A UT-educated engineer and graduate of UT Law School, she quickly scaled a career ladder that led her to the position of counsel to the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works. From her Washington office, Jourdan was the liaison between lawmakers tasked with regulating the disposal of nuclear waste and the many disparate groups of the public interested in those regulations.
<P>"You'd get everything from a business organization," she explains, describing the range of calls she answered, "to a radiologist concerned because the government has made it so expensive to dispose of the syringes at St. Mary's that it's driving the cost of the procedures up. It might be a concerned citizen calling about Watts Bar--some normal American who wants to know 'How do I understand what these two sides are saying about Watts Bar? There's no common ground. What's true? How do I know?' Then you'd have activists from both sides calling. Really, they are not interested in exchanging information. They have an agenda that they want you to enact."
<P>Jourdan gives the legislators she worked with credit for making consistently sincere efforts to do the right thing by all parties involved. But there was no satisfying the special interest groups that tried to influence the work of that committee.
<P>"All of the parties involved in nuclear waste make money by fomenting discord and not cleaning up," says Jourdan. "There's no economic incentive to clean up or get a consensus. All the money is going toward chaos and confusion. The environmental groups raise more money through nuclear concerns than any other fund-raising issue. The two sides have been in this entrenched polarization for 30 years."
<P>In 1990, Jourdan tired of standing between two groups that did nothing but scream at each other and call names. She knew from her experience that the public wanted honest and accurate information. She knew that the special interest groups would rather they not have it. From her participation in the limited discourse that did take place, Jourdan had also sensed that the problems of nuclear power--mostly related to the disposal of waste--were being projected upon the workers of the industry, particularly those first involved. People who had acted as heroes, working against all odds and under incredible pressure to invent the force that ultimately stopped World War II, were being cast as villains who had unleashed a pox upon the planet.
<P>"My whole career ended up being centered on nuclear waste politics," says Jourdan. "All I did all day long was talk to people in meetings and write papers and newsletters about nuclear waste, and it wasn't doing any good. It wasn't going anywhere. I realized that there's no point in trying to talk to the pros or the cons. Nothing's going to happen there. 
<P>"So who do you talk to? Everybody else. How do you talk to them? I thought of every kind of medium, and thought that television was probably the biggest."

<H2>The Film</H2>

<P>Half Lives is an engaging film and will probably be enlightening to many. It presents the scientific spectacle of nuclear power--the heat released when an atom is caused to change its structure--not as equations or statistics or molecular models, but as oral history, related by experts at ease in their homes. Usually, when the media gaze is turned toward the end of World War II, the emphasis is on the horror of ground zero. That's a story that demands retelling, without doubt. But equally worth telling is the story of the still-to-be-marveled scientific accomplishments that led to ground zero and were later applied to post-war peace. 
<P>The elderly scientists and workers from Oak Ridge, Hanford, Wash., and Los Alamos, N.M., are disarmingly frank and human. They paint a picture of a world that's never seen in period films made for entertainment or more pointed historical films. Before there was a bomb or even the materials with which to imagine making one, the minds of these young people were America's secret weapon. They were the hackers of their generation. Since advanced physics and chemistry had only recently begun to be taught in universities, the majority of the workers in Manhattan Project labs were under 30 years old. 
<P>The labs were doing cavalier things with materials that would go on to cause trouble no one could have predicted. But all of the workers in those labs had heard of the very real atrocities taking place in Europe and the Pacific and were justifiably convinced that they would spread to the United States, or at least continue in those places, should the Axis win over the Allies. 
<P>After World War II, history carries the film through the advent of nuclear powered electricity and the Cold War--the good news with the bad--and on to the present.
<P>Even if Jourdan were not a first-time filmmaker, Half Lives would be an impressive piece of work. Listed in the closing credits as director, executive producer and producer, Jourdan refuses credit for anything but raising the money to make the film. After forming a non-profit organization, she raised nearly $1 million from sources that ranged from the Department of Energy to private contributors (including the filmmaker's parents and crew members). Though the fundraising process lasted as long as the five years it took to make the film, and is ongoing, there was one 18 month period during which Jourdan allowed herself only four days off. Since her work day was largely paperwork and telephone solicitation, she worked from the beginning of the business day in the Eastern time zone until the end of the day in the Pacific time zone--12 hours. Yet she attributes the film's quality and impact to the serendipity that led her to her colleagues. 
<P>Initially, she hired local crewmen to film the interviews. There was the possibility that the film would be eligible for support from the State of Tennessee, so she looked first to Tennesseans. As it happened, the cameramen and other crew she hired were inexperienced with documentary filmmaking, and the result of their work was substandard, she says. With over half of the film's important interviews unusable visually, she turned to the two elements that make Half Lives so memorable. She hired Linda Goldman, an archivist from the National Geographic Society and Smithsonian magazine, to gather the rare or never-before-seen historical images and footage that set the tone of the film and fill in visually. 
<P>"It could have been worse," says Jourdan. "The archive images made the movie. It also gave us the chance to use the camera work of the best documentary filmmaker in the industry." 
<P>After local resources didn't pan out, she hired cinematographer Allan Moore, who is best known for his work with Ken Burns. He shot the popular PBS programs The Civil War and Baseball, and has won Academy Awards for his fine work. Michael Olmert, the writer of the narration, has three Emmy Awards on his shelf. The man who reads the narration throughout the film, Courtney Vance, is an actor on stage and screen. He can be seen in The Hunt for Red October and has received numerous Tony Awards for his work on Broadway. 
<P>While it's clear that Jourdan's colleagues shared her enthusiasm for the project, that kind of talent doesn't get excited unless the price is right. Her exhaustive fundraising paid the film back with excellent work done by people at the pinnacles of their respective professions.
<P>Still, rather than acknowledging responsibility for attracting all that talent, Jourdan maintains that all she did for the film was make a bunch of phone calls. Reminded of one of Olmert's most resonant lines in the narration, "...science was hijacked in the name of war..." she comes clean, however. 
<P>"I wrote that line," she says, almost embarrassed. "I wrote three lines, actually."

<H2>The People</H2>

<P>The title of the film is a scientific term. It refers to the unit of measurement used to describe how slowly radioactive elements decay--or how long it takes to become half of its current quantity. The half-life of Uranium-238, for example, is around four-and-a-half billion years.
<P>Jourdan saw the importance of Half Lives to her generation, but she also made it as a reference to be used by future generations. Every generation from now on will be forced to consider in some way nuclear waste created during this century. One goal for the film was to provide a record of the first workers in the nuclear industries so that future generations would not consider them evil or enemies of mankind. If people watch it in the future, it's likely that she will be successful in that respect. 
<P>In the film, K.O. Hackworth, a 73 year-old Clinton native who retired after 41 years as an electrical engineer at Y-12, tells how the Manhattan Project changed his home: "They called it Happy Valley because jobs out here paid real well. Fifty cents an hour is a whole lot better than a dollar a day, which was standard wages then. I bought me a car that wasn't but eight years old. That was livin' way up yonder."
<P>Lately, Hackworth has been calling friends to let them know he's going to be on TV. 
<P>"It's an honor to be in the film," he says, sounding more energetic than the average 23-year-old. "It's an honor to be involved in something that posterity can see. To me, that's the way it is."
<P>Hackworth is justifiably proud of Oak Ridge and the work he's done there. There is a recurring debate with which Hackworth is familiar, as to whether or not the nuclear bombing of Japan saved the lives of Allied forces standing by to invade that country. To him, it's a ridiculous quandary. He did work at Oak Ridge that led to the completion of the bomb, and as far as he's concerned, his is one of the lives it saved.
<P>"You may be interested in this," says Hackworth. "I worked at Y-12 when it first started up." 
<P>He found out about the secret city through a chance meeting with a surveying crew out in the country near his home. Since he was originally classified 4-F because he'd been electrocuted, Hackworth found work in the burgeoning complex. He worked at Y-12 when the plant made its first successful electromagnetic separation of fissionable Uranium-235 from non-fissionable Uranium-238. Still, he persevered in his attempts to volunteer for the Army. It turns out his fourth time was the charm. 
<P>"They said, 'You're just the man we're looking for,'" Hackworth recalls. "I went to Europe with the 82nd Airborne. We whooped that little conflagration over there, and I loaded up on a ship one night headed for Japan for the invasion. 
<P>"About that time, they dropped that bomb on Hiroshima. We sat there for three days. People knew I was from Oak Ridge and were full of questions. But I couldn't tell 'em nothing. Anyway, instead of going to Japan, we headed for New York. That was the best trip I ever made in my life. I was apprehensive about going to Japan. I think that bomb saved my life."
<P>The Hackworth clan, which has remained in and around Oak Ridge, also stymies the lore involving nuclear physics and life expectancy. His brothers are all healthy in their sixties and seventies. His mother turned 96 last week ("When she was born, she didn't weigh but two pounds and a half! And here she's seen Haley's Comet twice. It was better the first time."). And Hackworth himself is not to be stopped. When Half Lives airs in Knoxville, he and his wife will be leaf-watching in Maine.
<P>Dr. Waldo Cohn, a biochemist who has retired from Oak Ridge National Laboratory but still offers consultant services pro bono, is also in the film. He says that he's not equipped to say whether or not the film will clarify the nuclear waste problem or if he's looking forward to millions of people hearing his remarks. He is interviewed frequently, and the interview in this film, which he hasn't yet seen, took place years ago. So he doesn't remember exactly what he said. 
<P>Among other things, he said: "Unfortunately, the modern debate has been fueled by public misconception. Like Chicken Little, people worry that the sky is falling. This fear permeates everything and people think radioactivity is going to attack you if you don't watch out. People think the best thing to do is put the genie back in the bottle. Well, it won't go back in the bottle."
<P>Cohn, now 86, ceased to deal with radiation and radioactivity when the war ended. Up until his retirement, his research concentrated on nucleic acids. Between 1943 and 1946, however, he was part of the Manhattan Project. 
<P>"The work that I did up to 1946 was essentially nuclear chemistry," he explains. "It was part of the plutonium project, which was part of the Manhattan Project. I was brought into the project starting in 1943, because it was known that the fission process--whether you're running a power plant or a bomb--produces fission products which are highly radioactive materials of no use. They are not the product that is sought. What is sought is the energy of the fission process itself. The result of my war work was the radio-isotope production and distribution program, which had nothing to do with producing a bomb. It was sort of a side show, if you like."
<P>Since Cohn's work at ORNL after the war didn't involve nuclear science, public perception of things nuclear was not an issue for him. Still, he's well acquainted with the debate. 
<P>"I've had no adverse effects from working with radioactivity for all those years," explains Cohn, with an energy that makes you believe him. "You simply know what to do with radioactive materials, how to protect yourself and anybody else. You deal with it by remote control, behind barriers. And when you're through with them, you put them in a safe place and put up a sign saying 'Keep away, because you'll be fried like an egg if you don't.' 
<P>"I like to point out to people that there's enough electricity in every one of our houses to kill us ten times over. The reason it doesn't is that we know how to deal with it. We don't stick our fingers in the sockets."

<P>Jourdan is now trying to decide if filmmaking is for her. She's had offers from Hollywood and she's had offers to make Half Lives the first in a series. She even received a call from a filmmaker who wants to make a documentary about her. While she decides, she's trying to do everything she can to get people to watch her film.

<P>"The problem those workers faced was much worse than the problem we face now with the waste," she says. "I hope it will shame others into realizing that those people handled it with no time at all. And we have time. This is not something we can't do. 
<P>"That's the ultimate purpose of the film--to keep people from becoming so disheartened that they just throw up their hands."

<P><STRONG>Emergency medicine calls a special breed of health care professional to the trauma rooms at UT Medical Center</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>At 6:30 a.m. on a cool fall morning, University of Tennessee Medical Center looks more like a prison than a hospital--somber, monolithic, a dismal collection of brick fortresses shrouded in mist and gloom. Inside, the ambiance is less foreboding--warmed by soft carpet and gentle fluorescent light--but still implacably sullen, awaiting the bustle and peal of daylight with fathomless calm.
<P>But one particular department of UTMC never really sleeps, and even at this misty-eyed morning hour the Emergency Department (or ED) is abuzz with burbling voices and clattering wheels. It's an unceasing medley of tension, laughter, worry, irritation, and weary determination all bottled up in a tile and fluorescent pressure cooker roughly the size of a corner food mart, a place where diverse human experiences become so irrevocably intertwined that even the gravest circumstances may seem rote, and even the most seemingly insignificant human exchanges may possess a singular poignancy.
<P>Dr. Pat O'Brien, assistant director of UTED, calls the emergency department the "front door of the hospital, the place where you get to see what's going on outside." If that's true, then UTMC lays out the welcome mat for an entire region, boasting the only 24-hour trauma team in the Knoxville area, and hosting nearly 50,000 emergency patients in any given year.
<P>At the moment, only half of the ED's eight adult trauma rooms are full--there's an elderly man with chest pains in one, a middle-aged woman suffering from debilitating stomach cramps in another, and a bewildered teenager with an oversized bug bite in a third ("a case of not thinking before he came in," says O'Brien).
<P>In a fourth chamber, a young black woman, a psychiatric outpatient, paces uneasily, like an excitable cat in a noisy kennel cage. Her attending physicians are standing outside, weighing the risks of sending her home with the abusive lover who necessitated her visit and who now sits in the waiting room on the other side of the ED's oaken double door entrance. (Using funds from the hospital chaplain's fund, the docs eventually call a cab and send her to a psychiatrist.)
<P>For O'Brien, the current patient count adds up to an "unbelievably slow" morning, which goes to show that even when it's slow, things at UTED move pretty fast. It also offers a telling glimpse of the sprawling diversity of medical conditions--blood-soaked traumas, foreign objects lodged in inappropriate orifices, sudden mystifying pains--that emergency physicians treat on a daily basis, and hints at the strange admixture of curiosity, compassion, and courage O'Brien's job requires.
<P>"An emergency doctor is equal parts physician, social worker, fireman, clergyman, and cop," says O'Brien, who actually was a cop for four months in South Carolina before entering medical school.
<P>Now 40, this slight, speckle-bearded father of three has witnessed the evolution of emergency medicine from a bothersome necessity, almost an administrative afterthought, to a full-fledged medical specialty. As an undergraduate at Vanderbilt in the mid-1970s, he gave up his Friday evenings to work as an orderly at the university hospital. The experience whetted his appetite for practicing medicine, but also impressed upon him just how primitive, in terms of both lay-out and staff expertise, the emergency room was in comparison to the hospital's other departments. "If you came into an emergency room back then, you were seen by the least educated physicians, unsupervised medical students, and residents who were learning as they went. I saw the best and worst when I worked at Vanderbilt, but mostly I saw the worst."
<P>By his reckoning, many lingering public perceptions of emergency room physicians--as doctors who are somehow less caring, more jaded--are remnants of that era.
<P>Today, thanks to a proliferation of new programs at medical schools across the country, about half the ED doctors in the United States are certified in emergency medicine (at UT, all but one of the 13 physicians permanently assigned to the ED are board certified in the field.) And O'Brien says the emergence of the specialty has also reformulated the psychological profile of the ED, luring a new breed of doctor who is enamored of both the singular adrenaline rush the job delivers and the undiluted public interface it entails.
<P>"The old profile (of an ED physician) was that of someone who didn't fit anywhere else and couldn't make up their mind about what kind of medicine they wanted to practice," he says. "Nowadays, it's people with inquisitive minds, people with almost a detective mentality. You have to be quick on your feet, and you have to learn the emergency conditions of all areas of medicine."
<H2> </H2>
New arrivals at UTED are evaluated in the triage station, a small, spare office wedged in next to a plush 50-seat waiting room in the rear of the hospital. Each new patient is assigned a letter value from A to D, with A signifying the most dire cases and D encompassing people who probably would have been better served by a primary care physician.
<P>When the casualties are mounting fast--and that can mean more than 20 people holed up in trauma rooms and splayed across hallway stretchers, with a full waiting room outside--those letters enable the attending physicians to set priorities and perform the precarious life-and-death juggling act emergency medicine requires.
<P>It's late morning on this day before the ED sees what the staff might consider a respectable lunch time rush. It begins when a Rural-Metro paramedic brings in a new patient, a transfer from another hospital under surveillance for an allergic reaction, a long, haggard, swarthy man with a red do-rag kerchief wrapped around his head and a withering stare written indelibly across his face.
<P>Then, with six rooms already full, the day's first trauma case crackles over the two-way radio in the corner of the nurses' station--"coming in by ground...male in his forties...neck injuries...possible internal injuries...five minutes..."
<P>At the same time, an elderly nursing home patient in a flannel shirt and a tractor cap is also wheeled into the front hall. O'Brien sighs almost imperceptibly as he hustles across the room, files in hand, and picks up one of the dozen or so phones in the nurses' station. His tones are still measured--"wavering baselines...platelet count...CKMB less than one...the patient had no other chest or jaw pain..."--but the stress level has risen audibly in his voice.
<P>But if there is some tension in the room, it's an oddly jovial tension, the sort of chuckling, resigned ambivalence you find at almost any workplace, very different from the tight-lipped urgency witnessed on TV hospital shows. As members of the trauma team, a group of residents led by trauma specialist Dr. Blaine Enderson, get ready for the incoming patient, they act more like neighbors suiting up for a bush league softball game than doctors prepping for a man who may have a broken neck; laughing, joking, scarfing last minute snacks as they pull on blue scrub jerseys and yellow gloves.
<P>"Why trauma? I don't know, I just like it," Enderson says with eyes that twinkle beneath gold-rimmed specs and an elfish smile that threatens to crawl out from under the woolen blanket of hair that covers the lower half of his face. A native of South Dakota, the triple-certified Enderson cut his teeth on trauma cases in Chicago and Seattle before coming to UTMC nine years ago, and now splits his work week between the ED, the critical care unit, and general surgery.
<P>"I knew when I was a sophomore in high school I would be a surgeon, so the idea of bloodletting never really bothered me," he says. "My time in Chicago really sold me on trauma, on the improvisational aspect of thinking on your feet. Sometimes you have to make things up as you go along. That always keeps it interesting."
<P>But while Enderson and his charges exhibit a loose-limbed nonchalance in the minutes before the ambulance arrives, their collective demeanor changes drastically once the double doors part and the stretcher rolls in. According to a paramedic, the hulking, bearded mountain man laid out in front of them suffered his injuries during the course of a failed suicide attempt (involving a noose and an ill-chosen tree). "It's his 43rd birthday," he adds, out of earshot, with a knowing sigh. "They always pick their birthday."
<P>The victim is shuttled into trauma five, the largest of the eight trauma rooms at roughly the size of an executive office, an ominously busy room crowded with pumps and dials and computer screens and IV bags and cylinders on wheels, all set around a lone stretcher-bed and a domed space-age surgery light hanging from a retractable arm on the ceiling.
<P>Ten doctors and nurses swarm the man, strip off his clothes, stick needles in his beefy arms. He looks homely and pitiful splayed naked across the adjustable stretcher-bed beneath the looming pod-alien surgery light-- a sad fleshy crucifix on a linen cross, arms spread wide with IV needles nailed in the crooks instead of the wrists.
<P>When the trespassing pumps and probes are finally removed from his body some 15 minutes later, the doctors find little more than some rope burns and a broken ankle, and whisk him off down the hall. "If he was trying to kill himself, he did a pretty bad job," someone mutters, also out of earshot.
<P>Outside, O'Brien scribbles on files in the nurses' station, watching through the plexiglass windows as the remaining physicians assess the worst of the other ED patients. In trauma three, the nursing home resident lies in a glassy-eyed stupor, black John Deere cap riding high on his brow, his ashen pallor offset by burning cheeks. A nurse gently leads a plump 75-year-old grandmother in a bright red frock into trauma four. Her gait is slow, hobbled, and when she points to her chest and speaks, she grimaces in obvious pain. Other ills around the ED include a bumped head, a chipped tooth, pelvic pain...
<P>The man in the red do-rag has his spider arms tucked behind his head in trauma seven, but that dour expression is still set like a stone etching on his hard dusky face.
<P>"When you work down here, you end up with a lot of intermittent time with a lot of different patients," O'Brien says. "I'm not always sure why the system works so well, but it does. It's a lot like being a waiter."
<P>That analogy holds true for O'Brien's schedule as well. In addition to his ED post, O'Brien teaches and performs administrative chores at the hospital and serves as medical director for the Knoxville Fire Department, approving care protocols for the organization's paramedics. "Those are my patients out there, too."
<P>While most UTED physicians work between 12 and 15 12-hour shifts per month, O'Brien usually works about 10, a concession to his other duties. This wasn't always the case; he says it was only in recent months that he managed to cut his weekly workload to a "manageable" 60 hours, give (but never take) a few.
<P>"I guess I'm kind of a Type A+ personality," he says. "But I have been trying to spend more time with my kids, taking them to gymnastics and baseball. I even have a cabin on Norris Lake.
<P>"And I'm playing golf again--something I feel should be relaxing," he adds with a dubious grin.
<H2> </H2>
It's early afternoon when the trauma unit goes on standby for the second time; one of the nurses' station scanners emits a long series of arcade blips and siren bleats before a static-riddled female voice cuts through the din and announces a Scott County auto wreck that has injured at least two people.
<P>The call sets in motion a vital arm of UTED's medical outreach--Lifestar, the helicopter ambulance service that affords seriously injured patients in remote areas quick access to the hospital's expertise and 24-hour care.
<P>A handful of paramedics and flight nurses crawl inside one of the two tan-and-orange rotatory leviathans parked behind a green fence just a few yards outside the ED waiting room entrance. Moments later, the whirlybird's massive blades, spanning perhaps 35 feet, begin beating the air relentlessly, stirring a gale-force wind that claws at hats and lashes at small trees on the nearby hillside. The hulking chopper rises haltingly at first, then surges and disappears in the milky sky.
<P>Back inside, assistant head nurse Sheila Duncan is listening to dispatched updates on the Scott County victims. Their car was T-boned (emergency slang for a perpendicular two-car collision), she says, and the 78-year-old driver is unconscious with a distended abdomen and maybe a pair of collapsed lungs. "Not good," she mutters when she hears the woman's age.
<P>An attractive 40-ish woman with a snowy complexion and a pert stack of dark auburn curls, Duncan spends most of her work week in the emergency department. In truth, "work week" might not be the proper term, because the schedule for ED nurses is a brutal, schizophrenic affair; Duncan's work cycle calls for seven consecutive days of 4:30 a.m. wake-ups and 12-hour shifts, then seven days of rest. "That week off is like a vacation," she says. "The week you're on, all you do is work and sleep, work and sleep, with a little time for a hot bath at night."
<P>When asked why she chose the emergency department over other, less tumultuous areas of the hospital, the 18-year nursing veteran responds off-handedly that "you experience everything--gunshot wounds, DOAs, dealing with families," citing perhaps all the reasons why most people would not want to join the ED. Then she adds, in an altogether more vulnerable tone, "I guess I take it personally in a way, because I've been on the other end."
<P>Then she's in trauma four, bent over the plump grandmother, tenderly clasping the hand of a woman who had looked unbearably sad and lonely only moments before. Next door, the nursing home patient is sleeping, a blanket pulled up to his chin. In trauma seven, Do-rag has moved one lank arm down to his side, but his face is still set in that unflinching stoney glare.
<P>The reports from Scott County only seem to get grimmer with each squawking scanner bulletin, but life in the ED is too diffuse, too quintessentially of-the-moment for the attention of all its denizens to be absorbed by any single crisis or event, especially not one that is still several whole minutes away. Even with the specter of some potentially moribund episode looming, the ED is a windmill of divergent sounds and activities; machines beeping and blinking, speakers humming, monitors going off in two or three rooms at once, conversations between family members, cops, docs, nurses, residents...
<P>There are three permanent attending physicians staffing the ED during peak hours. O'Brien says some of the other physicians shuttling in and out of the ED's ever-changing cast are doctors from other departments, paged for their particular specialty. Others are residents serving four-week tours of duty as part of their training, while still others are simply visiting, running errands, flirting, killing off a coffee break.
<P>All of them, however, recognize the rumbling crescendo of an approaching chopper. At exactly 2:50 p.m., Lifestar I comes lurching over the top of UTMC, landing slowly in front of the hangar with its nose pointed skyward and its great white underbelly descending like some monstrous airborne whale. Huge blades once again whip the surrounding brush into a churning frenzy, beating billowy folds in the white lab coats of the doctors waiting below.
<P>The older woman is rolled out first, her head an unwieldy mass of tape and gauze, her neck locked in a thick orange brace. Her 40-year-old daughter is brought in close on her heels, wrapped and strapped in a similar fashion. But her injuries are apparently less serious than those of her mother, and she is rushed to room eight, the second largest of the trauma centers. "My name is Danielle, and I'm going to be with you all the time," says a woman in a blue apron and scrubs, one of six medical personnel in the room. "I know this is kind of scary, but it's routine stuff. You're about to feel a little stick..."
<P>In number five, her mother is beset by more than a dozen people. To the benighted, they might look like malevolent blue wraiths, cloaked in ghouls' robes and masks and wielding all manner of brutish implements over the frail naked body of an elderly woman wrenched in silent agony. The trauma five doors close.
<P>Do-rag watches the whole scene play out from his vantage in room seven without so much as blinking an eye.
<H2> </H2>
By 4 p.m., the steady flow of traffic into the ED has mysteriously abated, and the staff enjoys a moment of rare tranquillity; neither of the Scott County accident victims suffered anything worse than a few broken ribs, the nursing home patient in trauma three is resting comfortably under the watchful eyes of three family members, and the little old lady with the chest pains has slipped into a blissful slumber, her x-rays finished and her pain mercifully stopped.
<P>On a stretcher next to trauma five, the would-be suicide victim, just back from x-rays, is attended by three residents. "You've got a lot more birthdays ahead of you," one of them says gently.
<P>"Thankfully, most of the stuff we see is stuff that's going to get better," says pediatric emergency physician Russel Rhea. "That helps you tolerate the few that don't."
<P>If O'Brien is a self-professed Type A, Rhea with his soft voice and brown curly hair seems as if his P rating might fall somewhere in the nether regions of the alphabet. He says he relishes the often exhilarating turbulence of his work in the ED, but his real reasons for choosing the department have tiny peach cheeks and flaxen blonde hair.
<P>Having briefly run a small private practice in Nashville, Rhea says the shift work of the ED affords him more time with his family, a department now staffed by two daughters, ages three and one.
<P>"When I was in practice, I didn't see much of my first daughter," says Rhea, who is impressively quick on the draw with his weighty stack of Polaroid snapshots. "Now, when my shift is over, I hand off to someone else and go home."
<P>For Rhea, the time he spends with his own children is therapeutic, salve for the emotional wounds wrought when he must sometimes watch someone else's little ones die. But he also says gruesome trauma cases and frenetic life-and-death struggles are so commonplace in the emergency department that most of his war stories tend to blur, one blood-stained episode fading into another.
<P>O'Brien agrees, and adds that it's the quieter, subtler moments, far removed from squealing heart monitors and hastily set IVs, that 
<P>make life in the ED worthwhile, and often memorable, for the doctors who are called to it.
<P>"One of the better things I ever saw at a hospital was when some other doctors and I gave an elderly woman who was terminally ill some time to die alone with her husband," O'Brien says. "There was no rush-rush-rush like you see on TV shows, none of the pumping on chests or any of the other things we're known for. They said good-bye. It's a truly rare moment when you get a chance to do something like that."
<P>Meanwhile, in trauma seven, a pretty red-headed nurse is chatting up Do-rag, straightening his bedclothes, fluffing his pillows and patting his bony shoulder, and for the first time in more than four hours, this hard-looking man with the flame-red kerchief on his head and the world-sized chip on his shoulder breaks down and smiles as broadly as his gaunt face will allow.

<P>Nine years ago, a Criminal Court judge stunned the public by declaring a mistrial in the middle of a notorious first-degree murder case, citing misconduct on the part of a defense attorney.
<P>The jury had endured a week's worth of testimony about the death of little Eddie Brown, on whose tiny corpse were found skull fractures, bruises old and new, cigarette burns, an untreated broken arm, brain swelling, vomit in his lungs, contrecoup (shaken baby) injuries, hemorrhaging in his belly, an old brain stem injury, ears ripped nearly off his head.
<P>Seldom had a crime so affected the public. Seldom has a defendant been as reviled as Evajean Brown, the mother accused of failing to protect her son from her husband, Mack Brown, while he committed this affront to human decency.
<P>The prosecutor, Bob Jolley, put a detective on the stand to testify that Evajean knew her husband was abusing little Eddie. The defense attorney set about to prove that she had never used the word "abuse" to describe the punishment meted out to the boy. The judge sustained an objection to the line of questioning, and the defense attorney asked the same question--slightly rephrased--again.
<P>And that's when the whole thing jumped the tracks. 
<P>Judge Ray Lee Jenkins excused the jury and announced that the defense attorney's misconduct had created the "manifest necessity" to end the trial. Stunned by the ruling, the offending lawyer stood and addressed the judge:
<P>"May I be heard?" he asked.
<P>Came the famous response:
<P>"Mr. Moncier, I hear you in my sleep."
<P>Jenkins is not the first judge to have been driven almost crazy by Knoxville's highest profile and most controversial lawyer. Whether Herbert S. Moncier is being praised for his brilliance, damned for his manners, dreaded for his persistence, envied for his success, or excoriated for his tactics, he won't be ignored.
<P>At 50, he is a pudgy perpetual motion machine of a millionaire lawyer who drives a silver blue Jaguar, but frequently shows up in court with the seat of his pants split or ink stains on his shirt. His dark hair is peppered with silver, but still he thunders and paces, buries the opposition in avalanches of paper, pushes judges past the limits.
<P>Ralph Harwell, a lawyer who was a mentor to Moncier when they were both prosecutors in the early '70s, says one underlying principle is key to understanding his old friend:
<P>"Herb's modus operandi is he goes from the premise that you challenge everything. Herb has a very fertile mind. He can think of issues to raise that others would reject, and he argues each issue in a criminal case with the same vehemence, and that irritates the living piss out of prosecutors, especially the self-righteous ones for whom the only issue is 'did he do it.'
<P>"They're motivated by wanting to make the world safe for democracy and getting the scumbag off the street. For them, defense lawyers are just a necessary evil and impede progress. And Herb does a lot of impeding.
<P>"Most prosecutors don't appreciate somebody who raises 50 issues before they even get to 'did he do it...'" 
<H2> </H2>
Ron Smith was a party to the astonishing turn of events in the trial of Evajean Brown. Just a couple of years out of law school when he was appointed to defend Brown, he knew he needed help, so he enlisted the biggest gun he could find--Herb Moncier.
<P>"All of us were devastated," Smith says. "We were shaken, devastated, pissed. And I include the judge in that number."
<P>Smith rejects long-circulated speculation that Moncier calculated Jenkins' breaking point and intentionally nudged him ever so slightly over the edge.
<P>"We believed strongly that we had a client who was entitled to a favorable verdict. I don't ever want to believe the strategy was to enrage the judge. We had a case; a beautiful one that Herb developed...just a work of art. Unfortunately, no one will ever get the chance to appreciate it."
<P>Harwell agrees.
<P>"Herb's not devious in that way. He does have a personality trait that raises that kind of speculation--his tremendous powers of concentration, some would call it tunnel vision. And he will not be deflected."
<P>Jenkins put down an order charging Moncier with bringing improper evidence before the jury, refusing to follow repeated rulings, deliberately trying to influence the jury, and being rude and abusive toward the judge, prosecutor Bob Jolley, and witnesses.
<P>Evajean Brown was freed when the appeals court ruled that Jenkins erred in declaring a mistrial and that a retrial would amount to double jeopardy.
<P>The case is remembered as a debacle, and some, in off-the-record comments, condemn Moncier's behavior as far beyond the pale. The public was outraged over the law's impotence to punish those who torture and murder children.
<P>Moncier, however, is still defending her.
<P>"Evajean Brown was reduced to a concept, and as a concept, she was despised. But Evajean Brown, human being, was kind, caring, grateful, and one of the most dependent humans I've ever seen. She was shattered when the judge showed displeasure. She was a gentle, sweet lady..."
<P>He is fiercely unapologetic.
<P>"All through history, when humans band together, the first order of business is to create a government. The second order of business is to protect ourselves from that government.
<P>"Nothing in the Constitution guarantees the state a fair trial. The state doesn't have any damn rights. The people have rights. And when those rights work to the benefit of someone they don't like, that's tough. "
<H2> </H2>
John Gill,  a former US. Attorney who is special counsel to the Knox County District Attorney General, says it is perfectly natural for Moncier to be at the epicenter of a legal maelstrom.
<P>"Most good trial lawyers have an ability to make themselves the center of attention," says Gill. "And Herb will go much farther than any other lawyer to grab the center stage."
<P>Other prosecutors put it differently, derisively calling him "Try 'Em Twice Herbie," a reference to Moncier's propensity to appeal losing cases.
<P>Gill calls Moncier "a genius at stretching the criminal justice system to its limits. Human beings can't create a perfect system, and Herb's a master at finding the imperfections. You may not see it at the time, but he's always got a reason for what he does. He knows exactly where he's going, and he will push judges, law enforcement officers, and witnesses to their limits. He is intimidated by nobody, and he's amazingly inventive. When you think you've seen it all, Herb comes up with something new. He has amazing willpower and stamina. He's not going to give up."
<P>Or, in the indelicate declaration of a criminal defense lawyer:
<P>"That son-of-a-bitch will keep going until everyone else is past the point of exhaustion. That's what he did to Judge Jenkins. You just can't wear Herb down." 
<P>Something that did surprise many who know both Moncier and Jenkins occurred when it came time for Jenkins to appoint a lawyer to represent another notorious client, accused serial killer Thomas D. "Zoo Man" Huskey.
<P>He called Herb Moncier.
<P>(Cynics are quick to point out that Jenkins soon thereafter removed himself from the case, citing a potential conflict of interest. They suggest that Jenkins, being a man who takes his responsibilities seriously, wanted Huskey, against whom the state is seeking the death penalty, to have the best defense available. But, this line of reasoning goes, Jenkins, also being a highly intelligent man not  unacquainted with playing the percentages, chose to bail out of the case, dumping it into the lap of his junior colleague, Richard Baumgartner. None who frame this theory are critical of Jenkins.)
<P>Jenkins wouldn't be the first judge to have had his fill of Moncier.
<P>There's an older courthouse tale that Judge George Balitsaris got so fed up that he barred Moncier from his courtroom. Not so, says Moncier, who maintains he requested to have his cases reassigned to other judges.
<P>Harwell says it was maybe a little of both.
<P>"We need to define our terms," he says. "There was a disagreement, and, as a result, Herb asked for his cases to be transferred. I think both of them were pleased..."
<P>Before Moncier can concentrate on the Huskey case, he must conclude the matter of Tex Hill, the Blount County video poker operator accused of concocting a scheme to defraud the federal government. Presiding over that trial is US. District Judge James Jarvis. He grins warily when asked if he's prepared to spend the next couple of weeks keeping Moncier in check.
<P>"My doctor tells me that Herb Moncier is hazardous to my health."
<P>One of the longest-running current courthouse legends is the rumored animosity between Moncier and Assistant District Attorney General Bob Jolley, nicknamed "Dr. Death" and known as the toughest prosecutor around. Although neither will own up to harboring hard feelings toward the other, nobody believes them.
<P>Jolley is stone-faced when asked to comment on Moncier.
<P>"The record speaks for itself," he says.
<P>Harwell has his own ideas about this issue, too.
<P>"Herb and Bob are good lawyers; they each see it just their way, and each sees the other as an impediment."
<P>Moncier says he believes Jolley is hiding his true feelings:
<P>"Down deep, Bob Jolley admires me. If he got in trouble, he'd probably call on me."
<H2> </H2>
He is everywhere at once.
<P>Endless and sometimes bizarre motions in the Huskey case? Look for Moncier. The over-hyped drunk driving trial and ensuing belch defense of Old City restaurateur Hugh Ray Wilson? Moncier. The federal court tax fraud trial of gambling kingpin Tex Hill? Moncier again.
<P>He chose Greg Isaacs, a popular young lawyer who has had a good deal of early success and notoriety, as his co-counsel in the Huskey case. Courthouse observers worry that some of the Moncier bombast is rubbing off on him.
<P>Isaacs isn't concerned.
<P>"People tell me that Herb's a prima donna. People tell me he's an egomaniac. I don't see it. He's a true believer in what he does. And trying a case with him is pure, raw energy. How can people criticize a lawyer for doing his job too well?"
<P>Isaacs says he and Moncier "are the guys who keep the police from coming through your door. Not the judges; not the prosecutors. We are the last line of defense. If you were someone's champion, fighting for his life, his freedom, how hard would you try? Herb fights as if he's the one going to jail."
<H2> </H2>
Margaret Corum never jokes about Herb Moncier. In June 1991, her daughter Connie Lynn Martin died at the hands of her husband, David Paul Martin, who knocked her to the floor, pinned down her arms with his knees and strangled her. His two children were in the house.
<P>He hired Moncier to represent him against a charge of first degree murder and was convicted in 1994 of voluntary manslaughter after a trial during which Moncier said, in essence, that Connie Martin had provoked her own death. Voluntary manslaughter carries a penalty of up to six years imprisonment--Martin got five.
<P>"My daughter was on trial," Corum says. "I've never claimed she was an angel--she and I went round and round about a lot of things she did, but it's just not fair. Herb knew he strangled my daughter with his bare hands. How could he get up there in court and paint David as a saint and degrade my daughter so?
<P>"My daughter didn't kill anybody. David did."
<P>Corum says her family was "devastated" by the trial, but has been driven almost beyond their endurance by watching Martin go unpunished while his case is on appeal. On October 7, the state Supreme Court agreed to consider psychiatric issues in the Martin case and join it with the Huskey case, as well.
<P>David Martin has been charged three times and convicted once of drunken driving in the meantime. The Corums say he has shown no signs of remorse.
<P>"In the beginning, I was not bitter," says Margaret Corum, "Because I believed God had a plan for everything. Now, it is hard to see. I can't sleep in my bed anymore. This is my bed right here," she says, as she pats the couch in her den.
<P>She says Connie's daughter Tiffany is haunted by dreams where she sees her mother at the far end of an aisle in the grocery store, forever out of reach.
<P>"It has changed us all; it has changed us forever," she says.
<P>Intellectually, she knows somebody had to defend Martin, but she believes Moncier went too far in the service of his client.
<P>"Connie Lynn is gone; she's never coming back. But I would just love to be able to do something so there would never be a Connie Lynn Corum whose name is dragged through mud, so her mamma and her daddy and her two children don't have to go through what we went through...and something I'd like to do before I die is have 30 minutes with Herb Moncier. I'd ask him how he could paint David as such a saint when he knew it wasn't true. Do we not live under the same constitution David does? I'd ask him how he would feel if he were in our shoes..."
<P>Moncier has short and immediate answer for Corum's question:
<P>"My heart would be broken."
<P>He has strong views concerning the issues of victims' rights, in general.
<P>"I think victims have a right to go into court and sue, but to separately consider that the victim has independent rights is to bastardize the entire system. I have yet to see a victim satisfied."
<P>He is emphatic, even harsh.
<P>But outside the courtroom, he is jovial, kind, and engaging; a pillar of Church Street United Methodist Church who headed up fund-raising for the church annex presided over by a statue of the Teaching Jesus, and he is proud that this is where Knoxville's homeless are fed on a weekly basis. He is a devoted father to two motherless boys, a lover of animals whose pet pig Theodore used to sit up in bed with him watching CNN, a spell-binding spinner of yarns.
<P>"He has a huge, generous heart," says Ann Short, an attorney who has been Moncier's associate for 13 years. Short, past president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, works behind the scenes, researching the issues Moncier will use at trial. Contrary to the belief of some, Short says Moncier always shares the credit for success.
<P>He is a civic-minded Knoxville blue blood whose mother, Frances Sanford Moncier, was a human dynamo known as "Mamma Mon" to the thousands of teenagers with whom she worked at the Knoxville Teen Center, which she founded to give young people a place to socialize and learn to contribute to their communities. She threw herself into her project after her daughter Marty was killed in a 1957 traffic accident.
<P>"Marty was like a second mother to me," Moncier remembers. I remember her telling me that night she never wanted to grow up. I took a hose and sprayed her. She said 'I love you,' and walked away and got into the car, all those crinolines billowing...she was on her way to a fraternity party in Gatlinburg. I never saw her again..."
<P>The Monciers didn't push for prosecution.
<P>"The criminal justice system had no salve for our grief," Moncier says. "My mother's reaction was to create a wholesome atmosphere for young people to get together..."
<P>Old friends say Moncier is a lot like his mother, and he says there's some truth to the contention:
<P>"Saying no to mother was just an invitation to do it another way."
<P>He married his high school sweetheart, Rachel Hufstedler, in 1969, a year before he graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Law. Drafted in 1971, he served in the Judge Advocate General Corps in Washington, D.C., as a captain. Rachel taught school. He was first a prosecutor and later a defense attorney. By and by, he noticed a phenomenon that would follow him through his career.
<P>"The brass liked me as a prosecutor, but when I became a defense attorney, they didn't like me. After about a year, I noticed that when the brass got into trouble, I was the one they'd come to. I am very proud of that."
<P>Predictably, Moncier was in hot water before his tour of duty ended.  An enlisted man, Robert K. Preston, stole a helicopter and flew it into the White House, which was then occupied by Richard Nixon.
<P>"The Joint Chiefs of Staff were considerably upset," Moncier says. "And they denied me the right to represent Preston. He was facing 105 years and a dishonorable discharge on an attempted murder charge."
<P>Moncier sued and won the right to defend Preston, and during the trial, he charged his superiors with the crime of command influence, a violation of the Code of Uniform Justice.
<P>"I stepped outside that little courtroom at Ft. Meade, and NBC, CBS, and ABC were all there, asking me to explain my motion. I ran home to watch it on TV, and the crawler came across the screen 'Army captain accuses Joint Chiefs of Staff of crimes.'"
<P>It was heady stuff. Morley Safer interviewed him on 60 Minutes, and Moncier rubbed the Joint Chiefs' noses into the case by making Preston his clerk and having him ride around in Moncier's Army car. 
<P>Preston ended up being sentenced to two months retraining and an honorable discharge. He was convicted only of misuse of a helicopter.
<P>Discharged in the middle of the trial, Moncier's commanding officer, whom he says "could do nothing less than hate me," wrote him a commendation for meritorious service that he still cherishes.
<P>He and Rachel returned to Knoxville, and Herb, who had earned a master's degree in law while in Washington, became a prosecutor in the district attorney general's office. Rachel continued teaching until their son Adam was born in 1977. Their second son, Nick, came along in 1980 and was born blue and not breathing. The diagnosis was cerebral palsy, and his first few months of life were tough. The vivacious, active Rachel fell into a depression she couldn't pull out of. It deepened when the family was hit by flu, and grew deeper still when Nick had an allergic reaction to her breast milk. As Rachel's state of mind worsened, her family rallied around her. But there was nothing she, or anyone, could do.
<P>"I have always hoped Rachel's story could help other women who suffer from post partum depression somehow," Moncier says. "It was a tragic thing to happen to a beautiful, gentle lady. We had made arrangements for her not to be alone; had taken precautions. But she shot herself..."
<P>He was in Ralph Harwell's office when the call came in, and Harwell will never forget it.
<P>"He and I went to the hospital together, and I stayed with him for days afterward. He was totally devastated. Probably the worst thing that ever happened to me didn't happen to me.
<P>"We'd sit and talk for hours, and he'd tell me, 'Ralph, I can't imagine ever laughing again'...God or bad, things happen big to Herb."
<P>Moncier was left with a 3-year-old and a severely handicapped 5-month-old, whom he calls "the most precious things in my life. I view them as my strength. They gave me something that needed me, and I found strength and warmth and love and comfort in the children. I was blessed."
<P>He seems prouder of the fact that Nick had his first job this summer --greeting and seating customers at Pete's, a downtown restaurant--than of any legal victory he mentions.
<P>And he will probably never fully understand why the tragedy  happened. He remembers the funeral of another suicide victim years later:
<P>"A young priest gave the eulogy and asked the question 'Why?' 
<P>"Why? Why? Why?" Moncier repeats. "It just bounced off the walls."
<H2> </H2>
It is late in the day, and Moncier is tired. Margaret Corum's comments have worked their way under his skin. He buries his face in his hands and says he understands the feelings of the Corum family.
<P>He gets up and paces once across his office.
<P>But it is a momentary lapse, and he resumes his customary bravado. If he were to talk with the Corums, he says, he'd remind them that they had the services of Bob Jolley, "the most vigorous prosecutor ever known in Knox County."
<P>(This may be a rare case of Moncier modesty. Some 20 years ago, he and Harwell were a prosecution team that never lost a case.) 
<P>He calls the issue on appeal in the Martin case "huge" and says it will make new law regarding compelled mental evaluations.
<P>"I defended David Martin based on facts and the law of the state of Tennessee. The tragedy that the Corum family suffered is real. But those emotions have no place in a trial..."
<P>He calls this "a case I can't make go away...I'm sorry they didn't like the facts they heard. I'm sorry."
<H2> </H2>
The tension is palpable, lurking just beneath the surface of studied tedium of courtroom civility on what must be the zillionth day of motions before the murder trial of Tom Huskey.
<P>Judge Richard Baumgartner is considering the mechanics of the death penalty, and Moncier asserts that District Attorney General Randy Nichols, personally trying the case of the man he has declared "the personification of evil," has not given Huskey adequate notice of the reasons the state is seeking to put him to death.
<P>Nichols, who has known Moncier since they were both prosecutors so long ago, is a ruddy-complexioned man prone to bright flushes when provoked. He does a slow burn as Moncier lectures Baumgartner.
<P>Moncier continues to push, and Nichols, by now fireplug red, raises vigorous objections.
<P>Moncier rocks in his chair. He demands to know if there have been promises of immunity.
<P>"Be careful," he growls when Nichols denies any such.
<P>Seconds later, he's calling Nichols a liar. The judge asks him not to yell.
<P>Heedless, Moncier thunders "Make him follow the rules!" 
<P>Baumgartner has had all he can take. He hurls his pen across the courtroom, calls a recess, and stalks toward his chambers. Halfway there, he whirls around, black robe swirling, and addresses the defense attorney:
<P>"This is on the record," he shouts. "You're showboating, Mr. Moncier. You're showboating because you've got a person here who is writing a story about you."
<P>Impervious, Moncier readies himself for the next round.

Sculpting a Legacy</H1>
<P><STRONG>Whether Knoxville deserves Haley Heritage Square or not, we may well get it anyway</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jack Neely</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>In a sculptor's studio on 26th Street in downtown Manhattan is an enormous statue of a man seated holding a book, as if reading to unseen children. The statue is reputedly the largest one of a black man in America, perhaps even the largest in the world outside of Egypt. And after it's cast in bronze, it may or may not arrive in East Knoxville, the destination for which it was created. Some have threatened that the statue may soon no longer even exist. 
<P>With tens of millions of admirers around the world, the subject of that statue may be the most famous and influential person of any race who ever made a home in Knoxville. Yet he remained humbly Knoxvillian, a local philanthropist and community volunteer, available to one and all, often eager to help even on minor projects.
<P>Now, almost five years after his death, when a small arts group attempts to establish a relatively modest park in his honor, the local response is tentative, discordant, murky.
<P>The project in question is Haley Heritage Square, a proposed public park on the east side of downtown to honor former Knoxvillian Alex Haley and all the good things he represented: literacy, family, and maybe hope for a struggling community. 
<P>At this point it's much more than a mere proposal. The African-American Appalachian Arts group (better known as Quad-A) and its specific task force, Citizens for Haley Heritage Square, have raised--or at least have been promised--hundreds of thousands of dollars from public and private sources to fund the project. The city has made land available for it; and for a couple of years now, a famous sculptor has been working on the statue that will serve as its most conspicuous attraction.

<H2> </H2>
With the city, CHHS identified a triangular slice of grassy slope at the head of Summit Hill Drive, between underused but attractive Morningside Park and overlooked but historic Dandridge Avenue. Local arts booster and sometime blues singer Evon Easley headed up the project, with an almost desperate ambition, to be "a permanent public reminder" of Haley's legacy, "visible and present in our community." In Easley's mind, it would be a step toward solving the urban community's biggest problems.
<P>"In the '60s and '70s, we went through hard-hit urban renewal," she says. "After desegregation, we did not have the organizational skills to preserve our home. It brought a detachment from community and family, which led to drugs, family breakdown."
<P>Haley Heritage Square, Easley believes, would help restore a sense of community to East Knoxville. "It would increase property value, increase attractiveness, bring hundreds, thousands of people into the area." She envisions performances in the proposed amphitheater on the site, storytelling festivals to perpetuate the Haley legacy. She sees it as the dawn of a day "when people from West Knoxville can come to East Knoxville and see it as a positive experience."
<P>Whether Haley Square can be the transforming generator of inspiration and goodwill that Easley and others suggest, it would definitely bring attention to this oddly uncelebrated part of town. Barely three-quarters of a mile east of the Old City, the park's at the head of Dandridge Avenue, a tree-shaded lane of well-kept middle-class homes and churches. Adjacent to the Haley site is antebellum Mabry-Hazen House, once home of wealthy gunslinger Joseph Mabry. Renovated and open for tours, it's now one of Knoxville's most attractive and fascinating showplaces. This hill may be the loftiest spot in central Knoxville. From here you can see the mountains to the south and one of the best skyline views in town.
<P>Still, Dandridge Avenue remains a blind spot in Knoxville's eye. Some downtowners and west-siders admit they don't even know where it is. 
<P>Organizers have almost transcendent hopes for the project. Easley says the Haley statue has already been cited by some as a national treasure and that it would be "a permanent public reminder, visible and present in the community" of an African-American culture and heritage based on strong family ties. 
<P>Quad-A executive director Nkechi Ajanaku remembers the first discussions, within days of the controversial Haley estate auction in 1992. "It was so depressing," she says, "his effects being sold in an auction-block scenario. We knew we needed to remember him in a better light." She emphasizes the potential of Haley Square as a positive influence on black youth. "Children need a strong influence, a strong African-American male model," says Ajanaku, who has four children of her own. "Especially in this city, we have to create more images and models for these children. They need to know they don't have to work for McDonald's--or TVA."
<P>Easley, Ajanaku, and others are convinced the Haley statue and park could be a big step toward restoring the dignity and pride of Knoxville's black community.
<P>Or, as the sculptor's studio has suggested to Easley, the statue may just be dismantled. 

<H2> </H2>

If Haley Heritage Square has already outgrown the proposal stage, it's far short of reality. Funds expected from the city early this year have not yet arrived, allegedly due to red tape and bureaucratic hoops--and what are apparently some colossal failures of communication.
<P>The whole development--which will include buying and installing the statue, building an attractive amphitheater alongside it, and developing historical kiosks to recognize heroes of the African-American community--will run to a total of $3.9 million. (Most of that's for landscaping and construction; the original bill for the statue itself is just over $200,000.) Fundraising efforts in Knoxville have been respectable, almost encouraging, but hardly overwhelming. As mainstream whites watch quietly to see what happens next, some factions of the black community have been skeptical of a memorial honoring an outsider they once associated with the white community. 
<P>However, Ajanaku is convinced these grassroots are finally sprouting. "It's really growing on the African-American community," she says. "In three years, I've heard just so many things--but on the whole, I've seen more positive than negative support in the African-American community. As far as the European-American community, it's waiting on the African-American community to take the lead."
<P>Sculptor Tina Allen has received praise in the national media for her work in heroically large bronze statues, mostly commemorating admirable black people. Her representation of Nelson Mandela is scheduled to be erected in South Africa. She's been working on Knoxville's Haley project for many months. 
<P>"We need to expand the idea of what greatness is--reading, writing, literacy skills, as opposed to sports," she says. "The Haley statue has that emphasis on literacy--but also on the strength and importance of the family structure, on knowing who you are."
<P>For this family-friendly author, Allen created a family-friendly statue. Kids can climb it like a tree. "They can climb on the arms, they can sit on the book," she says. Allen and everyone else involved with the project talk a lot about children. One day, as she worked in her Manhattan studio with the windows open, two black teenagers came by. "They stopped in their tracks," Allen says. "They came in, had to see it close up. I could tell they were shy. We looked at it together. After a long pause, I said, 'I feel better.' One of the boys said, 'I feel better, too.'" 
<P>Moments like that, Allen says, make her feel her work can help to unburden "years of psychological pain--and feel you're part of what's right with America. 
<P>"These are sad children," she adds. As it does in the massive temples of Egypt, she says, "sculpture can restore your sense of dignity. "
<P>In September, Allen was hospitalized for exhaustion and pneumonia, partly from breathing dust, an occupational hazard. "It was like being hit by a linebacker," she says. She's recovering, but has not yet been paid what she was promised. Allen herself professes to be understanding of this rare grassroots project undertaken by a group without as much administrative experience or resources as most entities that commission huge statues have.
<P>"I'm very tender toward them. I understand there's a lot of inexperience, people who've never done this before. And there are too few communities doing anything. America's very different from Europe, where everywhere you look there's art. I just want you [Knoxville] to do the best you can."
<P>However, the accountants in Allen's studio, charged with representing the sculptor and a team of bronze casters, are demanding payment now. 

<H2> </H2>

Most of the total cost of the project will come, as much of it has already, from federal, state, corporate, and private grants and donations. But since it's to be owned by the city of Knoxville, municipal funding once seemed the readiest source of start-up capital.
<P>Easley and Ajanaku have experience directing several of Knoxville's phenomenally successful Kuumba festivals--a major logistical feat, to be sure--but they've never built a park or installed a statue or spearheaded such an expensive proposition as Haley Heritage Square. Though Easley had worked for several years in Knoxville College's administration, she was best known just a few years ago as an Old City jazz singer. She's familiar with public skepticism. "People say, 'You don't have the experience! How dare you think you can do a $4million development!'" 
<P>They're doing it, and they're doing a lot of things right, by the book. Easley's an excellent promoter, and can readily quote figures on the several complicated deals she has negotiated. Diplomatically taking a holistic approach to the whole neighborhood, Easley talks of its provocative diversity, which includes the Mabry-Hazen House--built to be the home of a slave-holding, Confederate family--the Beck Cultural Center, and Haley Heritage Square. The Mabry-Hazen folks strongly support the project.
<P>However, some local historical groups, as well as curators of the Haley Project at UT, while expressing enthusiasm for what they've heard of the project, say they've heard few details and would like to be more involved than they are.
<P>With the city of Knoxville, Easley's treading a thin line. She seems grateful for what support Haley Square has received from the Ashe administration, but she's also painfully aware that it's only a minor slice of what the city allots for some other projects: $8 million for the controversial riverfront project just down the hill; $12 million for an equally controversial new baseball stadium.
<P>"We're asking for half a million," she says. She hasn't gotten it. The city promised only about two-thirds of that figure, $350,000, approved by City Council back in March for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
<P>And even with that figure, there's a polar misunderstanding about what that money was intended to pay for. Finance director Randy Vineyard says the $350,000 was technically earmarked only for a noncommittal "Morningside Park Extension." The city set about to procure property from the Mabry-Hazen complex, plus one private home, and has gone to some lengths this month to relocate a retired couple living at the site. 
<P>The city has made friends of that couple, by the way. William Mapp has lived in the house since he was a toddler in 1933, but he and his wife are contentedly moving to another house a few miles away. "Nothing will ever be as comfortable as this old home," says his wife Eva. "But we're not the kind of people that would want to stop progress if we can help the youth of the city. I think Haley Square will improve the neighborhood. At least, I'm praying that it will." She says the city has treated them well.
<P>That acquisition is indeed important to completing the Haley Heritage Square project. However, Vineyard insists that none of that money was ever intended to help pay for the statue itself. He implies the land acquisition may come in under $350,000, but says whatever savings there might be would merely revert back to the city's coffers. Citing municipal procedure, Vineyard says it would be impossible for the city to pay for the statue without additional action by city council. "We can't be a third party to these agreements" between CHHS and the sculptors, he says. "Certain things will have to be done, procedurally and legally."
<P>On February 20, he sent a letter to CHHS, stating, "The city would...have an interest in obtaining the statue of Mr. Haley...We would need to review all contracts, documents, and agreements with the sculptor and donors, and it would then be up to the city to choose a site and install and maintain the statue." Vineyard says CHHS has not responded to the conditions stated in his letter. "It's not a control issue," he insists. 
<P>Meanwhile, Easley has just moved the project's offices into a small white house on the Mabry-Hazen property--the servant's quarters when the late Evelyn Hazen lived there. CHHS moved in almost a month ago after they were crowded out of their old office at Morningside Park Community Center. She's been hard at work on other aspects of the complicated project, including a planned big-city tour of the statue, pending its completion, prior to its projected installation in Knoxville in July. She just received a $26,000 development grant from the Federal Economic Development Association. She's also been working on a web site to publicize the project, as well as a personalized-brick sale promotion she had hoped would be rolling by now. 
<P>For the four months since the fiscal year began, and through several meetings with city officials--including two recent ones with Vineyard himself--Easley thought the city's commitment to paying for the statue was only tardy, not nonexistent. 
<P>Today, Vineyard's opinion of the allocations are an utter surprise to Easley and project manager George White, a retired TVA employee helping administer the project. Easley says CHHS has sent Vineyard copies of contracts and agreements, everything he has asked for. Easley said that she's been operating under the promise that $102,000 of that $350,000 allocation approved by City Council was earmarked expressly for completing the statue and that she was waiting for Vineyard and the city law director to approve the funds.
<P>That figure, by the way, would have represented less than half the total bill for the statue, the rest of which CHHS has already obtained in grants from Knox County, KCDC, and private donations. 
<P>When expected city funds didn't arrive immediately, Easley's group obtained a loan of $34,600 from KCDC, against what she and KCDC believed was the city's commitment to completing the statue. 
<P>As for not responding to Vineyard's February 20 letter, Easley produces a copy of a three-page response, dated March 26, addressing the city's demands, asking only that CHHS be included in discussions concerning the placement of the statue and that the title to the statue would pass to the city only upon its safe arrival and installation. She says she's had several meetings with Vineyard and other city administrators, and the suggestion that city council would have to take further action has not come up. 
<P>Meanwhile, Knox County, which apparently has none of the procedural roadblocks Knoxville does, has already acted on CHHS's proposal and delivered $36,000 toward completion of the statue. 
<P>Easley's not the only one in the dark. Several city development administrators and assistants profess interest in the project, but ignorance of its status. "I've heard of it," one assistant in Community Development says helpfully. 
<P>Recreation czar Sam Anderson, who will administer the park once it's completed, is aware that there's been a delay but is under the impression that it's entirely due to legal delays associated with obtaining name-use permission from the Haley estate. (CHHS obtained that permission some weeks ago, and sent a copy to Vineyard.) 
<P>Meanwhile, the sculptor's studio has begun charging for storage space in Manhattan (perhaps the highest-rent neighborhood in America), plus late fees. Because of the delay in delivering final payments, the studio is now asking for more than $90,000 in late penalties and storage fees, $10,000 of which the funding-strapped CHHS has already paid. (The late penalties alone are nearly equal to Easley's impression of the city's commitment in the beginning.) The alternative, the sculptor and casters' agency insists, is ceasing work and dismantling the statue--apparently a real possibility--or possibly installing it in another city.

<H2> </H2>

Neither Easley nor Ajanaku assign blame for their problems. They wanted to see it done as a grassroots-generated project and seem aware of the realistic side of that proposition. "We just want to get it finished as quickly and painlessly as possible," Ajanaku says. Easley's optimistic but often seems very much like a concerned mother who's just gotten bad news after a routine check-up with the pediatrician. At the moment, it appears that First Tennessee Bank, for which Haley himself once served on the Board of Directors, will come to the rescue, saving the statue from oblivion. 
<P>For the time being, overstaying his welcome in his Manhattan womb, the monumental Alex Haley is seated telling a story almost as a modern griot, the African storyteller and keeper of tribal history. He's gesturing as if he's trying to say something. 
<P>At the beginning, some of the difficulty had something to do with the subject. "Why Alex?," some Knoxville blacks asked. "What did he do for us?" Some Knoxville blacks remember Haley as a foreigner-- someone from another place, someone wealthy and successful who, though he declined a token membership in Cherokee Country Club, spent a lot of time hanging with upper-middle-class white people. Some were disappointed to learn that Haley left his papers to the University of Tennessee and not to Knoxville College. Today, many mainstream Knoxvillians, black and white, are surprised to learn that Haley ever lived in Knoxville proper.
<P>What does Haley have to do with Knoxville? To Ajanaku, it's simple. "He did make a home here. He created a presence here. And Knoxville gained from his presence. The whole state of Tennessee has gained from his presence, especially in the area of marketing. And the University of Tennessee has his papers. That's here in Knoxville, you know what I'm saying? That's an asset." There's no question about that. The Haley papers may well be UTK's single most famous possession.
<P>The controversy reflects a few of many contradictions in the life of Alex Haley. His genial face and open manner concealed more mysteries than any biographer has yet presumed to unravel. No serious biography of Haley has yet been published, though at least one is reportedly in the works. Less than half a decade after his death, any final assessment would be premature. Some have questioned whether Haley was a great prose stylist or a thorough researcher or a scrupulously original author. 
<P>No one has doubted Haley's generosity of spirit, his skill as a storyteller, his influence. He's perhaps the most positive influence on black America of the post-Civil Rights era. 
<P>What does Alex Haley have to do with Knoxville? He wasn't born here, didn't grow up here, didn't do his better-known work here, didn't die here, isn't buried here. Though he said he intended to, he never wrote that book about East Tennessee. 
<P>But he did choose to live here, for most of his last five years. After a visit to the Knoxville area during the 1982 World's Fair, Haley bought a farm in Norris. For the next four years, it was only one of his several homes around the world, from Los Angeles to Morocco. But in 1987, while maintaining his Norris retreat, he moved his principal residence to Knoxville proper, telling reporters that, at 65, he felt a need to move home to Tennessee. But this Tennessee bears little resemblance to the West Tennessee flatlands of Haley's youth. 
<P>A millionaire beloved the world over, he could have lived anywhere: a chateau on the French Riviera, a Manhattan penthouse, a lush plantation in Africa. He picked Knoxville. 
<P>Ajanaku, who knew Haley, speculates that "he was looking for a city--but someplace where he could get away and write." Once asked by this reporter why he chose to live here, he smiled and answered, "I like East Tennessee better," as if that answer should be perfectly clear to any idiot. 
<P>Haley did take an interest in this community, becoming a generous individual sponsor of the magnet school that flourishes near the Haley Square site. Some, though, expected him to do more; more, between the talks people were always asking him to make; more, between the books we all expected him to write. When he moved here he said he had five more books in him, and that they might be as momentous as his first two, The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Roots. Instead, he wrote friendly little pieces for Parade: nostalgia, humor, practical advice. 
<P>Some in other cities allege that Haley does not deserve commemoration. Shortly after his death in 1992, the Village Voice led a charge that in his later works, Roots and Queen, Haley was a plagiarist and/or fabricator, suggesting his Pulitzer for Roots should be revoked. Haley was not a trained historian. When he wrote Roots, he wrote a book much more factual than most autobiographical novels--but less provable than most histories, which still angers some. Maybe it was a different kind of book, and maybe he should have identified it as such.
<P>Still, Alex Haley is idolized by millions, praised as a maverick who brought the tragedy and triumph of the black experience to black and white audiences equally. "African-Americans don't know who we are," Ajanaku says. "There have been millions of people in this country that don't have a sense of who they are, without a sense of shame attached to it." She says Haley's work gave African-Americans a chance "to grow and progress, to know who we are."
<P>How much Alex Haley's legacy will prevail in the grassy triangle optimistically called Haley Heritage Square remains unclear. 
<P>A handsome booklet published recently by the Metropolitan Planning Commission wasn't written to sound ironic. "The Heart of Knoxville Empowerment Zone Strategic Plan" attempts to sell Washington grant-givers on our inner city and bring needed federal funds into Knoxville. In Chapter 2, "Our Vision," under the heading "Examples of the Philosophy in Action," the text touts Haley Square as one of two dynamic examples of the sort of cooperation between a grassroots inspiration and municipal planning found here in Knoxville. "The residents who developed this plan feel empowered to make their own decisions," it goes, "but without a sufficient connection with responsive resources, Haley Square would probably not be built, and that would cause frustration." 
<P>On the other hand, the text goes on to add, "The resources without the grassroots vision would result in a poorly planned project without neighborhood support, a monument without spirit. The connection of grassroots empowerment with responsive resources will produce a project that will bring black and white together, will link diverse neighborhoods to downtown, and will create a beautiful, inviting place of pride."
<P>That connection is, for the moment, a tenuous one.

Night People</H1>
<P><STRONG>Your doors are locked, the lights are turned off, and you've settled into bed for another night of sleep. The long day is finally over--you've nothing more to think about other than soaking up the quiet and letting dreamtime arrive. But for some Knoxvillians, this particularly late hour is just the beginning of another work day, one conducted under the glare of fluorescent lights. As you nod off into slumberland, they are minding the city, making sure things get done and the system still works. Here are just a few of the people who make the city ready for your return the next morning.</STRONG>
<P><EM>Photo Essay by Torre Redford, Text by Coury Turczyn</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_musician.gif" HEIGHT=146 WIDTH=216 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Jerry T. Winther, street musician, and Arrow, dog, the Old City--12:45 a.m.</H3>
Although our city leaders seem to frown upon the existence of street musicians, they're actually a vital sign of life and culture in any urban setting. (Just ask Jack Neely about the roots of country music in Knoxville--dare you.) Jerry T. Winther plays and practices his guitar on the Old City's sidewalks to appreciative strollers, hoping to gather enough change for gas money or some breakfast. Surprisingly, he says he hasn't seen too much late night weirdness.
<P>"I've seen enough strangeness in my lifetime," he says, "and Knoxville is just normal enough."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_vet.gif" HEIGHT=141 WIDTH=216 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Dr. Hilrey H. Randolph, veterinarian, Knoxville Academy Emergency Pet Clinic--2:20 a.m.</H3>
Humans aren't the only ones who experience medical emergencies late at night--pets, too, face life or death situations when no regular vet clinic is open. Where do concerned owners turn? The Emergency Pet Clinic on Ailor Avenue, where Dr. Hilrey H Randolph and assistant Barbara Dieffenderfer handle those sudden emergencies.
<P>"To my knowledge, the strangest occurrence here was when a pot-bellied pig was brought in that had eaten rat poison," says Dr. Randolph. "It took an hour to appreciate the extent of the rat poison he had ingested and to satisfy that our treatment had taken effect. All the while, the pig was screeching at the top of its lungs."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_ticket.gif" HEIGHT=117 WIDTH=180 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Robert M. Rogers, Greyhound ticket agent, and J. Thomas,  Greyhound bus driver, Greyhound Bus Station--1:50 a.m.</H3>
<IMG SRC="644_driver.gif" HEIGHT=94 WIDTH=144 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Got a pal coming in on the red-eye from Chicago? Have to get outta Dodge in a hurry? These are the gentleman you might deal with in order to purchase some affordable transportation. Robert M. Rogers sells tickets, dispenses information, announces buses, and enters package express bills into the computer at night. J. Thomas, meanwhile, drives buses, loads passengers, helps out with the baggage, and "deals with the people from point A to point B." In order to adapt to a nocturnal lifestyle, Rogers has darkened his bedroom with cardboard and plastic, and uses appliances to lull himself to sleep.
<P>"I have an air freshener that makes a steady hum, which I use in the winter time, and during the summer I use the air conditioner," Rogers says. "The best thing I did to guarantee sleep was to invest in an answering machine. I turn my ringer off and the machine volume down."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_dunkin.gif" HEIGHT=218 WIDTH=144 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>David E. Whitson, donut maker, Dunkin' Donuts on Kingston Pike--3:34 a.m.</H3>
For some, donuts are the primary catalyst for starting the work day. And somebody's got to make them--Bavarian cream, apple-filled, chocolate-dipped, peanut. That somebody is David E. Whitson, who mans the Dunkin' Donuts night shift, making sure orders get loaded up for truck delivery to UT Hospital, Fort Sanders Health Center, and "a few places in Clinton."
<P>What's the strangest thing that's ever happened to him on his donut rounds?
<P>"Getting stopped by cops for speeding," he reports.

<H3><IMG SRC="644_nurse.gif" HEIGHT=140 WIDTH=216 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Christy Roth, Patient Care Assistant, neo-natal intensive care nursery, Fort Sanders Children's Hospital--12:36 a.m.</H3>
After the miracle of birth occurs, someone must watch over these newborns 'round the clock. At Fort Sanders Children's Hospital, one of those people is Christy Roth, who cares for the children as the new parents recover themselves--from feeding to diaper changing. As someone on the front lines of birth, Roth attests that--yes--more babies are born during full moons.

<H3><IMG SRC="644_waffle.gif" HEIGHT=225 WIDTH=144 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Rebecca L. DeMonbron and Bonnie Grant, waitresses, Waffle House on Papermill Rd.--3:10 a.m.</H3>
<IMG SRC="644_waitress.gif" HEIGHT=111 WIDTH=72 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>After a long, hard night of listening to Metallica tribute bands, exhausted westside nightclubbers swarm to that lone, shining beacon of coffee hope, Waffle House. Within its bright yellow confines comes physical redemption in the form of burgers, fries, eggs, and waffles. Manning the lines are waitresses such as Rebecca L. DeMonbron, Bonnie Grant, and Kathy A. Ritter, and cooks like James Edwards and James Willoughby. 
<P>"I enjoy the third shift," insists DeMonbron. "Waffle House at night is almost like a safe haven for people to stop over to."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_dj.gif" HEIGHT=199 WIDTH=130 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Terry Womack, disc jockey, WIVK FM--4:05 a.m.</H3>
In this age of complete broadcast automation, it might be expected that your favorite radio station simply turns on the CD player at midnight and lets the staff go home. Not so at WIVK, where Terry Womack plays country music, commercials, and weather reports until 5 a.m. He also answers the phones, taking requests all night long from other night shift people for the tunes that keep them going. Does this lonely time slot ever get boring? Not for Womack.
<P>"I always wanted to be in radio since the 6th grade, and have been in this business for 30 years--and it's always exciting, always new," says Womack. "I'm just living a dream."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_kroger.gif" HEIGHT=201 WIDTH=130 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Mickey Harp, night manager, Knox Plaza Kroger--2:58 a.m.</H3>
Working from 9:30 p.m. to 6 a.m., Monday through Friday, Mickey Harp is the fellow who keeps those Kroger floors cleaned and buffed--when he isn't waiting on people, too. And all sorts are attracted to the store in the wee hours: people passing out in the aisles, fraternity pledges demanding giant cucumbers, women making promises they can't keep in a vain attempt to get around the 3 a.m. beer restriction. And that's not all.
<P>"People will sometimes try to steal stuff by coming up to the front claiming that they have been rung up already in the back, even though I'm the only one here," says Harp. "We also get a lot of guys in here obviously trying to make up with their girlfriends, buying balloons, cards, candy--anything they can get at five in the morning. Makes you wonder what they did."

<H3><IMG SRC="644_tv.gif" HEIGHT=93 WIDTH=144 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Will Gouch and Rick Jones, master control technicians, WKXT Channel 8--12:33 a.m.</H3>
It's one o'clock in the morning, you can't sleep, and the warm milk isn't kicking in--so what can you do? Flick on Night Court. That just might work. And the fellows making sure the proper buttons are being pushed to safeguard your 1 a.m. viewing of that seminal sit-com are Will Gouch and Rick Jones. They are in charge of ensuring that all the shows and commercials run on the air correctly.
<P>"The worst thing is when something happens during a show and you have to hurry and replace it with something else," says Jones. 
<P>"One time they were getting ready to do a live feed from a satellite and everything was fine--until all of a sudden the satellite was gone and we didn't know where it went," says Gouch. "So you're always left wondering if the set will actually be there."

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><IMG SRC="644_mortician.gif" HEIGHT=199 WIDTH=130 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Tim Wheeler, mortician, Steven's Mortuary--5:24 a.m.</H3>
Death, it seems, often strikes at night. As general manager, funeral director, and embalmer at Steven's Mortuary, Tim Wheeler is on call seven days a week, 24 hours a day. He makes the removals at the institutions or homes where deaths have occurred, then places the deceased on the preparation room table. Once he has obtained verbal or written permission by the family, the embalming is done. It's a job one has to get used to.
<P>"I had just begun work here for a couple of months and I had someone who had died in the hospital," relates Wheeler. "When we went to remove the body from the bed to our cot, the lung collapsed and the air escaped through the mouth, causing a moaning sound. That's probably the worst experience of my life, but now I've become accustomed to it."

A Joyful Noise</H1>
<P><STRONG>The sweet sound of gospel music resounds in Knoxville</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>"GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, KNOXVILLE!" pipes Brother Louis Thompson across three counties every weekday morning at 5 a.m. From the small cinder block bunker of a studio that houses WKGN-AM, he sends out what may be the most joyous wake-up call available in Knoxville. "This is the time of day when I just like to raise my hands to the heavens and thank Jesus for letting me see another day. Won't y'all join me?" 
<P>Thompson has been on the air in Knoxville, sharing the Lord's message in music, for 28 years. Even though he gets a regular traffic report feed by telephone for his broadcast, Thompson's brand of traffic advisory is unique on early morning radio. "Lord, please keep that old reckless driver out of our way and protect us from the evil one who might wish to do us harm."
<P>All of a sudden, it's like Jesus is in charge of 1,000 watts--an illusion made complete by the rapturous sounds of gospel music that Thompson shares for two hours with a still-sleepy Knoxville. 
<P>Even though it's on and off the air before the fog burns off the pond, Thompson's Gospel Caravan is one of WKGN's most popular time slots--in sharp contrast with the urban format to which the station adheres during the remainder of the day. Three other stations in Knoxville play gospel music around the clock, and many of those radio fans and others are lining up at the musical altar to hear live gospel every chance they get. 
<P>Gospel in Knoxville is experiencing the same "changing of the guard" that other styles of music have seen. The rousing, transcendental euphony of the traditional black choirs and jubilee quartets is giving way to updated, more pop-sounding music. Younger ministers, congregations, and performers are moving away from the roots of the genre to a more palatable, mainstreamed and modern sound. Here we introduce some folks who regularly share their God-given gifts in song and explain how things look from the gospel stage.

<H3>So Much To Shout About</H3>

<P>On the Sunday daylight savings time begins, it appears to be getting dark at an odd and early hour through the rippled amber windows of First Baptist Church at Roseberry City, a tiny, 80-year-old brick building in North Knoxville. But the sun is shining inside. The God Gospel Singers are holding forth in the tiny sanctuary, and the room is bright and alive. The audience of 50, ranging from pre-teens to seniors in age, are on their feet clapping and dancing for almost the entire 90 minute performance. 
<P>The God Gospels, a female quintet backed by lively piano and drums, have been singing traditional gospel in and around Knoxville for nearly six decades. Violet Thompson, Joanne Moore, and Alma Harrison (Sister Harrison could not be present today) are all original members. Juanita Clinkscales and Beverly Moore have joined in recent years. The collective years that the God Gospels have lived seem only to have enhanced their rich, multi-layered sound. Sister Joanne Moore makes use of a cane on her way to the microphone, where she promptly hits and holds notes that would put singers half her age to shame. 
<P>As a group, the God Gospels make a beautiful sound, a shimmering tide of holy harmony. Yet even in such talented company, Sister Beverly Moore, the baby of the group at 36, stands out. Her amazing delivery is nothing less than volcanic, reminiscent of the young Aretha Franklin when she was a featured vocalist in her father's traveling choir. 
<P>"I was bashful when I was a girl," says Beverly, who's still a bit reserved when she's not singing. "I had a glee club teacher who made me sing."
<P>Since her glee club days in grade school, Beverly hasn't stopped singing. And she sings only gospel. Hers is the very type of voice for which blues and soul were invented, yet she's not attracted to anything those kinds of music have to offer.
<P>"God blesses me and I just want to bless other people with what he gave me," she says sincerely. "I want to use my talent for God. People tell me sometimes that I could do well out there. Well, all of that out there doesn't mean anything to me."
<P>Even though she's only been on stage with the God Gospels for five years, Moore has been involved with the group since she was a child. Her aunt was a singing member, and Moore would attend local concerts and travel along on their frequent excursions to other cities, such as Nashville and Chattanooga. Moore says that in the years since she began attending gospel concerts, she's seen the audience for that vibrant, traditional music lose some of its steam. 
<P>"I think the popularity of gospel is going downhill a little bit," she says. "Years ago, the churches used to be packed and response was always good. Now, a lot of the audiences are small, and sometimes, even if they're not, the people just sit there."
<P>Like the elder God Gospel Singers, Louis Thompson has made a career of gospel music. The satisfaction he receives from his work is evident in his warm and satisfied soulful charisma. He has an unfading, beaming smile, like the face the Farmer's Almanac used to put on a full moon. A regular segment of Thompson's Gospel Caravan is the Caravan Calendar. He says there are roughly half a dozen local black gospel groups for whom he announces regular dates. There used to be many more, he adds.
<P>"Now, the young people with talent seem to want to play the popular music," he says. "All the other young people are locked up in the church. The people who have talent and stay in the church are kept very busy by their pastors and usually don't have time to sing out in town."
<P>"Concerts like this one," he adds, referring to the God Gospels' performance, "the Sunday afternoon musical, have almost become a thing of the past."
<P>Diane Jordan is a Knox County Commissioner and a gospel singer. She currently sings at the church where her husband is pastor, Peace and Goodwill Missionary Baptist Church, on Woodbine Avenue, and her former group (Jordan and Company) has evolved into the choir at that church. Jordan also organizes the gospel talent for the annual Kuumba Festival in Knoxville. From her experience as a performer and promoter, Jordan offers another perspective of black gospel music's changing audience in Knoxville. 
<P>"Knoxville is a good place to sing gospel," she says. "But it's not a good place to make money singing gospel. We've had some real dynamic groups here that weren't able to move. In terms of appearances, though, you can get all you want. There are lots of audiences that want to hear good gospel music."
<P>That fans of traditional black gospel in Knoxville may not be a gold mine for talented local singers can probably be attributed to a number of mixed blessings. Most folks who enjoy the music are familiar with the motivation of the singers. They're aware that men and women, like Sister Beverly Moore, see their talent as gifts from God, given to share. They know it'll be shared, whether or not it's paid for. In almost 60 years, the God Gospels say they've only rarely declined an invitation to perform because the inviter couldn't promise pay. At this concert, the offering plate is passed to compensate their talent, hard work, and the message they passed along. 
<P>Another factor is that singers of national fame regularly pass through Knoxville and perform for modest ticket prices. Heroes of the genre, like Willie Neal, who sang at Knoxville College in October, routinely play here for 10 bucks or less, about the same as the average bar band on the strip or Market Square. 

<H3>Bringing In The Sheaves</H3>

<P>Gospel music is a black tradition that has been embraced and adapted for other audiences over the last century and a half. Separate from hymns and other sacred or liturgical music, historians credit the invention of gospel to an energetic black pianist named Thomas Dorsey, who first composed in the teens of this century. Even before Dorsey, slaves had adapted the sermons and spirituals they heard here during the 18th and 19th centuries to rhythms of their own African-based cultures. 
<P>There's a tendency to point out attributes of the distinct white and black gospel traditions with claims that certain musical aspects were borrowed by one culture from the other. It would be more accurate to say that there has been an ongoing process of sharing between black and white gospel (or Southern gospel, as its current niche in the sales and radio markets is referred to) all along. Slaves learned the hymns of the Protestant faith and also interpreted the Bible to write their own spirituals. During the '20s and '30s, Southern songsters like A.P. Carter and Jimmie Rodgers re-learned those same hymns, radically changed and stylized, from black musicians such as Frank Stokes and Blind Willie McTell. The white singers then thrust their versions of the songs into a young and growing country music song bag. Ever since, the traditions of black and white churches have given to each other, like the soil that feeds the tree that, a season later, feeds the soil. 
<P>J. Bazzel Mull first played the Lord's music on the radio in 1939. Since then, his signal has only gained in strength. His family now owns and operates PRAISE 96.3 (WJBZ-FM), and Mull, with his wife and long-time broadcast partner, Elizabeth "Lady" Mull, continues to host a Sunday morning gospel television show that has aired on WBIR for 40 years. Preacher and Lady Mull are on the air almost every day on stations all over East Tennessee. He has become an icon in Southern gospel, a form of music and worship that he's done much to sustain. 
<P>"Back when I first went on the radio in nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, very few stations played gospel music," says the sprightly, gravel-voiced Mull, explaining gospel's growth in popularity. "I think it's the hand of the Lord guiding people to gospel music. It's the last message that God is sending to the world before the rapture. 
<P>"Gospel music has made it. It's all over the nation. It's as great now as country music ever dared to be. In fact, most country singers have gospel records out now."
<P>Southern gospel has evolved alongside black gospel. Mull's comparison to country is natural, as Southern gospel tends toward similar instrumentation and arrangements. In contemporary groups one hears shades of the family quartets and duos popular in early bluegrass, as well as the Nashville sound born on the Grand Ole Opry.
<P>Arbitron rates PRAISE-96.3 number one out of 1,100 Southern gospel stations across the country. The Mull family sees the music they spread far and wide as nothing less than a ministry. One aspect of that ministry, which has had a tremendous impact on the steadily increasing popularity of Southern gospel music, is their live singing conventions, where they bring performers of national or regional acclaim to sing in and around Knoxville. 
<P>Cedar Ridge is a Knoxville-based family quintet that has performed for Mull Family conventions, and has had nearly a dozen songs on the Southern gospel top 40 (in the charts published in Singing News, Southern gospel's answer to Billboard and Rolling Stone). Frank Treece manages the group, which features his wife Violet, his sons Jeff, Duane, and Dustin, and his daughter-in-law Ginger. 
<P>"Knoxville is one of the better singing points in the country," says the elder Treece, who has toured nationally with the group for 32 years. "There are a lot more local groups here than in most other towns, and that seems to keep the audience interested. Out west, in California or Texas, there aren't a lot of groups. Of course that seems to help us when we go out there, because the people really come out for gospel when they get the chance."
<P>The Treece family also sees its music as an extension of their religion. When they consider recording or performing a song that they didn't write themselves, they'll compare it one line at a time with the Bible to make sure it's something they can get behind. Treece says that Cedar Ridge's audience is equal parts churchgoers and folks who just love their music for the way it sounds. They do have a fine sound, with family harmonies out in front of modern, multi-instrumental arrangements. Cedar Ridge's line-up demonstrates well one facet of Southern gospel's evolution. Due to extensive traveling and performances in nontraditional venues that aren't likely to have a piano, the electronic keyboard has all but ousted the piano from its position as primary accompaniment. 
<P>Cedar Ridge will perform in Knoxville the Sunday before Thanksgiving at Valley View Baptist Church.
<P>The music of Knoxvillian Kirk Talley also illustrates how Southern gospel has adapted to appeal to secular audiences. His arrangements are tight, slick, and up to the minute--somewhere between Bruce Hornsby and Michael Bolton. So while his lyrics are traditional in their references to scripture and prayer, his music gets him into a lot of homes that might not lean toward old-time gospel. Readers of Singing News recently voted Talley Favorite southern gospel male singer and favorite southern gospel song writer and picked his "Serenaded By Angels," from last year's album ,Serenade, as their favorite southern gospel song. Talley is on the bill for the upcoming Mull Family singing convention scheduled for Thanksgiving evening. 
<P>A sort of adjunct to Southern gospel is the nebulous and recently invented contemporary Christian brand of gospel. Contemporary Christian is something of a musical chameleon. In record stores you'll find rap, rock, and even heavy metal with religious lyrics. 

<H3>Tilling New Fields</H3>

<P>On a recent Monday night, Lorrie's Kitchen, on Broadway, is packed to near capacity. A Knoxville trio called Redeemed is letting loose some rafter-raising hymns, their own originals, and Southern gospel top 40 tunes. They've drawn in almost enough boots and Bibles to moderate the Big Orange decor at Lorrie's. 
<P>As singer and pianist Fredda Valentine winds up, "I can almost hear the trumpet for the Lord to come again ..." singer Tommy Spencer sums up the mood: "Folks, if that don't make you shout, you got a busted shouter!"
<P>From a distance, Valentine looks and sounds a perfect copy of a young Tammy Wynette. Up close, it's clear that she's taller and prettier.
<P>"I do sing country some," she says. "But this kind of music is so different. It just fills you up."
<P>Redeemed has been together just over eight months. Along with bassist Ron Hutchinson, Valentine and Spencer have been playing regularly on the Star of Knoxville and plan to record a compact disc early next year. Though they're members of a newly formed group, all three have been musicians in Knoxville for years.
<P>"This is not a hard way to make a living," says Spencer, who's been singing since he was six and is now in his mid-30s. "We've almost got more work than we can handle. Knoxville has a very large audience for gospel, but it's very discriminating. If you're not very good, you won't last long."
<P>If the reaction of the audience at Lorrie's is any indication, Redeemed will do just fine. In the time it takes them to disassemble their sound system, they get booked for another show by an audience member. 
<P>There is young blood coming up in Knoxville's black gospel pool as well. The four young musicians who accompany the choir at Peace and Goodwill have recently formed a group called the New Travelers. Jordan says she has high hopes for them and that they've been well-received. Churches in town routinely feature their children's choirs and allow the young singers as much solo time as they want. Surely some of those singers will get the spirit, just as Sister Beverly Moore did, and keep that train a-rolling.

<H3>Take Your Burdens To The Lord</H3>

<P>Gospel music was something of a gift from the church to the world. Now gospel appears to be giving back to the church. Its broad reach and mass appeal competes even with television ministries and extends the reach of the minister far beyond the walls of the church. It does sound different from the gospel Knoxvillians heard here 20 years ago--but you can hear gospel music, in one of its many manifestations, almost every night of the week in Knoxville. Much of it is very good. What's not wonderful to listen to often still rewards in its spirituality.
<P>Some of the elders in the Southern church were offended by Dorsey's audacity, bringing the sounds of jazz and blues--the Devil's music--into the church. Now, Dorsey's influence is pervasive, and his music is the root music of the church. Today, some elders who are accustomed to the roiling, syncopated energy he introduced are appalled by the introduction of today's street music sounds into the church. 
<P>Bishop Gary E. Wright, pastor of Knoxville's Biblical House of God and presiding bishop of the 20 other Houses of God throughout the east, listens to Thompson's radio program. Wright has heard young singers, rooted in soul and even hip-hop, gaining on the old-time jubilee quartets and choirs. Thompson gets an endless string of requests for music by Kirk Franklin, a contemporary gospel singer whose sound might easily be confused for Keith Sweat or Luther Vandross if not for his silky, obliquely spiritual lyrics. Music is one of the cornerstones of the worship service at Biblical House of God, and Wright, who's been preaching for 20 years and has a head of close-cropped gray hair, is among Franklin's fans.
<P>"There is a diversity of music in the black community," Wright explains, "and at this church, we try to appeal to all the different tastes. In order to be effective in the ministry, we try to have some of all of it. 
<P>"Over the last 10 or 15 years, gospel music has come to be seen in a new light. Sales have taken off, and it's being marketed in new ways. I think that's good. I try to learn, from what's happening in the music, things we can do to keep the church alive."
<P>Amen.

Patent Pending</H1>
<P><STRONG>From basement workshops to corporate labs, area inventors strive to discover "the big idea"</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>At 10 a.m. on the third Saturday of every month, Oak Ridge's Commerce Park becomes a hub of intestinal and intellectual fortitude, a locus of pioneering pith and pluck. For it's on those weekends that the industrial park plays host to the Tennessee Inventors Association, a group whose membership includes would-be Edisons and intrepid technological pathfinders from all across the state.
<P>On this particular Saturday, guest speaker and small business counselor David Beall is holding forth on the vagaries of entrepreneurial endeavor, expounding on the fickle alchemy that transforms inventions into sellable commodities. In short, he's doing his damnedest to scare this assemblage of backroom tinkersmiths, ivory tower eggheads, and corporate laboratory captives into checking the odds before betting the farm. 
<P>The prospects for most new product ideas are "slim and none," Beall warns, "and Slim just left town." An ex-military man and former Boeing flight tester, he doesn't mince any words when he tells the group that only one of every 100 inventors recoups the cost of his patent.
<P>"When you run your own show, the last check you write is your own," he says. "Sometimes, you don't write that last check."
<P>But scare tactics notwithstanding, they're still here, undaunted, some 30 TIA members holed up in a stuffy conference room on an unseasonably warm October morn. And it may be with good reason that they've come; over the last 14 years, TIA has counted among its constituents (and its guest speakers) several inventors who beat the odds, including a computer touch screen pioneer, a husband and wife team who crafted a special toilet seat for tiny tushes ("Little Bottoms"), and a Texas Instruments engineer who helped design the company's "Speak 'n' Spell" learning toy.
<P>And according to TIA co-founder Martin Skinner, East Tennessee continues to be a veritable petri dish of technological creativity, a great place to observe the species (Inventus Fanaticus) in its natural habitat. "Because of the technology that exists here, it is a rather active area for inventions, with lots of small companies generating new ideas."

<H3>"Nuts" with Bolts</H3>

Mad scientist and forgetful professor stereotypes aside, do inventors share any unifying characteristics? "What they all have in common is that they are all people of considerable persistence," says Skinner, "with the drive to spend hours and hours in the shop looking for solutions."
<P>Skinner adds, somewhat enigmatically, that "there's one other trait they all share, but I can never quite put my finger on what it is."
<P>Offers another TIA member, "By and large, inventors tend to be a little bit nuts," perhaps putting his finger on what Skinner is too polite to say.
<P>But in this day of esoteric government research and colossal corporate R&amp;D, the notion of wide-eyed, wire-coifed zealots fashioning heretofore unthinkable contraptions in a smoke-filled basement lair ("Eureka!") seems almost quaint--a daguerrotyped relic from the era of Edison and Bell. And while Skinner says independent creators are still responsible for more new ideas than their big business counterparts, he adds that most of the new products that actually hit the market were first sketched out on the corporate drawing board.
<P>"If you look at the extremes of what constitutes an inventor, you have large companies on one hand, with teams of engineers working to solve a problem or improve on a device already in existence," says Bill Gibson, an Oak Ridge business man with several "touch screen" patents to his credit. "At the other end, you have the lone inventor who comes up with some idea, which after the fact he convinces himself is the greatest thing since sliced bread."
<P>Only about one out of 20,000 lone inventors will shepherd their creation through the patent stage and onto the market, says one local patent attorney. "You're usually talking about people with very little marketing savvy," he says. "They're more enamored with the cleverness of the concept than whether it's viable."
<P>Enamored of the concept, and perhaps immune to certain financial realities: "You have to have some money in order to move your idea down the road." says TIA president John Dabbs. "Your funds, your family's funds, and your friends' funds--that's where you start in this game."

<H3>The Galkie Company--Kitty Concepts</H3>

Few people are more keenly aware of the daunting economics of the inventor's milieu than TIA member John Galkiewicz. Upon losing his job as a corporate pilot, the Harrogate resident sought out new horizons in 1983, staking his livelihood on a toy he made for a family pet.
<P>His invention--the Kitty Tease--represents neither a conceptual revolution nor a technological marvel. It's a fiberglass rod with a wooden handle that dangles a dacron string with a scrap of denim bait tied on the end--much like a fishing pole, sans worms and reel. "It's one of those things you look at and say, 'I should have thought of that years ago,'" Galkiewicz laughs. 
<P>The initial response to Galkiewicz's "Tease" was heartening; after a relatively modest materials investment, he sold 400 toys at a cat show in Houston, 350 in Birmingham, and more than 500 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Soon he was wholesaling Kitty Tease to pet store owners and pitching directly to cat enthusiasts via mail order ads in Cat Fancy Magazine.
<P>But although the Galkie Company has pushed enough products over the last 13 years to justify construction of a two story workshop/office in back of Galkiewicz's home, the inventor says the enterprise has often been an exercise in frustration, a lesson in the law of diminishing returns.
<P>"There's a big company putting out a copycat product right now, and it's really cutting into the business," says Galkiewicz. "I've got more than $20,000 in domestic and overseas patents, and all it gives me is a license to sue."
<P>Galkiewicz has rolled with the punches, taking the basic materials from the Kitty Tease and evolving two other products--a joggers' foil he calls the "K-9 Swat Rod" (for discouraging overzealous dogs), and a special blackboard pointer that was used by Judge Lance Ito in the O.J. Simpson trial.
<P>"The patent office says it's too obvious and can't be patented," he says peevishly, explaining in minute detail why the lightweight fiberglass body, the almost shadow-free tapered point, and the black and fluorescent yellow-on-red color schemes set his winsome wands apart from other, more pedestrian pointing sticks.
<P>So why does Galkiewicz persevere, suffering the slings and arrows of persnickety patent officials, not to mention the patent-rending shark attacks of carnivorous corporate lawyers?
<P>"Once you start inventing things, you can't stop," he says, holding up a Dr. Seuss-like implement used to stretch and cut dacron lines for the Kitty Tease. It's only one of several homemade gizmos Galkiewicz has concocted to run his one-man assembly line more efficiently, many of which are even more fascinating than the products they help forge.
<P>"It's natural for me to try to defeat problems," he says. "If there's an easier or better way to do something, I'm going to figure it out."

<H3>Preston Leingang's Very Special Operations</H3>

In some ways, however, Galkiewicz's modest success flouts the rules of product innovation. "It's important to invent something in an area where you have some expertise," says Skinner. "That way you know where it fits into the market, and you already have some business contacts."
<P>It's a lesson Maryville's Preston Leingang learned well. A former communications specialist for the US Army, Leingang marshalled all the resources and know-how accumulated during his 20-odd years of military experience and founded Turtle Mountain Communications Inc., a firm that designs hi-tech information systems for covert police and government operations.
<P>Today, Leingang's client base includes many of the same players he served during his military career--U.S. Army Special Operations, the Joint Special Operations Command, even Israel and the United Arab Emirates. And his employees, from his crack team of former armed forces technicians to his son and production manager Corky, are fellow veterans, almost to a man.
<P>"I won't have an engineer on my crew. We've got some of the best Army and Navy techs you can find," Leingang huffs. Graying and 50-ish, he's thick-set, gruff, mustachioed, and tottering around on short legs that are often lost in the imposing shadow cast by his bear-like upper frame.
<P>If some inventors fashion new products out of whole cloth, Leingang is the inventor as synthesist and facilitator. He and his technicians take standard equipment--Motorola phones, Casio cameras, Samsonite luggage--and create elaborate portable communications systems with self-contained power supplies.
<P>"In my line of work, it's all been invented," Leingang says. "All that's left is enhancing and honing what's already there. I call it follow-along technology. Somebody has an idea, and somebody else comes along and makes it better."
<P>The results of Leingang's hi-tech couplings would do Ian Fleming proud. Surrounded by stacks of black attaches in Turtle Mountain's workshop/storeroom, he shows off a briefcase equipped with a phone, a computer link, a fax unit, and a little black control box designed in-house. The bearer can engage in confidential communications from almost any location, says Leingang, noting that his particular systems are carried by the president, as well as more than 400 other statesmen across Europe and the US.
<P>For a client who wanted to tote his cloak-and-dagger workstation into remote parts of Bosnia, Leingang and company outfitted a backpack with a printer, a scanner, a camera, and a laptop computer--all powered by a satellite receptor in the top of the pack. 
<P>"You'd be surprised at the ideas you can get off Mission Impossible reruns and Bond movies," Leingang chortles. "All those things Q used to show James--we can do them now."
<P>Unlike most product innovators, Leingang isn't worried about obtaining patents for any of his systems, nor even for any of the gadgets he and his men have engineered while cobbling all those do-it-yourself spy-packs and portable surveillance kits together.
<P>He believes the strength of his company lies first with the ingenious simplicity of its creations--he's got systems strung together with Radio Shack components that larger companies told him couldn't be done--and with the dogged sense of pragmatism that marks his approach.
<P>"This is a patentable item," he says, holding up an interconnected series of wires, circuits, and plugs--a device that allows two-way radios to receive computer input. "But most of them are so simple you could look at them, change one circuit, and get around the patent.
<P>"Remember, I'm from North Dakota," he adds, thumping a heavy leather boot with a big finger. "We use 'cowboy logic' for everything; there's a simple solution to any problem."

<H3>Omniview's Singular Vision</H3>

If you accept that the spectrum of inventors begins with quixotic basement daydreamers and ends with tediously goal-oriented corporate R&amp;D, then Lee Martin probably falls somewhere near the middle of the continuum. When the ORNL expatriate and his then-partner Paul Satterlee founded Telerobotics in 1986, they had a plan of action, but lacked a clear-cut goal.
<P>What began as an attempt to integrate robots and imaging systems for work in remote environments became something else entirely when Martin and two other scientists patented the PhotoBubble. And as the 'Bubble's commercial potential became increasingly evident, the company phased out its forays into robotics and changed its name to Omniview.
<P>It's impossible to appreciate a PhotoBubble without seeing it in person, but imagine standing in the geometric center of a room and taking a picture with a wide-angle fish-eye lens, then making a 180-degree turn and snapping a second shot. Individually, the two photos provide warped hemispherical images--distended in the center, curved and thin on the perimeter. Together, they comprise a complete view of the room, albeit fractal and distorted.
<P>But the PhotoBubble system combines the images and allows them to be viewed on a computer screen as a unified, undistorted whole--as if the viewer were operating a remote control surveillance camera located in the middle of the room. (If you're curious, check out http://www.omniview.com/ for an on-line demonstration.)
<P>"We think it's kind of cool," Martin says with a broad, boyish grin. "It's cyber-photography. We're taking something crooked and straightening it out on computer. You control where you want your eye to travel on the screen, and everything will keep its perspective. You can even look close-up at any part of the room."
<P>Martin's evolution from scientific explorer to inventor to entrepreneur and CEO has been, for the most part, a happy one; Omniview now has almost 30 employees (up from 2 in '86) and a sizable office space off Oak Ridge Highway (a big step up from Martin's basement.) PhotoBubbles are currently used on the worldwide web to advertise cars and apartments, and Omniview recently released the first in a series of educational CD-ROMs, a tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house, Fallingwater.
<P>A scientist by trade, with negligible prior business experience, Martin says he could have licensed the PhotoBubble to a larger company, thereby side-stepping all of the demoralizing pratfalls of marketing and production. "I might not have so many of these gray hairs," says the 40-year-old inventor, running his fingers through a ream of silvery locks. "I have a whole new appreciation for marketing now."
<P>But just as Martin's prematurely graying hair belies the countenance of a younger man, so his genial manner and serene smile affably veil the steel and resolution that lie at his core. Inventors are in many respects like fathers, and this proud papa has an abiding faith in the strength and promise of his child.
<P>"We're going in with the attitude that we've got something pretty special," he says. "It's more risk and more responsibility this way, but with the right partnerships, I think this will go a long way."

<H3>Fi-Shock's Flying Discs--Glowing Reviews</H3>

As a product development specialist for Fi-Shock Inc., Brett Burdick is cushioned from many of the wallet-skewering thrusts and ego-deflating hammer-blows that self-employed innovators such as Martin and Galkiewicz often endure. Once an avionics engineer for Honeywell in Phoenix, Arizona, Burdick was hired by Fi-Shock in early '95 to help the rapidly growing Knoxville company explore new commercial horizons beyond its successful line of electric fences.
<P>Burdick's UF-Glo, a throwing disc (not to say Frisbee) festooned with tiny lights, represents the biggest product roll-out in the company's 26-year history. And while Fi-Shock's vast production rooms spit out nearly 1,500 discs per day, company suits are negotiating product promotions with the likes of ESPN, Dennis Rodman, and MTV.
<P>But even with the considerable financial resources of a large company behind him, Burdick had difficulty finding a foothold in the rugged terrain of commercial R&amp;D. "This was all brand new to me," he says. "It's one thing to design a product and another to design one you can feasibly manufacture."
<P>Fi-Shock CEO Tom Boyd first conceived the UF-Glo when an acquaintance showed him a crude product model--a Frisbee soldered with Christmas lights--in early '96. Boyd was reportedly smitten by the idea and handed it off to his brand new engineer.
<P>Burdick's first step was to conduct a patent search at the UT law library. He discovered several patents on what were essentially lighted Frisbees, but most of them had expired, and none of the discs had proven either commercially or aerodynamically feasible. "My neighbor even had one," he says. "Poor quality, and it didn't fly well."
<P>Convinced he could make a better mousetrap (or at least a brighter flying disc), Burdick canvassed other companies in search of the cheapest component parts, took a crash course in the finer points of making plastic molds, and learned to use the three-dimensional-image software that eventually laid out the first UF-Glo prototype. "There were lots of changes and lots of homework before we ever hit the manufacturing stage."
<P>Unlike its predecessors, Burdick's model is buoyant (the light-emitting diodes that line its outer edge are each smaller than a pea), aerodynamic (the battery is housed in a rectangular case in the center of the disc's underside), and, retailing at about $10 per disc, reasonably cheap.
<P>"The feedback has been terrific," Burdick enthuses. "At trade shows, the standard response has been 'That's cool!'"
<P>Having arrived at his current station (as essentially an in-house inventor) by a serendipitous career turn, Burdick may not yet approach his labors with the same paternal ardor as those inventors who came by their lot more organically. But he's getting there.
<P>An art enthusiast in high school and college, Burdick describes his job as "the perfect combination of art and engineering." And even though his first patent at Fi-Shock--on a cooler with a built-in insulated drink dispenser--fell by the wayside when manufacturing proved too costly, his enthusiasm for the project hasn't waned.
<P>"There's nothing like this one at all," he gushes. "You always have people telling you 'That's not a good concept.' They think it's kind of silly. Above all else, you have to be committed to your idea."

<H3>Remotec: Lots of 'bots</H3>

In the world of inventors and inventions, Knoxville patent attorney Bob Pitts believes even solo R&amp;D specialists such as Burdick may be more the exception than the rule. Pitts estimates that 70 percent of his clients are corporate entities, most of them with teams of scientists who work simply to refine existing products. It's a phenomenon that blurs the lines between invention and modification, between conceptualist and technician, between trouble-shooter and pioneer.
<P>"Most inventions are modifications of things that have gone before, as opposed to completely new ideas," Pitts says. "We're talking about incremental changes rather than brand new concepts."
<P>Oak Ridge's Remotec offers a case in point. Founded in 1980 by a group of ORNL engineers, the company (now a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman) purchased the ANDROS robotic line from its Belgian creators in 1986. What it got was a blueprint and an embryonic prototype. What the company has now is seven different remote control robots, each with a variety of hi-tech accessories and a full family of robotic equipment.
<P>"The original electronics systems had to be completely redesigned," says business development manager Mark Tcherneschoff. "We made them easier to use, more durable, stronger, and generally increased their capabilities."
<P>Remotec's 'bots all fit the same basic mold; rectangular bodies set on either wheels or treads, and equipped with a retractable mechanical arm and a camera (so its distant human operator can "see.") But like new cars, each one comes with its own unique set of standard and optional features. The ANDROS 6x6, for instance, one of the larger models at roughly the size of a lawn tractor, has an accessory plate that will operate all manner of tools and sensors, including drills, saws, or x-ray equipment.
<P>A smaller model, the ANDROS Mark VI, has retractable rotors on either end of its wheel base, allowing it to shrink to sub-compact size for increased zip and maneuverability, or extend its tread and ascend a flight of stairs. Tcherneschoff demonstrates both functions, and while the Mark VI is a bit cumbersome on the Remotec stairwell, painstakingly thunking and clunking up each step like a vacuum cleaner being dragged by a child, the tasks it will ultimately perform won't require much grace. And with its rotors raised and its wheels on level ground, it darts, stops, and turns with startling agility, a Kevlar canine frolicking at its master's feet.
<P>Remotec's clanking automatons have been purchased by more than 400 police agencies and nuclear facilities across the world; besides handling hazardous waste, ANDROS machines are used for ordinance disposal, surveillance, and hostage interface. The company holds several patents on its modifications, and its office walls are adorned with a host of awards from police and military organizations recognizing it as an industry leader.
<P>But ask Tcherneschoff which of Remotec's 100 or so employees is most responsible for cutting these bold swaths through the field of robotics, and you'll get a decidedly nonspecific answer.
<P>"There are individual names on each of our patents, but they're really attributable to the company," he says. "Everything we do is really a team effort."
<P>Which is all well and good, because Remotec's robots are hardly the sterile progeny of homogenous corporate paternalism; freakish, fascinating, and futuristic, they're loads of fun to play with and a flat-out hoot to watch.
<P>Nonetheless, the notion of the lone inventor, the basement pioneer, the Frankensteinian eccentric (all blood-shot eyes and frazzled hair) acting out his God complex on a makeshift laboratory stage, holds a certain romance that seems lost in the translation to collectivist creativity. Have marketing monoliths finally robbed the lone inventor of his vision and his voice? Is boardroom groupthink really all that's left of the legacy of Marconi, Franklin, and Bell?
<P>Probably not, says Pitts, because although technological parameters may undulate and change, the need for maverick thinkers and seat-of-the-pants innovators will never disappear. "There are still pioneer patents that come along and completely change the way we do business or the way we manufacture," he says. "There will always be those people who come along, look at a problem, and take a whole new approach."

Food Drive</H1>
<P><STRONG>Can Knoxville's anti-hunger forces cope with rising need?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Katie Allison Granju</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P><STRONG>Knoxvillians love food. From our football season tailgates, groaning under the weight of homemade fried chicken and barbecue, to our late night visits to the Old City for cappuccino and cheesecake, many Knoxville residents choose to mark all the important moments of life with a good meal. In the past, urban legend had it that Knoxville was home to more restaurants per capita than any other city in the United States. While this is probably not true, there's no denying our love affair with eating. However, for more members of the Knoxville community than one would perhaps like to imagine, food is neither a reason to celebrate nor a source of pleasure. Instead, it is a struggle, a daily contest between an empty belly and an empty wallet.</STRONG>
<P>A visit to a local grocery store with Linda, a 46-year-old Food Stamp recipient and mother of two, illustrates the face of hunger in Knoxville, circa 1996. Linda, with her petite frame and brunette bob, looks like any other working mother, patrolling the aisles for a double coupon special on her family's favorite treats. Actually, she is earnestly attempting to stay within her food budget of under $45 weekly for a family of three. Linda became a widow when her elder son was only seven. Her husband, who had been a self-employed carpenter, died of cancer, leaving the family with no means of support. 
<P>Since then, Linda, who attended the University of Tennessee for one year before her marriage, has worked part-time at a variety of retail and secretarial jobs. She claims that going to full-time status wouldn't improve her family's financial situation because she would have to pay for after-school care for her younger son, age 13. Cracking a slightly embarrassed grin, Linda admits that she usually shops for groceries late at night, after her two teenagers are asleep, so that she won't have to produce her food stamps for payment in a checkout line full of impatient Knoxville yuppies. Today, however, she is shopping on a weekday afternoon. She carefully crosses items off her list as she fills her cart with beans, rice, and pasta.
<P>"I am so sick of hearing these stories about being behind someone at the grocery store who was paying for sirloin steak and caviar with their food stamps," she says in frustration. "First of all, just because I don't have a lot of money doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able to fix whatever food I want for my kids. And anyway, no one in my situation can afford to buy those things. I can't even buy snacks for my boys. They really want snacks for when they get home from school, and I always have to tell them to wait for dinner. I would love to just buy them a big bag of chips and some dip."
<P>As Linda heads out the door of the grocery store after making her purchases, she passes a collection barrel for donations to a local food bank. She drops a can of green beans into the container, noting that she herself has had to turn to emergency food banks on more than one occasion over the years.
<P>The Appalachian region has always had a justifiable reputation for problems of intense poverty and hunger. Who can forget those famous photographs of politicians campaigning in West Virginia and Kentucky in the 1960s, only to be confronted by starving children and their hollow-eyed, desperate parents. Today, it is commonly believed that government programs such as food stamps, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), in combination with charitable giving, have successfully eliminated most hunger in Appalachia and elsewhere. In fact, Knoxville's hungry never really went away. They are still among us, silently coexisting alongside the gourmet markets and golf and country clubs. And experts say that their numbers are increasing. 
<P>Second Harvest, the area's largest resource for collection and distribution of donated food, has seen the demand for its services rise in the past decade. The agency continues to strive to meet the need. In 1982, Second Harvest distributed approximately 120,000 pounds of food in Knox County. By last year, that number had risen to over one million pounds. Elaine Machiela, executive director of Second Harvest, says that although she can't quantify the number of hungry Knoxvillians, she is confident that there are more of them all the time. 
<P>"Although we do not have a way to accurately measure the number of families in this area who are struggling to get enough to eat, it is clear to all of us who work in this field that there is a serious hunger problem in East Tennessee," says Machiela.
<P>Gail Harris, the director of the Office of Community Services at Knoxville's Community Action Committee (CAC), agrees. Harris says that the nature of hunger in Knoxville has changed in the last generation. 
<P>"We may no longer have starving children with swollen bellies in our communities, but make no mistake about it, we do have hungry children. It's hard to define hunger in Knox County. The fact that the demand for food relief keeps going up is a clear indicator that we have a hunger problem."
<P>Harris' office provides staff support for Emergency Food Helpers, a coalition of over 60 pantries, churches, and kitchens that provide free food to hungry Knoxvillians of almost every description. In 1995, Emergency Food Helper member groups answered 82,374 requests for food, the highest number since records were first kept in 1980. This includes Knoxville's four homeless shelters, which distribute over 23,000 meals per month, and the Love Kitchen, which provides 4,000 meals per month. 
<P>According to Machiela and Harris, being a hungry American today usually means under-nutrition or malnutrition rather than actual starvation. A family trying to stretch a food dollar, or relying on donated food, is likely to be limited in its selection of nutritious meals. Those suffering from hunger tend to choose the most filling food items, as opposed to the most healthful. This can lead to numerous medical problems, many of which are being seen at the Knox County Health Department. 
<P>Carolyn Perry-Burst, nutrition services manager for the Health Department, says that diabetes, hypertension, and, ironically, obesity, are only a few of the hunger-related illnesses that she sees in her work. 
<P>"People around here see an overweight poor person and assume that they have plenty to eat. In fact, what obesity often tells us is that this person has no choice but to eat foods the rest of us wouldn't want," suggests Perry-Burst. "Poverty severely limits not only the amount of food but the quality as well."
<P>The federal government currently defines poverty as an income below approximately $14,000 for a family of four. According to The Tennessee Hunger Coalition's newly-released book Bread and Justice, the maximum amount for which a Tennessee family can qualify in AFDC and Food Stamps together totals less than 40 percent of what a family needs to live at the poverty level. Although the Knoxville area's unemployment rate of under 5 percent is generally lower than both the state and national averages, more than 45,000 Knox County residents, over 14 percent of the population, still live below the poverty line. 
<P>In the central sector of Knoxville, the poverty rate stands at a staggering 38.3 percent. Left uncounted are the thousands of other Knoxville families who live above the official poverty limit but who are still poor by anyone else's standards. Chronic poverty is the clearest risk factor for hunger, according to experts, leading to the inescapable conclusion that, after paying for housing, utilities, clothing, and medical care, many Knoxvillians are struggling to afford sufficient food. 
<P>"Knoxville's unemployment rate is low," agrees Bob Becker of the Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network, a community labor coalition. "However, it doesn't tell the whole story. Anyone with a part-time, temporary, low wage, or no-benefits job is counted as employed for purposes of the statistics. These jobs can't begin to really support a family, and someone with a job like this is just wiped out if they have even one hospital stay. The poverty rate is probably a more accurate indicator of what is happening within our community."
<P>Jim Wright holds forth on his view of the economic inequities leading to hunger as he pilots his battered minivan to the next Hospitality Food Pantry on his daily route. 
<P>"Hunger is a simple matter of economic justice. We just don't have enough jobs here in Knoxville that will support a family. I believe that food is a right that everyone should have. No one in this country should have to go to a food pantry and beg for food."
<P>Wright, middle-aged and mild-mannered, looks like a salesman or small business owner, which is exactly what he was before he gave it all up to become a fierce advocate for Knoxville's hungry citizens. Today, working through the Episcopal Church of the Ascension on Northshore Drive, Wright directs the four locations of Hospitality Emergency Food Pantries. These Pantries distribute food packages to over 5,000 Knoxville families each month. The Hospitality Pantries are somewhat different in philosophy from Knoxville's other primary emergency food source, FISH Emergency Food Pantries. For one thing, any hungry person can use a Hospitality Pantry as often as he or she needs it, no questions asked.
<P>"We don't try to decide for the poor when they are hungry," says Wright.
<P>This is in contrast to some of the other food pantries in Knox County, many run by churches, which have stricter guidelines about who can receive the free bags of food and how often. Harris notes that Wright's method of providing relief has been controversial with the rest of the Knoxville hunger relief community.
<P>"There has been some conflict between the Hospitality Pantries' approach and those who believe we should act as a better steward of scarce resources. However, there is room in this work for all types of viewpoints. We shouldn't allow this to be a polarizing conflict," says Harris firmly.
<P>Wright explains that his views about hunger relief were crystallized when he first began working with Knoxville hunger assistance programs and discovered that some maintained an alert list of needy people who were blackballed from obtaining food. 
<P>"If a poor person had beer cans in their yard or simply asked once too often for food, they might be turned away."
<P>According to Wright and others, these discriminatory practices have generally been eliminated from Knoxville's emergency food pantries. However, some of the underlying attitudes regarding who actually deserves to be fed remain. Those on the front lines of this area's fight against hunger are frustrated by the public's lack of understanding for the causes of hunger. The media emphasis on so-called welfare queens and Food Stamp fraud have left many in Knoxville with the belief that true hunger does not actually exist here and that those in need are just not trying hard enough. 
<P>Perry-Burst says that Knoxvillians, known for their generosity and volunteer spirit, are simply unaware of the reality of hunger.
<P>"I have seen people who are doing everything that they can do and they are still running out of food at the end of the month," says Perry-Burst. "There are some in our community who have difficulty believing that people here are going without food because they themselves have never been hungry before."  
<P>David Duncan, local television celebrity chef and caterer to Knoxville's elite, is currently serving a term as chairman of Knoxville's Food Policy Council, a community group appointed by Mayor Victor Ashe to address community food and hunger issues. He says that he has gained a fresh understanding for the nutritional problems faced by low-income Knoxvillians through his tenure with the Council. Still, he says that he and most of his clients, while sensitive to the plight of the hungry, don't feel that their own mode of conspicuous consumption has any negative effect on the less fortunate.
<P>"Food is my profession. I have to look at it as simply a commodity. When I do a party, the table has to look bountiful when people are paying those kinds of prices for it to look that way. I worry about the hungry, but I don't let it stop me from enjoying a $100 dinner. I don't think that other people should either."
<P>Duncan says that he and other successful caterers attempt to recycle their leftovers from events by delivering them to shelters and other organizations serving the needy. Duncan also believes that Knoxville's food industry helps to combat hunger by providing jobs and generating economic growth.  
<P>"I see that $50 meal that one of my clients may serve to their guests as good for the local economy. The expensive meal someone eats tonight may help to put better food on someone else's table on down the line."
<P>At the Hospitality Emergency Food Pantry, located in Knoxville's Magnolia Avenue United Methodist Church, a table is laid out with a motley smorgasbord of foods from which Pantry clients may choose. There are bins of vegetables which look as if they've seen better days, slightly misshapen loaves of bread, and leftover boxed birthday cakes from a grocery store bakery. This last item catches the eye of a 4-year-old boy as he drags his mother, who has come for a bag of food, toward the table.
<P>"Look Mama," he squeals happily. "There's that cake I done baked for you and Daddy!"
<P>She smiles at his delight and lets him add the cake to their own brown paper bag. Then, after picking out a few more items, she leads him out the door, mumbling a shy thank you to those outside. A truck full of donated food is being unloaded on the front steps by an assortment of volunteers, young and old, male and female, well-dressed, and obviously homeless. On this day, the steady stream of people entering the Pantry to sign up for a small bag of free groceries reflects the diversity and depth of Knoxville's hunger problem.
<P>Gary and Mick, grimy and tattered friends who live together at a permanent campsite down by the river, come to this food pantry frequently to pick up a bag of whatever items are available. Today they are happy with the bread and cookies they see on the table. The men, both in their late thirties, say that they refuse to take government assistance or go to one of the homeless shelters.
<P>"I'm not going to go on the government dole when I know I can work," says Gary emphatically. "I want to get a job in construction, but I don't have a car or money for the bus, so I can't get to the job sites."
<P>Mick, slurring his words, echoes his companion's sentiments.
<P>"I hate them homeless shelters. Even when I'm really hungry, I ain't goin' there. We get by fine with what food we find and some fishin' and what we get here. I worry more about some of them little kids that's camping out with their parents around town."
<P>Volunteers at the Magnolia Avenue Hospitality Pantry say that many homeless Knoxvillians utilize their services. A number of these guests are intoxicated when they arrive at the Pantry. Still, the hunger activists try not to judge. 
<P>"People shouldn't try to tell someone they aren't hungry just because they're drunk," says one.
<P>Amber, another visitor to the Pantry, is a 20-year-old woman in a UT sweatshirt with long blonde hair. She approaches the table and begins gingerly adding food to her own grocery sack. Except for her obviously pregnant form, Amber looks like somebody's Tri Delta sorority sister. In fact, she is a nursing student at Pellissippi State with a 2-year-old, a baby due in three days, and an empty cupboard at her apartment. This is her first visit to an emergency food pantry. She says that the decision to come here was not an easy one. 
<P>"I waited until I absolutely had to come," she says. "I fed my son some bread and peanut butter for his supper last night. We were both really hungry this morning and I knew I had to get some food somewhere. I told him that I needed to go to the grocery store and left him with my neighbor. I told my neighbor that I was going to Kroger."
<P>Amber says that before she became too pregnant to maneuver between the tables, she was a waitress at a popular West Knoxville restaurant. The $800 per month that she earned at her job, plus the $120 monthly she received in food stamps, allowed her to just get by. Now, without her income from her job, she and her toddler are living on the same amount in food stamps, plus the $95 monthly she receives as her AFDC welfare check. 
<P>"I don't even have money for gas in my car, so I haven't driven anywhere in weeks. I used to think that people on welfare and Food Stamps were getting away with murder, just sitting around collecting money. Now I wonder how some people with bigger families survive. As it is, I am trying to eat less so my son can have more."
<P>Betsy Haughton, associate professor in the Department of Nutrition at the University of Tennessee and longtime member of the Knoxville Food Policy Council, explains that food is often the first place a family will cut back to try to make it to the next paycheck. 
<P>"The landlord will expect the rent, so people will try to get by with less food. Parents will skip meals so that their children can eat. Eventually, many hungry families have to cut back on the children's meals as well," says Haughton.
<P>The amount that Amber receives in food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children is determined by the state's calculation of need based on income, family configuration, and family size. Many of the working poor don't qualify for any government assistance. The state's new Families First welfare reform mandate will further restrict who is eligible to receive benefits and for how long. For those who are impoverished enough to receive them, food stamp benefits in Tennessee currently average out to $.77 per person, per meal. 
<P>Wright says that he recently attempted to eat on this amount for one month. He points out that, unlike many families with no personal transportation, he was able to use his own car to shop around for the best deals on food. Despite this advantage, trying to feed himself on under $3 a day proved nearly impossible. 
<P>Many Knox County families who are struggling to feed their children rely on the school system for help. The amount a family pays for school-based meals is determined with a sliding fee scale, and children whose family incomes qualify receive a hot, nutritious breakfast and lunch each schoolday for free or at a reduced price. Phil Clear, director of food services for Knox County schools says that the demand for school-based food assistance is sharply up this year. Currently, approximately one-third of Knox County public school students eat their daily meals through the program. The percentage of each student body receiving meal assistance varies widely from school to school, with approximately 95 percent qualifying for meals at Vine Middle School and only about 30 percent qualifying at Holston Middle school. 
<P>"We have received 1,500 to 2,000 more applications for the program this year than last year. We have more applications in 1996 than in the last six or seven years," says Clear. "None of us can figure out why we have had this kind of increase."
<P>The largest participation day for free and reduced-price school meals in Knox County is on Mondays, when Clear says many children may be returning to class after a hungry weekend at home. Knox County Schools also contract their services to local Boys' and Girls' Clubs for preparation of free evening meals.
<P>"This means that we have many children who are eating with us three meals a day, five days a week," Clear points out.
<P>A logical question to ask is what these children are eating when school is not in session. According to Perry-Burst, many of them are probably not getting enough to eat during the summer months or during the holidays. Knox County offers a federally funded summer feeding program in which eligible children can enroll to receive nutritious meals at community centers. However, compared to the 16,000 children who receive free or reduced-price meals during the school year, only 3,000 enjoyed meals last summer. Perry-Burst points to funding deficiencies, transportation issues, and a lack of knowledge concerning the availability of the program as reasons for the non-participation of Knox County's other 13,000 eligible children. 
<P>"Children who do not receive enough nutrients are affected for the rest of their lives," says Wright. "Their emotional and physical growth are compromised, and the scars never leave them."
<P>Knoxville's elderly and homebound residents are another population at risk for malnutrition and hunger. The Senior Nutrition Program includes serving 250 meals per day at various locations within the community and the delivery of 520 Mobile Meals or "Meals on Wheels" each weekday to hungry, homebound senior citizens. Some 240 elderly Knoxvillians are now on a waiting list to receive Mobile Meals. Although the $4 per day it costs to prepare and deliver meals to each Mobile Meals participant is a relative bargain, and Meals on Wheels recipients themselves bear a portion of the cost, the federal, local, and private funds used to bankroll the program won't stretch any farther.
<P>"We really need to make elimination of the waiting list for Mobile Meals a community goal. This is one population of malnourished Knoxvillians who we can really put our fingers on and help," says Perry-Burst. "Our Mobile Meals elderly citizens are some of the most needy and under-nourished people in our community."
<P>As the winter holidays approach, the startling contrasts between the two communities within our own seem to become more visible. On a clear and cold East Tennessee evening, a glittering society gala lights up the night while nearby, a homeless shelter fills to capacity with citizens seeking a warm meal and an escape from the chill. In one neighborhood, a young mother serves a filling meal to her family in the warmth of their brand new Southern Living-styled home, while across town, another explains to her children that there isn't enough food in the house for an after school snack. The dilemma is clear. Unfortunately, the solutions are not. 
<P>The kind and unselfish spirit of giving for which Knoxville is celebrated plays an important role in battling hunger. There are scores of local organizations which can benefit from a gift of time, food, or money as they work to feed Knoxville's hungry. According to hunger activists, however, as crucial as charitable giving is, it really only provides a band-aid approach to the larger problems causing hunger in the first place. 
<P>"The poor have no one in government representing their interests," theorizes Wright. "Until they do, I am afraid that change will come slowly."

<P><STRONG>Can UT halt its academic erosion as it experiences an ongoing budget squeeze?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jack Neely with contributions from Joe Sullivan</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Earlier this year, well-publicized layoffs in UTK's computer-support staff resulted in slowing down some of the university's support systems. Not surprisingly, it's easy to find stories of computers down and unrepaired for weeks. 
<P>But those layoff casualty figures are only the most publicly visible tip of a budget iceberg at the University of Tennessee's Knoxville campus--which, some are concerned, is already endangering the university's ability to serve its students and has the potential to wreck UTK's hard-earned academic reputation. 
<P>Other vivid stories have been making the rounds, some of them incredible, all of them true: of canceled subscriptions to important academic journals, of outmoded and decrepit lab equipment, of a copy machine removed from a business college office unable to maintain the lease, of faculty members disallowed to make long-distance calls, of canceled trips to important academic conferences, of three-legged desks and absent overhead projectors, of positions unfilled, of promises unkept. 
<P>For the next year or two, at least, it's likely to get only worse.
<P>Perhaps the biggest losses to the university are some 40 faculty positions left unfilled, decreasing the university's faculty body by about 3 percent. 
<P>Those 40 were not necessarily the 40 most expendable. Attrition is without question the most humane way to downsize. It's also, arguably, the most threatening to the school's academics. 
<P>Through attrition, UTK's Geology Department has lost specialists in sedimentology--oil detection--one of geology's most practical applications. Department head Harold McSween says UTK's geology curriculum is "greatly weakened" by the loss. "Our inability to train students for the oil industry is real serious to us," he says. 
<P>Chemistry was once proud of its nationally prominent chemical analysis program. However, in the last year, one nationally known expert in that field has died; another has retired. Due to budget shortfalls, neither has been replaced (an associate professor will be hired by next year). 
<P>By the end of this year, the Department of English will have lost six full-time staffers through resignation or retirement. They'll be replaced with only two. Lost is Norman Sanders, UTK's only Shakespearean scholar, not to be replaced. The attrition "cuts down on the size of the faculty and its competency," says department head Allen Carroll. There are other similar stories throughout the campus, but especially in the College of Arts and Sciences, UT's oldest curriculum. 
<P>"Faculty members are not interchangeable parts," says former dean Larry Ratner. "If you lose an American colonial history or medieval history specialist, there's no one else to teach upper-level and graduate courses in these areas."
<P>Losses of such nationally prominent scholars can start a vicious circle that undercuts a college's reputation and decreases its graduate student enrollment, which, via the dreaded formula, will bring further cuts in the budget. 
<P>That ominous word comes up, over and over, in every rank of UTK, from president to adjunct professor, all of whom hold it in awe. Most fear it; few know it well. You might get the impression that it's a spy novel euphemism. The formula actually is a complex algebraic equation established by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission that determines just how much funding UT Knoxville and other state-supported campuses deserve in a given year. Lots of variables are fed into the equation; among the most frightening is g, the number of graduate students.
<P>Via the formula, grad students are worth a lot more state money than undergrads. Graduate students are attracted to schools with strong specialty programs. As these programs are undercut by retiring faculty members who aren't replaced with professors of equal stature, they attract fewer graduate students. The school gets less money. And its reputation edges downward. 
<P>That descent appears to be showing up already. UTK failed to meet its early '90s goal of 7,000 graduate students. In fact, the number has been dwindling for each of the last three years, from 6,790 in 1994 down to 6,443 in 1995, to 6,229 this year. There's no reason to think that trend has hit bottom. 
<P>Perplexed UT officials offer various explanations for the graduate enrollment decline. The strong economy is pulling graduates into the job market sooner; national demand for entry-level faculty members is weak, especially in the arts and sciences; and UTK's pay scale for teaching assistants is much lower than at many other schools. Meanwhile, at some UTK schools, the downward cycle of reputation/student-population/funding/reputation continues.
<P>Several faculty members observe that faculty at the University of Georgia, ordinarily considered a peer of UTK, are paid better than UTK professors. Indeed, in department after department, position after position, UTK professors earn significantly less than the average salaries of professors at Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, and the other universities UTK considers members of its peer group. 
<P>UTK's nationally respected College of Business is widely regarded as one of the university's best, but full professors in each of its departments make several thousands less than the regional peer group average. In the field of marketing, that disparity amounts to more than $24,000. 
<P>UTK has been proud of its College of Engineering for more than a century; but even in that field, a full professor of industrial engineering at UTK makes $12,240 less than the peer group average. Electrical and civil engineering profs don't fare much better. 
<P>Don't send any care packages; most UTK profs do plenty well enough to get by, of course. But the disparity's important because comparatively lower income also makes recruiting and retaining top-notch talent very difficult.
<P>"Because of salary disparities, we're tending to lose our best and brightest younger faculty," says Ratner. Recently retired, the former Arts and Sciences dean may speak more frankly than some incumbents. "If you can't replace them, this both creates holes in the curriculum and hurts your ability to attract research grants.
<P>"Our worst single problem is lack of competitive salaries," says Business College dean Warren Neel. "And the biggest hurt doesn't come when you lose someone but when someone stays who feels he's not compensated fairly. When your best and brightest don't feel engaged, they start taking more consulting and holidays."
<P>"It's terribly worrisome to see this happening," Ratner adds. "Last January, we were in the midst of recruiting to fill 30 faculty vacancies. Then the budget cuts came, and we had to institute a hiring freeze. We thought we had a great opportunity to rebuild our faculty, take a leap forward--and now we've lost it."
<P>This year, state funding to UTK is already $4.6 million short of what the formula allows it; that's what left 40 faculty positions unfilled, as well as the travel cutbacks and other recent shortages. But it gets worse. The state's finance director, John Ferguson, projects that the receipts in the current fiscal year will fall $80 million to $100 million short of budget. Some of this shortfall will certainly come out of UTK's hide.
<P>That's the source of another well-founded anxiety: the impoundment, better known to some professors as the giveback. Anticipating further cuts, the university's bracing for a 3 percent impoundment of funds already appropriated--a reduction totaling $4.5 million--expected to hit in January. "There are no further layoffs planned, other than adjunct professors," Chancellor Bill Snyder says. "But it's going to mean not filling positions, cutting back on operating expenses, and backing away from commitments to things like lab equipment." 
<P>Among other measures already instituted to minimize impact of the cuts is cutting back or eliminating faculty travel plans. More than just a perk, travel to various national conferences has become an important part of professors' continuing education. John Peters, vice chancellor for academic affairs, understands the importance of what's being lost. "We need money for faculty renewal, to learn new technologies, to go to professional meetings and hear the latest research," he says. "These things invigorate their teaching."
<P>Increasing class size has been another stopgap measure to cope with the crisis. Adding three or four students to an average class size seems an innocuous short-term solution to some administrators who advocate it. 
<P>The English Department in particular is feeling the impact of this doctrine. Teaching the ability to express ideas clearly in writing is among the most important duties any college performs for students bound for almost any profession. Though some freshman-level classes number in the hundreds, the legendary freshman comp, is traditionally a small class, fewer than 25 students to an instructor, preferably fewer than 20. Raising class sizes from about 20, where they were a few years ago, to 25 or 26, where they are now, may seem an obvious solution. 
<P>But experienced freshman comp professors at UTK and other colleges insist that 20 should be the maximum class size in a course requiring so much individual attention. Grading each student's paper for grammar, spelling, syntax, and clarity typically calls for half an hour of the professor's time. Beyond 20 students in a class, they say, the professor's effectiveness drops sharply. 
<P>Department Chairman Allen Carroll calls the 26-student maximum an "invidious consequence" of the cuts. "For years we had the cap at 22 [students per class], and worked hard to realize that," he says. "Now it's 25, in some cases 26. That size makes the class unwieldy. It diminishes the chances it will be successful."
<P>Professors at other universities agree. National guidelines for freshman composition, in fact, recommend a maximum of 15 students per class. 
<P>The threat of major cuts for the 1997-98 academic year appears to be even worse. Vice Chancellor Peters admits that "while reallocation can be invigorating, I don't know how we can sustain more cuts without some very, very hard choices." UTK's been operating at a disadvantage for some time, but it's clear that the worst is yet to come.
<P>UTK's administration is gamely taking measures to take this bull by its horns. Snyder is establishing an academic program evaluation committee (APEC) which will, with the advice of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee, the Council of Deans, and five faculty task forces, make some of those very hard choices. "We have to be more focused on priorities and efficiencies," Snyder says. "This process is essential for both retrenchment and enhancement."
<P>APEC will rate programs in light of how well they serve the mission of higher education in Tennessee. A draft of APEC's guidelines sounds severe: "Resource allocations to programs with low ratings, other than those central to the mission, should be reduced, with a view to reorganizing, restructuring, or eliminating them."
<P>The administration is taking some of these steps based on models of what other comparable universities have done in recent years, especially Syracuse and the University of Iowa. Among Iowa's cutbacks was the elimination of the School of Home Economics. That institution, which some see as obsolete, survives at UTK as part of the College of Human Ecology. 
<P>Concurrent with these cutbacks and rumors of cutbacks is some understandable hostility toward UT's administration. Some are suspicious that the many offices in Andy Holt Tower, some of which govern the statewide university system, are bloated and not suffering to the same extent the rest of the campus is. Some faculty members perceive UT administrators as incompetents. "They have no better an idea of how to run a great public institution than someone living under the Gay Street Bridge," declared one science professor in a recent faculty forum--echoing, more colorfully, Governor Don Sundquist's recent harsh criticisms of UT's "bureaucracies." 
<P>There may well be fat and gristle in Andy Holt Tower. However, some gauges indicate that UTK is one of the cleanest-burning academic engines around. For years, U.S. News &amp; World Report has published a widely respected inventory of the best college buys in America, finding the universities that combine low tuition with high academic achievement. A school that somehow does both, one might assume, uses its resources very well. In the category of national universities, UTK consistently ranks extremely high for per-dollar value: #7 in America in '94, #8 last year, #12 this year. (In academic reputation, UTK is placed in the second of four tiers among American colleges and universities, still ahead of UK and Auburn, far ahead of Alabama and Ole Miss.) In addition, average college-entrance exam scores have risen, suggesting UTK's current student body may be a tad smarter than those of former years.
<P>Many see Dean Neel's Business College as the jewel in UTK's crown, ranked among the better business schools nationally, regardless of tuition. "It's incumbent upon universities to say we use the money as effectively as we can," says Neel. "We think that with UT, the state gets a big bang for its buck." 
<P>There's plenty of room for improvement, but it's hard to look at dollar figures and argue with that statement, or with the likelihood that the largest part of the problem is outside of Circle Park: about 180 miles outside, to be specific, in Nashville, where, some note ruefully, the legislature is no longer dominated by UT grads. Its age, size, and superior reputation within the state aside, UTK still has to compete for state dollars with many other state-funded campuses. And higher education, in turn, now has to compete with other new, ambitious state programs like TennCare, Families First, and the urgent effort of bringing rural K-12 schools up to snuff.
<P>Many faculty members wring their hands in frustration with the legislature and what they see as its complacency about UTK's plight. Some suggest their biggest problem is their failure to educate politicians; if they only understood how important the university is to the state's reputation and welfare, they say, they'd fix the problem. Chancellor Snyder has a more sober perspective. He sees no evidence that UTK is unfairly discriminated against in state budget allocations. "Given the resources we have in this state," he says, "we simply cannot meet all our needs as well as we'd like."
<P>Even the almighty formula is impotent without one variable--the variable $. The formula has not, in fact, been fully funded by the state since 1989. This year, UTK is getting $151 million from the state--more than half its total operating budget of $248 million, with most of the balance--$76 million--coming from tuition. In some respects, UTK's problems reflect higher education's nationwide crisis, as the demand for high-tech equipment makes education more expensive and the federal sources of funding for it are now being picked over as sources of budget cuts. However, UT--which is, unfortunately, dependent on the State of Tennessee--has its own distinct revenue problems.
<P>Now one of a tiny minority of states with neither an income tax nor a lottery, Tennessee's revenue depends almost entirely on sales tax. "The state of Georgia has a lottery system, with a large percentage of the revenue earmarked for higher education," remarks Jim Wansley, director of UTK's School of Finance, whose office has been forced to depend on private money for basic supplies. "Other states have an income tax. Without lotteries, which we have been unwilling to even let people vote on--or an income tax--there's just not much flexibility."
<P>If statewide retail sales are disappointing, as they have been this year, higher education is on the butcher's block. In Tennessee, a bum Christmas season can bring big slices out of its state-funded universities. It's those Christmas sales tax figures that have everyone worried about the likelihood of unplugging the phones at UTK in '97. 
<P>Some of the most conspicuous shortcomings are the results not of recent cutbacks but of flat budgets that haven't kept up with inflation. 
<P>This fall, Oscar Franzese, an Oak Ridge Ph.D. in engineering, made the mistake of visiting UTK to look something up in recent issues of transportation journals he assumed any engineering library would have on hand. He was startled to discover that UTK's library had none of those he was seeking; the latest issues of each journal he sought were dated 1993.
<P>On campus, similar stories abound in almost every field. Brian Griffin, a novelist who's an adjunct professor of writing at UTK, was taken aback to learn that the library didn't subscribe to several influential literary journals, including Story, one of America's most-respected fiction magazines. "We have a strong creative writing community, with a real interest in these publications, but they're not there. I'm really disappointed--to the point I don't even go to the library anymore."
<P>To meet the demands of the budget crunch, the UTK library has surrendered a net total of 629 periodical subscriptions this year alone. Those deficits are only distantly related to the current rounds of cutbacks. Publishing costs have skyrocketed in recent years, and so have subscription rates, but the library's budget has not kept up with subscription rates, which have sometimes doubled in recent years. Though the library budget is allegedly safer from the current round of cutbacks than most other departments, its once-respectable catalogue of current academic journals has been dwindling for years, and continues to.
<P>Many departments are also contending with the consequences of years of underfunded equipment budgets. 
<P>In this era of electronic mail and CD-ROM, students learning radio technology in UTK's School of Broadcasting are learning their trade using 17-year-old equipment that predates the digital age. Not only is it outmoded; some professors suggest some of these machines are so decrepit, they're even dangerous to use. "We are in a severe bind," says Professor Norman Swan. "We don't really have an equipment-maintenance or equipment-replacement budget. Radio is moving toward the digital world. In order to prepare students for the future, we need to teach them about it. But we're still working with outdated equipment."
<P>The School of Civil Engineering has found it possible to rely more on outside nonstate sources of revenue--corporate grants and contracts--than some schools have; the budget they get from UT proper doesn't quite cover salaries alone. "We're asked by the crediting agencies to expose students to the latest testing methods," says chairman Greg Reed. "But we've had no equipment budget in eight years." 
<P>Is most of their equipment more than eight years old, then? It's a naive question. "Most of it's well over eight years old. Some of it's more than 20 years old! We're still patching it together, to keep it going." He says the THEC formula, when it's fully funded, allows for the replacement of 5 percent of the department's equipment yearly, which means equipment has to last an average of 20 years. In the fast-changing world of high technology, that's not nearly enough. "So much today is computer-integrated," he says. "Computers don't last for 20 years, that's for sure. Friends and alumni donate some--but not enough to keep pace with our peers." That is, N.C. State, Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, Clemson, Auburn.
<P>The administration admits the urgency of the problem. "We desperately need more infrastructure--equipment and operating money," says Peters. "We don't even have an equipment budget line anymore." The equipment shortage is a campus-wide crisis, part of which is now being addressed by a new $100 per student, per semester technology fee, earmarked for computer support.
<P>The efforts of Snyder and APEC may make the best of a very painful situation, the magnitude of which we won't know until Sundquist's budget is unveiled next month. Things may be somewhat better by the '98-'99 year, when some of the other strains on the state's budget are predicted to have run their course. In the meantime, in the face of that ominous impoundment and certain future cuts, UTK's faculty, students, and alumni can only watch for it, knowing there's going to be much damage, praying it won't be the catastrophe they dread.

Living in the Material World</H1>
<P><STRONG>Tis the season to buy retail, and all indications thus far are that we are doing so with a vengeance. But where do we shop, and why?</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Janet Tate</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
There's a scene in the prescient 1976 film Network in which ultra-evil uber-boss Ned Beatty stands at the head of a gleaming 30-foot-long conference table in a hushed and darkened room and unleashes the following fire-and-brimstone explanation of modern-day corporate cosmology: "...There are no nations...there are no third worlds; there is no West...There is no America, there is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon...The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business...Our children will live to see [that] perfect world: one vast and ecumenical holding for which all men will labor, and in which all men will hold a share of stock--all necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused."
<P>Fast-forward 20 years; substitute such names as Wal-Mart, Toys-R-Us, Barnes &amp; Noble, Heilig-Meyers, and SuperPetz for the megalomaniacal powers-that-be, and the resemblance to Paddy Chayefsky's vision of monolithic-corporate domination is eerily accurate. Hugely successful discount chain stores now cast their long shadows over most of the American retail landscape, luring us with their siren songs of low prices and convenience, enticing us through their automated doors with fleeting promises of material delights as foretold in their glossy, full-color ad pages that cascade daily from our morning newspapers.
<P>And we all find ourselves in them at one time or another; there's really no escape. Their discounting, bulk-buying ways make it seem almost foolish for us to not buy our products from them. Why should we pay $45 for a Sony Walkman at Joe Shmoe's Corner Electronics, when the identical item is available at Target for $29.95 (and while we're at it we can pick up a 20-pound bag of cat food and a copy of the latest bestseller)? We want what we want, and we want it now, and that's what keeps our great capitalistic society going. But at what cost to our community as a whole, let alone to local merchants, those entrepreneurial heroes in every hometown who would prefer not to labor for and hold a share of stock in anyone else's vast and ecumenical holding? In Knoxville, the list of small businesses that expired in competition with mega-chains is ever-growing: Raven Records, Shriver's, Moveable Feast, Sequoia Drugs, Gateway Books, Blues Depot...
<P>Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the U.S., is infamous for coming into a burgh--say, Newport, Jefferson County, or the already impossibly traffic-choked Walker Springs interstate exit in west Knox County--and erecting its 91,000-square-foot "discount" stores. Sometimes, they then move on to another plum site and build a brand new 182,000-square-foot Supercenter, leaving in their wake not only deserted strip malls and grocery stores but also, this time, a huge abandoned husk of a building that few (if any) other local businesses can afford to lease. 
<P>While they're at it, they tranquilize our anxieties. Because Wal-Mart alone sells about one-twelfth of all pop recordings sold in this country, they can (and do, under penalty of not carrying artists' works) bully record labels into altering their wares to suit Wal-Mart's tastes. And they do amuse our boredom, often by playing by their own rules: Independent booksellers nationwide have noted how Sam's Wholesale Club-- a leisure service of Wal-Mart--feels free to get the jump on the competition by offering newly-released books to its customers before the official "lay-down" date observed by other bookstores--and because no one's going to tell them they can't, they get away with it.
<P>Freedom of expression issues and fair trade practices aside, what do we make of our retail choices today? Is the Brave New World that the global economy is increasingly offering us--wherein the last small independent bookseller closes up shop for good and the lucrative ghost of Sam Walton dictates to America what records and videos are morally acceptable for us all--an inevitability, or just a feverish conspiracy theory? What's a mom &amp; pop business got to do to stay alive these days? 
<P>Independent retailers can survive, even thrive, and not only in spite of the Wal-Marts of the world, but sometimes because of them. Here are retail theories and other tales from some local independent business owners who, despite the odds, are standing their ground as Davids in a growing world of retail Goliaths.

<H3>Service with a Smile</H3>

In October 1987, UT grad student Allan Miller faced a dilemma: continue his studies in clinical nutrition, or figure out what to do with his burgeoning, homegrown compact-disc copying and distribution business. "I was delivering discs to students and faculty between classes, and it was getting to be too much," says the co-partner of the Disc Exchange, which now boasts two good-sized, exceptionally well-stocked CD emporiums in Knoxville: the original store on Chapman Highway, which recently underwent a major expansion under the auspices of manager Scott Partin; and its two-year-old sibling on Kingston Pike. 
<P>Ironically, Miller recounts, "We didn't start it to make money; we [Miller and co-partner Jeannie Jenkins] just like music a lot, and we were trying to get music for cheap. That's all it was supposed to have been. I kept thinking I would find someone else to run it, but I couldn't find anyone with the time or experience, so I just did it myself. It kind of grew from there."
<P>The secret of the Disc Exchange's success is simple and organic: a store staffed with people who share with their customers passionate love of music. "If you go into a store and spend full price on a CD and you don't like it, it kind of turns you off to getting into new music or discovering other things," Miller says. "You want the whole experience [of listening to and buying music] to be pleasurable, and so do we. The people we have working at the store are all musicologists, real big into music, and they all have certain areas of expertise. It's a big turn-on for our employees to help people find new music or the music they're looking for."
<P>Miller also challenges the assumptions that larger music-store outlets, whether Wal-Mart or Camelot in West Town Mall, are more convenient than the little guys. "If you go into a locally-owned store," he says, "they can probably get you to where you need to be and out the door faster than it takes for you to park out in some big parking lot, walk all the way in, wander around trying to find what you want, try to find someone to point you in the right direction, try to make your mind up what you need, find it, then get in a long line with other people who think they're saving money by going there, then walk all the way back out to your car."
<P>And that's assuming lower prices happen at the big "discount" stores--an assumption the big guys flog but that ain't necessarily so.  Frequently stores will use a few "loss-leader" items (merchandise purposely marked so cheaply the store will lose money on it), only to mark up other, less-frequently purchased items (and therefore less frequently compared in price to the same items at other stores) to make up the difference. What's more, chain stores can well afford to lose money for a while at a new startup store by offering lower prices until any area competition has effectively been run off--at which time the store's prices inch up to about the same level the competition was offering in the first place.
<P>Miller also points out that money spent at the big chain stores "heads out, not into the community, but back to the corporate office, into the big cities or wherever they are. A lot of people are so concerned with price they forget there's a lot of other things that go along with that. It's called being a good citizen." 

<H3>Stocking Up</H3>

Judy Luna, marketing manager for Davis-Kidd Booksellers' Knoxville store, couldn't agree more with Miller about the importance of a retailer's sense of community. 
<P>"That's why we do poetry readings, book signings, and discussion groups," says Luna. "That's the way we like to bring people in, rather than spending a lot of money on media advertising."
<P>That, and offering customer service over deep discount--a philosophy that admittedly hurts smaller booksellers such as Davis-Kidd, which first opened in 1980 in Nashville and has since expanded. 
<P>"We have more staff available than most bookstores; that's a high priority for us. But that also prevents us from being able to offer across-the-board discounts like other stores. You can't be everything. But we feel the way we do things does build strong customer loyalty. People feel comfortable coming in here to a signing or book group, even though they may not know anyone else. Lots of times people tell us they've just moved to town and thought it seemed like a good safe way to meet people."
<P>The real-estate mantra of "location, location, location" impelled Davis-Kidd five years ago to pull out of its Cumberland Avenue store and move its operation to the Peters Road/Cedar Bluff area--a competitive move that has helped them broaden their base by taking advantage of the lucrative shopping mecca that is West Knoxville. 
<P>Still, says Luna, the big chain discount stores pose the biggest problem for the small bookseller. "It's very tough, period," she says. "The discounting seems to be very important to so many people. It's surprising to me how important a 10 percent discount is, say, on a $4.99 book to people, to where you sometimes wonder would they really drive a lot further to save 50 cents. but I know people are price-conscious. You just have to work really hard to be able to help the customer get the right book as quickly as possible and go beyond what other people are willing to do to do that."
<P>Part of how Davis-Kidd does that is to maintain ample stock and to display an eager willingness to order, and quickly get in, any book currently in print that the store may not have--a service surprisingly lacking at most bookstores, large and small. Luna recounts, "I had a customer yesterday who'd been dealing with another bookstore because frankly, she said, she wanted to save time and money, but she couldn't find what she wanted elsewhere. It turned out we had every book on her list. And truly, a book is a book, whether they buy it here or Books-A-Million or Bookstar. And it's not just other bookstores; everyone sells books these days. Kroger, Revco, practically every store has some kind of book inventory."
<P>Niche bookselling is another way of staying alive: inventories consisting solely of, say, children's books, pet books--or religious books. "This area is one of the highest per capita in the country for Christian bookstores," says Luna. "Many smaller stores just narrow their focus, find a niche, and manage to survive that way." It's either that, or else keep enough inventory on hand to provide a sufficient client base with what they want when they want it--a tightrope walk that may have been the downfall of some former Knoxville independent bookstores. "Apple Tree was the first good bookstore we had in Knoxville, and Draper's was excellent," Luna muses. "Maybe they weren't big enough."

<H3>Scratching a Niche</H3>

The two-story, upscale-rustic house on Mohican Drive just off Kingston Pike (which, ironically, was once the Draper Bookstore) has for the past year-and-a-half been home to the Best Little Cat House in Tennessee, a virtual cat boutique crammed full of cat toys, combs, brushes, collars, scratching posts, and litter-box screens; cat calendars, umbrellas, wrapping paper, doormats, jewelry, posters, pillows, hats, coffee mugs, windchimes, and books, including The Official Cat Codependents Handbook for People Who Love Their Cats Too Much. Brenda Johnson, former housewife and cosmetics salesperson and now the Cat House's proprietress, laughs as she winds her way around the seven free-range cats of assorted colors and sizes currently residing in the Cat House: "We do get a lot of crank calls, but most of them are sincere cat lovers."
<P>Johnson explains that she opened her store because she found it so hard to find unique cat furnishings and accessories. "You can find all sorts of things for dogs, but not so much for cats," she says. "So I decided Knoxville needed a place like this. We thought it would be a good niche to try to pull something together." Johnson hopes eventually to expand into Oak Ridge and the Tri-Cities areas. 
<P>And business is booming. "Cats have surpassed dogs in popularity," she asserts, "and of course, Christmas is best time of year for most retailers. I definitely see an increase in sales over last year." 
<P>Interestingly, dealing with the more than 850 vendors who supply her stock is Johnson's biggest headache. "Most of the time we have to hunt them down, that's the hard part. We have really overcome that by just diligence, seeking people out who do deal in cat merchandise. Maybe one vendor will have a handful of cat items that I would want to carry in the store, and they deal with other things rather than just cats. If I could find someone who dealt only with cat merchandise or cat-related products, that would make it a lot simpler, but we can't do that because it's such a small niche."
<P>You may be able to find the perfect rhinestone-studded collar for the feline on your Christmas list at the Cat House, but if you're looking for a covered cat-litter box or non-upscale cat food, you'll still have to go across the street to SuperPetz. "We don't carry the same brand of covered litter box as Wal-Mart, but we have a good product that we do carry, and it's substantial. We're just out of stock on that right now. But we offer more variety, we offer things SuperPetz never heard of, or even thought about carrying, because we are a specialty store for cats."
<P>Johnson seems serenely confident of her niche, and dismisses the large competitors for the cat-loving public. "I don't even think of SuperPetz [which is located right across Kingston Pike from the Cat House, near Homberg] as a competitor. Wal-Mart will never know you by your first name. We get to know our customers, what they want, what they like, what their particular cat needs are. If they have a problem, we can either recommend what they do, or go to a vet, or find help for them in some way. Wal-Mart won't do that; Target won't do that. They don't have the know-how because they have so many other things they're interested in and carry, and for us, it's just cats."

<H3>A Toy Story</H3>

The shelves at Mark and Catherine Sheffer's store, The Toy Chest, are well-stocked with upscale playthings that look like they might actually have originated in Santa's workshop rather than the imagination of some mega-profit-minded Hollywood mogul. There are magic show kits, Brio building blocks, Playmobil playsets, non-electric train sets, and non-plastic, aesthetically-pleasing toys offered by Holz-Steckbox and Ravensberg and other Swedo-Germanic-sounding manufacturers. The collectibles there are minerals and fossils, not Barbies or Transformers. The rubber-stamp kits sold here might actually outlast Christmas morning; the puzzles are sturdy and feature nary a Disney character.
<P>"This was basically Catherine's idea," Mark Sheffer explains between the ever-ringing bell on the store's front door and the ever-ringing cordless phone at his elbow. "There's just not any specialty toy stores in this area, and she got tired of driving so far out west [to Smart Toys, in Franklin Square] to get to one." 
<P>The Sheffers also didn't care much for the bigger toy stores and their dictatory domination of the market. "We like to keep things that Toys R Us wouldn't have. A lot of the brands that we have, they wouldn't carry, for whatever reasons," says Mark. Maybe because there's no movie tie-in to the well-made, but generic, stuffed animals that The Toy Chest features. Or maybe it's because Toys R Us has been so busy acquiring Baby Superstores, expanding its Kids R Us children's clothing stores, and fighting off anti-trust charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission that the world's largest toy retailer doesn't have the inclination to stock anything that's not Nintendo 64 or somehow related to Space Jam or 101 Dalmatians. Which actually suits the Sheffers just fine.
<P>"It's good that they're there," Mark insists, "because they can stock the inventory and have things like the Tickle Me Elmo. That's the one everybody's panicking over this season."
<P>The exclusivity factor works for The Toy Chest. "There really is a market for this niche; we've been surprised. Some of the companies [that we deal with] are very particular about who buys their products. Brio interviewed us first, to make sure we had the type of store they wanted to be in. It was a fairly tough interview, too. They wanted to know the other products we were carrying, and it was very important to them. They want to be known more in a specialty and educational toy store, like this environment."
<P>The door rings once again, and soon two elderly women approach the front desk with gifts for their grandchildren as well as for two chosen names from a children's charitable organization. As he does the toys up in the store's complimentary gift wrap, Mark assures the women that if their selections fail to satisfy, they can be easily returned. It's a concept called customer service.

<H3>Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Salesman?</H3>

Paul Long has spent the last 42 years as a manufacturer's sales representative, selling furniture and lamps throughout the state to large chain stores and small mom-and-pop stores alike. 
<P>"It's tough now, it's real tough. Years ago, the independent mom-and- pop stores were owned by families. They weren't big, but they were all financially in good condition. But they've been disappearing like flies over the last ten years." The mom-and-pop furniture stores were once the basis of the business, says Long, but most of them have since been bought out by the big national chains such as Heilig-Meyers, based in Virginia (which bought out Knoxville's old Sterchi stores) and Rhodes Stores, based in Atlanta (which recently acquired Fowlers). "The big chains buy them out with offers they can't refuse," says Long. "A lot of them have tried to go on as family businesses but then just close up because they can't fight the big stores."
<P>And the chain reaction of chain store buyouts ultimately trickles down to individual folks like Long. "It's affected my business, for sure. There are fewer and fewer accounts to call on, and you've got to have some of the big ones now to survive. But the chains cut their own deals with the manufacturers, which cuts me out." So when a furniture store chain--say, Heilig-Meyers--makes its own deals with furniture manufacturers, "all the buying is done in Virginia. The Tennessee man doesn't get anything at all." 
<P>It's a predicament Clyde Driskill of Newport knows all too well. Eighty-five years ago Driskill's grandfather and great-uncle set up their furniture store and developed first-name rapport with the local folk by selling them well-made, affordable bedroom and dining room suites. Three generations later, Driskill's Furniture Company is the oldest family-owned business in Cocke County, "but we're just hangin' in by our teeth," says Driskill. 
<P>It's not just the major furniture chains that are a threat. Sometimes the mere existence of a super discount store--say, Wal-Mart--that doesn't even pose a direct competitive threat in terms of merchandise can still create havoc for the moms-and-pops. "Fortunately, Wal-Mart doesn't carry much furniture," Driskill chuckles. "But they built a store in Newport, then moved on and built a Supercenter, and although that hasn't affected the particular items we sell that much, it has affected the traffic. [Locally-owned] stores are in the older part of this little town, and with the rerouting of traffic [toward the Wal-Mart], people don't go out this way as much anymore. And that means they don't get to pass by us."
<P>In order to stay in the running with the big guys, Driskill says, they've narrowed their product lines and cut out promotional, or lower-end, merchandise. "We've always had a good reputation for customer service and taking care of what we sell. So now we try to capitalize on that reputation. It seems to be working very nicely."  
<P>Part of what keeps Driskill hanging in there has been a shrewd analysis of his client base. "In the southern part of our county, the Cosby area toward Gatlinburg and bordering the Smokies park, there's a rapidly developing population of retirement people. They come here with money and need to furnish their retirement or summer house, so we're gearing our advertising toward those people."
<P>It's a good thing Driskill has been able to delineate a new market. "We've noticed there's not much store loyalty anymore," he says. "Here in Newport, especially among some people in the professional communities-- those who have disposable income over and above what most of us have--it seems to be sort of a status symbol to go to Knoxville and have a Fowler's or a Fielden's truck come to Newport to deliver what they buy. It's an ego trip."
<P>Still, Driskill remains optimistic about the human longing for something out of the ordinary, and he hopes that will bring buyers back to his door, "Because you know, I think people are getting tired of being treated like cows, and everybody just doing the same thing all the time."

Welfare Reform?</H1>
<P><STRONG>Tennessee's Families First program is still a work in progress</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Patrick Thomas</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Debbie Rich has 18 months to find a job or lose her welfare check. 
<P>When her case came due for its regular, six-month re-certification review this fall, she was enrolled in Tennessee's Families First welfare reform program which, unlike the now-abolished federal entitlement program, purports to have time limits. "About six years ago, Mom kicked me out of the house when I was pregnant," she recalls, smiling because she and her mother are reconciled now. Off and on welfare for most of her adult life, she is the mother of a 6-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son--a textbook case. She has no car--not even a telephone.  
<P>Her monthly cash stipend is small--only $185 a month, the maximum for a family of three in Tennessee. Under the reform plan, if she were to have another child, the amount would not increase.  Tennessee has always been stingy with cash allotments, among the bottom five states, but there are other benefits worth far more.  Knoxville's Community Development Corporation (KCDC), through a federal pass-through subsidy called Section 8, pays the $450 rent for Debbie Rich's small house on Martin Luther King Boulevard. The utilities are subsidized--she paid eight dollars for them in November.  She also collects $299 a month in food stamps. And then, of course, there is free TennCare medical coverage.
<P>Until last summer, all these benefits would have been extended indefinitely
to Rich and 93,000 other Tennesseans. Under Families First, welfare clients are being transformed into "customers," and more than 2,000 Department of Human Services eligibility counselors have been re-trained as case managers, whose goal is to get people off the rolls and into the workforce. To remain eligible for cash assistance, the "customer" must sign an individualized Personal Responsibility Plan--a PRP--which requires up to 40 hours of classes, employment searching, or assigned work each week until the applicants get a real job. To support their efforts, Families First also pays for child care and transportation. Moreover, their benefits will no longer get cut off all at once when they get a job. Instead, for 18 months, the state will provide "transitional benefits" including a rent freeze in public housing, continued food stamps, child care vouchers on a sliding scale, and TennCare coverage. 
<P>After 18 months, if the recipient has failed to find employment, the cash payments stop for at least three months--unless one of the numerous exceptions kicks in. Time limits are the most important change that Families First supposedly brings to welfare reform. There is a five year lifetime cap on benefits, but here too there is enough latitude for exceptions that it remains to be seen whether any family with small children will actually be cut off. Indeed, the prospects for the entire program at this stage can be summed up as a "wait and see" proposition.
<H3> </H3>
To keep her $185 stipend, Rich has been attending mandatory life skills classes on parenting, nutrition, financial planning, etc., and then practical job hunting. A local agency has a contract with the state to conduct this four-week course, called Fresh Start. All across Tennessee, the state Department of Human Services has subcontracted various Families First programs to local, non-profit and quasi-public organizations such as this one, Child and Family Inc., which gets funding from the city, the county, United Way, the Gerber Foundation, and other private donors. 
<P>Faith Tapp teaches the job search class which Rich attends. After two weeks together, the women in the program have bonded and their discussions are lively. This morning, Tapp goes through a list of the top 10 jobs her pupils can pursue in the city, explaining the pros and cons. The occupation of corrections officer comes up, and one of the women wisecracks about having the opportunity to hunt down child support violators. This draws loud laughter--it's an inside joke, because many women find themselves on welfare because of fathers who won't pay child support. But Tapp says soberly that there actually are  such positions, and there is a more practical consideration, to wit: "You'll get the same salary as the men."   
<P>Welfare benefits are worth up to $7 an hour, Tapp says. That's why the transitional benefits are so important. "This economy will not support $8.00 and $9.00 an hour jobs in the first job for the welfare recipient who's never worked before," says Vaughn Smith, director of the Knoxville-Knox County Private Industry Council, which implements many Families First programs. "The way to get there is to take the $6.00 or $6.50 an hour job now, continue to provide the subsidies for the person who is working at that level as long as it is necessary, while they continue to upgrade their skills... and they'll eventually get themselves out of that low-wage job."
<P>Rich is a model "customer," as welfare clients are now known under Families First. She's had two years of college and now hopes to attend a technical school, with government assistance, to study accounting. To cut Fresh Start training classes might mean losing her $185 a month check--90 percent attendance is necessary.  Yet many customers ignore the threat. "They told us 65 were registered, and only 18 showed up," Rich says. One was a friend of hers. "When she found out about those classes, she said, 'I'm not going to waste my time,' and went out and got the first job she could." The welfare department estimates that about a third of the no-shows do that--just find work--although the hard information is scanty so far.  
<P>And what happened to those women who didn't participate and who didn't  find jobs? Or those who dropped out OR refused to sign a PRP?
<P>"One of the scary things is that the state can't tell you," answers Gordon Bonnyman Jr. 
<P>Scion of a wealthy Knoxville family that made its millions in nonunion coal mines, Bonnyman was a Legal Aid attorney until recently, when the Republican Congress limited the political activities of these federally-funded advocates. He now operates out of the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center in downtown Nashville. Gordon Jr. seems to have spent most of his life overcompensating for the reputation of his father--playing Luke Skywalker to Gordon Sr.'s Darth Vader. 
<P>"I litigated against AFDC for 20 years," the fortysomething lawyer says. That's the acronym for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the New Deal entitlement program whose tombstone reads "1935-96." One of the more egregious failures of big government in American history, AFDC was the very purgatory of poverty, somewhere between starvation and recovery, a coma-like existence for millions of women and their children. Bonnyman loathed the micromanagement of people's lives--the "man-under-the-bed" rules, for example, which prohibited unmarried fathers from even visiting their children, the penalty being expulsion from the program, thus making mothers even more dependent on government sustenance.  "You know, the welfare department is the IRS with attitude--and about a third of the resources."
<P>So, however reluctantly, Bonnyman found himself drawn into the legislative sausage factory on Capitol Hill, where he helped season the recipe for Families First, whose first helpings are being cooked up and served out now. "The law that got written was more humane, more rational, a more sober effort to make policy than--certainly-- what we saw in Washington," he says. 
<P>For him and many other liberal lobbyists in Nashville, hammering out the legislation was a race with the Republican 104th Congress in Washington, which was barely won. President Clinton had vetoed two GOP welfare reform bills, but by late summer this year he had run out of excuses to deliver on what, after all, he had promised in his 1992 campaign--to end welfare as we know it. The President, in fact, never had a plan in writing. So, in late August, he signed the GOP legislation and then promised he would change it after the November elections when the Democrats would regain control of Congress. But the Democrats did not regain control of Congress, so...
<P>In the meanwhile, Gov. Don Sundquist appointed Leonard Bradley to head up the Welfare Reform Task Force to draw up the plan which became known as Families First. "One of the things about a state like Tennessee is that it is still small enough that personalities make a big difference," says Bonnyman. "I think Leonard Bradley was key, a thoroughly decent, bright person with a history of administering AFDC--and a good negotiator. There were committee hearings where people would grandstand, sometimes at his expense, and he would keep his cool and try to keep it being discussed at a policy level as opposed to political posturing." In July, just before Congress and the President agreed on a new federal welfare law, the Clinton administration formally approved Families First, thus allowing the state to use this program for 11 years. "The state is better off having a waiver than being under federal law," says Bonnyman.
<P>He prefers the Tennessee plan because it provides more escape hatches than the new federal law. There were 30 waivers granted to the state by Washington. One difference between the state and federal plans, for example, is the rate for "minimum work participation." Federal law tightens requirements for each of the next five years. Tennessee's Families First has no such provisions whatsoever. For the next 10 years, our state is exempt from these and other Clinton-Gingrich restrictions.  
<P>Nonetheless, Bonnyman believes Families First is flawed. "There's not enough money for transportation, and the child care rates are not adequate," he says. But the biggest problem he sees is the state Department of Human Services itself. "As an entity, it's not any place you'd want to go to have somebody make profound decisions about the life course of you and your children in a 15 minute episode." He is referring to the interviews that DHS case workers conduct with welfare mothers as they come off AFDC and enroll in Families First.  
<P>DHS officials say these sessions normally take an hour to an hour-and-a-half. But, Bonnyman insists, "These PRPs are being thrown together in 15 minutes. I heard yesterday that they're being done over the phone. I've seen some of them--they're ludicrous!" The whole idea of transforming the roles of DHS employees overnight strikes him as preposterous. "You take a 25-year-old social worker who's basically got keyboarding skills...and that's it. Now, suddenly we sprinkle holy water over them, and we've made them case management specialists, who are going to work out a life plan for women to turn their lives around." Bonnyman despises social workers more than Newt Gingrich. There are saints among them, he says, but then there are the case workers with attitude, who now delight in saying: "'You're toast, and I'm so glad to be here to give you that message. I've wanted to give you that message for a very long time.' That has been the attitude that I have encountered over the years."  
<P>He sighs. "The misconception is that these are people who are basically dumb and sorry, and they really need counseling and a kick in the butt, and they'll be right as rain. I think that's the basic conception of welfare reform." The consequences of failure, he says, amount to this: "If in fact the stories that I'm getting are true--which is that the majority of the people with PRPs are not showing up--we're going to see a big jump in child homelessness."
<H3> </H3>
Prof. Leonard Bradley, chief architect of Tennessee's welfare reform,  left the Sundquist administration last summer to teach political science at Tusculum College in Greeneville. Today, he cautions against any "rush to judgment" on the Families First program, which was designed with "best guesses" on some outcomes, such as child care and transportation for those finding new jobs. "It will be two years before we know if it is working as planned," he says.  
<P>That is why the first formal evaluation of Families First will not be presented to the state treasurer until the session after next. "You have no past to look at," he explains in early December, when there was less than a hundred days of data from which to draw conclusions. It is a "shot in the dark" in some respects, he says. But Bradley is confident about one thing: "There is probably more than enough for child care and transportation this year." In Knoxville, less than 20 cases out of the first 500 were problematic, officials say. 
<P>The Families First budget is $72 million, statewide, for nine months of the current fiscal year that ends on June 30, including $44 million for child care and $10 million for transportation. Sundquist is expected to ask for an additional $40 million for Families First the next fiscal year.
<P>The first meeting of the state Family First advisory council convened in Nashville on December 5, presided over by DHS commissioner Linda Rudolph. But it was Bradley--handsome, engaging, modest...the sort of fellow Jimmy Stewart used to play in the movies--whom the other members regarded with awe.  
<P>The commissioner reported that 16.9 percent of the people whose cases had come up for review so far were "no longer on welfare"--5,000 cases out of the 29,000 processed in September and October.  Then Mike O'Hara, her assistant commissioner, tried to explain where the 5,000 or so missing welfare moms have gone: "Roughly a third said they had a job or had gone to work. Approximately a third refused to sign the Personal Responsibility Plan, and we have just really anecdotal information on that--a lot of them said they were going to work, some said they were going to receive child support, and some others said that they just didn't want to fool with the process. And another third contacted us--or didn't contact us--but basically asked for their case to be closed. So we don't really have an idea at this juncture. However, we are getting some follow-up survey from the University of Memphis." 
<P>About 1,700 people either "contacted or didn't contact" the welfare department to have their cases closed--whatever that means--but either way, their cases were trumpeted as victories of 20 percent or greater reductions of the welfare rolls during the first two months of Families First. So Bonnyman is right: the state has no precise measure of what is happening so far. But neither does he, and the anecdotal information gathered for this story, after the first 100 days of Families First, has some bright spots. 
<P>"We are putting a strong emphasis on the collection of child support," Rudolph says, noting that a new computer system to track deadbeat dads is already in place across a third of the state and that eventually this would hook into a national system. Once located, these men would face revocation of their driver's licenses, professional certificates--even hunting and fishing licenses.
<P>Suddenly, the soft-spoken Bradley interjected the most troubling observation of the meeting: "Some may have been intimidated by the program, but we can't know that, can we?" The unspoken question was what would happen to the children of these women, which O'Hara anticipates by reminding his audience that health department nurses would visit the homes of those who had been sanctioned--that is, kicked off the rolls for non-compliance. They would then report back to DHS if emergency funding for rent and utilities need be arranged.
<H3> </H3>
In Knoxville the next morning, about 40 protesters disrupted the local Families First advisory council's meeting. Organized by Solutions to Issues of Concern to Knoxvillians (SICK), it was a well-oiled demonstration with a press kit. Three welfare mothers read their statements, and the board was presented with a letter to Commissioner Rudolph, which the council members were asked to sign. 
<P>SICK wants case workers to explain rights and the appeals process to clients and for them to be allowed to bring another person--an advocate--to PRP meetings. They also ask for an extension of the five-year limit in cases where DHS cannot provide services, such as child care and transportation. Actually, all their demands are already DHS policies. The sticky point is the one of advocates, who are allowed and even welcomed, unless they gum up the interviews.
<P>After about a half hour of SICK's unscheduled presentation, which ended cordially, the council moved on with its prepared agenda, which included a couple of sobering reports from DHS officials. Tina Kent, who happens to be Debbie Rich's DHS case manager, drew a gasp when she revealed that she is presently in charge of at least 200 cases.  "I don't see all of them in a month," the twentysomething social worker responded, "only about 45 or 50 a month." What people say off-the-record is that the state really doesn't have enough case workers to carry out such an ambitious program.
<P>Perhaps the most alarming news that morning is that two out of three people who signed their PRPs in Knox County have been no-shows at mandatory meetings, and that they face losing their welfare checks. Or so it would seem. Many of these people simply reschedule appointments, DHS officials say. Chronic no-showism is routine--there was a 40 percent no-show rate for semi-annual re-certification on the old AFDC program here. This, incidentally, is a national phenomenon. As the Washington Post  reported this month, "New studies of work programs in Indianapolis and New York City report that about half of all recipients who are referred to work programs failed to show up, despite the threat of losing their welfare checks." 
<P>The most important demand that SICK makes is that if clients "can't work because of a lack of child care, transportation, or other needed services in the Personal Responsibility Plan, they will not be sanctioned and their benefits will be extended beyond the 18 month and 5 year time limits [sic]." Repeatedly in interviews for this story, officials would explain one way or another that the "clock would stop" on welfare limits. Finally, one DHS official, Viv Stidham, says, "There's nothing absolute about either the 18- or 60-month caps.  There are numerous exceptions."
<P>That explains why liberals like Bonnyman Jr. think Families First is a better law than Washington's. The Tennessee plan does not have real time limits. 
<H3> </H3>
One of Families First's "missing women" is LaRoyce Dalton, a 39-year-old mother of a teenager and a 3-year-old who lives in a Section 8 house near Asheville Highway. Raised on welfare, she came to "hate the thought" of it. "That's all we knew," she said, remembering that her grandmother helped the family live a decent life. Dalton worked in child care before her own child became sick and she had to go on welfare for more than three years.
<P>"I took myself out of the system," she says. "I didn't see how it would benefit me--a program so long and drawn out. Then they didn't guarantee a job. I feel like it was a waste of my time. When I didn't go to get recertified, I felt good . The system is just crazy. They just make you dependent on them."
<P>Although she has lost her monthly check and food stamps, she still has housing assistance and child care. One thing that emboldened her was a new arrangement to get child support directly from the father instead of DHS. "I'm surviving," she says. "We haven't been hungry a day."
<P>Her appraisal of the system is harsh. Some social workers, she says, were fine people, but others acted like they were giving away their own money. "Some of them talk to you like you are a nobody. They humiliate you. If you are a weak-minded person, they will bring you down to the lowest level. To be labeled a 'customer'--that would be enough to drive me off," she says with a laugh.
<P>Then, more seriously, she reflects on Families First. "I hate it because so many kids will be hungry and homeless. There are women my age who can't read. Some won't be able to go to work. Some are just slow."
<P>One official with long experience with public housing residents, KCDC director Fred DeBruhl, worries about these women, too--the ones who grew up in the projects, have fourth, fifth, or sixth grade educations, who moved into their own apartments as young people with babies, got a check every month, and now seldom move beyond that world.  "A lot of programs come and go to change the system, so a lot people think Families First will go away. Then I get the feeling that a lot of people are scared, and if you are scared, you are less likely to participate," he says, echoing what Bradley said in Nashville about intimidation. The housing director says, "Somehow, we've got to tell them: 'This is your opportunity.' The problem is getting people to come out to meetings."
<P>As for the dire predictions about new waves of homeless people next year, statistical evidence in Knoxville shows no sign of real trouble yet. Of about 3,700 cases handled by the Knox DHS office during the first three months of Families First, there were only 99 actual non-compliance sanctions, and they can be appealed. Exceptions are myriad, and Legal Aid attorney Ted Kern says, "We'll dig around till we find one" for clients with appeals cases.
<P>The issue of evictions from public housing is the most potentially explosive--and so far the least likely to happen anytime soon, local officials feel. Hilton Bolton, DHS chief for Knox County, explains that if a Families First case is closed by sanction, the Department of Health visits the household head to check on the children. If the family is likely to be evicted, or its utilities cut off, DHS is authorized to make an auxiliary payment in the exact amount of the Families First check that has been denied. And these payments could go on indefinitely. "It's a safety net for children," say Bolton. "We're funding the Health Department visits. But we haven't paid for a single one so far."
<P>"The American people are not going to let the government put people out on the street," says DeBruhl, who does not anticipate a crisis in 1997. He is excited by the opportunities that Families First provides.  "Let's give this thing a year or two," he says.

It Came From Knoxville: The Year in Review</H1>
<P><STRONG>It's been a scary year. Even as cartoon characters were taking potshots at our beloved Sunsphere (hey - name one other city that has one, okay?), giant proposed buildings were hovering over downtown and novody knew where they were going to land. And still don't. Meanwhile, we've got big employers threatening to vamoose even as Pigeon Forge is growing ever-larger (talk about scary...). On the plus side, Margie's doing the weather again.
<P>At any rate, here's our survey of the year's events, guaranteed to make you squirm in your chair, or your money back. See you next year.</STRONG>

<H2>Local Politics</H2>

<H3>Ah, Unity!</H3>
"Unification--it just makes sense." Countless media spots regurgitated this message ad nauseam during a $400,000 campaign for merging city and county governments. But 57 percent of Knox voters didn't buy it, and uni-gov went down to defeat for the fourth and probably final time. Getting rid of duplication was one of the prime reasons its establishment backers claimed it was so sensible. But, as County Commissioner Frank Leuthold pointed out, "They seem to have forgotten that people who live outside the city only have one government to begin with."
<P>As an added attraction, registrar-at-large Irene Lovely, who draws $63,000 a year to see that the Election Commission office is run right, wreaked havoc when she forgot to separate city votes from county votes in the unification referendum. Political realities kept her board from firing her, and her commissioners have opted to "evaluate" the office instead. Even that feeble measure has displeased Lovely, who evidently believes that being registrar means never having to say you're sorry. Will she still be around when her term expires in April? If so, will she resign gracefully? Or will she outlast them all and go on to bungle elections in perpetuity? Smart money is on the third option.

<H3>But When Does He Get His Own Nickname?</H3>
New kid on the block Nick Pavlis has had a tough rookie year as city councilman. He ticked off the old guard during the '95 campaign when he had the effrontery to run a tough campaign for an At-Large seat against the three incumbents and actually (gasp!) outpoll them all, even habitual top-vote-getter Jack Sharp. So Pavlis has endured a year of snide asides and lopsided votes against his initiatives--treatment heretofore reserved for the likes of Carlene "Too-Tall" Malone. Watch for Pavlis, apparently a disciple of the Nietzsche/G. Gordon Liddy "Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong" theory, to just keep on keeping on.

<H3>Who's on First</H3>
No, Where's on first. Siting the proposed replacement for Bill Meyer Stadium isn't as simple as it was when Mayor Victor Ashe announced his first choice this summer. After getting council to put a casual $12 mil in the budget for the new ball field, the mayor first picked a tract behind the city Safety Building. That hit a snag and World's Fair Park came into play. Then a lot of people who weren't supposed to be players ran out on the field. Near neighbors from Fourth and Gill and Parkridge wanted to keep it where it was. The Smokies wanted it anywhere but where it was. A bunch of people didn't want it on World's Fair Park. Nobody knew where everybody wanted it till the utility left-fielder, Councilwoman Carlene Malone, caught the mayor sitting on a poll which said that city residents (a) like it where it is and (b) really don't want it on State Street, which has become the Smokies' site of choice. At last report, relief pitcher Laurens Tullock had been called to the mound to try for a save. Where's it going? I don't know. (Third base.) I don't give-a-damn. (Shortstop.)

<H3>Too Cool For School</H3>
The school board lost its most progressive member this summer when Democrat Anne Woodle was ousted by D.M. Miller, a retread from the old city school board. Also joining up is perpetual school activist Steve Hunley, who is showing signs of breaking ranks with the hard-core school critics he used to run with before he was elected.

<H3>Just Reward</H3>
In November, the Knoxville Police Department finally rewarded Metro Pulse poster-cop Charles Coleman by giving him a long-overdue promotion to captain. Coleman is an African-American featured in a story on the joys and griefs of being a black cop in Knoxville, and his promotion was widely applauded in the community, which has been wrought with contention over KPD conduct.

<TR><TD><H2>Old City Blues</H2>
Admit it, Knoxville. You've never trusted the Old City. You used to say there were too many Whittle kids there. Later, you said there are too many frat kids there. Or foreigners. Or musicians, or something. But when you tried to say there were too many criminals there, you were stymied by the fact that in recent years, more outrageously violent crimes have transpired along Kingston Pike than downtown. Now, with the carjacking of a teenage couple in a parking lot near the Old City, you have one story you'll quote for years.
<P>No question, safety's a bigger worry than it was before.
<P>Some figured fear would take its toll on the OC's health. And this year, two of the anchor businesses we once thought we could count on forever closed: Lucille's, heir to Annie's, which was the germ from which the Old City grew, closed, and so did another Old City charter member, Manhattan's. Throw in the demises of the Big Easy, Spaghetti Warehouse, and Amigo's, and you'll hear prudent Knoxvillians and longtime Old City skeptics saying, "told you so."
<P>But if you haven't been there lately, you might be surprised to hear that in 1996, as many Old City businesses opened as closed. The Summit Diner, which closed a couple of years ago, reopened as Sullivan's Diner. An all-vegetarian restaurant that goes by the dusky moniker All Night Eggplant opened. In keeping with that nocturnal theme, Blue Moon, Knoxville's only modern retail bakery that doesn't specialize in birthday cakes, opened. So did the next-door ice cream parlor, the Big Dipper. Even Manhattan's has just reopened after being dark for several months. Amsterdam Cafe, which opened about a year ago, expanded onto patios fore and aft to become a crowded exotic-beer-and-live-music sensation. And Copper Cellar King Mike Chase bought into Hooray's, adding a note of stability. 
<P>Will the Old City ever see Old Age? We think maybe so. Despite closings and rumors of closings to come--such as the Blue Moon Bakery itself--these city blocks will remain, and people will come to them.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Much Ado...</H3>
If you happened to be walking down the Cumberland Avenue Strip or through the Old City in early fall, you may have noticed that the decibel level was considerably elevated from years past. A sudden proliferation of outdoor music sent the sweet crooning of patio bards wafting through the air, and thumping dance beats spilling off disco decks. But such joyful noise was a little too much for some area residents. After a spate of noise complaints in both areas, the Knoxville Police Department sent an ominous letter threatening to close the establishments in question if the patio racket didn't cease and desist. (KPD also managed to drag up a 30-plus-year-old statute that outlaws outdoor amplified tunes.) After a series of alternately quiet and contentious neighborhood meetings, the parties reached a tentative agreement to let the music play--as long as it doesn't play too loud. The compromise may have been aided and abetted by the fact that it was by then growing too cold for most of the clubs to keep their decks open anyway. Has the noise about noise finally quieted down? Stay tuned this spring.

<H3>You Mean There Are Still People in Knoxville Having Fun Late at Night? Let's Put a Stop to It!</H3>
Ever concerned about temperance and our collective moral welfare, city fathers abruptly decided in November that brown-bagging--the practice of BYOB at clubs without bars--should be prohibited between the hours of 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. An ordinance to that effect passed by a unanimous vote upon second reading in city council, although council members Nick Pavlis and Carlene Malone raised several questions that were largely ignored by Mayor Victor Ashe and their fellow aldermen.
<P>KPD chief Phil Keith spearheaded the ordinance, citing rampant problems (underage drinking, excessive calls for service, etc.) with brown-bagging establishments. This was news to folks at the Boiler Room and the Old City Late Nite Club, the two long-running clubs that serve as the city's primary after-hours hotspots; owners say you can count the annual calls for service to both establishments on the fingers of one hand.
<P>That wasn't the only point Keith was a little shaky on; nor was he alone in his disingenuousness. After all, this council boasts several of the same moral stalwarts who went nearly a dozen years without revoking a single beer permit in the city.
<P>In the meantime, Boiler Room and OCLNC ownership have joined forces and hired a lawyer; expect a judge to review the new law in early '97. And Boiler Room DJ Rob Taylor (a.k.a. Stormboy) reports that business is down but not out. "We still have a healthy dance floor crowd, but the rest of the club is almost empty," he says. "A lot of these people have been working all night, and they'd like to go somewhere where they can drink a beer."


<H2>Downtown</H2>

<H3>Meanwhile, On the Waterfront...</H3>
Knoxville emerged where it did as a riverfront port town, and for 150 years, the riverfront remained a lively place, first for commerce, later for gambling, bootlegging, and sundry other subversive pursuits. But in the 1950s, as part of "urban renewal," the shabby waterfront vanished from Knoxville's consciousness, paved over as sleek Neyland Drive, with only a sliver of grassy median between the pavement and the drink. In 1996, years of speculative discussion and an $8 million investment by the city began to culminate with the construction of a new pedestrian bridge across Neyland and the landscaping of a long, narrow sidewalk (er, park) along the river, embellished with serpentine walls, fountains, and strobe lights--with the promise of astonishing new developments to come. We'll wait and see. But it's clear, at least, that it'll be easier for the downtown lunch crowd to walk to Calhoun's...

<H3>Wow--A Downtown Addition That Doesn't Destroy Local History</H3>
East Tennessee had never had a comprehensive history museum until January, when the historical society opened the second half of the new East Tennessee History Museum on the first floor of the already-historic Customs House on Market Street. The prize draw this year has been Davy Crockett's actual rifle, Ol' Betsy. 

<H3>Big (Little) Steps</H3>
A grand design for downtown revitalization emerged last winter from a "Big Steps" planning process co-sponsored by the city and the Downtown Organization. But when it came to implementation, not much has happened by year's end.
<P>The grandest of the designs: converting much of the World's Fair Park into an entertainment and shopping Mecca got a big boost from developer Earl Worsham. His $125 million (for starters) plan for attractions patterned loosely after Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen (yes, Denmark) was unveiled with much fanfare in October. But his ability to raise the money, including $9 million requested from the city, has met with skepticism from Mayor Victor Ashe.
<P>A committee of the Downtown Organization that has a city mandate to make recommendations on use of the World's Fair Park was due to meet on Dec. 11, but that meeting got postponed. The committee's chairman, James Haslam II, has so many other commitments that scheduling is very difficult, according to DTO president Richard Cate. Ditto for convening another DTO committee, co-chaired by Haslam and TVA's Craven Crowell, that's supposed to be making recommendations on another biggie: a new convention center.
<P>The DTO-appointed "champions" of two other Big Steps projects also confess they've been too busy to spend much time on them.  Developer Kristopher Kendrick is charged with spearheading the renovation of the landmark Sterchi Building on Gay Street as a condominium complex to foster downtown residential growth. But he's been fully engaged converting the Emporium Building at Gay and Jackson into a decorative arts center and the former Blakely Hotel (now the St. Oliver on Market Square) into a stylish set of apartment/hotel suites.
<P>Similarly, Andrew Nelson of Cyberflix has been too busy promoting the wares of the one high tech venture already domiciled on Market Square to figure out how to convert the entire square into a cyber enterprise zone. It could just be that sticking to one's own knitting does more for downtown development than weaving master plans.


<H2>State &amp; National Politics</H2>

<H3>Remember Us?</H3>
In June, the ragged-edged state of Tennessee celebrated its 200th birthday with a Nashville bash we heard about only through faint echoes bouncing over the Cumberland Plateau. Like a mutt that doesn't recognize its own mother except as a food source, Tennessee hardly threw a milkbone in the direction of Knoxville, the birthplace of the state, the home of outlaw patriarchs Blount and Sevier, the burg that was this state's first capital, the Philadelphia of Tennessee. February 6, once celebrated as the state's birthday, was unrecognized except by a motley assortment of Tennesseans who stood in the snow on the forgotten Gay Street site of the Constitution's signing, defied the open container law, and offered some sour mash to the spirits of Jackson and Sevier.

<H3>So What Does a Republican Have to do to Lose an Election Around Here, Anyway?</H3>
State legislative races were a little quiet this year, except for the one in Blount County where Democrat Mae Owenby tried to unseat arch-conservative Carl Koella. Races don't come much uglier than this one, which saw Owenby supporters circulating 20-year-old pictures of Koella's beat-up ex-wife filched from a court file and Koella charged with leaving the scene of a bloody, fatal traffic accident after allegedly clipping a motorcycle rider and bouncing him into oncoming traffic. Koella won this one by a whisker after Owenby had already done a victory lap.
<P>Koella/Owenby made "Gentleman Ben" Atchley's race look like a tea party. Becoming Senate Majority Leader didn't guarantee Atchley genteel treatment when challenger John Emison took a run at him in the Republican Primary. Atchley, who gained notoriety last winter with his resolution to post the Ten Commandments wherever two or more of us gather, is still smarting from Emison's rude treatment, which included painting Atchley as a friend of sleazy liquor lobbyists. Emison generated more noise than light and got a swift kick in the butt from Republican voters.

<H3>Don and the Giant Peaches</H3>
Lamar has his Honey, Al has his Tipper, and now Don has his Peaches, proving once and for all that a woman doesn't have to have an adult name to play with the big boys. Peaches Simpkins, a Nashville politico who doesn't let party loyalty stand in the way of ambition, came out swinging in '96, leaving Tennessee Higher Education Commission chief Bryant Millsaps without a job and UT President Joe Johnson in the dog house for refusing to fire Peaches' enemy, Billy Stair. Finally catching on that his deputy was beginning to overshadow his own office, Sundquist cut Simpkins loose a couple of weeks ago to pursue a private health-care business, which she had already been going after despite inconvenient conflict-of-interest regs. Is there a Peaches in our future? Without doubt.

<H3>White Out</H3>
Former Supreme Court justice Penny White made history this summer but not the way she wanted to. White, a Democrat, became the first high-court justice to lose a yes/no vote on whether she should be allowed to stay in office. The Tennessee Conservative Union used a couple of lines of one decision to tar White as an anti-death-penalty liberal and, sensing a chance to rouse the rabble, the Republican establishment signed on, defeating White and giving Gov. Don Sundquist a chance to name his own Supreme Court justice. Feeling their oats, the TCU is now looking over White's replacement, Memphian Janice Holder, and grumbling about her liberal leanings.

<H3>Cast Your Choice: Pick-up Trucks or Flannel Shirts?</H3>
Big Ol' Fred Thompson is guaranteed to become a media darling in '97, as he takes the reigns of the Senate Whitewater investigations from the slimy hands of Al D'Amato. There are rumblings that Thompson is being looked at as a potential GOP candidate for president in the year 2000. That despite the fact that White House Fever still burns bright in the belly of his old pal and fellow Howard Baker protg Lamar Alexander, who is handing out plaid bumper stickers even as you read this. With Al Gore a strong bet as the Dem standard-bearer, the nation could be hearing a lot of Rocky Top--oh, happy prospect.

<H3>Location, Location, Location</H3>
It seemed simple enough: Reorganize TVA to prepare for the free-for-all looming in the electric-utility industry; consolidate the customer-service guys in Chattanooga with 60 employees from Knoxville's development office in a single location. But that location happened to be Nashville. As TVA staffers prepared to hit the road, the spin hit the turbines. Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe hinted of hidden agendas and complained that Knoxville had had its share of TVA reductions. GOP congressmen echoed the mayor, and TVA Chairman Craven Crowell was forced to study the issue further. Earlier this month, a reduced transfer was announced, one that moves only 11 jobs from Knoxville, simultaneously scratching TVA's itch to switch and the mayor's itch to bitch. An MP prognostication: Look for TVA's economic development staff to swell in Music City as it shrinks in K-town.


<H2>Sports</H2>

<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=10 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=45% HSPACE=5 VSPACE=10>
<TR><TD><H2>Our Tears Run Deep Orange...</H2>
In any other year, the Vols' football season would have had us all bragging. We beat 'Bama--not to mention Georgia, Arkansas, and UCLA--and finished the regular season 9-2. But this wasn't any year. It was 1996, the most-hyped Big Orange season in generations. The Vols opened the season as Sports Illustrated's number-one college football team in the world, led by the junior many considered the greatest college quarterback in the world, Peyton Manning, the summer's odds-on favorite for the Heisman. On top of all that, we suddenly had the largest football stadium in the world, to accommodate the crowds that would witness the Vols' triumph. 
<P>Then came the rainy 21st of September, the date of what CBS had touted as "The Game of the Century," when the largest crowd in college football history watched in horror as the Gators snacked on the mighty Vols. Six weeks later, when the Big Orange lost for the first time ever to unranked Memphis (and later struggled to beat perennial bottom-feeder Vanderbilt), the great '96 Vols were beginning to seem like another shaggy-dog story: down to #9 (AP) and #10 (CNN) at season's end, and scorned by the big-daddy Bowl Alliance bowls. The Citrus Bowl is still ahead, but against #11 Northwestern, there seems more to lose than to gain. Manning hasn't decided whether to return for a senior season.
<P>There's always next year. But when we said that last year, it was easier to believe.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Hey--There's More Than One Game In Town!</H3>
The Lady Vols snagged an unprecedented fourth NCAA championship in March and started a new season in November with a young, relatively unseasoned team. But returning is Chamique Holdsclaw, everybody's All-American in her freshman year, so how bad can things be?

<H3>A Ray of Sunshine</H3>
Knoxville Sports Corporation head Gloria Ray, UT's first women's athletics director, snagged plans for Women's Basketball Hall of Fame away from Jackson, thereby spurring talk of K-Town becoming a Mecca for women's sports. And why the heck not? We're good enough for Pat Summitt to call home. June saw the national gymnastic championships, which brought those bendable kids who would be stars to town. Ray, by the way, is well on her way to the role model hall of fame, having finished off a big year by getting named to the KUB board of directors.

<H3>Bigger and Better</H3>
On the cusp of only his third season at the helm of the UT men's basketball team, firebrand coach Kevin O'Neill scored what might be the biggest coup in the program's history by bagging the state's top two prospects, Nashville's Charles "Big Hat" Hathaway and Chattan-ooga's C.J. Black. When added to several other fine new recruits, promising sophomores such as Brandon Wharton, and next year's signing of all-world Memphis point guard Tony Harris, the duo should give a shot in the arm to a program that, under O'Neill's care, has already risen from the doldrums of a five-win season (under previous coach Wade Houston) to an NIT berth last year.

<H2>Business</H2>

<H3>Oh, Lucille...</H3>
East Tennessee's center for live jazz for over a decade, the original restaurant that set off the Old City, and one of the region's finest continental-style restaurants, Lucille's (and its near-identical '80s predecessor, Annie's) was the place many of us took newcomers to give them a lively first impression of the city. The crowds never slackened, and the live music, often featuring pianist Donald Brown, seemed to get only better. But late this October, Lucille's closed for reasons we've heard had little to do with their volume of business. The restaurant allegedly was unable to recover from incurring five-digit fines earlier this year for selling liquor on an expired license. There are rumors about its imminent reopening, but for the moment, we're still waiting.

<H3>Fresh Produce</H3>
The Knox County Regional Farmers' Market, that whipping-post of local politics in '94, is hanging in there. LeeRoy and Tootsie Neely departed the premises in the spring, and the county handed over the lease to a new manager from Chattanooga. Local farmers filled the open-air shed outside the main building with produce all summer, and the place is full of Christmas greenery at year's end. The future? Vendors say they'll let us know in March.

<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=10 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=45% HSPACE=5 VSPACE=10>
<TR><TD><H2>Now That's Swanky!</H2>
<P>Knoxville was a well-known beer-brewing center 90 years ago, and a little company on East Depot proves there's still a head on that tradition. The New Knoxville Brewing Company released its first ales, Swanky and English Mountain, and Old Pal (some named after old Knoxville brews) which earned them local adherents despite the premium price, plus nationwide recognition from several beer-connoisseur clubs. The company's chief brewer, Al Kruzen, is also taking command of the vats at Great Southern Brewery on Gay Street.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Turning Out the Lights</H3>
Since the 1970s, Philips Consumer Electronics has kept their headquarters in a building somewhere in East Knox County; that's what we've heard, anyway; we've never actually been there. (Have you?) In May we started to hear rumors that Philips was planning to move their headquarters even farther away, like maybe to another state. But with sale of its Greeneville plant this month--and the December 20 announcement that its marketing and sales divisions were heading to Atlanta--it seems the rumors have become fact. For a time, the company was developing that elusive quality known as "synergy" with Whittle Communications; Philips wed Whittle in a corporate ceremony in '92, and some Philips executives moved in with Whittle for awhile. Maybe it was Whittle's demise in 1994 that left Philips feeling lonesome.

<H3>Old Orange</H3>
What if you looked around one day and everybody was old? Welcome to the University of Tennessee. That's one of the problems the university is facing over the next two or three years as administrators and senior faculty, hired in the '60s and '70s, reach retirement en masse. President Joe Johnson and Chancellor Bill Snyder are within shouting distance of out, as are such administrative stalwarts as Emerson Fly and Walter Lambert. The only spring chickens, relatively speaking, are Sammie Lynn Puett and Homer Fisher, and there's no heir apparent for Johnson's job. Already stressed by budget cuts and its first-ever layoffs, the university is also having to cope with a decidely unfriendly governor who keeps using them as a bad example of budget-cutting. In '97? More budget woes and--maybe--a change or two at the top.

<H3>Short Half-Lives</H3>
Oak Ridge, for decades the home of gee-whiz scientific advancements, had another marvel to ponder this year: "Gee whiz, the jobs are drying up." Despite the promises of Democrats (VP Al Gore) and Republicans (Third District Rep. Zach Wamp), Department of Energy jobs in the Atomic City continue to wither. With all the fat long gone, DOE contractors began cutting into flesh in '96, with 1,600 to 2,000 workers leaving without benefit of attrition. And '97 holds more of the same; DOE offices themselves are likely to face the next round of cuts. Will the last one out please turn off the Chamber of Commerce?

<H2>Trials and Tribulations</H2>

<H3>Taylored</H3>
The demise of the late financier Joe Taylor figures to leave close to 200 East Tennesseans out much of the estimated $60 million they put into his Ponzi scheme. (The current guess is 50 cents on the dollar.) But their misfortune is the opposite of same for the scads of lawyers involved in Taylor's bankruptcy proceeding. Legal fees could run as high as a million dollars, and the bankruptcy trustee, William Hendon, could collect close to another million for his services.

<H3>Inner City Burning</H3>
It's been almost a year since the Inner City Church was torched by arsonists on a snowy night last January. But neither the FBI nor any of the other law enforcement agencies involved have been able to finger the perpetrators. Their inability to do so leaves the community tarred by racism's ugly brush, even though scarcely anyone involved believes the church burning was really racially motivated. Just as bad, or worse, it leaves a cloud of suspicion overhanging the church's ministerial Upton brothers whom the FBI hasn't seen fit to clear after initially branding the arson as an "inside job." That cloud, along with numerous death threats, has lamentably caused one of the city's most dynamic black leaders, Jerry Upton, to go into somewhat of a shell.

<H3>Sequoyah Stink</H3>
Sometime last summer, Sequoyah Hillsbillies were startled to see heavy machinery rumbling into the neighborhood like Soviet tanks; lined up like stockpiles of missiles, enormous pipes materialized in Sequoyah Park; a grassy riverside meadow turned into a large fenced-off industrial compound; several roads from the Boulevard to Kenesaw turned into war-zone rubble. Sequoyah Hills was, finally, getting new sewers. For years, Knoxville's Old Money has been content with Knoxville's oldest sewers, but they were unable to stop the march of sanitary progress. The neighborhood's Roman Empire-style sewer system, which dates back to the 1920s and mixes raw sewage with stormdrain runoff, is being replaced. Sequoyah Hills has always been a labyrinth for visitors; now, as rubbly streets are opened and closed to traffic, it's a maze that changes every day, like the New York Times crossword. It'll be several months before it's all done. Now might be a swell time to buy. 

<H3>Gangs Kill</H3>
Gang wars caught everyone's attention this summer when a 5-year-old Lonsdale girl, Brittney Daniels, was murdered by an Eastside bullet meant for a Westside teen. A few weeks later, a young man minding his own business near Five Points was gunned down by an unknown shooter on a nearby roof. The violence seeped westward into a club on the Cumberland Avenue Strip, and beyond, as another young African-American man was killed in the parking lot of a Cedar Bluff hotel.

<H3>A Difficult Trial</H3>
Of all the criminal proceedings that caught our attention this year, none was more poignant than the Delaware trial of Knoxville restaurateur Mike Chase, whose toddler son Mikey died in '95 after being left in a hot car. Chase, indicted for criminal negligence, stood trial and was acquitted after the jury deliberated about a New York minute. Afterward, several jury members would denounce the prosecution.

<H3>Back to the Zoo</H3>
Knoxville's first serial trial ground on, with accused Thomas "Zoo Man" Huskey getting convicted early in the year of a gaggle of rape charges. Still to come is a quadruple murder trial, where he (and perhaps a couple of his multiple personalities) faces the death penalty if convicted of strangling working women he (they) picked up off the streets of East Knoxville.

<H3>Unplanned Problems</H3>
Six months after Metro Pulse's examination of the financial straits of Planned Parenthood of East Tennessee, the agency is operating in the black. Taking a cue from the corporate sector, Planned Parenthood adopted a less-is-more philosophy toward doing business, eliminating three positions (one in Oak Ridge, two in its Chattanooga offices), consolidating two Oak Ridge offices into one, and trimming back operating expenses wherever possible. That the community responded to Planned Parenthood's monetary dilemma with generous donations hasn't hurt their plight, either. "The community really responded to our needs, and we appreciate their continuing support," says PPET executive director Debbie Blair. "I'm happy to say that we're now operating in the black, and meeting our expenses."

<H2>Media</H2>

<H3>We're a Hit!</H3>
Why Knoxville? Still unable to project a viable national identity, Knoxville keeps getting referenced in the national media as America's All-Purpose Municipal Buffoon. Inspired by an outdated World's Fair tour book, Bart Simpson barrels into town with his pals in an episode of The Simpsons. The bully Nelson, disgusted to find the World's Fair was over and the glorious Sunsphere is now only a wig outlet (in the cartoon only, we understand), hurls a rock at the rusting icon--which teeters, falls, and smashes the boys' car. Misadventures with slow-witted rednecks follow. Other references in a +, skit this fall, in the New Yorker (an exploding pen intended for Bob Dole does in the mayor of Knoxville) and in Harper's (an excerpt from a Film Comment comment that Independence Day "President" Bill Pullman "looks like he might make a good junior vice president at the southside Wal-Mart in Knoxville, Tennessee") have us scratching our lice-bitten heads.

The computer-game company known as Cyberflix, heady with national praise for its 1995 interactive CD-ROM western, Dust, released Titanic--a game that's an amazing interactive mystery that doubles as an eerie self-guided tour of the Titanic on its last evening. The release of this long-awaited project came at a serendipitous moment, just after the aborted raising of the Titanic's hull and simultaneous with a smarmy TV melodrama about the big tub starring George C. Scott. Cyberflix has sold close to 30,000 copies since November, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The game is, at this writing, sold out in many stores nationwide, a potentially embarrassing predicament for the pale geniuses of Market Square.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Frankly, My Dear...</H3>
The News-Sentinel got a new managing editor for Christmas last year. Frank Cagle, who has been with the paper since the mid-'80s, quickly put his own stamp on the N-S's most powerful job. Contrary to at least a half-century of tradition, Cagle became the first N-S managing editor to write a weekly political column, and his idiosyncratic conservatism quickly won a following on Capitol Hill, which is only slightly more isolated than the N-S newsroom. The targets of his punditry were House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh (Cagle tried to raise funds for an obscure woman who challenged the speaker for his West Tennessee seat), environmentalism, and the goodies the Democratic Legislature withholds from Republican East Tennessee. Granted an exclusive look at Cagle's obsessions for '97, Metro Pulse advises you to read the following 52 times real fast: East Tennessee is being cheated; environmentalists are wackos; Jimmy Naifeh is the anti-Christ. There--you won't have to buy a Saturday Sentinel all next year.

<H3>We Want Our Bob-TV</H3>
Arguably the funniest man in Knoxville TV history since Cas Walker, Bob Deck was sick of being called "the David Letterman of Knoxville," so he left Knoxville's struggling cable project TNi to become "the David Letterman of Nashville." But his arrival at That Guitar City unhappily coincided with a coup at the station, which canceled his show before it ever aired. He returned to Knoxville, his home since he was a cook at Piccolo's in the early '80s, and is now doing private TV production work. We've seen him lately; his face is still as stubbly, his wit's still as sharp. We say, "What the Heck--Bring Back Bob Deck!"

<H3>TV News Boldly Marches On</H3>
Lots of changes happened out in TV land, where all three stations saw top-down shake-ups, with Channels 6 (WATE) and 10 (WBIR) getting new news directors, both women. Channel 10's Marti Skold left for the warmer climes of Miami, Florida, while Margie Ison returned to the air and is telling us which way the wind blows on Channel 6. And at year's end, Channel 8 (WKXT) is preparing to launch a whole new look, vowing to beef up its staff and become competitive. 

<H3>And They Said It Couldn't Be Done</H3>
Well, the competition did, anyway. But despite their cruel cynicism, Metro Pulse hit its fifth anniversary in August, stronger than ever. From its humble beginnings as a bi-weekly entertainment rag to its current position as a weekly community voice, Metro Pulse has managed to wedge itself into the currents of Knoxville life. Celebrating its anniversary with a bash at the Knoxville Museum of Art's "Alive After Five" (ah, such sweet irony!), the party set a KMA attendance record with over 800 people showing up. (Now, if only they had brought birthday presents...) 

<H3>A Full Life</H3>
Carolyn Jourdan, a UT-educated engineer and graduate of UT Law School, finished up the project she started after shucking her job as counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Environment five years ago. Her film, Half Lives, aired on local public television October 10 after showing in other cities related to its subject: nuclear waste and the Manhattan Project. Response here leaned toward the same gushing praise she received in national press and television. The film will receive a national PBS broadcast next year (check your MP calendar for dates). In the meantime, the ad-hoc fund raiser, director, and producer is dodging pitches from Hollywood and elsewhere, wondering just what she's got herself into.

<H3>Music Scene Roundup</H3>

<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=10 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=45% HSPACE=5 VSPACE=10>
<TR><TD><H2>See Live Tourists!</H2>
It's beginning to look a lot like Branson (Mo., that is) over in Sevier County, as East Tennessee's own tourist Mecca has been adding a slew of new music theaters to its already-imposing line-up of theme parks, outlet malls, and putt-putt golf courses (oh yeah, they've got the Great Smoky Mountains National Park tucked away over there somewhere, too).
<P>Metro Pulse reported earlier this year about the development of such new music-related projects as the J.D. Sumner-linked Southern Gospel Hall of Fame and cafe that will go along with the theaters already in existence there (T.G. Sheppard, Lee Greenwood, et al). Since that time, the county has seen a few new announcements and several shake-ups. Crooner B.J. Thomas was tapped for, then booted out of, the existing Rainbow Music Theater, and construction of his own concert hall is apparently now somewhat in doubt. Meanwhile, Sheppard is abandoning his great glass temple in Pigeon Forge for the Eagle Mountain Theater (which currently features Con Hunley and The Four Guys). As for the new stuff, country band Alabama has opened its Alabama Grill, a Hard Rock Cafe for country music, while songstress Louise Mandrell has announced that her new theater will hit Music Row sometime in '97. Up the Parkway toward Sevierville, another as-yet-unnamed act will occupy a new theater in the multi-million dollar Governor's Crossing development.
<P>But the news that really has folks in Sevier waiting with baited (pardon the pun) breath is the impending announcement from Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society as to where they will locate their massive new theme park and headquarters. Sevier County is one of only three sites left in the running (Daytona Beach and Birmingham are the other two), having survived several "cuts" in a selection process that began with more than 70 cities a year-and-a-half ago. Although B.A.S.S. corporate heads have belabored the announcement long past their original self-imposed deadline, local officials privately believe they may have landed the big one.</TD></TR></TABLE>

The middle ground in local music narrowed considerably this year: while a fistful of local bands found the kind of success this town hasn't seen since the Everly Brothers, the Koxville scene limps into the new year with more than a few bruises.
<P>The big news, of course, was Superdrag. Their much-anticipated Elektra Records debut, Regretfully Yours, came out to a flurry of critical praise (including earning an "A" from Entertainment Weekly), and their first single, "Sucked Out," hit the Billboard charts and was sucked dry by MTV, which aired the accompanying video religiously all summer. Meanwhile, the band toured relentlessly and stared out at us from the pages of every cool music magazine. The V-roys hitched up with country-rock vet Steve Earle and released a killer disc of kinda-sorta-mostly country tunes, Just Add Ice, on Earle's e-squared records. They, too, hit the road, opening for Earle in the U.K. and burning their way across the states alone. And RB Morris finally got around to doing what most people thought should've happened years ago when he linked up with John Prine's Oh Boy! Records. Expect the results early next year.
<P>Well-dressed punk boys Thumbnail found their way onto the roster of Cargo/Headhunter Records, who re-released the band's self-titled record. (Look for the brand-new Red! Dead! in the coming weeks.) Pop-punk maestro Mike Smithers finally found a permanent rhythm section for 30 Amp Fuse, who signed with Dedicated Records and recorded a full-length sizzler with Stephen Egerton and Bill Stevenson of Descendents fame. Songs by slaphappy pop-punksters Torture Kitty showed up on an assortment of national compilations, the Prime Sports Network, and their own House O' Pain Records-released EP. A CD by former members of Evan's Dilemma--now in an outfit called My Friend Stephanie--showed up in Christian bookstores.
<P>Things weren't so bright for Fort Records. Guy-on-the-scene Mark Murdock had no sooner announced the formation of his fledgling indie label when two of the participating bands--Stinkfoot USA and the Family Jewels--broke up in the same week. Only Leaf remained, and by the end of autumn, they too had shriveled up and blown away.
<P>Meanwhile, scene vets HyperTribe moved to Los Angeles and changed their name to Movement, Smokebomb bombed, Numskull cracked, Wateva foundered, and a whole flock of musicians (including John Paul Keith, Rick Tiller of Leaf, the Doubters Club--and drummer Dave Jenkins' Disgraceland Studios, and Eric Otto of the Scenesters) migrated to Nashville. Thankfully, the Holy Ghosts, Beeswax, an overhauled Dynamo Humm, Ragazzi, the Satellite Pumps, Kissing Virus, Autonomy Vs. Shame, and others proved to be vital new additions to the Knoxville scene.
<P>Or, we should say, what was left of the Knoxville scene after venues Lucille's, Amigo's, Manhattan's (which later re-opened under new ownership), the Library, the Living Room, the Electric Ballroom, and cooly store Landspeed Records closed. On the Strip, newcomers Dante's, McGhee's Irish Pub, and Rudy's tried to absorb some of the loss, while Old City reggae nightspot Bullfrog's became The Frog and expanded its format. And on Painter Avenue, an unassuming abode--which came to be known as the Autonomy House--offered a much-welcome haven for punk/emo fans of all ages.
<P>So what will the new year hold for live local music, especially now that Mercury Theatre has been slapped by neighbors with a lawsuit bearing a variety of nuisance charges, and Sassy Ann's is threatened by possible interstate expansion? Why do clubs continue to fail even as the music continues to thrive? Hopefully, instead of just bitching and moaning about it (and/or giving up and jumping ship), someone is quietly brewing a grand scheme for jump-starting the sluggish state of venues. (What's the clich about dark clouds and silver linings?) Otherwise, Knoxville might just be in for one of the deepest cyclical downswings in local music history.

<H3>Dance Hall Daze</H3>
One thing became adamantly clear over the past 12 months: Knoxville is a dancing machine. Not only did live music fans lose the Electric Ballroom to the boogie-down crowd, a whole slew of new nightspots cropped up, including the Sound Factory, Ivana's (formerly Trump's), and Neon Nites. Line-dancing became a showdown, with neighboring country mega-clubs Cotton-Eyed Joe and the new challengers at Gunner's facing off for the hearts of the boot-scootin' masses. Accusations and shady stories rocked both sides, but Gunner's finally waved the white flag and closed their doors in November. Plans call for the club to re-open with a Top 40 format, but sources report that this is not quite as certain as the daily paper has reported. Meanwhile, count Cotton-Eyed Joe among the walking wounded. Strange and often unpleasant rumors continue to swirl around the club, as its management has been under investigation for money-related shenanigans.

<H3>Freedom May Not Reign, But The Zombies Are Alive And Well</H3>
A scheduled Freedom Hall concert by Top 40 industrial-metal-camp-mirth makers White Zombie was axed in February by the Johnson City City Commission after JC residents decried the band's alleged ties to Satanism. The town immediately became the whipping boy for several national media outlets, with MTV news jock Kurt Loder describing the venue as having the "apparently ironic name of Freedom Hall." Meanwhile, the Johnson City Press quoted town Vice-Mayor Bob May as saying, "I don't care if it's the First Amendment. [White Zombie's music] is a disgrace." For their part, the band simply moved the event to Viking Hall in Bristol.

<H3>Coming Together</H3>
The Jazz Exchange Organization--sponsor of both the Jazz in the Park series and the educational Jazz in the Schools program--finally found a permanent home (after existing for years in Ella Rogers' living room) with the opening of the Jazz Exchange Center at the Moses Center. The Music Association of Knoxville returned after a lengthy slumber, promoting its 1996 BMI Showcase--which turned out to be a bigger success than anyone expected, electing new board members, and then growing mysteriously quiet again. And the Knoxville Blues Society came about as an effort to increase the recognition of the blues greats (Brownie and Stick McGhee, Ida Cox) who've hailed from our fair city, as well as new musicians. Unfortunately, a damper was put on the society's progress when co-founder Lynn Stinnett's niche record store the Blues Depot closed.

<H3>Grand Entertainment</H3>
Ashley Capps'  AC Entertainment, the little music promoters who could, bit off a big piece of pizza pie when they took over the management of the air-conditioned jazz-age Arabian fairyland known as the Tennessee Theatre just as country-music megastation WIVK donated the shrine to the Historic Tennessee Theatre Foundation. It's a natural move for a group known for bringing big-name acts to venues we know they'd skip if they had any sense. But when they announced they were going to show old movies--well, we worried about those boys. The last folks who tried something similar went broke trying, and the years since have only more and more old movies on cable and VCR, more reason for six-year-old kids to say, "Daddy, I've already seen Breakfast at Tiffany's." But with more of an eye for Glamour and Flash than previous efforts have mustered, Ashley's Folly seems to be calling its own bluff, pulling in packed houses to see movies we've all seen before, just to be there. Hanging over old Gay Street just like some electrified legible papal balcony, the Tennessee's marquee keeps reminding us that the Tennessee Theatre is Knoxville's Grand Entertainment Palace, and, damnit, it is. 

<H3>Raucous Bacchus</H3>
Local modern rock station 94.3-WNFZ exhibited a commendable desire to push the envelope of commercial radio by hiring former WUTK Wednesday night shock jock Col. Bacchus to man the mike during their evening post-drive-time slot. Bringing with him some of the same shrill antics and loopy soundbites that made him a minor legend at UTK (not to mention the occasional format-flouting song selection), the good colonel has quickly established himself as one of the most exciting DJ's in town.
<P>The station also deserves extra kudos for slipping some local music in with all the standard modern rock fare; besides putting the latest Superdrag single "Destination: Ursa Major" in heavy rotation, the 94.3 crew have regularly spun tunes from the Doubters Club, the Opposable Thumbs, and the nationally-released-but-not-quite-part-of-the-commercial-alternative-format V-roys.

<H3>Still a Golden Boy</H3>
It was the worst of times, then the best of times for former Olympic swimmer Melvin Stewart this year. The former UT pool jock lost a chance for what could have been his second gold medal when he was upset by two upstarts in the Olympic trials this year.
<P>But within days of his come-uppance, Stewart received a call from ABC-ESPN, which has since tapped the adopted Knoxvillian as the youngest sports correspondent on national television. Stewart, who told Metro Pulse that acting and broadcasting have always been part of his larger plan, also co-wrote, co-produced, and co-starred in Jesse's Girl, a local independent film about two mismatched roommates. He's currently shopping the film to studios for possible video release.

<H3>Joint Adventures</H3>
 Nearly two years after completion, the film that tied up Fort Sanders traffic and nearly all of Knoxville's actors for a month, Joint Adventure, is still for sale. Producer Michael McDermott does say that a Houston distributor (Warwick Films) is extremely interested, though. Jaded Los Angeleno that he is, McDermott says he'll believe it when he sees it, but Warwick seems sincere and has been involved in pre-purchase preliminaries for over two months. What got the distributor's attention? Nothing less than the "Best Comedy" award that the film snagged at the Houston Film Festival in April. Keep an eye peeled for the filmmakers' next project--Saturdays and Sundays, featuring names you'll recognize from sources other than your high school yearbook, like Charlton Heston and Ben Stiller. 
<P>Meanwhile, our other shot at movie fame, Tom DiCillo's Box of Moonlight, has yet to peak out from behind the clouds. Although producers vowed to enter it in this year's major film festivals, not a mention of the film has made it into print or onto the Internet. 

<H3>Lolla Land</H3>
After years of rumors and deals-that-got-away, East Tennessee finally hosted Lollapalooza, the traveling alternative music festival and carnival of subcultures founded by former Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell. This year's rock-intensive show (featuring such heavies as Metallica, Soundgarden, and Rage Against the Machine) was staged in Newport, of all places. While a few local residents protested the influx of heathen "alternative lifestyles" into Cocke County--the pot-growing, 'shine-making capital of Tennessee--the July show was nevertheless fairly well-attended and went off without a major hitch.

<H2>Environment</H2>

<H3>Wetlands Controversies</H3>
TVA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation fielded questions and comments  on Dec. 10 to help them decide whether they should issue a wetland development permit to a local limited partnership. Turkey Creek Land Partners and Farragut Land Partners hope to develop a long idle 360-acre former farm adjacent to Lovell Road. And the city and county want to build a road across the wetland to relieve congestion on Kingston Pike and I-40. The developers and citizens have been hashing it out for over a year now, and public officials who once had no idea what a wetland is have been treated to a crash course from local and visiting experts. Look for decisions from the permitting agencies late in January. 

<H3>The Smoky Future of the Smokies</H3>
Environmentalists had the opportunity to view Governor Don Sundquist from just about every angle this year. Early on, his office issued a "Memorandum of Understanding" with business interests promising relaxed regulations for new and expanding polluters. Naturally, the citizenry jumped on him like he was the neighbor's trampoline. Since then, we've seen him play hardnose with Champion over the Pigeon River and make gestures in support of the new and improved EPA regs. What next? He's probably home hugging his Christmas tree right now.  

<H3>Fighting the Champ</H3>
It was another weary year of fighting Champion International for those weary defenders of the Pigeon River. The good news is public opinion, which of late has been rather moribund toward the reeking river, appears to have taken a strong turn against the polluters at the North Carolina papermaker. The bad news is that the EPA is ready to approve a new, Champion-friendly discharge permit.

<H2>Art Central</H2>

<H3>It's Been a Colorful Year</H3>
In September, Bennett Galleries hopped across Kingston Pike to turn the former Capri Theater into a 20,000 square foot behemoth of an art boutique. While there was justified skepticism beforehand--does Knoxville need, want, have the ability to support the "largest art gallery of its kind in the Southeast?"--it's been a success on all fronts. Decorators and chronic re-decorators are swooning over the cascades of swanky home accessories, and the fine art space (the dominion of one visionary Marga Hayes Ingram) is top notch, as has been the work with which they've graced it.
<P>Knoxville artist Andrew Saftel (recently relocated to new studio and digs in the Sequatchie Valley) received a commission to participate in the Atlanta airport's "Airport Art" program. He installed his large and luscious "We Can Go," a montage of his signature style just-this-side-of-abstract paintings seen through large minimalistic sculpture, in mid-June. Now everyone who goes (or comes) through Atlanta's international concourse is treated to the talent we've been happy to take for granted. 
<P>And speaking of significant commissions, discriminating readers all over the world have been toasting Knoxville glass artist Richard Jolley. He executed a handsome vessel in his signature style that readers of Atlantic Monthly, American Photographer, Audubon, Wine Spectator and a zillion other glossy mags have encountered as "The Bombay Sapphire Martini, As Interpreted By Richard Jolley." Next month the artist will have the opportunity to re-interpret said martini if necessary--Carillon Importers, distributors of Bombay products, will host a special martini reception in honor of the opening of his three-month long show at the Mint Museum, in Charlotte, N.C. (And if you need a special excuse to purchase a gentleman's magazine, the ad featuring Jolley's glass is in the January issue of Playboy.)
<P>The Knoxville Museum of Art made it to the light at the end of a two-year-long tunnel of evaluation, study, and downright hard work in December when it received accreditation from the American Association of Museums. Accreditation means that AAM acknowledges KMA's high professional standards and quality programming. (Tell us something we didn't know.) It also greases the wheels of the arduous borrowing process when KMA goes after blockbuster shows like the Red Grooms exhibition that opens next summer. 

<H2>Farewells</H2>

Photographer Jan Lynch passed away early on the morning of November 5 after a prolonged bout with AIDS. Lynch was known internationally for his titillating nudes and erotic imagery. Closer to home, however, he captured the local gay lifestyle on film, with all of its wonders and warts, and passed it along for insiders and outsiders to share. With a quiet wit and caring eye, he played diplomat between cultures that otherwise probably never would have known where to start. 
<P>Cry, cry, darlin'. The Father of Bluegrass, Mr. Bill Monroe, bowed out on September 9, just shy of 85 years old. With a hand for a hammer and a mandolin for an anvil, Monroe forged a style of music that would come to reflect and represent East Tennessee and the rest of Appalachia. Since he passed, the Blue Moon of Kentucky has never been more blue. But how can you really miss somebody who not only left behind three barns full of beautiful music, but also taught hundreds of others how to play it? 
<P>He left town about 60 years ago, but we still count him as our own. Legendary bluesman Brownie McGhee was born in Knoxville in 1915 and grew up here and elsewhere in East Tennessee, singing and playing his homemade guitar in the streets. He went on to an amazingly diverse career as a sideman for the likes of Woody Guthrie and Paul Robeson, promoter for the American folk music revival in Europe, half of a unique country-blues duo (with Sonny Terry) and movie star with work ranging from Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd to Steve Martin's The Jerk. He was also a fine guitarist and songwriter. It was a Brownie McGhee song, "Robie-Dobie Boogie," that in 1948 inspired a reviewer to write, "it rocks, it rolls," thus giving a new genre of music a name. He died in February in Los Angeles.
<P>They called her the Belle of Bethel when she was institutionalized at that New York asylum. Rose Williams, the emotionally troubled older sister of playwright Tennessee Williams, had a hard time getting along with her St. Louis family and spent much of the '20s and '30s seeking refuge with her Knoxville aunts. Feted at Cherokee Country Club, she was a Knoxville debutante in the '20s. But even eccentric Aunt Ella and sensible Aunt Belle couldn't work wonders on schizophrenia. Rose Williams was institutionalized, and one of the early victims of an exciting new surgical procedure called lobotomy. Rose Williams and her horrors inspired several of her brother's best-known works, especially The Glass Menagerie and Suddenly Last Summer. A trust left by her brother kept Rose in luxurious comfort during her last years. She suffered delusions that she was a member of the Royal Family and reportedly kept a framed portrait of General Hospital's Robert Scorpio on her wall, but some who knew her insist that her later years were, against all odds, happy. She died in New York in September.
<P>Educator Dick Yoakley, as good a friend as Knox County's kids ever had, died this year after a short, futile battle against a ferocious cancer. Yoakley, who was supervisor of the Department of Pupil Personnel, had the loaves-and-fishes job of stretching too-few resources to serve too many special needs kids. The Center for Alternative Learning, which he helped found, was renamed the Richard Yoakley School in his memory.
<P>Delmar Dennis lived the last half of his life in Sevier County, where he made a living as a printer. This quiet, ordained preacher with a predilection for right-wing politics (he ran for President once, and was a long-time member of the John Birch Society), was an unwilling hero of our times. Dennis, who grew up in Mississippi, spent his youth as a member of the Klan; repented as a young man, and earned the undying enmity of many fellow Mississippians by turning informant. He was instrumental in solving the case of the three murdered civil rights workers whose bodies were buried in an earthen dam; he saved Martin Luther King Jr.'s life by getting word to the authorities of a bomb planted under a bridge along the route of a freedom march, and finally, his testimony was the crucial link in cracking the 30-year-long unsolved murder of Medgar Evers and puttering the doddering racist Byron de la Beckwith behind bars. Not a bad resume.

<STRONG>But the honor is dubious as Tennessee takes first place in personal bankruptcy petitions</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Val Pendergrast</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>"CONGRATULATIONS!!! Due to your outstanding credit rating, you have been selected to receive our pre-approved SKR credit card at an all-time low rate of 19.23 APR!" 
<P>They arrive unsolicited, like angels of mercy. But what begins as a serendipitous occasion can easily mutate into a nightmare on Elm Street. Some 5 billion credit-card solicitations were mailed to consumers between 1994 and 1995--an average of 32 per each American age 18 to 64. Less sophisticated spenders frequently assume that if a financial institution deems them a good credit risk, then they must be. Little wonder then that the credit card delinquency rate has hit a 20-year high as consumers have sounded the charge to charge. 
<P>"People are kind of sucked into it," Knoxville attorney 
<P>Beverly Sharpe says. "They should have more sense, but most of us don't. If someone says, 'You can buy this and we'll help you,' most of us will do it." 
<P>Sharpe, who estimates that a full 25 percent of her business is derived from handling bankruptcy petitions or financial counseling, says that a "Madison Avenue" mindset combined with easy access to credit can quickly set the stage for financial disaster. 
<P>The seduction of easy credit has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of personal bankruptcy petitions as more than 266,000 individuals filed in the first quarter of 1996. In East Tennessee alone, 3,450 people filed personal bankruptcy in the same time frame. In fact, more bankruptcy petitions per capita are filed in Tennessee  than in any other state. Bankruptcy has become an epidemic, and there doesn't seem to be a cure. 
<P>Sitting amid a sea of paperwork, US bankruptcy trustee Patricia Foster says she expects more than 14,000 petitions to be filed this year in East Tennessee--compared to last year's total of 11,000. 
<P>With Tennessee's bankruptcy rules and regulations among the most restrictive of all 50 states, why does Tennessee lead the nation in personal bankruptcies? 
<P>"That's the debate of the day," says Foster. "We all ask that question." 
<P>Personally, Foster attributes the increase in bankruptcies to a combination of factors, not the least of which is the proverbial "keeping up with the Joneses."
<P>"People want to give the appearance of success. They want to wear the nicest clothes, have a nice home, nice furniture. They think they have to have a big screen TV because people around them do. You'd be surprised how many of these people (bankruptcy petitioners) have big screen TVs and cellular phones," she says, shaking her head. "What I hate most of all is when they put in their budget that they have to have $200 to $300 for their cigarettes. I just hate that."
<P>A variety of factors weigh in as possible culprits to Tennessee's bankruptcy boom: the lure of easy credit, catastrophic illness or medication not covered by TennCare or other insurance, and advertising that encourages bankruptcy as a solution to financial crisis. 
<P>"I think a lot of the advertising has hurt," Foster says. "It makes bankruptcy seem attractive. It looks like an easy solution." 

<H3>The Nightmare Begins</H3>

"I guess what started it was when I got credit cards," Jennifer says ruefully. The 37-year-old office manager confides that credit cards, medical bills, and job loss all played a part in her decision to file bankruptcy earlier this year. 
<P>"They were so easy to get and I was making enough money that they were begging me to get the cards. So I got them and swore to myself that I wouldn't abuse them." 
<P>Then, a year ago, she was fired from her job. Desperate for work, she accepted a job with no health benefits.
<P>"I took a job and I knew that there was no insurance, but it was a job," she says. When illness struck, she quickly racked up $20,000 in uninsured medical bills that, when added to her mortgage payments and credit card bills, became unmanageable. When she fell behind in her payments, the collection calls began. More than any other factor, the constant harassment made her life a living hell. 
<P>"These people are evil," Jennifer says of the collectors. "They will call you at work, which is against the law. But they will call, threaten to come and get you, humiliate you on the job. They'll call you at home at 11 o'clock at night and terrify you. And it leads to a state of panic."
<P>Foster says some of the petitioners she sees have filed specifically to escape collector harassment. "In 15 percent of the cases, the person is totally judgment-proof (they have no assets that can be seized to satisfy creditors), but they can't take any more phone calls." 
<P>Bankruptcy specialist Richard Mayer says increasingly aggressive collection efforts, especially for medical bills and student loans, put a huge amount of stress on delinquent payers. "In Tennessee, collectors are working hard to collect. They're quicker to sue in court, which results in garnishment," he says. And garnishment, Mayer says, is cause for dismissal. "You can be fired if you're not protected by Chapter 13." 
<P>Sharpe, Mayer, and Foster say that most people delay filing until they're past the point of no return and the stress becomes unbearable. "They keep hoping they won't have to do it," Sharpe says. 
<P>Jennifer toyed with the idea of filing bankruptcy for months before she made a move. Sitting at home one evening pondering what to do, she called a number from an advertisement. The ad, she says, was attractive and "made it seem so simple." Still unsure, she made an appointment to discuss the possibilities. Within days, the ball was rolling and she was knee-deep in Chapter 7. 
<P>"It's an assembly line," she says of the bankruptcy process. Now, five months after choosing to file, she regrets her decision. Last week, a real estate agent appeared and planted a "For Sale" sign in her yard and demanded a key for a lock box. When she balked, her bankruptcy trustee told her in no uncertain terms that if she could sell her house, she must. That, Jennifer says, was devastating.
<P>The irony is that the primary reason she filed bankruptcy was to protect her home. "I would have endured the torture of the calls and the letters," she says emphatically. "I never would have filed if I thought I'd lose my house." 

<H3>The Curse of Credit</H3>

"If credit were not so available, people wouldn't live beyond their means. They couldn't," Foster says. "They'd go back to eating beans and cornbread and mashed potatoes." 
<P>Mike Clark, director of education at the Credit Counseling Service, says credit cards are the ruin of the people he sees daily. The Counseling Service attempts to assist individuals in negotiating payment plans with creditors and is often the last stop before bankruptcy.  
<P>"The biggest reason people come in here, the biggest reason people get into debt, is that they've abused their credit cards," Clark says. "People have too many credit cards. If you've got more than two credit cards, you've got too many." Foster sees as many as 20 or 30 credit cards listed on individual bankruptcy petitions. "We have people that owe $75,000 to $100,000 on credit cards. And these people are making $35,000 a year," she says incredulously. "You can't live like that!"
<P>Carey Brown, manager of retail banking for First Tennessee bank of Knoxville, says maintaining a good credit rating in the face of the bombardment of credit card offers requires more restraint than many spenders can muster.
<P>"The proliferation of credit card offers is a real challenge to the consumer because keeping his credit record good when he has more than one or two credit cards can be difficult," Brown says. 
<P>Brown denies the notion that sucking consumers into debt is a sinister plot designed to enable banks and other lending institutions to capitalize on human weaknesses. 
<P>"I personally don't think the financial industry has an ulterior motive. We all have an interest in keeping customers' credit within reason," he says. 
<P>Foster is not as generous. "It's not a conspiracy, but it almost seems that way," she says of lending industry practices. She has little sympathy for credit card companies who take big hits when their deadbeat customers file Chapter 7. "They make big bucks off of interest. I don't think they're hurting." The recent trend of charging people who don't maintain an outstanding balance rankles her as well. "That offends me," she says. "I have no sympathy at all for credit card companies." 
<P>Nor is she sympathetic to the cash-advance organizations propelled by greed who prey on those on the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder. "Pawn shops and things like that are not considered to be banks," Foster says, "so they can charge 300 percent interest. There are no usury laws that protect the consumer on those issues. But this check-advance thing is just really, really horrible." Recently a man who operates a cash-advance operation called her to complain that a customer had filed bankruptcy and he was unable to collect. "I told him, 'I want you to come tell your story to the judge.'" Foster added sarcastically, "I'm sure he'll be real sympathetic." 
<P>The way it works, Foster says, is that an individual takes his or her check for, say, $240 to the cash-advance place, post-dates the check for two weeks, and receives $200. Then, two weeks later when the check is scheduled to clear, they don't have the money in the bank. So they run down the street and use yet another cash-advance place.  "Pretty soon they've got a voluminous amount of these things that look like bad checks," Foster says. "We figured it's like (charging) 1,000 percent interest."
<P>"It is an absolute scam," she says. "These people are so unsuspecting and some of them so unsophisticated that they really don't know any better. I wish the legislature would do something about it."

<H3>The Downfall of America</H3>

"I think credit cards are America's downfall," says Karen, a 37-year-old former factory worker. "I'm totally against them. I will never have another credit card," she vows. 
<P>Credit card abuse was a major factor in Karen's decision to file bankruptcy. "My biggest mistake was at Christmas," she confesses. Using her cards for unexpected expenses and gift-giving, her debt grew like waxy buildup on a kitchen floor--slowly over a long period of time. Maxed out on four or five cards to the tune of $10,000, she continued making payments until illness and job loss contributed to her decision to file Chapter 7 this summer. Though covered by medical insurance, her recovery from surgery took three months--twice as long as her doctors estimated--and her employers let her go. 
<P>Initially, Karen viewed bankruptcy as a necessary evil. "It bothered me psychologically," she says. "I felt like I was shunning my responsibilities." But today she sees her decision in a more positive light. "A lot of people have one great fall in their life. Bankruptcy is mine. But I've learned from that lesson. I'm starting my life over again."
<P>A fresh start is what most petitioners hope to gain by filing bankruptcy. That's what it should be, Foster says. "It should be for emergencies, for a fresh start." But abusers always exist. "You can work the system if you're smart," she says. Her job as administrator is to ferret out the bad apples. "We make sure that debtors are being honest and keep up with the numbers to be sure they're not embezzling money." When she finds criminal activity, she refers the case to the US Attorney's office for prosecution. 
<P>The consequences of "honest" bankruptcies are severe. But for those who see no other way out, the benefits outweigh the risk. 

<H3>The Price You Pay</H3>

The aftermath of bankruptcy--the proverbial free ride in some instances--is no pleasure cruise. Though credit is available under certain circumstances, those who have filed are subject to outrageous interest rates or outright rejection. A car loan, for example, is subject to interest rates of as much as 22 percent, while loans extended to those with good credit pay an average of 8 to 12 percent. Even basic necessities can be denied to those who have filed. But the most grievous side effect of bankruptcy is the damage done to an individuals credit history. 
<P>"Chapter 7 is the worst thing you can have on your credit record," Clark says. "It's basically an admission that you didn't pay your bills." A Chapter 7 petition remains on a filer's credit history for 10 years; seven years for the "more honorable" Chapter 13. And nothing short of an act of God can clean up a bad credit rating.  
<P>"It looks like an easy solution," Foster says. "But bankruptcy is a horrible place to be once you get there." Mike Clark echoes a similar sentiment: "Life's not over when you go through bankruptcy, but it does stick with you a long, long time." 

<H3>The Times They Are A-Changin'</H3>

One final factor that everyone agrees has contributed to the increase in bankruptcies in recent years is the lessening of the stigma associated with bankruptcy. 
<P>"We've become very tolerant in our society of things that didn't use to be tolerated so well," Mike Clark says. "Filing bankruptcy was almost like wearing the scarlet letter. Nowadays it's very common, and it doesn't carry the same emotional weight it used to." 
<P>Mayer says bankruptcy has become a financial tool. "The stigma has been lifted," he says. "Today's generation is different from my generation," Foster says. "My uncle filed bankruptcy years ago, and my mother didn't speak to him for two years. She was too embarrassed."
<P>Jay, a 23-year-old graphic artist, says so far, he hasn't seen the downside of bankruptcy. There's been little stigma, and he hasn't had to make any radical changes to his lifestyle. The main difference is that he pays cash for everything he purchases. He still receives credit card applications in the mail. 
<P>"The only thing different is that (the applications) are for secured cards," he says. Jay's financial crisis arose after the birth of his daughter when his wife developed agoraphobia and was unable to leave their house for a full three months. Her medical condition and subsequent job loss were manageable until he lost his job a few months later--along with his insurance benefits. 
<P>"I originally blamed it (his financial crisis) on those damn credit cards," he says candidly, but it was his wife's medical condition that pushed them over the edge and convinced them to file. 
<P>Like Jennifer, he was overwhelmed by the flood of information and the speed at which the process moved. But unlike Jennifer, he has no regrets, despite his inability to afford all of his wife's medication. "It's affected the way we live in a good way," he says philosophically. "Everything we wanted to do before, we do now--it just takes a little longer."
<P>Foster cautions those quick to pass judgment. "Bankruptcy is not an easy solution," she warns, "but it is a solution. Any of us may need it some day, you and me included."

<P>Celebrated Yugoslavian hand model Laura Atkinson grew weary of her glamorous
life of leisure, emigrated to Knoxville, picked up a BA in journalism, and became the Metro Pulse production manager in 1992. "Being the focal point for all the screw-ups in the publishing world is so much more rewarding,"
says Laura.

<P>"This is... Jay Nations."<BR> Former proprietor of the near-mythical Raven Records, a longtime front for
subversive musical activities and asylum-cum-gravy train for countless local
musician types with retail skills, Jay launched his advertising debut in February of 1995. He's found the new career oddly similar to the old one: still smiling, still schmoozing, still listening to know-it-all co-workers
bullshit about new punk rock vs. '77 punk rock. A declared Frankophile (as in Sinatra), Jay also has the coolest celebrity photo collection of the whole
staff.

The fact that she has an impossibly tidy cubicle, complete with framed art hanging on the pressed foam walls, proves she isn't really human.

<P>After abandoning a promising career in cellular phone and FM radio sales, James joined the staff as a sales rep in '92. He and his hair managed to work their way up the Metro Pulse ladder--and into an office all their own, where James became possibly the only sales manager in the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies to use the phrase "golly gee" on a regular basis. James was the sunny-side-up yin to the editiorial and art staffs' grouchy, eye-rolling yang. Besides cheerfully lording over a seemingly revolving door of account execs, he also had the thankless job
of making nice with clients after the editorial staff pissed them off.

<STRONG>With their outlandish get-ups and attitude, Alicin's Journal sticks out like a sore thumb in their hometown--and that's just the way they want it</STRONG>
<P><EM>by John Sewell</EM>

<P>Dateline: Newport, Tennessee. Strange creatures have descended from the stratosphere bearing guitars and spewing blood. They have been spotted at several dives around East Tennessee, bludgeoning Earthlings into submission with their music, a combustible mixture of metal and industrial rock. As these beings gain momentum, they are spreading their disease to the north, with sightings as far off as the ber-punk hangout, New York's legendary CBGB. This is not a test of the Emergency Broadcast System, this is the real thing!
<P>Okay, so maybe that's a bit over the top--but it's actually not that far from the truth. The East Tennessee music scene has seen its share of musical mutations, but never anything quite as, uh, interesting as Alicin's Journal. And it just had to happen in Newport, of all places.
<P>Alicin's Journal has been spreading its musical madness for a little over three years now, evolving from a high school cover band into the horror show they are today. During their reign of terror, Kevin, Jayson, Chad, Tr, and Philip (no last names, please) have become adept at their skills on vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and guitar, respectively. The guys are still young (ages 19-21), but have approached the music scene with an intensity that belies their youth. "After we started playing out, I told the guys that this is what I wanted to do with my whole life, and we've just gone from there," says Chad. "When I joined the band we decided to get serious."
<P>The band's onstage personae would lead one to expect them to be equally melodramatic in their offstage personalities, but the men of Alicin's Journal just seem like normal Southern guys; guys who like to put on horror rock shows complete with quasi-androgynous getups and simulated violence onstage, that is.
<P>The band is often referred to as "the Marilyn Manson of Tennessee," a title they disavow--sort of. Although no longer sporting whiteface makeup, they do still wear black lipstick, eyeliner, and plenty of thrift shop couture onstage. Nonetheless, they are in a process of reevaluating their image because they don't want to be pigeonholed as Marilyn Manson wannabes.
<P>"We were cool with the white makeup until every article that came out about us compared us to Manson, and we got sick of that," says Jayson. "We don't really sound like them anyway."
<P>Well, maybe. It's understandable how the untrained ear could find the missing link between the two, especially anyone who had heard the lurching industrial noise of the Newport band's previous release, Sliverware. In reality, the latest incarnation of Alicin's Journal's sounds weighs in closer to the post-thrash metal stylings of Korn and Pantera, full of thick riffs, menacing rhythms, and Kevin's vitriolic howl.
<P>The band has experimented with samples on their most recent recording, a cassette entitled Kill Us....Save The World. Lack of funds prevented the band from exploring this technology to the fullest, but they wouldn't use too many loops or sequencers even if they could, preferring to physically produce the sounds you hear onstage.
<P>Kevin, the primary lyricist of the band, says that the violent imagery that often comes up in the band's songs is merely an outlet for anger and aggression, not a true reflection of his mental state.
<P>"The way I write lyrics, one person can listen to it and say, 'Man, he's talking about stabbing someone,' and someone else can get something entirely different. You have to look at it with a bit of humor; that's what makes the world go 'round!"
<P>The band has a serious work ethic and, in the last year, have played around 60 shows, including the CBGB gig, where they opened for Speedball Baby and Bloodloss, a side project of Mudhoney's Mark Arm.
<P>"CBGB's is a rat hole and I love it," says Kevin. "It's the ultimate rock 'n' roll club."
<P>This past summer found Alicin's Journal playing for the largest crowd of their career: an estimated 2,000 campers the day before Lollapalooza in Newport. The show culminated in a crowd jumping on stage and getting naked, a benchmark performance for the band.
<P>Coming from the buckle of the bible belt, Alicin's Journal has encountered plenty of opposition from the religious right. Though the guys don't claim any affiliation with Satanism or any other religion, they have enjoyed the result of the controversy that surrounds the band: publicity.
<P>"We played at this street festival in Newport, and we were passing out our cassettes to the audience," says Kevin. "At the same time, there was this religious group passing out their pamphlets through the crowd. After the show this lady gave me their tract or whatever that said, 'You have an enemy.' There are all these religious people in Newport that are against us, but that's publicity--and any publicity is good."
<P>"I just laugh at it," adds Jayson. "If they would actually read and listen to the lyrics, they would see that they have nothing to do with all that religion they're talking about."
<P>Satanic or not, Alicin's Journal manages to provoke extreme reactions from their audience, including violence directed at band members. An incident at the band's last Mercury Theatre show resulted in Jayson hitting an audience member over the head with his guitar.
<P>"I hit one of them on the head with my guitar 'cause he was trying to drag me off the stage," he shrugs.
<P>"At first it was like really cool though," adds Philip. "You know, we were letting them beat the hell out of us onstage, they were jumping up and slamming into us and that was okay--it just got out of hand."
<P>All in all, Alicin's Journal members aren't as serious about their "message" as some overzealous audience members seem to be.
<P>"It's just entertainment." says Tr.
<P>"Basically we do this as a form of release," adds Chad. "You know there is definitely some humor in all of this. I mean, if someone decided to come to the show with 'Alicin's Journal is fags' written on their forehead or whatever, I'd just laugh and go on. There's just too many people that take things too seriously."
<P>"That's just us," opins Kevin. "We're totally the opposite of what a lot of people think we are. I mean, we're just acrobats in a circus, you know?"

In Punk We Trust
</H1><P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>
It is stiflingly hot in the dark hole that is Mercury Theatre on this Saturday
afternoon and, although MTV would have you believing the punk rock "revival"
is the thing all the kids are doing these days, the floor is dead except
for a few loyal fans pogoing in place. The near-unbearable temperatures
inside the club have driven most everyone outside in search of fresh,
free-of-sweat-stench
air. In other words, nobody's slamming. And, as if that's not enough, the
sound man stepped out in the middle of the set to get a sandwich, leaving
a blaring screech of feedback to ring mercilessly through the p.a. and threaten
to drive out the remaining audience.
<P>
Onstage, American Trust guitarist Tony Johnson steps forward between verses,
staring down the room in a way both confrontational and inviting. Forrest
McCorkle takes the classic defiant bass player's stance, reinforced when
he steps forward to rattle off his own machine-gun vocals. Undaunted, they
put on an in-your-face performance, hoping for a in-their-face audience.
<P>
"We hate playing for a wax museum," is Johnson's battle cry as
they roar, feedback be damned, into the next frustrated anthem.
<P>
Frustration haunts a band like American Trust. In many ways they are, to
borrow a phrase from The Pirate Movie, "younger than the Beatles, but
older than the Rolling Stones." In a decade where the main pop trend
involves '70s nostalgia wrestling with '80s nostalgia, their raw sound gets
pegged into a narrow hole that doesn't exactly match their ambitions.
<P>
"Everybody tries to label us as 'Old School,'"says Johnson. "But
I don't know if that's correct, it's just an easy way to put it."
<P>
Eschewing the melodic Green Day style, these young, fresh fellows keep the
punk spewing raw, fast and jerky. Rugged, simple chord changes, wrapped
tight around hammer-and-anvil drum pounding, support the angry, quasi-political
chants of dissatisfied youth. It's sonic discontent with a capital "D"
and that rhymes with "P" and that stands for Punk-- right here
in River City.
<P>
Johnson and McCorkle trade off lead angry-voice-of-youth duties, while drummer
Justin Pearson drives the whole thing home like a hyperactive nailgun. And
don't mistake them for "old" twentysomething guys cashing in on
the new punk mania; the eldest member of this three-year-old band just turned
twenty.
<P>
American Trust songs address the perils of unquestioned authority, mindless
conformity, and ignorance of history. Songs like "All American Boy"
exhibit a mature self-consciousness about growing up in the post-Vietnam,
post-yuppie world where the "Family Values" movement creates an
empty facade of traditional roles. In a wail roughly reminiscent of Jello
Biafra himself, Johnson sings, "I got to serve my country too/ I got
to stare at the TV too/ I got to love my parents unconditionally/ I got
to be all that I can be/ But most importantly/ What I've been taught to
be/ Is an all-American boy."
<P>
Johnson sees the struggle against conformity as a historical one. "There
are a few key phrases, like 'manifest destiny,' that I try to incorporate
into modern-day (situations). Instead of driving the Indians away and converting
them to Christianity, now they're telling us we're wrong for spiking our
hair, and telling us we need to go to church."
<P>
As Johnson calls it, easily tossed off labels like the aforementioned "Old
School" catch American Trust between a classic rock and a post-punk
hard place. "Some of the older guys [in local bands], like Atom Bomb
Pocket Knife and Chug-a-Lug Donna, tried to help us out at first. But then
it seemed like they ostracized us out because we were playing an older material
they got sick of. Some of the newer kids, we don't remind them of anything,
so they don't know what to do with us."
<P>
This public-perception limbo has inspired an unfortunate antagonism, which
they hope to overcome, between the band and the usually diverse local scene.
"Since we didn't really fit in anywhere," says Johnson, "we
kind of went 'anti-' with a lot of things at first, including Metro Pulse
and other local bands. It seemed like everything was really elitist against
young kids playing something old."
<P>
One scene the American Trust fellows do feel a part of is anchored by the
all-ages shows organized by young local promoters like Chad Negendank and
Tim Sheehan. These shows allow the band to play for their primary audience,
people under 21, outside of the usual basement and garage party venues.
<P>
"When we first started," explains Johnson, "we were all underage,
anyway. So it was pretty pointless to play if our friends couldn't get in."
<P>
Still, the band would like to receive recognition on a broader level. Their
goals involve a true long-term effort, including putting out a record, with
or without the help of a record label. They have some very post-'77 tools
to progress their "Old School" sound. The initial meeting for
this very profile was arranged via America Online. Also, merging the
do-it-yourself
spirit with telecommunications, McCorkle runs Green Hell, Knoxville's only
punk rock online Bulletin Board Service (BBS).
<P>
And, for all their angry young men posturing, American Trust really just
craves the same thing as any other band. Simply said by Johnson, "We
just want to be happy in what we do." And if they can change the world
along the way, more power to 'em.

<H1>Atom Bomb Pocket Knife</H1>
<EM>by Mike Gibson</EM> <P>
Ah, for the days of yore, when punk wasn't such a sprawling muddle, when
the whole aesthetic was defined by a few hallowed trademarks: safety pin
piercings, social outrage, a stripped down three-chord barrage. It was a
time when mohawked zealots took center stage in dives across the country,
making wanton, gleeful noise on old guitars and dousing crowds of disenfranchised
suburban youth with verbal vitriol and assorted bodily fluids. <P>
But it just isn't that simple anymore. Things started to change when mutant
forms, like new wave and post-punk, dropped pebbles in the punk rock puddle,
distorting the image and sending out ripples still seen and felt a decade
or so hence. Nowadays, between the sundry genre spin-offs (hardcore, grunge,
power pop) and the factious, fractious nature of the beast (Old School vs.
New School, MaximumRocknRoll vs. Heart Attack), it's hard to say what's
punk and what ain't. <P>
Which brings us to Atom Bomb Pocket Knife, a sharp-edged noise-pop trio
making the rounds at local clubs and spitting out homebrew tapes like there's
no tomorrow. In terms of expressed musical values, the band's loopy licks
and clanking chords are more reminiscent of the quirky tinkersmith's pop
purveyed by Sebadoh and Guided by Voices. But when you factor in those intermittent
swaths of scalding post-hardcore white noise, and the band's egalitarianism
and D.I.Y. ideals ... just what the hell do you label this stuff, anyway?
<P>
&quot;I'd say we're definitely not punk,&quot; bassist Jason Morris is quick
to say. &quot;Maybe idea-wise, but not musically. I don't know of any pigeon-hole
you could conveniently stick us in.&quot; <P>
&quot;I'd like to hope we're doing something different,&quot; says guitarist/
vocalist Justin Sinkovich. &quot;We're not trying to fit any scene. We were
booked at a punk show a couple of weeks ago, and I really didn't feel like
we totally fit in.&quot; Quibbles aside, it's not surprising that ABPK sometimes
teases the palate with tantalizing hints of pungent punk. Morris and Sinkovich
also constitute two-thirds of Thumbnail, Knoxville's New School heroes and
resident punk circuiteers. But whereas Thumbnail ditties railed against
societal ills, Sinkovich says Atom Bomb Pocket Knife's music hits a little
closer to home. <P>
&quot;In Thumbnail, we expressed anger about broad-based social and political
issues,&quot; Sinkovich explains. &quot;Most of the songs I wrote for this
band were born out of depression and boredom. Scott [Westmoreland, ABPK
drummer] and I were both going through some personal problems, and this
music was our release. This is how we made it back to some kind of equilibrium.&quot;
<P>
Right now, Thumbnail is on indefinite hiatus, and Sinkovich and Morris are
curiously cryptic about the band's fate. (&quot;When our drummer, David,
comes back home this summer, we'll ... well, we don't really know what will
happen.&quot;) But there's no such equivocation when they talk about Atom
Bomb Pocket Knife; Sinkovich emphasizes that this is a permanent entity,
not a side-project. And now that Morris has come aboard (ABPK's early shows
were two-piece affairs), chief songwriter Sinkovich is anxious to revamp
and revisit the band's mission statement. <P>
&quot;We're just trying to write new songs with the three-piece lineup,&quot;
says Sinkovich. &quot;The music is definitely moving in a different direction.
Jason has a louder, more aggressive edge. And now that I don't have to write
the bass line into the guitar, it allows me to be more creative.&quot; <P>
&quot;The way we've always written together is that one person makes up
a song and the other creates his part,&quot; Morris says. &quot;I haven't
got to the point where I'm bringing a lot of stuff in yet, songwise. Right
now, I'm concentrating on coming up with kooky bass parts to enhance the
songs Justin brings in.&quot; <P>
ABPK already has two cassettes' worth of material in circulation--last summer's
Didn't Make the Cut, which sold 100 copies, and their latest self-titled
offering. But to really get a feel for the band, you'd best see them live.
That's when all those vehemently punkish passages really scorch the senses,
empowered by Sinkovich's blast-furnace yowl and schizophrenic guitar. <P>
&quot;I started putting in the loud parts for shock value,&quot; says the
mild-mannered Sinkovich. &quot;But I've tried to blend them thoughtfully,
mixing the quieter parts with the hatred.&quot; <P>
But with both Sinkovich and Westmoreland on the verge of receiving college
degrees, Atom Bomb Pocket Knife would seem to be at a crossroads--a point
where punk ideals clash with real-world responsibilities, when reckless
abandon usually falls by the wayside. According to Sinkovich, however, ABPK
plans to stay the course: <P>
&quot;I've talked to a lot of people about jobs, and I've got one waiting
if I want it. But that's not really where my head is at. Right now, I just
want to play. I want to get with an indie and just be able to survive and
tour.&quot; At least that much about punk hasn't changed.

<STRONG>Well, maybe they're not really rebels...or angry, or emo, or hardcore. But local band Autonomy Vs. Shame is certainly entrenched in the D.I.Y. ethic./STRONG>
<P><EM>by John Sewell</EM>
<P>There's a good chance you haven't heard of Autonomy Vs. Shame. Instead of following the usual routes to local popularity (i.e. playing in clubs, schmoozing, and hoping for that pie-in-the-sky big break that never comes), these guys have adopted a different approach, building a following through playing word-of-mouth shows at parties in living rooms all over town, as well as playing out-of-town shows in equally unlikely places. This hands-on assault of the music scene has netted the band a reputation as being rebels, a characterization they don't feel is really applicable.
<P>"A lot of people have said that we're a rebel band and that we're against this or against that," says guitarist Eric Bliss. "We're not really against anything, we're just for us and we're for the scene..."
<P>Rebels or not, almost everything these guys do is somehow a departure from the standard rock 'n' roll configuration. Members Matthew Hall and David Basford switch their guitar and bass duties during any given set; Hall, Basford, and Bliss switch off on vocals, sometimes employing all three in the course of a song. Drummer Wolfgang Coleman occasionally switches from using drumsticks to mallets in quieter passages. In the world of Autonomy Vs. Shame, experiments and innovation result in a band that is constantly evolving.
<P>The band's different approach carries over into the construction of their music. As opposed to the usual technique of a lone singer/songwriter, all of Autonomy Vs. Shame's songs are group compositions--a democratic songwriting process resulting in music that is textured and multifaceted. Their songs encompass a range of sounds and emotions, going from quiet, pretty passages to jarring discordance in a matter of seconds. The result of this aural complexity is a sound comparable to Jawbox, Thumbnail, Today Is The Day, or Fugazi in their more experimental moments.
<P>These comparisons invariably lead to the conclusion that Autonomy Vs. Shame is yet another "emo" band, a niche that they don't necessarily want to be lumped in.
<P>"I guess we could be considered emo, but I don't want to be stuck in a category where there's a certain crowd that comes to the shows," says Sinclair. "I invite people to take a chance and come see us.  Maybe it's emo and maybe it's not. Maybe you'll like emo. That term means different things to different people."
<P>"I think the term emo is pretty elastic," says Coleman. "I don't necessarily reject the label, but I don't embrace it either. We didn't get together and say, 'We're going to start an emo band.' People could also say we're a hardcore band. I've heard people call us math rock, too, but that's a very dismissive term I think."
<P>"My biggest focus in music is to explore what I feel inside," adds Bliss. "I mean, I don't want to sound cheesy, 'cause I'm being sincere. Basically my music is an expression of me. I mean, it is emotional music, so if someone wants to call it that, that's okay."
<P>The band will be releasing a split single with Chicago's Assembly Line People Program on the Constructive Interference label, which should be available within the next three weeks. True to form, the guys recorded the single on a four-track in their tiny practice space instead of going to a studio.
<P>Autonomy Vs. Shame has had many excursions from Knoxville, performing in Atlanta, Nashville, Chicago, and St. Louis, booking out-of-town shows through personal connections, and often playing in unconventional spaces.
<P>"Traveling is always a problem because we don't have a van and we have to take several cars on the road," says Bliss.
<P>"But we'll do it anyway because we love getting out and playing," says Coleman. "We lose gobs of money, but it's worth it because of what we get out of it personally."
<P>As the band gains popularity, it is becoming harder to continue playing informal venues. "I think we'll eventually reach that critical point where we have to play in clubs on a real stage, just so people can see us," says Coleman.
<P>Bliss agrees that the band may have to opt for bigger venues, but for now, he prefers intimate spaces. "I think I'll always feel more comfortable playing without a stage. I prefer to play among the audience without any barrier between us."
<P>The band's main focus is to create the most intense musical experience possible. "I want people to go away from seeing us play saying 'damn, that was awesome,' no more, no less," says Bliss. 
<P>"We want to hit people in the face with our music," adds Sinclair. "We want people to walk away from the show feeling like they got their money's worth and that they really got something out of the show. My main goal is to get the music out to as many ears as possible, by whatever means necessary."

<H1><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="black_velvet.gif" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="173" HSPACE="10">Black Velvet Dogs
</H1><P><EM>by Mike Tatum</EM>
<P>If you've ever been to Gryphon's to bask in the dim glow of the lone 40-watt
"stage light" to watch a band, you'll know why the Black Velvet Dogs call it "the living room." Gryphon's--with its usual cast of the inebriated hollering
out for "Hank" covers, bumming your cigarettes and drinking your beer--has become a comfortable place for the Dogs' music. The bar/laundromat's seediness
seems to create the perfect backdrop for their "hillbilly blues."
<P> BVD, the self-proclaimed "proud purveyors of stripped down, souped up,
psychedelic blues," have their reasons for playing in places that don't lend
themselves to the glamorous image of show business. Their presence and their
music proudly says "Low Budget," but that doesn't mean you're going to get a no-frills show from the Dogs. Quite the contrary; lead vocalist Bill
Irwin--armed with only a guitar and an attitude for the blues--growls and spits his way through the BVD repertoire, backed by a full complement of bass, drums, harp, and, uh, washboard.
<P> Together, the group sounds like the engine of a '57 Chevy churning out blues gems from as far back as the '20s. Their typical set culls tunes from such blues masters as Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, and Andy Griffith. Andy
Griffith? Yes, the 'Dogs take the innocuous, never-meant-to-harm-nobody "Crawdad
Hole" and turn it into a swampy blues rant that would have scared the hell out of Opie.
<P> "I came up with a guitar riff to sing those words to," says Irwin. "Afterward, I thought that it could be about junkies, or something dark and awful like that."
<P> "We thought if we ever do a video, it would be to that song," bassist Tim Stamm adds. "And we'll do it where this junkie is shooting up to 'You'll get a line, I'll get a pole,' and another guy is buying drugs. In the end the song goes, 'What'cha gonna do when the well runs dry'--well, then the dealer gets busted."
<P> Not all of Dog's songs conjure up such twisted visions of death and desperation,
but don't expect "Don't Worry, Be Happy" songs from the band either. "If they don't want songs about booze, women or animals, then we just don't need to play," drummer Danny Wade says succinctly.
<P> "It's a lot of attitude," comments Irwin. "For me personally, older blues has the same kind of attitude as hardcore and punk--aggressive, wild,
asses-up-there-playing music." This isn't a hard comparison for Irwin to make, considering he played in an '80s-era Knoxville punk band that was more than a little well known for being wild: Teenage Love.
<P> Another veteran in the band, harp player Doug Hemphill, has been playing in local bands since the '70s and holds the dubious distinction of having played the most gigs on Chapman Highway of any band member. But this is good
because they have a regular gig at Daniel's Bar &amp; Grill every month. "They really get down on the blues in there," says Stamm, "and they boogie and jitterbug. It's really a good place to play. Basically, our motto is we'll play anywhere for anybody."
<P> With that motto in mind, the Dogs are looking to spread their twisted "roots"
music everywhere they can, covering obscure blues songs from the '20s, '30s and '40s. "The reason we play it is because it's the real thing. It's the real basic building block of rock, blues and even country. It's timeless," says Hemphill.
<P> Although the Dogs have taken their timeless tunes to more upscale surroundings
(weathering the howls and cackles of the gold lam&eacute; crowd), it's the murky stage of Gryphon's where they feel most at home.
<P> "We called up Gryphon's one night to see if we could play, and they said sure, come on down, they didn't have a band," says Stamm. "So, we went down there and had practice. It was great!"
<P> "Yeah, this one old drunk guy was yelling, 'Play some Hank!' And every time we'd take a break he'd stagger up and say, 'Now you boys ain't doing too good.'
<P> "It was fun."

<H1>Keep on Shining</H1>
<P><STRONG>The Blue Mooners bring bluegrass back home</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM>
<P>It's a sad and vicious cycle. Kinda like the way the guys who rake the charcoal at the Jack Daniels distillery in dry Lynchburg have to drive 45 minutes to buy a bottle, or the way Cadillacs are assembled in Detroit by people whose only time behind the wheel of one is putting them on a transport trailer; as soon as bluegrass music became a marketable commodity, it became an export. <P>
Bluegrass is the indigenous music of this region. But to hear it, you have to either buy it back from the record companies, hang out down at Roy's Records or Pick &amp; Grin for the all too rare impromptu jam, or hold your breath between once-a-year concerts like last month's Ralph Stanley and Jim And Jesse. (Which promoted what? A film from New York, that's what.) <P>
The Blue Mooners are a Knoxville area bluegrass band. Aside from the occasional festival stint in Kentucky or Virginia, The Blue Mooners craft their traditional tunes and hand-me-down harmonies exclusively for East Tennessee audiences.<P>
"The popularity of bluegrass seems to go through cycles," says Rick Pollard, leader of the Blue Mooners by default and guitarist by virtue of his expertise. "It peaked in the '70s with all the new festivals and bands that sprouted up then. I can tell that it's on its way up again. That bluegrass revival happened because the young people became interested in it, and that's what's happening again now."<P>
Alongside Pollard when the Blue Mooners let their deal go down on-stage are Mel and Skeeter Doyle, playing rhythm guitar and mandolin respectively, Clint Harriman on fiddle, Wade Hill on banjo and Jeff Marcum on bass. The Blue Mooners are only a few years old, yet the core of the group has been singing and playing together for over 20 years.<P>
"Wade and Skeeter and I played together in the '70s in a band called Possum Belly," says Pollard. "Unlike a lot of the bands that came out of the '70s, those bands that play 'canned bluegrass,' all speed and showing off, we didn't learn bluegrass from records. Me and Wade and Skeeter learned from playing with and listening to old-timers, just like Jimmy Martin and Bill Monroe did. And it shows.<P>
"Every time my family got together, whether it was after church or before dinner or whatever, we'd always end up on the front porch with a couple guitars. I love those old songs. And that's one of the things we try to do, is keep those old-time songs alive."<P>
Listening to the Blue Mooners is a lot like a musical history lesson. Skeeter Doyle is one of the few singers around who can hit the high notes necessary to cover Bill Monroe or Don Reno. His mandolin playing is mostly improvised, but he draws from a traditional vocabulary of licks and styles, so it sounds familiar even if all you have at home are 78s. Tossed in with the obligatory Monroe or Flatt and Scruggs covers are seldom-heard antiques like "A Little Boy Named Joe" and "Put My Little Shoes Away." <P>
Their stage presence is worthy of the traditions from which they draw. The soft spoken Harriman only looks rough and ready, as if he might have ridden in from Kodak on a Massey-Ferguson. His passion for the genre makes you think he might have learned to play on one of those two-string gourd fiddles hanging in the Museum of Appalachia. Only his nonchalant virtuosity, the ease with which he saws off fills to bridge solos by Skeeter and Hill, suggests that he's actually a classically trained violinist. Pollard is something of a conductor, bobbing and nodding his vintage Hopalong Cassidy ten gallon hat in lieu of a baton.<P>
"This winter we had a steady gig at Bullfrogs," says Pollard. "It's pretty much a reggae club. We'd have these kids, black and white with their dreadlocks and tie-dyes, out on the floor trying to clog to our music. It's great to jump those barriers between styles. That's what makes me think bluegrass is going to make another comeback real soon. Young people are opening up to different kinds of music besides rock."<P>
Even if those dreads hadn't belonged to UT students, if they'd come straight from the Ivory Coast or Marrakesh, the attraction to bluegrass would be understandable. Of all the genres of music normally associated with the U.S., bluegrass seems to be the least embarrassed by its international ancestry. And it has cousins all over the world that can't be traced directly. Listen to the mandolins or balalaikas in the klezmer dance music of Eastern Europe, or the harp-like koras in the festive mandinka of Gambia. You'll hear a lot of the same high-pitched string melodies and furious energy that you hear in Appalachian Mountain bluegrass. <P>
Better yet, head down to the upcoming International Jubilee. Spend some time with the Japanese Koto musicians there or the Indian folk dancers. The similarities between the music you hear from those performers and The Blue Mooners, also performing at the Jubilee, say more convincingly than any Disney lyricist could that it's a damn small world.<P>
"It'll be a party," Pollard says laughing. "It's a party anytime we play. And whether the audience likes us or bluegrass at all, they'll have a good time. Guaranteed."

</H1><P><STRONG>Don't call them neo-hippies: local band Boondocks put a fresh spin on that whole "organic, raw, earthy" thing.</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>Let's face it; the horse that carried that whole toked-up-post-Dead-funky-shuffle-thang into college-circuit bars all over the countryside is one beat old nag. The galvanizing rhythms and cosmic improvisational mojo that may have once given the Birkenstock nation its raison d'etre have been snuffed, choked out in a patchouli miasma, lost in a thicket of bad facial hair. Oh, what Jerry hath wrought.
<P>But Boondocks have managed to appropriate some of the genre's mystical stoner essence without plying the same old flaccid grooves. This Knoxville quintet has realized the kind of telepathic musical union so many jam bands seek but seldom find, and rarer still manage to fuse with cohesive songcraft.
<P>Their rootsy musings are unabashedly song-based, mapping out some of the same lonesome backwater territory Neil Young and Gram Parsons pioneered nearly 30 years ago. Yet there's also a certain intoxicating improvisational synergy when all of the band's elements conspire-- quavering harmonies, cutting guitar leads, the rich rhythmic tapestry of bass, bongos, and drums.
<P>These Boondocks boys don't really have a label for their muse; you can call it post-modern country, retro rock, or buttermilk R&amp;B. But one thing they staunchly refuse to do is swath it in tie-dyes and stencil it 'groove'.
<P>"We were always looking for an organic, raw, earthy sound without sounding like a groove band," says singer/percussionist Mike Lipkin. "We just write straight-ahead songs that come from the heart and reflect our background. You can listen to us and tell we grew up in East Tennessee and ate grits all our lives."
<P>Much of the rural southern charm of Boondocks' music stems from the vocal interplay of Lipkin and singer/rhythm guitarist Mark Campbell. Whether singing in unison or in turn, their tremulous warbling often brings to mind a pair of back porch Gospel wailers milking a particularly mournful hymn, lending each song a certain plaintive authenticity. At times, their vocals hover in an uneasy limbo of microtonal ambiguities, teetering on the brink of dissonance. Yet they invariably regain their equilibrium in a way that resonates as much with the heart as it does with the ear.
<P>Boondocks had its genesis about one year ago when Campbell and Lipkin met over an acoustic guitar making the rounds at a party. They found that they shared a passion for music with a rural flavor and began pounding out original songs as a guitar/drums duo. When they were joined in late fall by carrot-topped guitar player Cap Lillard, a fellow Longbranch Saloon barfly with a hard rocker's penchant for skittering, blues-based leads, the trio decided to preserve Lipkin and Campbell's initial songs on tape. Boondocks, the self-produced CD that captures the band's first studio sessions, is currently available at Cat's Records, the Disc Exchange, and Lost and Found Records on Cumberland Avenue.
<P>The ten songs on Boondocks have a parched, almost mournful ambiance that's much akin to vintage Neil Young. But if you pay attention, you'll find a few suppressed grins poking at the music's solemn countenance; Lipkin and Campbell like to toss off lyrics with a wink and a beefy elbow in the ribs. On "She'd Do the Driving," Campbell ponders a dysfunctional relationship with an ambivalence that's almost comic, somehow managing to sound horny and despairing at the same time. ("She turns me on," he rues in the chorus.)
<P>And at other times, the mood is downright cheerful, full of spry wit and goofball charm. On "My Sign," a quirky porch-rocker, Campbell and Lipkin fuse CS&amp;N with Timbuk 3, giving a nod and another wink to the latter's novelty nugget "The Future's So Bright (I Gotta Wear Shades)".
<P>"I get a kick out of writing songs that someone is going to take too seriously," Lipkin explains. "I also like making music that isn't necessarily congruent with the lyrics. It's a device we use a lot just to keep things strange, keep people guessing."
<P>Adds Campbell, "The initial idea for the band was just to make silly country music to make people laugh. We've gone a little farther beyond that, but we still like to keep that sardonic element."
<P>Since recording Boondocks, the band has added former Fat Bastard bassist Doug Engle and drummer Jason Ratliff, allowing Campbell to concentrate on second guitar and Lipkin to explore a wider range of percussive instruments. The new line-up also enables Boondocks to push the limits of its short, hooky songs in live performance, to stretch tight arrangements until they fairly throb with newfound improvisational energy.
<P>It's at those moments, when Lillard's scrambling leads mingle with Engle's staccato bass blips, Ratliff's sturdy beats, and Lipkin's hypnotic percussive mantras, that Boondocks flirts with the G-word. And it's at those moments when the band separates itself from the rest of the jam-happy pack, reigning in its ensemble flights-of-fancy just short of pointless instrumental flagellation.
<P>"Any one of us in this band has the ability to be obnoxious as hell on their instrument," Lipkin says. "When it comes down to it, it's about the songs, about keeping the band tight, about making sense when we groove."

</H1><P><STRONG>The Cheeksters step out with an (almost) major new
album</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Lee Gardner</EM>
<H3>NEW YORK CITY,9/23/94, 7:45 p.m.
</H3><P>There's a surly crowd already jostling to get into CBGB, the legendary
toilet-like punk rock Mecca on the Bowery. But I'm headed next door, to the more genteel CBGB Gallery to catch a special CMJ convention showcase featuring
local heroes the Cheeksters. Except as I pull up a drink and a table, there's
precious little other clientele and no Cheeksters.
<P> As patrons filter in, Mark Casson and Shannon Hines burst through the door
trailing guitar cases and apologies to the club soundman. They've traveled over a thousand miles in car, trains, and taxis on their own nickel to play for 45 minutes with a hired session drummer whom they just met that afternoon.
But as they zip through a hasty sound check, the tables down front fill with
folks in expensive casual clothing--a clump of music publishing people, a
smattering of press, a few record label reps. With barely a moment to sip a beer and draw a deep breath, they're off into their set. Maybe if the right
person is here, and if this right person likes them enough, they could be on their way to a label deal, fame and fortune, the works. No pressure.
<P> From the first song, Casson's powerful voice cuts through the cigarette haze, and Hines's bass hooks in with the drummer like they've been playing together for years. When her songs come up, she turns on the charm high-beams, while
Casson croons back-ups and strums their loose-limbered acoustic pop music along. The audience applauds with vigor.
<P> After the set the Cheeksters are aflush The publishing people loved them. They're meeting people left and right. Rumor is that Paul Simon is milling about somewhere in the back. Tonight there is buzz round the pair. But day after tomorrow, they have to head back to Knoxville and their day jobs.
<P> In the five years since they met on a train in Europe, Casson and Hines have
become a couple, even getting married a few years back. But they have also been playing those local gigs, recording their songs, and wangling the odd
out-of-town showcase, all in the hope that they can interest the world at large in their well-crafted pop songs and performances. More than any other
unsigned act in town, they are working unabashedly towards stardom of a sort. And now they're starting to make some headway.
<H3>THE BASEMENT TAPES
</H3><P>Though they've released several choice cassettes for local consumption
and promo purposes, the release of their first CD, Hey, What's Your Style, hoists the Cheeksters into a higher league.
<P> "We didn't want to go in and make another demo tape," Hines, a self-described
"little old East Tennessee girl," states flatly. "I mean, with or without a record deal, it was time to make an album."
<P> Fortunately, the duo had been spending the last year or so hanging out and
jamming with Judybat Dave Jenkins. They started recording some of their tunes in the drummer's basement on a four-track. While the songs they were playing
developed a feeling that they liked, Jenkins acquired more and more recording
equipment. Soon they had an album's worth of songs and a studio's worth of
equipment in Jenkins's basement.
<P> "It got to a stage that we felt happy jamming in that space, and we'd made a lot of recordings before using pretty much the same system," says Casson, who grew up in England's Lake District and Wales. "I guess the main reason we wanted to do it like that, ultimately, is that we wanted to capture that feel and not have the pressure of being in a studio and watching the clock."
<P> "We couldn't have afforded to go into a studio for that amount of time," Hines adds.
<P> Thanks to taking their time with these organically-grown songs (and thanks to Jenkins's engineering skills) the Cheeksters have come up with an album worth the price of their sweat. Casson and Hines's trademark three-minute tips into the mystic have been augmented by the versatile kick of Jenkins kit, and obvious attention to the arrangements makes each track stand out for more than just the indelible melodies. Hey, What's Your Style provides a brilliant major label-caliber rendering of the Cheeksters. But it isn't on a major label--like so much of what they do, they did it all themselves. 
<H3>THE F-WORD
</H3><P>One of the things that makes the Cheeksters unique has also made them a little difficult to "sell" to label honchos thus far. Hey, what is your style?
<P> "When you play as a duo, people are going to think 'folk,' especially because I play an acoustic guitar," says Casson. "That tag is a little frustrating now, because I think of us more in terms of your basic pop/rock--whatever that may be."
<P> Actually, if you haven't heard the Cheeksters lately (or yet), you're in for a surprise.
<P> Though the CD and their sets are still filled with a familiar mix of strummulous
mid-tempo pop songs and gentle ballads, you might detect a whiff of old soul. And I ain't talkin' 'bout the reincarnated kind.
<P> "It's strange, because when you enter that recording process, whatever you're
listening to at the time, you really start listening to it," recalls Hines. "We'd put on Al Green or Marvin Gaye and go 'Man, it has such a groove, such a soulful warm sound.' You want to capture something like that, but we didn't
really sit down and say, 'We want to make this album.'"
<P> There is a bit of soul dressing on Style in the occasional wah-wah guitar lick or sax ripple (the latter courtesy of local hired horn Terry Schmidt). And certainly the CD focuses more on groove than past releases. But one of the most arresting elements of the CD is Casson's newfound falsetto on cuts like "Something About You" and "Slide." A slow-jam coo is the last thing you'd expect from a man with his hearty Northumbrian pipes.
<P> "It's really just because I've gotten more confident," Casson explains. "I never realized that I could sing falsetto until I was singing along with a Van Morrison song or something. Years ago I couldn't have wanted to sing like that, because it really sounded soft and lame. But the more I played with it, the more I realized that you could really get a good emotion with that style of singing. It's so fragile."
<P> Conveying emotion, after all, is what the Cheeksters are all about. As Casson
explains: "Some bands are very lyrically intellectual--I don't really see us in that way. It's the melody, the overall feeling that's important. I just really want to make music that makes people feel good, the way that a great pop song used to make me feel when I was a teenager."
<P> On good night, they're just about there. 
<H3>DYING FOR IT
</H3><P>So the Cheeksters work their day jobs in Knoxville, wait to hear back from the contacts they made in New York, and dream of spending their days making
music. "I feel like we could go a lot farther," says Hines. "We could make even better records, if we were given the chance to grow without having to hold down full-time jobs. But the path entails a record deal with all its gnarly little traps."
<P> "The bottom line is that we're not getting any younger," says Casson, who, like his wife, is 28. "We'd love to make a living at it, but, you know, we're
just plugging away. Still, I feel like we've reached a watershed with this one, something we've been striving towards for years and it's finally arrived. If I passed away tomorrow, I'd die a happy man."

</H1><P><STRONG>Crop Circles spin the alternapop wheel and come up winners</STRONG><BR>(Crop Circles are now known as Family Jewels)
<P> <EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P> The crisscrossing genealogies of Knoxville bands often lead to stagnant rehashes of the same old same old, but there are other times when this incestuous
process finally throws the right mix of people together. Influences click and aimless jams solidify into real live rock songs. I could be talking about a number of scenesters, but this time I'm talking about Crop Circles.
<P> At first glance, the band members don't even seem old enough to be scene
veterans. When I mention a band from 1987, they marvel at my memory of such an ancient era. Also, it's obvious from the clutter of their Monkees-style Fort Sanders crash pad that their favorite pastime is the mystic-fantasy card game "Magic, the Gathering"--to the untrained eye, a sure sign of nerd-dom. But they cross the line from nerdity to coolness via their
in-house eight-track recording studio, strategically disguised as the upstairs
bedroom of guitarist Gray Comer.
<P> Within the protection of walls lined with egg-carton acoustic tiles, Crop Circles gather to create their own brand of freedom rock-cum-alternapop. On tape and in person, it's a sound at once light and breezy, but charged with vim and vigor--yes, at the very least, actual vim. Their three-part vocal harmonies float above guitar, bass and drums that run the gamut from a laid-back lounge vibe to a pounding frenzy. Throw in some classic '80s memories (Let's Active, the dBs, the Housemartins) and you're there.
<P> Even with their youthful appearance, it didn't take them long to build a resume in the rock-and-roll game. Bassist Doug Campbell started his first band in town when he was 13, and more recently sat behind the drums with Knox rock expatriates Dim Kitchen. Vocalist Bill Hice handled bass for the
almost-made-it-sort-of-big Rapscallion Battery. Drummer Mike Dougherty earned his stripes in the late, great Soul Penny. And Comer played briefly with Sally Can't Dance (which morphed into what is now the Creeps).
<P> The latest Crop Circles triumph is Brother, an eight-song tape produced right there in Gray's room and soon to be available to the public. It hasn't been an easy point to reach, though. Since they started playing their raw,
slightly agitated brand of pop a year and a half ago, they've seen enough of the rock-and-roll lifestyle to write their own "What's Your Name" or "Turn the Page."
<P> "We were the last band to play at the Farragut [High School] Bandfest," proclaims Comer, with a certain touch of pride at such close involvement with the controversial incident. "We were playing when they shut it down."
<P> Soon after that, the band's first and only show at Gryphon's Coin Laundry and Rock Palace ended in chaos when their then-bassist physically attacked Comer. "We were just messing around at the end of our set," explains Comer, "and he thought I was making fun of him. So he kind of speared me with his bass."
<P> Despite the turbulent events of their short time together, the guys say they couldn't be happier. Friends through years of school and other bands, the four have a sturdy foundation. They didn't have to answer "musician wanted" ads. They peg their friendship as the key to their creative success.
<P> "There's a whole lot of input from everyone. It's a melting pot creative
process," says Comer, "and I like that because everyone's input is equal. There are no limits. We're going for variety of feels and styles in songwriting."
<P> Brother offers a healthy sample of said variety. Styles range from the
countrified "Clobber" to the high-tide surf of "Country Goodness" to the revved-up R.E.M. sound of "Public Access." Hice and Comer handle most of the lyrics, describing their wordplay as observational, rather
than an attempt to proselytize any kind of message.
<P> "We're not going for that 'change the world to our way of thinking' type thing," says Comer. "We're not the Live type thing."
<P> Instead, the band tries to recreate everyday observations of the average man. Hice carefully explains the in-depth Crop Circles songwriting formula.
"Sometimes the ideas are kind of disjointed. One verse could be about one thing, say a specific mood in a situation. The next verse could actually be about the situation. Or it could be the other way around."
<P> On the flipside of such high-falutin' cultural debate, the band has worked up a cover of Del Shannon's "Runaway."
<P> "It's one of my mom's favorite songs," Comer reveals. "It used to be the song my mom and dad danced to before they got married."
<P> "Chuck Burnley [local promoter extraordinaire] freaked out when we played it at Manhattan's," mentions Hice. "He ran out and cheered."
<P> Herein lies the lucky charm of Crop Circles--moms love it, but promoters like it, too. They've found the mysterious happy medium between personal and commercial satisfaction. That mystery can be as elusive as the band's
namesake, those giant mysterious images carved into British wheat fields.
<P> And what about the name, anyway?
<P> "I made it up," shrugs Dougherty.
<P> "Then the band just kind of happened," reveals Comer. "We were like, 'Well, hell, we already have a name, now we have to, like, write
songs.'" So let the curious know--Crop Circles are a natural occurrence.

</H1><P><STRONG>With the past behind them, Dinky Doo aren't afraid to be the underdogs</STRONG>
<P> <EM>by Shelly Ridenour</EM>
<P> Anybody who remembers the late, great Pegclimber no doubt expects
guitarist/vocalist/all-around frontman Stewart Pack's new band, Dinky Doo, to be just as powerful and
headstrong and macho. Another round of "heavy alternative." Another "power trio."
<P> Wrong.
<P> "That was the furthest from my intention with this band, because I was in the power trio. I'm content with not being so powerful," Pack reveals. "We want a small sound ... a dinky sound!"
<P> "It's anti-Pegclimber," proclaims drummer Morrie Rothstein, Pegclimber's original drummer and the man who sat behind the kit for the 1-900$, Pack's other local legend.
<P> "I hate to say that. But my goal is to do anything but be like Pegclimber," Pack reveals. "I felt trapped playing with Larry [Brady, Pegclimber bassist], who was Mr. Powerbass, and Shayne [Ivy, Pegclimber's second drummer],
who was Mr. Powerdrummer. As soon as I got in with them both, I was outnumbered.
I felt like I didn't fit the band anymore. I could play it, but it wasn't me. It was like a tool in the wrong hands."
<P> So now, along with Rothstein ("Stewart brought me out of retirement"), bassist Gregg Dunn (a former scholarship tuba player who, as Pack jokes, "knows the bottom end") and the brand-spanking new addition of former Gut Truck frontguy Bill Dahlinger on guitar and harmony, Pack is back and ready to keep the testosterone under control. Dinky Doo is a departure
from the past.
<P> No longer do you hear the jaw-rattling virtuosity that boosted Pegclimber into a sonic monolith of balls-to-the-wall ungrunge and heavy alternative.
Instead, reel-em-in hooks and infectious choruses bounce atop ringing guitars.
Three-and-a-half minutes of verse-chorus-verse is the formula du jour. Why, if you didn't know better, you would call them power pop. Good-bye Clockhammer
comparisons, hello H&uuml;sker Du.
<P> "I've tried to be more 'songwriterly,'" Pack muses. "I don't wanna say simplified, because I think the songs are more involved on a different
level, more involved within the tenets of pop songwriting. I don't want them to be choppy and abrupt just for the sake of being choppy and abrupt."
<P> Dinky Doo may try to shirk off the "power" label that once fit so well, but they also realize that's easier said than done. And don't
misunderstand: these guys still pack more of a wallop than anything you'll hear in just about any bar on the Strip or downtown. "Dinky" is not synonymous with "wimpy."
<P> "You can't avoid the power label when you play loud," Pack reasons. "I think if you listen to a certain genre of music, you become numb to what's 'power.' Like, if you listen to Bad Religion, you're immune to 'power,' but your parents will still be offended by it."
<P> Instead of citing the Misfits or the Buzzcocks or Sonic Youth as a defining
influence, Pack shamelessly goes where few other musicians dare. He actually
admits to listening to ZZ Top, Huey Lewis and Bad Company.
<P> "Stewart knows them all," crows Rothstein.
<P> "This man is an encyclopedia of bad Top 40 music from the late '60s to the mid-80s," Dunn says.
<P> "You know that Guitar Rock compilation you can order on TV?" Rothstein queries. "I was gonna buy it for him, but he already knows it all."
<P> While Pack most certainly doesn't deny his roots, he does defend them. "My theory on knowing cheese rock is if you don't know cheese rock you're liable to make cheese rock and not know it. You'll always have people who want to stay up on what's going on, read all the magazines, know what's fresh, and then there are people who think they have divine inspiration. They close
themselves off from what's going on, and inevitably they end up doing something
that's already been done."
<P> And if that's not convincing enough, he's also armed with one final note of justification. "My guitar learning age was the '80s, full of New Wave keyboardy effects and punk, which was anti-guitar. What else was I going to listen to besides classic rock?"
<P> If "Tush" or "Feel Like Makin' Love" can shape the face of rock 'n' roll in a way that doesn't involve jerk-off guitar solos or
over-the-top vocal operatics ... well, that might just be the best argument yet to keep dinosaurs on the FM dial.

<H1><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="brown_donald.gif" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="238" HSPACE="10">Donald Brown
</H1><P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM>
<P>In Japan, an artist or performer who is making a contribution to society that no one else could possibly make is given the title of "National Treasure."
Along with the title comes an honorary stipend and some heavyweight status. Such artists don't have to wait in lines at restaurants or hold their own
umbrellas anymore. If Knoxville ever decided to recognize its own living
treasures, Donald Brown would be near the top of the list.
<P> By day, for most of the year, Brown is an Associate Professor of Music at UT. By night, just about every day of the week, you'll find him on a local stage playing the unique brand of jazz that has earned a him an international
reputation as a composer and performer.
<P> "I can't really distinguish between the rewards I find in playing and those I find in teaching," Brown says modestly. "They're two different ways I can make a contribution. Teaching is a lot like parenting. You give what you can to the students and share what you know. Over a period of time you see each student develop musically. They may go on to perform or they may go on to teach themselves.
<P> "By performing, I give something directly to my audience. You can tell when they enjoy it, when what I play makes a difference. Those comments and
compliments are very nice, but so is seeing a student make progress."
<P> Brown grew up in Memphis, steeped in the musical traditions of that Mississippi
River city. He saw the late, great jazz/blues pianist Phineas Newborn, Jr. many times as a young man. He played bass and keyboards in the legendary studio bands at the Stax and Hi records studios. After graduating from Memphis
State University in the early '70s, Brown went to Boston to teach at the Berklee School of Music for five years before moving here.
<P> You'd expect such a resume to give an artist an ego that wouldn't fit through the door. The fact is, you can barely get the man to talk about himself. He'll never tell you he's got a shelf of killer jazz sides out on the Muse and Sunnyside labels. After Brown informs you that he heard Newborn as a lad, he doesn't throw in the fact that earlier this year he played with The
Contemporary Keyboard Ensemble on a stunning Newborn tribute, released on the esoteric DIW label (their Knoxville concert was called "Five for Phineas").
<P> "I loved playing that old R&amp;B in Memphis," Brown says. "And I miss playing
it, but not as much as I miss hearing it. That was some great music to hear and have on the radio.
<P> "For this Jazz and Blues Festival, I'll be doing a little bit of both. I'll be playing piano with Jerry Coker on the opening day. For my set, they asked me to put together a blues band. I can do that."
<P> What he says is true. The driving force behind the right hand melody in blues
piano is the rock-solid rhythm that comes from the left hand. Not a problem for Brown; on the nights when there's no bass player at Lucille's, he plays the bass line on one keyboard with his left hand and covers the piano with only his right.
<P> The fact that Brown has played nearly every kind of music and can play just about any instrument (he started with drums, worked his way through the brass and reed families, and finally settled down with bass and keyboards) shows
whenever he sits down at the piano with a pen in hand. His compositions "Affaire
D'Amour" and "Reruns of the Sixties," featured on the recent local release by Bill Scarlett, Jazz from the University of Tennessee, are nothing short of homegrown beauty.
<P> Brown also plays on the disc, and escorts UT's other classroom hotshots through
the gamut of all that jazz has to offer. His writing and playing embraces the unbridled freedom of fusion, the stately structure of bebop and the fun and unpredictability of improvisation. His two cuts on the disc sound right at home nestled among works by other composers ranging from Coltrane to Wayne
Shorter.
<P> Brown says Knoxville makes a great base for someone with his career and schedule.
<P> "I'll be going up to New York in a few days," Brown says. "I'm producing an album up there for Kenny Garrett. After the Jazz and Blues Festival, the
Contemporary Keyboard Ensemble has a date in Atlanta. Then I'll be going to Europe, playing for Tom Harrell on 12 dates we've got over there."
<P> The delay in making the title official notwithstanding, Brown is a Knoxville
treasure. If you didn't know that for the price of a cocktail at the Regas bar, for pocket change down at Lucille's, or for free at the upcoming Jazz and Blues Festival, you can see and hear a pianist whose concerts folks in
Manhattan and Paris pull strings to snag tickets to--get hip, y'all.

No Doubt</H1>
<P><STRONG>Rising from the pretty pop ashes of the Judybats, the Doubters Club is ready to flex some musical muscle</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>

<P>For Jeff Heiskell, Paul Noe and David Jenkins, connotation is everything. Losing their first record contract (with the Judybats) was like a dose of strong medicine, a bracing tonic that helped resuscitate a moribund creative entity. But the boys say the loss of deal number two, with the Doubters Club, was more akin to swallowing the proverbial bitter pill.
<P>"It ruined the winter," says singer Heiskell. "We thought we would be in the studio in February. When that didn't happen, it upset everything and set us back a good year in what we want to accomplish."
<P>When the Judybats, Knoxville's erstwhile major label darlings, limped into 1995 beset with poor sales figures and facing the dissolution of their record company (Sire), Heiskell, Jenkins and Noe anticipated the quintet's mid-spring demise and began recording some eight-track demos--new songs set a world apart stylistically from the 'Bat's lighter modern rock fare.
<P>On the strength of a recommendation from his assistant, former Sire executive Seymour Stein (now at Elektra) signed the newly christened Doubters Club in mid-'95 to a so-called development deal, an arrangement that nourishes promising new bands with studio funds and gives their major label benefactors first dibs at signing them to a full-fledged contract.
<P>But that agreement also fell by the wayside when a long-running feud between Stein and the band's old manager escalated and the notoriously capricious industry chief refused to pick up the Doubters' option at the end of the six-month deal.
<P>"What was sickly fascinating to me was that as you get up the ladder at the record company, it becomes this sort of 'king and his court' mentality," says Jenkins. "It was so much more driven by personalities than by realities. It was all crap."
<P>So how do former major label artists pick up the pieces after their rock 'n' roll dreams have been twice dashed? Fortunately for the Doubters, they still had some resources left over from their days of five-figure budgets and cash advances. For starters, the trio had nearly 30 songs in the can (financed in part by the Elektra debacle), ten of which appear on their recent do-it-yourself CD, Fleur de Lisa.
<P>They were also armed with Jenkins's newfound studio chops, honed when the drummer began amassing recording equipment even as the Judybats were losing creative steam. Jenkins recorded all of Fleur de Lisa in his basement Disgraceland studio.
<P>According to Heiskell, the new songs gave the trio a chance to break away from the gentle alt-rock stylings and artier pretensions that characterized their former band. And sure enough, Fleur de Lisa is a guitar record through and through, informed by the wide-screen arena-rock aspirations of latter-day U2 and by string-mangling textural rockers like My Bloody Valentine. (Listen for "I Blew It," a cut that features a sultry Heiskell vocal shimmying through the murk of Noe's dank proto-industrial noodling, on WNFZ-FM.)
<P>"It's all the things the Judybats weren't," says Heiskell. "I wanted to sing harder. We all wanted big guitar sounds. We wanted it to rock."
<P>Noe, who handled all guitar and bass duties on Fleur, puts it this way: "We made enough romance period paintings with the Judybats. This time we were ready to throw paint at the walls."
<P>But the Judybats four-album legacy left the Doubters with perhaps an even more important asset--old fans eager to hear new material from former members of the band. In June, Noe compiled a list of more than 400 Bathead e-mail addresses and sent each one information on the Doubters Club CD.
<P>"It's essentially e-mail junk mail," Noe laughs. "But only two people said 'Stop writing me,' so the hell with it."
<P>Surfing the wave of Noe's Internet marketing scheme (Jenkins also has his own Disgraceland web page, now with more than 800 "hits"), as well as strong sales at the Disc Exchange, the band has already sold over 320 copies of copies of Fleur de Lisa, more than recouping the album's production costs.
<P>Now the rags/riches/rags saga continues as the band sets out to prove via live performance what it has already established through its vibrant new recordings. The Doubters play Knoxville on Aug. 9 at the Mercury Theater, as well as an industry conference in New Orleans on Aug. 22 and a label showcase in New York in September. (Look for guitarist Reed Pendleton and bassist David Landeo to join the band's onstage lineup.)
<P>"If the Judybats name gets someone to buy our record or helps us get in on a showcase, that's fine with us," Noe says. "It helps us get a foot in the door. Besides, the Judybats recorded four albums together, and we did some good work. We're not afraid of our past."

<H1>Great Balls of Fire
</H1><P><STRONG>Now that his days with the Viceroys are snuffed out, John
Paul Keith
is ready to light up some TNT with The Dynamatics</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Jack Neely</EM>
<P>
A couple of years ago I was having a beer at the Bistro with some friends
who worked downtown. With a reverence people usually reserve for Genius,
they began talking about this guy named John Paul. I gathered that he was
a guitarist, singer and songwriter with some kind of eccentric brilliance
to him. They told me I should meet him, but I wasn't sure I was presentable.
<P>
Later that night we were in a lawyer's Market Street walkup, about four
of us grown men and one shy, skinny kid with big glasses. I presumed him
to be somebody's little brother, obviously not old enough to drink.
<P>
"Who was that?" I asked as he left.
<P>
"Didn't you meet him?" my friends seemed amazed at my ignorance.
"That was John Paul."
<P>
John Paul Keith is his full name, and he was indeed a mere teenager when
I didn't meet him. He was already known in some circles for his solo performances
on guitar at the Torch and the Laurel Theater, and then for a band called
the Filter Kings, which had sold 100 cassettes at Raven and had a brief
hit on WUTK called "Snakesnatch Lodge." Soon everybody knew John
Paul, lead singer and sometime songwriter for the imperial Viceroys, the
band you readers chose last spring as Knoxville's best band in both the
rock 'n' roll and country categories. The youngest Viceroy fronted the band
with surprising force and charisma.
<P>
Then, as the band was playing big shows in Nashville and Atlanta, and rumors
of a record deal were afloat, Keith quit. He spent the summer hammering
together a band of his own, with Jason Peters on drums, John Wright on bass,
and Jamie Akins on keyboards.
<P>
Most folks name their band before they learn to play their instruments,
but Keith had assembled his band, wrote a dozen new songs, and led several
rehearsals before picking a name. It's a word I'm surprised nobody has made
up before: the Dynamatics (you'd think either Motown or Chevrolet would
have made use of that one). In the very last hour of August, opening for
Southern Culture on the Skids before a sweaty, half-naked weeknight crowd
at the Mercury, Keith debuted the Dynamatics with their only cover, the
Beatles' "You Can't Do That."
<P>
Born more than a decade after it was a hit, Keith doesn't know what a big
deal the song was to some of us. The Dynamatics are smart enough to give
an icon the respect it deserves--but arrogant enough not to ruin it with
too much.
<P>
"Neverland" is a rolling, hypno-billy number that sounds like
the prehistoric Beatles, when doomed Stu played standing backwards on stage.
"Welcome to the loser's club," Keith drones, disparaging typical
beery music-show audiences. For a guy who's as shy and polite as John Paul
Keith, his lyrics have some teeth for the hands that feed him. "Janie's
lost her head again ... Drinkin' daddy's credit card and kissin' everyone
in sight." Then he apologizes, but it's not likely to make poor Janie
feel much better: "I'm sorry I'm so hateful, I can't empathize / But
I don't see a thing when I look in some people's eyes."
<P>
Fronting for the Viceroys, this scrawny guy jamming his vocals in your face
sometimes reminded people of young Elvis Costello. Without a coat and tie,
the resemblance is less obvious, but a few of Keith's songs are still
Costello-esque,
nervous, jumped-up hillbilly R&amp;B, in bitter complaints about impossibly
attractive women, e.g. "(You Got Me Jumpin') Outta My Skin." Keith
sings in a vulnerable whine that could have come out of the mountain
high-lonesome
tradition, or the Dylan/Lennon thing, or his own damn self.
<P>
When John Paul said his new band would be more R&amp;B than the Viceroys,
I
somehow pictured something funky. But he meant R&amp;B, Chess-era. "People
Will Talk" is an easy R&amp;B stroll that might have worked on big-city
race stations in '58.
<P>
But Keith's no revivalist. "I hate retro bands," he says, citing
Atlanta's rockabilly charades. If Keith's music reminds you of an era, it's
accidental. The Dynamatics' sets are blues and country and rock 'n' roll
only because everything else is inferior. "New country has no soul,
it's processed like cheese," Keith says. "'Alternative' says nothing
to me. And I don't have the attention span for anything too experimental.
Grunge bands can't play their instruments, get lot of feedback, and call
it experimental.
<P>
"I hate it all," John Paul Keith says, and smiles politely. In
spite of all the solemnly catalogued "evolution" of rock 'n' roll,
Keith says the basic forms are still the truest. "To me, there's nothing
anybody could do to improve on 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.'"
<P>
And don't think he'll be trying. Keith has seen the Killer play that one,
but it won't end up on the Dynamatics' play list. "It's a sacred cow,"
Keith says. This is one choir member who knows he can't sing louder than
the preacher.

</H1><P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>I lost control of the evening hours ago. I'm out at some godawful dumpster on one of those ugly nights where logic and cognitive function are lost in herbal haze and beery languor. Consequently, there's no escaping the gruesome
menagerie of sociopathic barflies, shambling derelicts, and malignant weirdoes
parading like so many drug-addled circus elephants through my woozy little corner of reality.
<P> My companions for the evening, members of Knoxville's El Smarto, aren't much
help. They seem to revel in this sort of madness, wallowing in it like hogs in fresh muck. After one particularly freakish outburst leads us to the brink of barroom disaster, I'm convinced that these are sick, sick men.
<P> Truth be known, watching these bozos play live is only slightly less
disconcerting. Oh, sure, their gut-level guitar pummel is plenty of fun, until some smattering of dementia or calculated dissonance drops in and throws
the whole thing into gleeful disarray. You're never quite sure whether to bang your head or scratch it.
<P> El Smarto arose like some oppressive gas bubble from the fetid, murky bowels of Fort Sanders in the torrid summer of '93, united by a love of Frank Zappa,
Mystery Science Theater 3000, and potty jokes. The band's music fuses lots of seemingly incompatible notions: discipline and chaos, succinctness and
complexity, studied songcraft and heavy rock release.
<P> "We make music for the easily bored," says guitarist Brett Winston, a gnomish
extrovert with Michael Dukakis eyebrows. "Our songs are mostly under three
minutes, without any long guitar solos or repetitive choruses. We're not going to appeal much to the sweating masses."
<P> Not unless the sweating masses favor smart pop and funk-tinged hard rock laced with Zappaesque humor and melodic subversiveness. Whether it be through
pathologically twisted riffs (one new song features a mangled fragment lifted
from the Knack's arena-punk chestnut "My Sharona") or warped song titles like "Creetorsweamy" and "Hemorrhoid Games," El Smarto just can't seem to play it straight.
<P> "We started out as the Carbuncle All-Stars, but our bass player Bill adamantly
opposed that name," says Winston. "Right now we're putting together an acoustic
set--we're going to call it Unplugged-o."
<P> The aforementioned bass player, Bill Ardison, a lanky, dread-locked virtuoso, is the only band member missing from this perilous little rendezvous. His mates are visibly nervous when I inquire as to his whereabouts. After several
cryptic responses and much anxious whispering, they feed me some half-baked story about a journey of self-discovery to the jungles of Belize. After a month of bugs-and-bark subsistence, he's supposed to return to play some local gigs.
<P> "Our biggest goal as a band right now is to release a CD sometime next summer,"
says spitfire vocalist Mike Walls, eager to change the subject. "After that, we'd like to release our own box set, complete with B-sides and rarities."
<P> In the meantime, El Smarto is circulating a ten-song demo of raw but tuneful
heavy weirdness. Walls is in fine form, his belting both vicious and soulful over the quirky din. Two songs, "Creetorsweamy" and "Sanpo" have received airplay on WUTK.
<P> "Our tape really wasn't meant to be played," says drummer Jason Ratliff. (Along with his brother, guitarist/keyboardist Bo Ratliff, Jason often provides
sober yin to Winston's and Walls's madcap yang. "It was a cheap recording made at an early practice. We'd like to release the CD in order to more
accurately reflect what we're about--and that's applying a Zappa mentality to three-minute heavy pop songs."
<P> El Smarto has an awkward but viable chemistry. On this night, the Ratliffs are buoys of coherence in a sea of chaos and delirium. On-stage, their low-key
demeanors and disciplined rhythmic interplay anchor the looser, edgier presence
of their bandmates. Like its music, El Smarto's core is tight and solid, while the outside is free-form and loopy.
<P> "Bo and Jay have an innate ability to pick up on unusual rhythms, more so than even some very well-schooled musicians we've known," Winston explains. "Bo is so proficient on guitar that he can instantly nail any mood we need to convey--he also single-handedly rescued the Dalai Lama from Tibet with nothing but a Bowie knife and masking tape. Not many people know that about him."
<P> I ooze back down into the booth, almost relieved that the spell of solemnity has once again been broken. I'm in no condition to ponder anything more serious
than raising mug to mouth. Walls is starting to lose his grip; he's in the throes of some manic fever-dream--something about ritual sacrifices and
professional wrestling.
<P> "But we really are serious about making this band work," interjects the
heretofore silent Bo Ratliff. "If we didn't do this, we'd all have to go back to college."

</H1><P><STRONG>The untold story of two rock-and-roll legends coming of age in Knoxville</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Lee Gardner</EM>
<P>If you've been in the lobby of the Bijou Theater downtown, you've probably
noticed the gallery of paintings that constitutes the East Tennessee Hall of Fame for the Performing Arts--James Agee, Dolly Parton, John Cullum, Roy
Acuff, David Keith and the others. But you won't find a picture of a couple of skinny, jug-eared guys who are among the most beloved artists ever to live in this area. No, for a gander at their picture, you'll have to visit
another wall entirely.
<P>There's been a picture of a family wearing cowboy suits tacked up on the wall of the old Long Branch Saloon on Cumberland Avenue as long as I've been
going in there. There's a tall, rough-cut man with a wild swoop of hair seated
behind a demure, smiling woman. Flanking them are a couple of grinning kids,
obviously related, wearing cowboy hats and holding guitars almost as big as they are.
<P>One night I just had to ask. "Oh yeah, that's the Everly Brothers," the
barkeep answered, shaking a rag in the direction of the snap. "They used to live around here."
<P>I was hooked. The premiere brother act from the early days of
rock-and-roll--the twined voices behind hits like "Bird Dog," "Wake Up Little
Susie" and "When Will I be Loved"--had lived in my hometown. But you'd probably
never learn more about the subject no matter how thoroughly you combed local
libraries and newspaper morgues or quizzed even the most trivia-obsessed drinking companions. In fact, you can open just about any one of the numerous
biographies of the Everlys and come up with at best a page or two on Knoxville.
They went to West High, they were on the radio, they left for Nashville ... the rest is history. Even in the excellent and extensively annotated Everly boxed set Heartaches &amp; Harmonies (Rhino), the Everlys are in and out of Knoxville in a paragraph.
<P>It was obvious that there had to be more to the story. And there was.
<H3>Roots
</H3><P>Ike Everly had mined coal in the Muhlenberg County area of western
Kentucky he and his wife Margaret called home, but Ike manhandled a guitar far better than a pickax. (He and a man named Mose Rager pioneered a style of thumb-picked guitar playing that they taught to a local guy named Merle
Travis, who would in turn popularize it for practically every country and
bluegrass musician who followed. But that's another story.) By the time their
first child, a boy they named Donald, was born in 1937, Ike was ready to try his luck at music full-time.
<P>In those days, radio featured live music and comedy, and Ike and Margaret did short segments on the radio first in Chicago (where a second son, Phillip,
was born in 1939), then in Shenandoah, Iowa. After Don joined the act at age seven, and Phil followed, they were billed as the Everly Family. They played daily half-hour shows of country and old-time music, featuring Ike's the jovial brio and amazing guitar picking, Margaret's steady support, and the beginnings of Don and Phil's precocious harmonies--the sound that would later define their music.
<P>But the '50s were bringing a lot of changes to radio and the music business.
Now that the wartime rationing of materials was over, records were being pressed at, uh, record rate. At the same time, radio stations were beginning to find it more economical to pay one person to play those records than to pay ten people to play live music. Then there was this guy from Memphis--but
let's not get ahead of ourselves. Suffice it to say that the local live radio
shows that had been the m&eacute;tier of the Everly Family for over a decade
seemed to be fading, at least in the Midwest.
<P>"We were familiar, of course, with the Grand Ole Opry, and of course that was really the big time," Don Everly recalls from his home in Nashville. "We had also heard about WROL in Knoxville, so we packed the car up and left in September of '53. We came down, auditioned, and got the job on Cas Walker's
show--$90 a week for all four of us."
<H3>Happy Days
</H3><P>The Everlys soon established themselves on the local airwaves as
down-home favorites, performing a live half-hour show every weekday morning, plus an afternoon show on Wednesdays. The family moved into a little red house on Sutherland Avenue where Jason's Cafe stands now, and Don enrolled as a sophomore in the Class of '55 at West High School just down the street. Phil would join him there a year later.
<P>"I loved West High School," Don recalls. "The people were so friendly--a
little bit of that Southern hospitality. And in Iowa I think they always
considered me a guitar-playing hillbilly anyway. When I got down to Knoxville, I seemed to fit in a little bit more."
<P>The Everly brothers may have gotten closer to their family roots in the South, but they had taken to a few uptown ways during their sojourn in the
Midwest. Don and Phil entered West High sporting twin ducktail hairdos, pomped
high and glinting with hair-oil sheen. 
<P>"The ducktails and the long hair, I took to that. The black and the pink, the turned-up collar, and that whole look--that was me," Don Everly recalls. "And it still is, to be perfectly honest with you. I don't have the ducktails
now, but I've got the turned-up collar. It was an attitude, but it wasn't a bad one."
<P>The brothers' hair certainly got them, well, noticed. "I thought of them as just standard kids ... with too-long hair," recalls Joan Parker McReynolds, a classmate of Don's. "Back in those days ... Well, when Elvis Presley came on the scene, everybody said, 'That man is wicked.' And all the other guys didn't have that much hair. So there was an element of questionability about
these boys because of these huge, voluminous hairdos."
<P>Their hair made the brothers notorious in other ways as well. During Phil's
tenure on the lower rungs of the basketball team, his mop inspired an incident
which would have kept him in the minds of his classmates even if he hadn't wound up on The Ed Sullivan Show.
<P>"As Phil would run up and down the court, his hair would be floppin'
everywhere, getting sweaty and stringy and falling in his eyes," local
businessman Gene Easterday recalls. "Coach [Walter] Ganz told him he was going to have to have his hair cut. Phil said he couldn't because he was in his father's act. And Coach Ganz, just off the wall, said, 'Either you're
going to cut it or wear a hair net ...'
<P>"Phil was kind of a jokester, so the next game, he showed up with a hair net. He had the girls falling out of the stands, cause he'd be running down the court and he'd just stop and pull that hair net out and stuff his hair back up in it when it'd come loose. He was just doing it to aggravate Coach
Ganz."
<P>Easterday has lot of fond memories of the Everlys. A year ahead of Don at West, he drove a two-tone gray '51 Chevy two-door, while the brothers rode around town in a two-tone green version. The three of them became friends,
parking their twin cars side by side in the parking lot in front of West every morning before school, hashing with other buds about, of all things, music.
<P>"They'd argue for country and western music, and we'd argue for popular
music," Easterday recounts with a chuckle. "I guess they proved their point one way or another ... Or I guess they proved my point, cause they were more
popular in popular music than they were in country music when they first started.
<P>"They were just typical guys," Easterday repeats, echoing nearly everyone I spoke with. "Phil was more outgoing, the fun-lovin' type, and Don was the
quieter, more serious of the two."
<P>And what about the fraternal tensions that would escalate into a full-scale
split for 10 years in the '70s? Did they fight? "No more than any other brothers,
no. They were typical brothers--most of the time they got along fine.
Occasionally one or the other would cross the other's path, but it would never last long."
<P>Easterday says that the Cumberland Avenue strip was the big hangout back then. In the days before the Long Branch, Evil Eye Video and the Sunspot Cafe, there were hot spots like Ballis' Poolroom, the Booth Theater and Karns
Drugstore. There was a little record store right up from the Campus Barber Shop, so you could tend to your coif and check out the new sounds in one trip. Don Everly has similar memories of life after class.
<P>"The pool hall, the drugstore and the record shop. I had a girlfriend, so drive-ins and dances. We had quite a little social life there at West High. It was just like the '50s scenes like you used to watch on Happy Days.
That's very typical. The girls had their social clubs, and the boys had theirs.
They would have dances and there'd be box suppers and that sort of thing. It was sort of structured fun and pretty innocent and very good."
<H3>Then They Met Chet
</H3><P>Like a lot of high school students, then and now, when they weren't out with their friends the Everly brothers spent a lot of their spare time
mooning around the house, playing guitar. But unlike most of their fellow teen musicians, Don and Phil had been professionals for half their lives. And they wanted to keep playing music for the rest of their lives. During their time in Knoxville they took the first important steps towards that goal.
<P>Chet Atkins played the Tennessee Valley Fair the fall the Everlys arrived in Knoxville. Atkins and Ike Everly had been corresponding, and certainly knew of each other's reputations as hot pickers, though Ike definitely had the seniority. So Ike brought his boys down to the fairgrounds to meet Atkins.
The family was still struggling, and Ike and the boys couldn't afford admission
to the show. They ended up having one of the most fateful conversations of their lives through a chain-link fence near the backstage area. 
<P>"I was writing songs, and so Chet said if we got to Nashville, sure, he'd
listen to some of our songs," Don recalls. "So we went to Nashville that summer, and played some of the songs for Chet, and he liked 'em! He had a few suggestions, but he was encouraging, and he said he'd publish them if he could get them recorded."
<P>Though Atkins was not yet the all-powerful force in Nashville that he would soon become, his encouragement gave the boys hope. While they waited for their big break, they continued their schooling, playing their shows on WROL and picking at a few school functions and parties. Their musical life was low-key enough that several former classmates I spoke with for this
article say they didn't even know the brothers were on the radio. "I played at a couple of assemblies--maybe once or twice," Don says, "but really I just stuck with my writing, which is what I was doing a lot of."
<P>By the time his senior year rolled around, Don's writing started to pay off, big-time. Kitty Wells had decided to cut one of those songs he had left off with Atkins all those months before. Miss Kitty Wells, the Honky-Tonk Angel, the number one female country star in the whole damn USA, was going to record a song that he, Don Everly, had written. "Thou Shalt Not Steal" would hit the Country Top Ten that year.
<P>"When you look at a record with your name on it for the first time, that means you're in the record business and you are a songwriter, and that is the most important thing," Don says now. "I was just a teenager. It was a real important step for me. It gave me a lot of confidence."
<H3>Catherine
</H3><P>Though they sang lots of songs sweeter, many remember the Everly Brothers primarily for 1960's number one hit "Cathy's Clown." It's not hard to hear why. The song's jaunty march-like rhythm and wailing harmonies make the lyric picture, of a doormat getting walked on by his conniving beloved,
indelible. Well, that Don-penned smash might have ended up as "Mary's Clown" were it not for his high school girlfriend, a West student named Catherine Coe.
<P>There are a lot of disagreements and vague memories about Don and Catherine,
including their own. He says they met in art class; she says they met on a blind date. Several friends paint him as being somewhat of a ladies' man; she insists they dated almost the whole time they were together at West. No one disagrees that they were a couple for some time.
<P>Now married and living in Florida, Catherine Coe Kennedy seems somewhat
reluctant to talk about the subject. She has only vague memories of going to the movies with the gang, going to football games, attending dances and
parties thrown by the various student social clubs. She remembers a near crash on an icy road averted by Don's expert driving. She remembers Don and his brother playing a "rock-and-roll thing" at a party "It was the first time I'd heard them play that kind of music--it went over very well," she
recalls.
<P>Whatever problems they might have had during Don's turbulent senior year, they resolved them all by graduation. The one division they couldn't defeat was the miles between his dreams of Nashville and her plan to stay in Knoxville,
so they parted ways. Nevertheless, she says it never fazed her when she heard her name jump out of the chorus of one of her old boyfriend's hits.
<P>"I didn't even realize it for years," she says. "I didn't connect it with me at all. They'd been gone several years and met lots of girls by then--and not just little Tennessee girls. I didn't find out about it having anything to do with me until six or seven years ago."
<P>As for Don's part, he is at pains to point out that he just used the name,
that the song is in no way a comment on their relationship. He just happened to be thinking of his old flame one day while working on songs, and "'Catherine's
Clown' didn't sound right."
<H3>Jumpin'-Up-And-Down Music
</H3><P>The music to go with the Everlys' ducktails was rolling across the state from Memphis by the summer of 1954. A God-fearing white kid with long,
greasy hair and a pimp's wardrobe had seized on an old blues tune as a goof and found it to his liking. But for the flipside of "That's Alright Mama," Elvis Presley picked on Bill Monroe's hallowed "Blue Moon of Kentucky." Elvis
wasn't the only Tennessee boy catching a bad case of rockin' pneumonia and having trouble respecting the already-fluid boundaries between country music and "race music."
<P>"Phillip and I were singing country stuff on the radio show, but as we were teenagers, we're going to be influenced by what was happening in the music scene at that point," Don remembers. "I'd been exposed to rhythm and blues, because my father played rhythm and blues. And then right up from the Campus Barber Shop was a record store. I went in there and listened to Bo Diddley, and my life wasn't the same after that."
<P>With all those teen hormones and jungle beats racing through their veins, its not hard to see why the younger half of the Everly Family might start to find the traditional family show a little constraining. By the time that Elvis was beginning to scandalize the rest of the nation, the brothers were
itching to inject some more of that rockin', rollin' feeling into what Don
describes as "duets, quartets, solos and a hymn at the end for the shut-ins." But Cas Walker, grocer, politician, impresario and local legend, was not a man to brook controversy. Not on his show.
<P>"Their daddy and mother was country music," the ailing but still feisty Walker recalls from the easy chair in his Gaston Avenue home. "But [Don and Phil] started to play all this ... I call it jumpin'-up-and-down music.
<P>"I had all different kinds of music [on my show], but I called it 'country
music,' and it is country music, and the Good Lord didn't mean for it to be any other way. I said you can't have that jumpin'-up-and-down music on my show--it won't sell no groceries.
<P>"I don't want it to sound like I'm making fun of it, I didn't mean to
downgrade anybody. I tried to be fair about it. But I told 'em that I couldn't
have none of this jumpin'-up-and-down music. That's the bad thing about anybody
in the public eye--you can't tell them what to do."
<P>No one I spoke with can (or will) elaborate on what exactly the Everlys did or didn't do, or what was the last straw. And even Don uses phrases like
"sort of fired" and "sort of canned" to describe what happened next. But for whatever reason, the Everly Family found themselves out of work at WROL.
<P>"One day he just decided we weren't quite suitable," Don says now. "Actually,
he kept calling us Yankees--he didn't think we were Southern enough."
<P>Walker will only say that the Everly Brothers have somewhat misrepresented
their "firing." "They was very much for me, but then they come back and tried to correct it," he maintains. "These boys have went out and give some good
stories--I didn't resent it. But I think it came out all right."
<P>It did indeed come out all right, but not without some struggle. Ike and
Margaret, having seen the writing on the studio wall, had already enrolled in barber school and beautician's school, respectively. But being forced to leave WROL was a tremendous blow--after all, every member of the family had lost a job simultaneously. Don remembers that he went down to the Tennessee
Theater on Gay Street, sunk down in a seat under the deep blue dome, and sat through Three Coins in a Fountain, barely noticing Clifton Webb and Dorothy
MacGuire from the depth of his depression.
<H3>All I Have to Do Is Dream
</H3><P>Things didn't look too good for the Everly Family. Not only were they out of a job, but it was going to be hard to find a similar gig to replace
it. Rumor has it that Ike took work as superintendent/ custodian of the apartment
house on Scenic Drive they had moved into six months after arriving in Knoxville.
<P>"That kind of radio we were doing, that half-hour family show was plain old dying," Don says. "There wasn't really anything to regret--it was just gone." 
<P>"We had been somewhere one day and we were going down to their apartment,"
Easterday says. "When we got there and walked up on the porch, Don checked the mailbox, and he was real happy. There was a check in there from Chet Atkins." The royalties for Kitty Wells's recording of Don's songs had finally
come through--to the tune of a couple thousand dollars, a big chunk of change in 1955.
<P>"That was the money that really saved us," Don says. "Our savings were gone, Mom and Dad were still in school, and that check just covered us enough to get us through. It was really a godsend--I don't know what we would have done without it."
<P>Ike finally secured a job manning the shears at the Campus Barber Shop, but Don and Phil were already looking beyond the confines of Knoxville. That
spring, the boys began to harden their resolve: they would go on to Nashville to try their luck as a duo as soon as Don graduated.
<P>"I think it was just mutually agreed upon that if the boys could become
teenage heartthrobs, why, they could advance a lot quicker," says Easterday. "I think [Ike and Margaret] just figured the boys had a better chance than they did. After all, they'd been at it for years."
<P>"I wasn't that great a student, and I was being rushed into university rush parties my senior year," Don recalls. "Mr. Love, the principal, called me into his office, and he asked, 'Don, are you planning on going to college?' I knew what he was talking about--my grades. And I said, 'No'--and it was the first time I admitted to myself that I wasn't going--'No, we're going to Nashville and try to get on the Grand Ole Opry.' So he said, 'Well, I'm going to graduate you, but if you were going to college you'd have to go to summer school.' But he was very sweet. I really appreciated that I got to graduate with my class.
<P>"The day after I graduated from West High, we got in the car and came to Nashville and started out. Mom stayed here and my Dad went to Indiana and was working up there for a year or so. But we stuck it out in Nashville."
<P>They scuffled around Music City, hanging out at the Ryman, trying to get
noticed. They scrimped and starved and wrote more songs. Finally, Chet Atkins
helped them get a deal with Columbia Records resulting in a single called "Keep A-Lovin' Me" in 1956. Never heard of it? Neither did anyone else at the time. 
<P>It would be almost another year before the brothers would hook up with Cadence Records and the songs of Boudleaux and Felice Bryant. The successful
songwriting couple and longtime Gatlinburg residents were shopping some songs
around Nashville. One of them had been passed over numerous times by country big shots, but someone in the Everly camp liked it, and they cut it with Chet Atkins on guitar. "Bye Bye Love," released in march of 1957, would hit
number one on the country chart, number two on the pop chart, and even number
five on the R&amp;B chart. 
<P>The Everly Brothers fulfilled and surpassed their original dream of appearing
on the Grand Ole Opry. They rode a hot streak of hits that ran into the '60s,
recording some of the most-treasured love songs in the rock-and-roll canon (many of the finest written by the Bryants). As documented amply on the
Heartaches &amp; Harmonies box, they continued to record excellent music up through the '80s.
<P>In addition to their recorded contribution, they were a seminal influence on future generations of rock-and-rollers through those eerie velveteen brotherly
harmonies. A sound so rooted in the country tradition yet so inalienably
beautiful, it would echo again and again: in Britain of the early '60s, L.A. of the mid to late '60s, and Nashville just about any time of the day or night since '57.
<P>And you can still hear the real thing--they continue to tour the country year after year.
<P>Back in Knoxville, people were astounded that those skinny, long-haired Everly boys had actually gone off and become famous like they said they were
going to. "I knew they were good singers, and I knew they were trying awful hard at it, but I don't guess any of us thought that Don and Phil would go as far as they did," Easterday admits. "They did, though. They did. That was probably what allowed them to do it, cause they knew. They knew in their own minds that, buddy, they were going to make it. And I think that's why they did make it, because they worked really hard--they sure did.
<P>And Don can finally say, after all these years, that "Cas Walker probably did us a favor by firing us."
<H3>Walk Right Back
</H3><P>The Everly Brothers' last official visit in Knoxville was in 1992. They played a show at the same Tennessee Theater that Don had brooded in over 40 years before, singing the kind of pop songs they had first started doing a few miles to the west, the kind of tunes that might have gotten them
escorted off of Cas Walker's show all over again--if he still had one.
<P>By all accounts it was practically a West High reunion, with former classmates
crowding backstage after the show to chat about old times with the delighted
brothers. Don remarked on the last occasion he had been in the theater to the crowd during the performance, but now, as he says, "It's a bittersweet
memory, because here I come back playing it many years later, very happy, my life's really good. I meet a lot of my old friends there, and they get to see me do what I was doing then."
<P>Phil Everly actually came back to town once before, in the very early '60s. According to Easterday, Phil ferried some musician friends over from
Nashville in his Jaguar sedan. While his friends played a gig, he looked up Easterday and some other old buddies, and they spent a few hours catching up at the Tennessean (now Sam &amp; Andy's). Then he dropped by Ballis' Poolroom
to shoot a few games.
<P>Some guys at the pool hall started calling up women that they knew to casually drop that they were currently crossing cues with the by-then
world-famous Phil Everly. When the women called them liars, they'd drawl, "Wanna bet?" Then, according to Easterday, Phil accompanied his old cronies
around town as they collected their dollar bets before he hopped in his Jag and jetted back off to Music City.
<P>Don Everly says that while he hasn't really visited except to play the 1992 show, he has driven through on his way to the Smokies, pausing to look over the vanished places on the Strip where he once shot pool, where his father once cut hair, where he and Catherine might have tarried on a Saturday
night, where the Bo Diddley beat once changed his life.
<P>Stop by anytime, fellas.

</H1><P><STRONG>Armed with nothing more than crazy grins and pummeling, bubble-gum punk, Facedown is on a mission to knock sensitive ponytail men right out of their Birkenstocks</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>The Magic Bean is a ramshackle little coffee house on the outskirts of Cookeville, a converted residence and part-time club where quiet little combos play sensitive strains for sandal-shod Tennessee Tech students.
<P>Needless to say, when spike-haired Facedown guitarist Tom Appleton walked in one Saturday evening lugging a massive Marshall amp and a flame-red Ibanez guitar, he drew lots of mortified stares.
<P>"'The last band played so loud I couldn't get the cappuccino machine to work,'" Appleton squeaks, mimicking the Bean's diminutive Deadhead proprietor. "I looked over at the rest of the guys and said, 'We're going to put the fear of God in this little hippie.' They thought they were getting Hector Qirko or something, and we whacked them upside the head."
<P>It's not hard to see how Appleton, a former Golden Gloves fighter, U.S. Army Ranger, and part-time kickboxer, might intimidate gentle residents of the Birkenstock nation. Manic and saucer-eyed, his pugilistic predilections are reflected in his spastic manner and run-on speech.
<P>They're also evident in his band's music. Influenced as much by Jackie Chan chop-socky flicks as by his punk-rock heroes--All and Bad Religion--Appleton is a six-string dervish, whipping out stuttering, speed-bag rhythms and haymaker fills. With Dustin West's relentless drumming providing rock-in-the-glove reinforcement, Facedown tunes pack a potent, punkish wallop.
<P>Facedown was born over the 1994 Christmas holiday when West and his cousin, bassist Scott West, met Appleton at an Oak Ridge movie theater. Appleton (formerly of Bad Reality) was the only member with experience in the club scene trenches, so the trio tapped veteran belter Mike Walls to man the microphone.
<P>A year and a half later, Facedown might just be Knoxville's best-kept secret. Shackled by conflicting schedules, the band can only play shows on Saturday nights.
<P>But if they ever solve their day-job puzzle, watch out, because theirs is perhaps the most infectious spring-loaded garage rock to rattle roachy Fort Sanders tenements since that little band with the Supername headlined its first backyard triple-kegger. Beyond its shiv-to-the-temple impact, Facedown's music boasts an adhesive melodicism, an insistent hummability that leaves songs like "Quality Time" or the effervescent "Train Song" bouncing around your cranium for hours--sometimes days--after the revelatory first listen.
<P>"We like intense, high-energy music that's still melodic and in tune," says singer Mike Walls. "You walk away and you're singing the songs even though you just got smacked."
<P>That hyper-melodic punch comes in part from bassist West. An exceptionally tuneful four-stringer, he roams the instrument's upper register, weaving concise, ear-pleasing melodies beneath Appleton's bruising onslaught.
<P>But most of Facedown's monster hooks come courtesy of Walls, former voxman for HyperTribe and El Smarto. That might come as a surprise to local music fans. A raw-throated barker during his thrashy, flashy tribal years, Walls was never regarded as a singer so much as a frontman--a raucous embellishment to the pounding complexity of his bandmates' virtuoso grooves.
<P>Not so in Facedown. Like a schoolboy at recess, Walls tears through Appleton's crackling changes with gleeful abandon, laying down sugar-coated melodies and heart-on-the-sleeve lyrics that might seem precious if set to music that didn't pack such a mulish kick.
<P>On "Quality Time," a driving rocker with a syrupy red herring of an intro, Walls manages to sound at once wistful and bouncy, building an earnest tension that he fairly explodes in the chorus, an exuberant wraparound vocal duet with Appleton.
<P>"I'm finally in a situation where I feel like I have some say-so in the songs," Walls explains. "I don't feel like I have to structure my vocals around the rest of the band."
<P>"When I write a song, I do it with vocals in mind," Appleton adds. "We try to give Mike lots of room for vocal hooks, and he almost always comes up with something that's better than what I had envisioned."
<P>But with gigs few and far between, not too many people have been exposed to Facedown's particular brand of bubble-gum pummel. The band plans to release a tape sometime this summer in hopes of remedying that problem. They're also trying to rearrange schedules so they can play shows at new venues on something other than a Saturday night.
<P>"We want to terrify the Amsterdam crowd," Appleton enthuses, his eyes growing wide and his head twitching. "No more of that hipped-out crap they've been listening to--we're going to rattle the tables."
<P>When that happens, it's a sure bet there'll be lots more Facedown fans in Knoxville, because no matter how much the music roughs you up and knocks you down, you're bound to dust yourself off and come back for more. Just ask the folks at the Magic Bean. Facedown plays Cookeville again next week, and this time even the tie-dyes are ready to rumble.

Deluge of Creativity</H1>
<STRONG>Immortal Chorus and Sandbox have dried up, but now there's a Flood</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>

<P>Though they flocked together (at Flamingo's, Mercury Theater, et al) and ruled the same roost (Knoxville), Immortal Chorus and Sandbox were hardly birds of a feather. The late, lamented local troupes shared a penchant for pummeling riffs and shared the marquee on several festival-sized bills. Otherwise, Sandbox's grungy post-punk rumble and IC's brooding neo-Gothic pageantry were set many musical and aesthetic worlds apart.
<P>At first gander, anyway. But if you took the time to peek under IC voxman Steve Britton's enveloping warble, or to strip away the 'box's keening metallicisms, you may have noticed a kinship, a shared affinity for Promethean riffs leavened by textural ether and atmospheric washes of sound. 
<P>Small wonder, then, that when attrition took its inevitable toll on the two long-running bands in 1995, Sandbox guitarists Todd Ethridge and Marc Inocco found kindred spirits in IC's John Tipton (bass) and Joel Stooksbury (drums).
<P>Singer Ethridge doesn't believe his new outfit, Flood, bears much resemblance to either of the bands that birthed it. "People assume we sound like a combination of the two," he says. "But other than having the same vocals as Sandbox, I don't think there's much similarity."
<P>For the most part, he's right. Flood is lighter on its feet than either of its predecessors; brighter, punchier, less apt to founder in its own bludgeoning drone. Traces of power pop, pogo, and post-punk pepper the band's otherwise bottom-heavy thump, making for melodic, texturally diverse hard rock with a polished, radio-friendly sheen.
<P>It's a tribute to Flood's collective songwriting acumen that none of its influences figures too heavily in the mix. Inocco calls his music "noise with a direction," and while that description might seem a little vague, it hints at the band's seamless but potent chemistry.
<P>Listen to Flood's new four-song (locally released) cassette, and you'll swear you've heard all of it somewhere before. But as you bang your head, tap your foot, and hum right along to driving modern rock anthems like "Everything" and "Empty Pool," you won't for the life of you be able to figure out where.
<P>"When I'm writing a melody, I think of bands like Cheap Trick; they were really poppy, but they really rocked," says Ethridge, who also pays homage to '80s mood-rockers the Psychedelic Furs. "We've talked a lot about the kind of stuff we like and what we want to head toward. What we're looking for is a good melody but a hard edge--something with some energy and some gut behind it."
<P>What the foursome have held over from previous projects (Ethridge was also a member of longtime local metal stalwarts The Innocent Ones, and Inocco is likewise well-traveled) has less to do with music than with life experience--the battle scars wrought in a decade of fighting in rock's grubby small-town trenches.
<P>"After you've been around a while and had a little bit of local success, it gets frustrating when you can't get to the next level," says Tipton. "It's become an obsession now--I'd really like to be in a band that earned a record contract."
<P>Adds Inocco, "I think we're all at a point where we're looking for something to justify all the work we've done over the years."
<P>Toward that end, Ethridge says the Floodmen now have the savvy to go with the sound. The band wants to build a fan base quickly, so they've kept their egos in check and accepted lots of supporting slots on bills with a guaranteed draw. You may have already seen them open for the likes of D.C. punkers Jawbox, or popular husband-and-wife alterna-rockers Fleming and John. Look for other upcoming gigs with Jason and the Scorchers and Movement, the L.A.-by-way-of Knoxville band best known in these parts as Hypertribe.
<P>"We're looking to play with national acts and local bands who already have an audience," says Tipton. "Headlining doesn't mean anything. I'd rather open a big show with a good crowd than headline in front of 50 people."
<P>Plans are also in the works for a full-length local CD to be released sometime in 1997--and don't be surprised if the disc exposes some new wrinkles in the fabric of Flood's sound. While Inocco played with Stooksbury and Tipton when the band coalesced last January, he didn't join the official roster until late summer. And according to Ethridge, his long-time bandmate's deft, rhythmically-charged guitar stylings are just beginning find a place in the mix. In that respect, he adds, some of that old familiar Sandbox chemistry may yet figure into the fledgling quartet's musical evolution.
<P>"Marc brings in a lot of punk energy and a lot of real unique guitar sounds, so we're probably going to change a little," Ethridge says. "He and I always clicked well together in our last band.
<P>"That's one of the things this band has had going for it from the start--we click well together, like we're all gravitating toward the same style. It's like we've finally found the right pieces of the puzzle."

</H1><P><STRONG>Proving that more is more, Gran Torino are a funkadelic excercise
in excess</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>A couple of weeks ago, my gal and I went to see this new band we'd been
hearing about, Gran Torino. We'd missed them once before, and heard they
had something good going on with a horn section, of all things. So we got
to the club and, wouldn't you know it, about 400 other people had heard the
same thing. Bands that are only six months old are usually just beginning
to develop their own crowd. But here was a band just that old, and the joint
was packed. Obviously, the secret is out.
<P>
Gran Torino are, of course, a crowd themselves--there are nine of them in
all. "I don't think people are used to seeing this many people onstage,"
says vocalist and occasional second guitar Chris Ford.
<P>
Heck, some bands aren't used to seeing that many people in their audience.
While a "horn section" in a lot of your modern lounge-rock acts means one
guy with a saxophone, Gran Torino carries around risers just to give the
horn section room. And they need room, too, because these guys move. There's
no parking on the dance floor, but the back of the stage is a tow-away zone,
too.
<P>
Besides Ford, the band roster includes Stephen Decker on guitar, Todd Overstreet
on bass, the Pfohl brothers, Whit and John, on drums and percussion respectively,
P. J. Alexander on trumpet and fl&uuml;gelhorn, Scott Pederson on trumpet
and fl&uuml;gelhorn, Jason "Chocolate" Thompson on sax and Dexter Murphy
on trombone and keyboards. Try saying all that three time fast.  Or try hanging
out at their practice pad and getting a word in edgewise with nine guys on
the same vibe. Communication is key to any band's personal dynamic, but its
become a way of life with this gang.
<P>
While it might be novel to see a Knoxville band go beyond the four-piece,
they make it clear that they are no novelty act. "Somebody said that to me
the other day," says Ford. "'It's so great to come see you guys, it's like
a novelty or something.' I said 'Now, wait a minute.' We also object to being
called 'funk.'"
<P>
They came together last August when P. J. Alexander heard music coming from
Overstreet's house, where the roots of Gran Torino were forming. "I walked
over there one day to see what was going on," laughs Alexander, "and I was
in the band after that."
<P>
"I was in the all-states jazz band with Jason," says Decker. "I called him
up and it just kind of snowballed after we got him."
<P>
"Is that a racist term?" asks John Pfohl, to everyone's amusement. It should
be noted that Gran Torino is one of Knoxville's only interracial bands (for
the record, it's decided that "snowball" is more of a sexual term).
<P>
What this ensemble produces, besides constant non-sequiturs, is smooth big-band
soul, a country mile from the groove rock Ford and Overstreet played in their
last band, Freeway. You can see the horn players communicate with each other
in concert, like an ongoing conversation in Tower of Power brass, charging
up the beefy rhythm laid down by Overstreet and the Pfohls. Filling out the
sonic picture, the melodies from Decker's spiced-jazzy guitar and Murphy's
occasional turns at the keyboard add another rich texture to the Gran Torino
sound.
<P>
Ford is charismatic as the front man. His vocals range from a (dare I say)
funky drawl to a damn strong falsetto, in the classic British blue-eyed soul
tradition. He doesn't grandstand, though--his voice is one more complement
to the music. Actually, no one grandstands in Gran Torino. They are a bona
fide ensemble, and this, again, comes from their ability to communicate.
<P>
"Me and Todd have been in some rock bands in town that weren't really what
we wanted to do," says Ford. "But we weren't very good at expressing our
opinions to other rock musicians. Then we met these guys, and they're like
computers or something. You can hum something to them and they can print
it right out of their head."
<P>
"I object to being referred to as a computer," interjects Thompson in mock
umbrage.
<P>
"The rhythm section didn't come from 'real' training," says Overstreet. "These
guys (the horn players) did come from real training. So the more they teach
us about music, the more we teach them about rock 'n' roll."
<P>
The night I visited them, they were all learning a thing or two from UT music
professor Don Hough. He listened to their practice and offered them some
pointers on dynamics and arrangement. Not every band would have paid much
mind to advice from the "straight" school of music, especially a band as
together as this one. But the Gran Torino guys don't seem to channel their
confidence into know-it-all arrogance. When Hough tells them about taking
it to "another level," they soak it all in--that's exactly where they want
to go.
<P>
And they're about to take a big step toward another level. The band is headed
for Los Angeles this summer in their customized, Partridge-style school bus,
complete with sofas, bunk beds and a new brake job.
<P>
Later, when I was reviewing my tape of our conversation and their jam session,
I discovered a special message from saxophone player Jason "Chocolate" Thompson
which offered me my final insight into the Gran Torino vibe. He apparently
recorded it while I was checking out the tour bus.
<P>
"Ah, this is Chocolate speaking," he says.  "I just want you to know--I love
these guys, man."

</H1><P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM>
<P>Not too many decades ago, almost all music in America was discernibly
regional. Listening to 78s, you could tell which blues singers were from Arkansas and which were from South Carolina by their dialect. If they played
guitar, they walked between chords differently. In some backwater Southern
counties, they even strung their guitars differently.
<P> The rabid expansion of international media like MTV and Rolling Stone has thrown regional music into a huge, commercial Cuisinart. Any East Tennessee
songwriter who wants to sell a record to Sony these days figures he's got to sound the way they do in Bakersfield, Nashville, L.A. or New York. Regional
music has practically become the stuff of anthropology.
<P> Hector Qirko fronts the Knoxville blues band that bears his name. Justifiably
content with the part-time market and fan base he's cultivated here in the land of bluegrass, Qirko doesn't aim his songs at Rush Street or Brooklyn. He and his band have given Knoxville a distinctive, local blues voice the likes of which it hasn't really had since the long gone McGhee brothers.
<P> Qirko, who was born in New York and raised in South America, says that while the blues isn't an art form many would associate with East Tennessee, Knoxville
is as good for him as any place else. And since he learned the blues while
growing up in different countries in South America, he's used to considering his music out of context.
<P> "Knoxville's a great place to write the blues, but any place is a great place,"
says Qirko. "Everyone has feelings about something or other that could be called the blues. We try to write and sing about those that are relevant to us.
<P> "If I were born here and had been raised here, I'd probably play bluegrass, which I love dearly, and think is related to blues in a lot of ways. But I was in South America, which isn't much of a blues place either. I learned the blues by listening to rock-and-roll records my father brought back from the states. Hendrix, Clapton, the Allman Brothers--that's how I got introduced to the blues without really knowing what it was."
<P> The Hector Qirko Band, with its current lineup of Jim Williams on bass, Steve
Brown on drums and Dirk Weddington on sax, has been together for six years. The bulk of "local" bands (no matter the locus) often see recordings as label
bait, to be hopefully cast into the hopeless quagmire of distributors, dragging
bottom for a contract and a ticket out of town.
<P> The Qirko Band doesn't have any bags packed. They record to mark their own
progress. The Blues Is A Living Thing, which recently landed on local music store shelves, is the band's third studio souvenir.
<P> "Unlike bands that record songs and then perform to promote them," Qirko
explains, "we learn songs, spend time with them, and then record them to document them.
<P> "It's also something for the fans."
<P> Living Thing was recorded live, straight to two-track, and it shows. It's once more into the breach, with no hint of tentativeness from Qirko or his mates.
<P> "We're proudest of this record," Qirko says. "Can't Help It, our earlier disc, was recorded a track at a time in Nashville. I played two guitars on most tracks and we added a lot of stuff to the songs. Living Thing was recorded
live, right here in Knoxville."
<P> The disc has a Knoxville feel to it. Even the original "Stax/Volt," an
undisguised tip of the hat to Booker T. and the MGs, seems to suit a stroll
through an Old City alley better than it would old Beale Street.
<P> A Carolina brakeman once sang that the blues ain't nothing but a good man feeling bad. No good man who's ever felt bad would argue. Qirko irrefutably
espouses that precept on the title track of the new record, with plenty of
string-stretching fret-walking and what just might be a tear or two:
<P> <EM>I wasn't born in the delta,<BR> I've never been to New Orleans,<BR> I spent some time in Chicago,<BR> But I still don't know what mojo means.<BR> But I know the blues, <BR> Because the blues is a living thing.</EM>

</H1><P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>I think it's pretty safe to say that Hypertribe has lived up to its name. When you think of the 'Tribe, you think of aural fireworks, amphetamine stage
presence, screaming scantily-clad groupies... Oh yeah, all the subtlety of a brakeless dumptruck.
<P> So you can only imagine my anticipation when bassist/producer Nick Raskulinecz
and I trekked down to the dank and musty nether-regions of the 'Tribal vaults to listen to new, unreleased material. I was ready to strap on a crash helmet.
<P> But as I sat listening to the future of Hypertribe, there was a tangible sense of restraint present on each of the newer tracks--dare I say it...
maturity? Familiar 'Tribisms are still much in evidence: shattered-asphalt
grooves, hairpin rhythmic misdirection, industrial-strength ensemble riffing. But now the rough stuff is liberally interspersed with trippy guitar atmospherics
and pensive textural passages, bringing to mind the futuristic soundscapes of Canadian sci-fi metallists Voivod.
<P> "We try to create a mood now instead of just slamming all the time," Raskulinecz
explains. "We're much less a metal band than we were before."
<P> "The music is still heavy, but we're exploring more melodic ideas," elaborates
guitarist/vocalist Mick Murphy. "We've shied away from the groove aspect. It seems that people really wanted to pigeonhole us with the heavy funk tag."
<P> In years past, detractors often faulted Hypertribe for posing and affecting too much studied "spontaneity" on-stage. Whether or not these charges were wholly warranted, the band has definitely replaced most of the hair-throwing
frenetics with a more focused presentation, exuding a very palpable intensity
despite the lack of visceral display.
<P> "We've settled down a lot," says Raskulinecz. "We feel less obligated to go ballistic on-stage. I don't feel the need to run around and have a certain
look all the time."
<P> Murphy believes that much of the change is an outgrowth of the fact that he and co-guitarist Manning Jenkins have had to assume vocal chores since the departure of former lead singer Mike Walls last summer. "I don't have the freedom to move around as much. But even though I'm fairly stationary, I'm a hell of a lot more tired after the show."
<P> If the Hyper-guys have gained a bit of sophistication and savoir-faire through
the course of their five-year existence, it's been at the expense of much
youthful innocence and more than a few cherished illusions. One of the few
Knoxville bands conspicuously trying to "make it" in the music biz, they've
suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune--fruitless road treks,
fickle A&amp;R reps, groundless rumors...
<P> "The music industry is not what I thought it was when we were a little younger,"
says Murphy. "We've heard so many things so many times before. The whole process tends to wear you out and frustrate you."
<P> "We've had lots of contacts with record companies in the past," says Raskulinecz.
"It doesn't mean much--people talk but seldom come through. I would just like for us to be reasonably successful--to be able to live making music instead of working in a restaurant. We don't give a shit about being
arena-rockers."
<P> Cynics though they may be, theirs is a particularly starry-eyed brand of
cynicism; no one is ready to talk about cashing in their chips just yet. A write-up in the "Raw Talent" section of the November issue of Screamer magazine has elicited a fresh round of rumor and flirtation from the pony-tail
set, and the band plans to do some extensive road-tripping this spring now that the post-Walls line-up has started to gel.
<P> "We hibernated for months, spending three nights per week working on vocals and songs," says Raskulinecz. "We've come through that period, and now we're
ready to get some road bookings."
<P> "I think we'll be more selective about our choice of out-of-town shows this
time," drummer Chris Brewer stipulates. "I used to love going on the road, but now I'd rather we not bust our asses on gigs that don't pay off."
<P> Hypertribe has an important home-stand upcoming; they'll be playing a showcase in front of A&amp;M Records reps on January 28 at the Electric Ballroom (along
with Immortal Chorus, Sandbox, and The Used). But high stakes or no, Raskulinecz
has his poker face on.
<P> "We've been in that sort of situation before, and it's really not productive to get too excited or go in with any expectations. It's just another gig to us."
<P> Raskulinecz pauses, as if searching for the right way to crystallize some final thoughts.
<P> "All of us have put our lives on hold for Hypertribe. No one here has had more than a semester or two of college. I've thought about going on to other
things, but right now I'm really committed to doing something with this band."

Idle Thoughts
</H1><P><STRONG>The Idle Hands draw on the shadows of old-time rock 'n'
roll</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Laura Atkinson</EM>
<P>
The flier in the window of Gryphon's a few Fridays ago said the Idle Hands
would be playing with Or this evening. But the joint's unusually low-key,
it's getting late, and there's no music. Someone points out the fine print:
the band will be happy to play a little something for everybody as soon
as Homicide is over. Take a look around the corner and there the guys are,
shoulders hunched before a television that's been temporarily installed
in front of the drum kit.
<P>
Making music is a big deal in the Idle Hands' lives, but it sure isn't the
only thing on their minds.
<P>
So on a later evening, after some mental meandering through Walker Percy
and the New South, Alanis Morrisette, white-boy funk and whether the film
The Last Seduction has any redeeming qualities, our Idle conversation takes
a turn to boxing.
<P>
"There's personality all over it, it's not like a regular sport where
there's so many rules. You have to look at it like personality, like listening
to a rock concert--they've all gotta perform," offers Eric Lee, one-half
of the band's pair of gritty guitar virtuosos. "That's why boxing's
a great sport--it's f*** the rules, it's totally individual... That's why
boxing's so much more intense than any other sport."
<P>
"Yeah, there's that intensity, but without compromise," adds David
Wilson, Lee's equally gritty counterpart.
<P>
Intensity without compromise is as good a phrase as any to start with when
describing the Idle Hands. Guitarists Wilson and Lee and drummer Eric McClean
have been lurking in the smoky shadows of Knoxville's music scene (a term
they eschew), creating soulful sonic maelstroms that are intricate, inventive,
fiercely melodic and definitely a three-part act. They've been writing songs
together and playing clubs for over a year, though that doesn't sound very
long when Lee says the band's already been through three incarnations, including
an extended stint as a virtually all-instrumental trio.
<P>
"It was hard in the first place to be able to try to do any kind of
vocals with the kind of stuff we were doing," says Wilson. They tried
working with several potential frontpersons, but always felt awkward. "I
don't know what happened, I eventually got real comfortable with playing
and trying to sing at the same time. I eventually got to the point to where
I don't even think about it anymore, I know where it needs to go and where
it doesn't need to go and it's just a matter of doing it now, it's not a
matter of worrying about it or trying to find somebody else to do it."
<P>
They do wonder if the folks who dug their sound in the beginning are even
getting it these days.
<P>
"We started out playing all these songs that were easy to grab onto,"
Lee says. "Well, people were expecting this rhythmic rock 'n' roll
quality and we did that in the very beginning," Wilson interjects,
"but that's not at all what I wanted to do."
<P>
"It's just like any band's supposed to do," Lee says. "Those
first two months we started, we're just getting used to it, and then all
of sudden you realize what kind of music you really want to play or the
ideas in your head start to come together more, and you don't just put a
couple chords together.
<P>
"Like now, we're thinking that we're making the best music that we've
made, every time we write a song. Well, every other one at least, or every
third one or every fourth one. It's like we're getting closer and closer
to what we were originally intending to do.
<P>
"So now when we play out, we play this shit that we think is the best
stuff we've done and people are just standing there scratching their heads."
<P>
The head-scratching could very well come from folks wondering why they think
they've heard the Idle Hands before. Though Wilson and Lee take turns in
front of the mike on many of their songs now, without vocals their dueling
guitars still tell the tales of everyday living. The Idle Hands are as inspired
by loners begging nickels, barstool debates and stories shared across overflowing
ashtrays as any song they've heard. Their music is spawned from images and
creates images of its own, and song titles like "The Blackest White
Man," "Small of the Back" and "You Must Wait Until Hell"
begin pulling the pictures into focus.
<P>
Even living in Fort Sanders has made its mark on the Idle Hands' instrumental
sensibilities. Sit on one of the neighborhood's porches on a lazy late evening
and let the Fort's own soulful soundtrack sink in: the high yowls of cats
just before they go for each other's throats--or get it on; engines that
pause with a rattling choke, then careen off in a cloud of grit; plodding
footsteps, unaffected by the night, going up one side of the street while
a nervous clip passes down the other; bottles breaking, folks slurring friendly
good-byes. The Idle Hands may say they're not rhythmic, but that rhythm
of life isn't lost on them.
<P>
Not that they'd say they don't have musical influences--they've got plenty,
many from the days when turntables got all the action. The names they drop
inspire a query--Are the Idle Hands rock 'n' roll?
<P>
"I'd say in word if not in deed," Lee says. "It's spirit.
People don't think about that enough. It's the spirit, the brevity, the
intensity. I think we're closer to CCR, Jerry Lee Lewis, tonally speaking...
If we can capture the spirit of an Otis Redding song, or Screamin' Jay Hawkins,
or Chuck Berry, then that's good. Cutting through the bullshit and getting
right to the heart, don't belabor the point. The way we play lends itself
to this incidental jamming, but we don't bother with that. It's the spirit
that matters."

Nice Girl</H1>
<P><STRONG>Knoxville's very own waifish chanteuse Jennifer Niceley meditates on matters of the heart</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jack Neely</EM>

<P>At the Tomato Head on a sunny afternoon, she's eating some gumbo, picking out the okra and saving the rice for later. She's been to too many parties lately, she says, and is trying to get in shape for Nashville. She is, unfortunately, moving to that municipal talent leech in a couple of weeks to attend Belmont College, where she'll study the music business. 
<P>She doesn't relish the business side of music, but at just barely 21 she's practical enough to know she'll need to make a living someday, and wants to be prepared to make a living doing something she loves. 
<P>What she loves is music, a passion passed down to her from her family: her Dad who taught her to play guitar when she was 12; the grandfather who hosted hoedowns in the family home; even her great uncle, the fiddler who died on the railroad long before Jennifer was born but left the family his fiddle, a hallowed and much-used heirloom. 
<P>She was the first woman in the family in generations and took the traditional name of J. J. Niceley, though she was the first Jennifer Jane. 
<P>There's an esoteric darkness in her music, a mystery that makes you need to go back and hear it again. On her eponymous CD, she sings long, slow lyrics to accompaniment that's so light it seems spectral: an ambling bass here, the ghost of mandolin there. Through several songs, plucked guitar strings throb like a heartbeat. You listen to it like you listen to the weather.
<P>Her songs are as much about death as about love. There's a minimalist ethic here, vivid images without apology or explanation, like haiku. Some of her songs are almost like Zen meditations. One sentence can stretch as far as a dream. You may need to back it up to recall the subject.
<P>In person, on a sunny afternoon, she's neither morose nor mysterious as she tries to ignore her plate of gumbo. "In the circle of things, death's just part of it," she says. She's cheerful, open, practical. She speaks in a soft, middle-class Tennessee accent, very different from the accent reminiscent of Natalie Merchant you sometimes hear on the record. 
<P>She says songs come to her without deliberate purpose. "People have asked me why I strum or pick. I never really know. A lot of the time, I write music and words at the same time." She says if her songs are elliptical or enigmatic, it's only because she has tried to write other kinds of songs and failed. "I wanted to write story songs," she admits. "I tried, and I'm just not good at it."
<P>She showed up here about five years ago fronting an electric band of Jefferson County High compadres called Soul Penny that you might have seen at the Mercury, Gryphon's, the old Ace of Clubs. At the Tomato Head, they were part of one shared bill that turned so rowdy it threatened a permanent ban on rock 'n' roll performances. 
<P>Like most teenagers, she was much more interested in appearances then. "I wore antique clothes, long, old, fragile dresses," she remembers. Her performances these days are much simpler, less pretentious. 
<P>She wandered around the UT campus for a couple of years, hoping to seem like a student, but felt desperate to get out--of UT, of Tennessee, of America. She elected to study abroad and ended up in Swansea, Wales, a place she didn't find as lyrical as its name. 
<P>"It's a city full of old people in dreary clothes, bumping into you all the time," she says. "I knew no one, and was stranded without a car. But the thing that really kept me down was the weather, gray every day." 
<P>But it may have been a provocative experience. "To say that it taught me about loneliness and suffering sounds stupid. But it really kind of did. And it taught me about where my roots are." Those roots are symbolized on her CD cover, a sepia-toned shot of summer vines entwined around an old snapshot of three impish young women with bobbed hair, circa 1925. It's Jennifer's Jellico-raised grandmother and her two sisters. 
<P>The CD, released less than two weeks ago, was produced by Niceley's distant former in-law Don Cassell, the wild man of the mandolin whose Cassell Tunes released jazz songstress Nancy Brennan Strange's Les Etoiles Mysterieuse last year. With bassist Will Byers and Cassell assisting on mandolin and dobro, they recorded Niceley's album in three sessions at Southern Sound in West Knoxville in May. She's pleased with the record, but she's not sure she likes recording. "You can't relax," she says. "I was nervous because I knew money was being spent."
<P>On "Valentine," the plucked strings rotate the melody like a sad tune on a forgotten music box. "When I Lay Myself Down" is an old-fashioned mandolin ballad, by far the most conventional original song on the album. "Everybody says that's their favorite," says Niceley, as if she's surprised at the fact. She is for the moment resisting suggestions to move closer to the traditional genre. "Wait for the Darkness" came to her as she was driving near her home along the Holston River ("All there is to do, these sunsets, is breathe in the life/And wait for the darkness").
<P>So she's off to Guitar City, but expect her back. She's terminally attached to her family's riverside farm in Strawberry Plains, where horses graze and 500 acres of tomatoes--and several of her songs--grow.

<H1>Kenneth Jacobs</H1>
<P><EM>by Jason Schneider</EM>
<P>Hearing electronic music for the first time, one is inclined to believe that it is art for the sake of "newness" rather than for the sake of honest self-expression--that someone is very consciously trying to break the chains of tradition. <P>
But Kenneth Jacobs, a Knoxville composer of electronic music, swears that this isn't the case with his work: "I don't strive for novelty, I strive for being myself ... If you're being true to your own vision, your art cannot ever be like anybody else's anyway. This concept of repeating or copying is irrelevant."<P>
Electronic music is made up of purely synthetic sounds, and has been an accepted form of art since the late 1940s. While much modern pop music uses synthetic sounds, and virtually 95 percent of movie scores are computer imitations of orchestras, the type of electronic music Jacobs composes is different. His intent is not to imitate acoustic instruments, but, rather, to create completely new timbres. <P>
Some of the sounds are reminiscent of traditional instruments--violins, harps, or glockenspiels--but many seem as though they could have come only from alien space ships, or government computers gone mad. "Composers have long wanted to expand the palette of colors available to them, and this is an ideal opportunity," says Jacobs.<P>
So far, the type of electronic music Jacobs composes has remained mostly in academic circles--a fact he attributes to the general public's unwillingness to accept the synthetic sounds. "The general public tends to be rather conservative in its tastes. The public would have to be repeatedly exposed to these sounds in a commercial environment before they would begin to be accepted as musical material," he says.<P>
Jacobs, who is also a UT professor of music, creates his sounds on digital synthesizers, then sequences them together on a Macintosh computer and finally transfers them onto Digital Audio Tape. Entire pieces can be realized while sitting behind a desk of equipment in the corner of the basement--because, with electronic music, it is the recording itself which is the final product, not the performance.<P>
Jacobs also composes "electro-acoustic" music, which brings together  synthetic sounds and acoustic instruments. These pieces are much like traditional concertos--with the electronic sounds taking the role of the orchestra. "I've long been fascinated by the interplay between the frozen tape sounds and the interaction of the live performer. How do we deal with something that is seemingly rigid and inflexible?"<P>
These electro-acoustic compositions bring out the strongest qualities of both mediums. There is the new and exciting sonic quality of the electronic sounds--bell-like tones bouncing from speaker to speaker, mounting layers of lush chords, pounding bass notes that shake the walls--and, at the same time, there is the emotional sensitivity that can only be provided by a human performer. <P>
Currently, Jacobs is composing only acoustic music--the medium he began working in over 25 years ago. "When I started combining the electronic and the acoustic, I started getting more involved with performers, which brought me back into the world of instrumental music. Because of that, the demand for my acoustic writing has started to grow."<P>
Jacobs is composing a violin concerto for the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra's concertmaster, Marc Zelmanovitch, and an orchestral piece for the University of Tennessee's bicentennial celebration. He is also completing his fifth CD, Sandcastles, which will feature acoustic and electro-acoustic performances by members of the KSO and the UT music faculty, and will be released by the middle of September.<P>
It seems notable that after two decades of dedication to electronic music--including the building of UT's electronic sound studio--Jacobs has returned to acoustic composition. Does this somehow reveal the fate of electronic music as a whole? Will it be only a passing, underground art form, which is ultimately overcome by more traditional types of music?<P>
"The way the world is now, it's not getting out there, even though a lot of people are doing it," says Jacobs. "Because of the computer technology, people can do this in their own homes--like I do. You no longer have to have a university studio, or anything else. Practically every block has got some teenager who's got a lot of this equipment. But is it just for your own personal amusement, or are you trying to make a serious product? I think we're in a state of development. It could go in a lot of different directions."

</H1><P><STRONG>Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs... and Leaf sees nothing wrong with that</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>I used to know this guy who fancied himself a real cutting-edge, punk-rock
thinking person. To this end, he formulated his own unique brand of cultural
criticism-- he wore brainy-looking faux eye-glasses and drank a lot. Somehow this combination of habits led him to a stunning dismissal of one of the most significant acts in rock history. His off-the-cuff summation was something
to the effect of "The Beatles? Feh."
<P> Since, at the time, I thought this friend of mine was undoubtedly hipper than me, I felt right oddball not understanding his disdain. Heck, I'm younger
than Beatlemania, but I still managed to grow up with the idea of "air, water,
Beatles" stuck in my head as far as pop music is concerned. So when I walked into Leaf's not-so-secret headquarters recently, it was refreshing to learn that plenty of other folks under 30 remember (and respect) Paul McCartney's
pre-Wings band. The wall-to-wall Beatles posters, and an impressive piece of stained-glass created in the images of John, Paul, George and Ringo, tipped me off immediately. As the saying goes, everything old is, indeed, new again.
<P> But Leaf is no retro act, despite the more granola-esque assumptions some folks made about their name early on. Nor are they a "junior" version of fellow Beatles fans Superdrag, though that's a comparison they take as a
compliment. The name comes from an in-joke from their teenage years, the
explanation of which lies somewhere in the "You had to be there" category. It's a simple, straightforward name for exactly that kind of band-- four nice boys playing not-so-quirky, not-exactly-melancholy power pop.
<P> Singer/guitarist Matt Allen proudly explains the band's core philosophy: "Every single one of our songs goes verse-chorus-verse-chorus-end."
<P> "Sometimes we stick a bridge in there," adds guitarist Rick Tiller. "We're not really a show-off band, trying to show an extreme amount of 'talent.' It may be simple to do, but it gets the point across."
<P> This focused aesthetic goal leads to a bevy of solid, heavy-guitar pop songs.
Their hooks are properly hooked and their pro-smooth three-way harmonies hold on to just that right touch of gruffness. Bassist Jay Daniel and drummer
Jeff "Squid" Ballard keep up a tight and groove-healthy rhythm, with sonic nods to the Jesus and Mary Chain. Somewhere along the line, they pull the
Beatles' classic pop essence through the punk and post-punk filter, coming up with an essentially modern rock a lot of bands pass over for the bright and shiny stuff the next aisle over.
<P> The JAMC nod comes out particularly in Tiller and Allen's feedback duel in the song "Beam." Their twist-and-turn textural assault adds a volume-tasty
dimension to the rhythm section's simple deception. What this means in layman's
terms is "Shut up, Beavis, this rocks."
<P> Song titles like "Beam," "Pedal," "Limerance" and "Circles" might suggest lofty, almost New Age, themes. But as with their band name, it just ain't so-- nothing too awfully cosmic here. Their songs are largely about the myriad
failures of boy-girl relationships.
<P> "One of the things about our music that I like is that we're so sappy," says
Allen. "It's all about getting dumped on."
<P> "Exactly," says Daniel. "The 'I'm the victim' route."
<P> "The sensitive male route," agrees Tiller, "except none of us have ponytails."
<P> "I'm not a sensitive ponytail man," clarifies Allen, "but our songs are like
'We're the victims, we've never done anything wrong.'"
<P> "Needless to say, it's one-sided," says Tiller.
<P> "Wait a minute," says Ballard, in a moment of good-natured dissension. "I don't even know the lyrics. I think it's really kind of happy and poppy."
<P> "They do sound happy," concedes Tiller. "But if you listen to the lyrics, it's not so happy."
<P> Despite, or perhaps because of, this kind of open and friendly kind of debate,
the Leaf sound is definitely a team effort. Their group dynamic makes me think of the recent documentary series which depicted the creative power plays and selfish bickering that typified the Beatles' demise. It doesn't look like Leaf, in their sonic simplicity and personal candor, will have a problem in that area.
<P> "There's no one songwriter who writes everything and tells everyone else what to do," says Tiller.
<P> "Before you came over tonight, we had to stop practice and have a fifteen-minute
bitch-fest," says Allen. "We're pretty lucky because we all get along so well, but we do have to bitch. We have to vent."

<H1><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="blake_nn.gif" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="193" HSPACE="10">Norman and Nancy Blake
</H1><P><EM>by Chris Barrett</EM>
<P>The idea that music has transporting powers is hardly new. Almost any of Lou Reed's albums from the '70s can leave a listener stranded on a wet Bronx curb with the 3 a.m. shivers. Stumbling into earshot of Chopin's piano
nocturnes generates a sensation similar to showing up unannounced and
underdressed at high tea. The music of Norman and Nancy Blake, then, is something
like those futuristic elevators you hear about in Tokyo skyscrapers, that move both vertically and horizontally. Their antique combinations of strings and voice will not only yank you away to another place, but another time as well. 
<P>Norman Blake lives in the past and likes it there. The music he plays is either rescued from the 1800s and early 1900s, or composed in styles from
those periods. Since recordings of (and access to) historical music is becoming
more limited as time passes, listeners may puzzle over what someone like Blake listens to for inspiration.
<P>"Well, I don't buy many records," Blake says. "I listen to the radio some, I guess I'd listen to a little of everything--country, jazz, some rock. You'd
probably call what I listen to most 'folk music.' Some I like, some I don't."
With a laugh, he adds, "The more I listen, the more I find there's two kinds of music: the kind I like and the kind I don't. I either understand it or I don't, you know.
<P>"Every time our culture gains something, it loses something," Blake says,
explaining his unabashed preference for music that predates his own birth.
"Transportation and electronics bring us all closer together, but that isn't
always better. There was a time when music and songwriting weren't influenced by pop culture the way they are now."
<P>The Blakes are expert players of many instruments (Nancy plays fiddle,
mandolin, guitar and cello; Norman plays just about anything with strings).
What's more important than their musical talents, however, is that they have damn good taste in old songs.
<P>"When I hear a song that is artistically and poetically good," Norman says, "I interpret it and then play it the way I feel it."
<P>For examples of the kinds of songs that strikes Norman as poetically and
artistically good, pick up one of the dozens of recordings that he's made both with and without the company of Mrs. Blake. The duo's most recent, 1992's
Just Gimme Something I'm Used To (Shanachie), fans the pages of about 150 years worth of calendars and atlases. 
<P>The more things change, the more they stay the same. The settings, characters
and situations in the songs the Blakes sing would be right at home in many of the genres that Blake says he doesn't understand. "Little Matty Groves," for instance, is right out of the 'hood. Groves beats a nobleman's time and gets caught in the sack with the missus. A la Hamlet, everyone ends up dead, the lovers buried side by side with the husband at their feet. 
<P>The Blakes' upcoming concert at the Laurel Theatre is something of a
professional homecoming for Norman. His career as a six-string guru began when his first band, The Dixie Drifters, took a stint as the studio band on WNOX's Tennessee Barndance. He has since attracted a wide range of fans, most of whom share his occupation. 
<P>Blake refuses any credit for helping to make historical music available. That many would disagree is beside the point. Rounder Records has embarked upon the noble task of re-issuing the Carter Family's Victor sessions on CD, but is only about 40 songs into those archives. So the Blakes' version of "Fifty Miles of Elbow Room" on Blind Dog (Rounder)--like many of the other
tunes they've revived--remains the only version in print. 
<P>As much as he loves the Carter Family's music and other music of that period, Blake is not impressed by the CD reissue trend. "I read where somebody
was saying that taking those old records and putting the music on new records was like digging up bones from one place to bury them in another," he says,
laughing.  
<P>Presumably, the preferred alternative is to re-record the songs, or better
yet, let them fly from the front porch or stage. How fine that those are the very things that Norman and Nancy do best.

<P><STRONG>Metal isn't dead, it's just been in hibernation -- but Numskull isn't content to let sleeping dogs lie</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>For folks in their early 20s, metal's heyday hit right around junior high. Too young to drive or date, they cranked Ratt and Crue from the front seat of big brother's Firebird, or hung at the mall in unlayered shags and Metallica T's.
<P>But pop music is a capricious beast. It's coddled, then turned up its fickle snout at four or five other trends since those late-'80s days of poodle-dos and bad tattoos, and most of the Metal Kids moved on--to grunge, to new punk, to indie-slack, to (gasp!) Birkenstock rock...
<P>The guys in Knoxville's Numskull, however, never got out of that Firebird--they just crawled into the driver's seat. Not that their music sounds dated; theirs is a distinctly '90s brand of thrash, souped-up but stripped-down, free of florid solos, saccharine twin-guitar harmonies and all the other turgid clichs that mired metal proper in its own muckish pretense.
<P>"We like some old-style metal, but we don't want to play it," says guitarist Bing Fu. "We want to reach kids, not 40-year-olds."
<P>"When we started playing out, we gigged with every bunch of 30- and 40-year-old rednecks around," says singer Nathan Barrett, a classmate of Fu and bassist Andre Hayter at Oak Ridge High. "They're ancient and they're all wearing black T-shirts and black pants, and their whole crowd looks just like them. We got over that quick."
<P>But Numskull sidesteps new clichs as well as old ones, eschewing the cartoonish post-industrial posturing so many modern metal acts (Marilyn Manson, anyone?) seem obliged to hide behind. A Numsong comes at you like a subway out of nowhere--careening sound and fury in the hollow Stygian night, or maybe some malign industrial machine suddenly sparked to life, all molten seething pistons and gnashing metal teeth.
<P>And lest they sacrifice songcraft in the carnage, band members say they keep a keen collective ear for the finer points, like dynamics and vocal hooks. The result: anthemic moshers are given respite by pensive interludes, lumbering sludge-riffs cut with slap bass and funky drums. This is mayhem with a dash of melody, high-volume hijinks with lots of sluggo hooks.
<P>"We're about good riffs and songs you can remember," Fu says. "When I write a riff, it's gotta follow the two C's--it's gotta be catchy, and it's gotta be crunchy."
<P>It may be catchy, but that doesn't mean it's caught on. Life in the pit hasn't been easy for these four 22-year-old rivetheads. They've assimilated plenty of hip heavy alternative influences (Tool, Rage Against the Machine, et al.) since their first thrashy garage jam in 1994. Their audience hasn't necessarily evolved with them, however, and they've slogged through lots of the aforementioned mustache-fests at sullen, beery West Knox clubs.
<P>"I think we've played at least once in every club in town," Barrett laughs.
<P>On the east end of town, Numskull bears the ignoble distinction of being one of the few local acts ever banned from Gryphon's, premiere grubby hovel and home to homeless bands ("They think we're gangsters or something," mumbles the mild-mannered Fu.) Inexplicably, the sanction was prompted by some less-than-complimentary graffiti ("Numskull sux") scrawled on Gryphons' less-than-pristine lavatory walls.
<P>But Numskull perseveres, opening shows for popular indie and even major-label bands (Doo Rag, the Deftones) at the Mercury Theatre, playing gigs with local punkers like Torture Kitty to net that all-important all-ages crowd. And in 1995, they released their Scary Stories from the Bible cassette, a potent five-song dose of steel-toed speedcore thud.
<P>"I think there are still closet heavy music fans out there," Barrett says. "It's something that's bound to reenter the mainstream, and we'd like to ride the coattails when it does."
<P>"Knoxville just doesn't have a big hard music scene right now," Fu adds. "We know we're swimming against the current."
<P>Which raises the question: Why? Why endure the boots-and-ball-caps venues, the low-shekel gigs, the barbs of fans and fellow bands who seem interested in absolutely anything but  four guys with a loud sound and a bad attitude? According to Barrett, it all boils down to stress relief.
<P>"Being in the band mellows me out," Barrett explains. "When we practice, I get to let it all out. You don't get that with any other kind of music. How else could I bitch out an entire crowd of people at one time, and know that they'll dig it?"
<P>Drummer Joel Abrenica offers an even more organic reason.
<P>"All those other kids in junior high school with us--they grew up," he laughs. "We didn't."

All Thumbs
</H1><P><STRONG>How local "all-star" trio Opposable Thumbs just sort of
fell into place</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>
The way the Opposable Thumbs tell the story, it's all just an accident.
They were just sort of standing around last year and unwittingly became
a band, as if they'd all eaten at the same bad restaurant and came down
with the same case of gas. Lucky for us, the sounds they expel make for
a rockin' good time, and the band is a bona fide "thing." In just
over a year since their initial "accident," they've plugged firmly
into the Internet and already have a number one radio hit (sort of), plagiarist
imitators (sort of), and worldwide recognition (sort of). And then there's
the Loudon Wainwright III tribute album. But more on that later.
<P>
It all started when ex-Smokin' Dave singer/guitarist and local-hero-of-all-trades
Todd "Toddzilla" Steed returned to the United States from a teaching
stint in Lithuania, itching to write and play some new songs. He landed
a gig opening for the Cheeksters, and jammed live with the Cheeksters rhythm
section, drummer David "Skank" Jenkins and bassist Paul "Super-Apple"
Noe (who were also experiencing the waning days of that little outfit called
the Judybats). Instead of the standard blues-improv, however, Steed led
them into musical left field.
<P>
"I remember," says Jenkins, "being very angry at Todd, saying
'We're up here doing just a quick jam, why is he playing in 6/8?'"
<P>
Steed shrugs. "I didn't know it was in 6/8."
<P>
Intrigued by Steed's off-beat audacity, Jenkins invited him over to his
Disgraceland Studios to record with himself and Noe.
<P>
"Dave and I had always been Smokin' Dave fans," says Noe.
<P>
"And so had I," admits Steed. "It was a weird coincidence."
<P>
By the end of the day, they'd recorded half of an album (God's Autograph,
available in cassette form at fine stores near you) and had their Opposable
Thumbs stuck out, looking for a ride.
<P>
"We were a band against our own will," says Steed. "Then
we just started playing gigs. There was never a point where someone said
'Let's start a band."
<P>
"The Thumbs are all about rockin' and rollin'," says Jenkins,
"not really thinking about it."
<P>
"This is Zen rock in its base form," brags Steed. "This band
has the least consciousness of any band in town, and I think it shows."<BR>
<BR>
Conscious enough to pass on early name ideas like "Happy Playtime Boys,"
the Opposable Thumbs combine Steed's famously clever songwriting ability
with straightforward guitar rock, hard-edged and upbeat. Jenkins and Noe
make up a powerful and efficient tag-team rhythm machine. Far from being
mechanical, however, they inject the music with earnest energy. Steed's
music and vocals (through the vehicles of Smokin' Dave and the Premo Dopes,
his old persona Johnny Stank and his current Toddzilla solo appearances)
have always been charged with vitality and poetic gusto, and he hasn't lost
his touch at all. The new sound, to borrow a phrase I picked up from a British
rock magazine, rocks like a bastard.
<P>
"God's Autograph is the loud obnoxious rock record I have been wanting
to make since I was 16," says Steed. "I am glad I didn't do it
when I was 16, 'cause it would have blown chunks."
<P>
Steed's lyrics, the shining centerpiece of the Thumbs' mystique, cover as
wide a range of topics as ever. "John Ward," the band's homage
to UT's respected sports commentator, debuted on an AM talk radio sports
show a few months ago, making it the de facto number one song on talk
radio.
<P>
"Every other band does the trendy little college station," says
Steed. "But how many get on talk radio?"
<P>
Then there's the travelogue piece "Stenga 5," the roots of which
ring with the Thumbs' accidental, yin-yang attitude. On his last adventure
in Africa, Steed took an excursion on the boat Stenga 5, piloted by a fellow
named Bothselso, whose name means "life." Bothselso's partner,
on the other hand, was named Dhalasupeli.
<P>
"Which means 'you never know when you are going to die,'" says
Steed, amused by the irony.
<P>
Accidents and irony certainly abound with the Opposable Thumbs. Steed has
been plagued of late with the confusion caused by a local "modern rock"
DJ's appropriation of Steed's stage name.
<P>
"That lame disc jockey," says Steed, steaming. "If I came
into a town and there was somebody named Toddzilla already, I would think
about using a different name. About once a week someone comes up to me and
says 'I heard you on the radio, it's not as funny as your tape.' I mean,
who is this Yankee?"
<P>
Perhaps most exemplary of band's sense of irony, though, is that for all
their raw rock energy, they are "plugged in" to the quasi-high
tech world of the Internet. The World Wide Web connection has had mixed
results. On the up side, the Thumbs have an electronic mailing list
(todzilla@utkux1.utk.edu),
and they've received e-mail queries from music fans as far away as Greece.
They also landed a spot on the upcoming Loudon Wainwright III tribute album,
performing the song "Red Guitar," after Steed met the project's
coordinator online.
<P>
Back on the more Zen side of things, one of Steed's initial web searches
of the phrase "Opposable Thumbs" led him to the Opossum Home Page.
<P>
"Opossums and humans are the only two animals with opposable thumbs,"
explains Steed, "which ties it all back to East Tennessee. So now we
know what that name means--it's the opossum connection."

</H1><P><STRONG>Or breaks the moldy mold of "traditional" improv</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>"OR isn't just a conjunction, at least not in Knoxville, it's a
super-psychedelic free-noise nerd-punk make-it-up-as-&amp;c. duo that don't have no 'quirky power pop' songs with a 'melancholy flair' so there. So foreget
(sic) the (Super-) Suckers."
<P>This apparent-chip-on-somebody's-shoulder message showed up anonymously on Metro Pulse's fax machine a couple of months back, provoking question marks across the board. Who is this "Or," and just what are they getting at? Are they mad about something? If so, at whom? Most importantly, do we really want to know?
<P>Eventually somebody thought to ask me, since I'm often friendly with the
natives. I immediately recognized the fax voice of the inimitable Scott Key,
primary Or geek-tarist and Knoxville's (as yet) unsung hero of superpsychedelic
free-noise nerd-punk aesthetics. Having conspired, collaborated and canoed with Key many a time over the years, I called him to ask what was up.
<P>"Oh, that?" he said. "It's just a press release."
<P>A press release with such an attitude is a fairly appropriate introduction to Or. They indeed have little patience with quirky power pop melancholia--no
paeans to lost love here. Heck, there ain't even lyrics, unless you count Key's occasional scat-like vocal spurts. Key and drummer John Talbird, along with official unofficial third Or Martin Beeler on guitar, clarinet and various
electronics, make up one of Knoxville's more progressive musical endeavors. If you're looking for the cutting edge, here's the tip of the blade.
<P>Key sometimes leaves his guitar to its own devices and manipulates a low-tech
array of tape loops, Casio keyboard and a nameless piece of equipment that gave sound effects to a children's book in an earlier life. Everything is made up on the spot, but their aggressive and dynamic mix of beat, rhythm,
feedback and drone keeps them away from the self-indulgent diddling tangents of more "traditional" improv. In fact, they make a point of improvising in five or six minute pieces, giving an impression of short, pre-set arrangements.
<P>"Well, brevity is the essence of wit," says Key. "To me, the band's about
playing the way I used to be afraid to play in front of people--playing the way I played sitting in my bedroom. I'm mostly influenced by groups like Sonic Youth and Chrome."
<P>"And we definitely have the first four Black Sabbath albums internalized,"
adds Beeler, and he's not really kidding. Key's chunky, booming guitar is a nice mix of modern drone and old-school metal, a far cry from the usual jazz that comes to mind when someone says "improv."
<P>"I find a lot of experimental or improvisational music unappealing," says
Talbird. "A lot of it's so rhythmless. We're very groove-oriented, and not just the drums, because Scott's a very rhythmic guitarist. Martin is less
rhythmic, more ambient maybe."
<P>"Little sounds and things," is how Beeler describes his input.
<P>Spurning the glamour of the rock club scene, they usually set up their own shows (such as their recent three-hour "come and go as you please"
performance) at the Foundry on the Fair Site. They are also at the core of the Nocturnal Eye Company, which promotes other improvisational acts whose sound is more important than their stage image. The "image-over-content" disease is something they see as a hindrance to most bands' actual music, such as groups or artists who equate substance abuse to artistic merit.
<P>"I went to see (electronic noise group) Nocturnal Emissions once," says Key as an example. "I laid down and listened to them, really listened, and the music just zoned me out--in a good way. That's an admirable effect in music and you don't need to be stoned out of your mind to get it."
<P>"I'd just like to put down the half-baked 'skid row' persona altogether," says Beeler.
<P>Key agrees. "It's people who seem to live in this Iron Weed/Bukowski,
drunk-poet kind of delusion. It's like 'I know you're drunk, but I've never heard any poetry from you.' So the best I can get out of it is they're alcoholic
with poetic aspirations."
<P>Setting aside all pretenses of image, Or's live presentation is focused
squarely on the sound they produce. In many ways, it's a reaction to what they see as music-turned-commodity--the "hot band of the week" syndrome. They know their music is pretty far off the beaten commercial path, and they like it that way.
<P>"This may be stretching it, but it becomes sort of an ego destruction in terms of us as performers," says Key. "To me, we don't put on a performance,
it's not about that. It's about a sonic experience. I don't want to
over-intellectualize it, because it's a very immediate thing."
<P>Beeler sums it all up best with a brief bit of wit. "It's mostly a pretty sexy kind of music."

<H1>The Envelope Please... </H1>
<STRONG>Phil Leadbetter of The New South ponders the prize</STRONG> <P>
<EM>by Chris Barrett</EM> <P>
Knoxville dobro picker Phil Leadbetter's career is that rare, storybook
tale of the kid who borrows a glove for neighborhood stickball, does token
time in the farm leagues, then makes it to &quot;the show.&quot; Before
the neighbors even realize he's gone, they see him on TV. It's the stuff
dreams are made of. <P>
Not all that many summers ago, you could've heard him for free, pickin'
on a car fender outside Buddy's Bar-B-Q out on Kingston Pike. This year,
he's already been on stage at the Bijou twice, first with Tony Rice, then
as a member of J. D. Crowe's legendary New South. An album he recorded with
Crowe has been nominated for a Grammy. <P>
&quot;You always enjoy your hometown crowd,&quot; says Leadbetter. &quot;There's
nothing any better than that. The thing that's different about playing with
J. D. is the traveling. We were out in Seattle a few months back, and people
just come up and start talking to you like they know you. <P>
&quot;It's great, but you kind of feel like you shouldn't be there. It seems
like the kind of thing that ought to be happening to other people.&quot;
<P>
Leadbetter picked up the dobro in 1975. He played with a local band called
Knoxville Newgrass back when the real specialty of the house at that particular
Buddy's was live bluegrass. Knoxville Newgrass were mostly teenagers. They
had to play first, and at least pretend to go home early. After he and his
friends turned the stage over to adults, they'd regroup in the parking lot,
jamming, swapping chops, and learning new songs off the car tape deck. <P>
Leadbetter laughs, remembering that one of the hottest bands recording then
was Crowe's original New South band, with Ricky Skaggs on guitar and vocals
and Jerry Douglas on dobro. <P>
In '87, Leadbetter left Knoxville for the bright lights of Nashville. A
friend in Music City lined him up with an audition for Grandpa Jones, of
Hee-Haw and Grand Ole Opry fame. He landed the gig, and backed Jones at
the Opry and on the road. <P>
&quot;Now, that guy would travel!&quot; says Leadbetter. &quot;He'd get
behind the wheel of his motor home and drive us to New York, only stopping
to go the bathroom. <P>
&quot;He's a comedian, you know. Unlike most people, when he screwed up,
he got a standing ovation. He had it made.&quot; <P>
After two years with Grandpa Jones, Leadbetter spent nearly a year traveling
with country singer Vern Gosdin. Leadbetter says that playing country made
it obvious he belonged in bluegrass. He's been with New South for almost
four years now. <P>
&quot;J. D.'s got the sound I like,&quot; Leadbetter says. &quot;The New
South was some of the first music I had. After I joined the band, I started
finding it's the little bitty things in the music that really makes it.
J. D. showed me that, rather than putting every note you know in a measure,
it's better to use fewer notes with good taste. <P>
&quot;It's kind of like what B. B. King does. He could rip a guitar up,
but sometimes he'll just work that one string and hold it.&quot; <P>
With Crowe at the helm, the New South stands apart from the ranks of bluegrass
speed demons. They take it slow, and can play a rest with more impact than
most others could play a riff. <P>
On Flashback, the album that's been nominated Best Bluegrass Album of 1994,
Crowe, Leadbetter and company walk confidently where others would run. The
standard &quot;Long Journey Home&quot; finally gets the arrangement that
the lyrics deserve. As it was recorded by Reno and Smiley or Bill Monroe,
&quot;Long Journey Home&quot; must have been a favorite of speed trap cops
across the country. Those early pickers rode it like a runaway train, and
the natural response to hearing it on a car radio would be to try to make
the trees go by as fast as possible. <P>
But the song's a bluegrass blues. If a fellow truly had &quot;lost all his
money but a two-dollar bill,&quot; he'd be shuffling home, humble-like.
Behind Crowe's banjo and the mournful lyrics, Leadbetter bends and sends
sweetly glissed notes to fill the cracks. Instead of coming at you like
a cloud of bird shot, Leadbetter's sounds bloom like wildflowers on a sunny
spring day. One or two here, another there, but each one exactly where it
ought to be. <P>
Rather than biting his nails, waiting for the Grammy ceremonies on March
1, Leadbetter seems to have risen above it all. His schedule prevents him
from attending, so he'll get the word by phone. Or maybe he'll let the answering
machine get it. But he's enjoying being a nominee, alongside names like
Jerry Douglas and Del McCoury, and is determined to be happy no matter where
the fickle finger of fate points. <P>
And as a member of the bluegrass first string, the other nominees are his
friends now. &quot;I just feel lucky. There's somebody in every one of those
other groups who's a friend of mine. I'm happy just to be included in the
same group as those guys. <P>
"I'm just enjoying it so much. I'd do it for free."

</H1><P><STRONG>B'rer Morris returns to his briar patch for one night</STRONG>
<P> <EM>by Jack Neely</EM>
<P> Richard Bruce Morris is an old friend of mine. People who know that have every right to be suspicious of anything I have to say about him. But now, at least, I've got some backup.
<P> You may know that R. B. has spent most of the last year or two impressing some impressive audiences in Nashville. Michael McCall, music writer for our alter ego, The Nashville Scene, noticed Knoxville's Local Man last November
when he played at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe. In the ten months since, McCall has written about R. B. Morris several times for Guitar-City audiences: Morris's music, McCall says, "glows with the scruffy intellectualism and choice, concise wordplay of Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark, and other literary renegades."
<P> This past summer, McCall wrote a column about rare Originals in that town known for its formulaic approach to country music. He singled out Morris as a special exception to the oppressive Nashville rule. "Morris is a scruffy, soulful poet who enjoys wrapping his multidimensional wordplay in earthy, roadhouse arrangements," McCall wrote. "Morris has an inventive way of wrenching open the structure of a song to indulge his oblique and dynamic wordplay."
<P> McCall concluded that R. B. and one other singer-songwriter in Nashville "speaks well of the future of Music City and its potential for embracing the musically adventurous."
<P> It's an irony that Morris strikes some as Nashville's Hope, when Morris is so thoroughly Knoxvillian. There's a hillbilly impertinence about his work, frayed with a decadent melancholy of a sort that lives on this side of the Cumberlands. His lyrics are provocative and memorable, his tunes are solid, his voice works, aging into an easy baritone with just enough rasp to make it sound lived in. And 20 years of performing before live--and often drunk--audiences have left him with a confidence about taking weird chances with music--and an instinct for taking the right ones.
<P> This Friday night, he'll play a venue he's played before--in fact, he was long a close neighbor and confidante of the century-old Laurel Theater, in Fort Sanders at Laurel and 16th.
<P> He emerged here in Fort Sanders, leading a blues/country band called Shaky Little Finger. In the early '80s, Morris did some traveling, geographically and spiritually. He grew fascinated with words, and for half a decade, Morris
concentrated on poetry without accompaniment, putting his guitar aside to produce a nonpareil tabloid arts journal called The Hard Knoxville Review. He also wrought an unlikely miracle in organizing some lively and even popular
poetry readings. And he started working on his one movie, a one-man screenplay
based on the tortured life of fellow Clinch-Avenue native James Agee called The Man Who Lives Here is Loony. (Copyright difficulties have prevented the film from being publicly shown more than once, at the Bijou in 1992.)
<P> All of his efforts were impressively unique. But somewhere in there, someone
talked R. B. into doing what he does best--that is, writing and singing songs.
<P> He holed up and worked up a new act, new songs, and returned to the stage, often backed by the Irregulars--a.k.a. Hector Qirko's blues band. Morris's
unpredictable shows combined poetry-as-performance-art with original songs that ranged from pure country to pure blues, which are, of course, roughly the same thing. Curves thrown just to keep us slack-jawed were occasional
operatic pieces, breezy reggae, and punk-influenced rock 'n' roll. The sum offers a strong impression of a man who has wrestled with angels and learned how to deal with being pinned.
<P> Morris has followed a wild road lately, curtailing his once-frequent local
performances. This is only his third Knoxville show in the past year or more, and his first in six months. He's typically in his home town for a couple of days each week, but wearing out the tires of his big red pickup on I-40 between here and Nashville--where he's been using his time well.
<P> Nashville isn't corrupting this local man yet. "I'm not trying to fit in there," Morris says. "I'm not putting on any cowboy hats or anything. I've just got some intellectual property I'm trying to rezone
Commercial."
<P> Morris has one distinction he might not admit to his hard-drinking, music-outlaw
henchmen in Guitar City. MTSU has invited Morris, the Poet, to be an honored
guest at a writers' conference next month, to share a dais with three other
nationally known authors, including award-winning short-story writer Lee Smith and renowned biographer Peter Guralnick.
<P> So far the recording contract Morris has deserved for half a decade is still just around the bend. He's had publishing offers that may include a recording
package, but so far he hasn't settled on one.
<P> Morris is a performer who's perpetually arriving. As long as he keeps arriving
back in his home town, we can't complain.

</H1><P><STRONG>The Ray-O-Vacs (now the Kingpins) recycle pop culture
debris</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jesse Fox Mayshark</EM>
<P>Society is falling apart, and the Ray-O-Vacs are picking up the pieces.
<P>Not all of them, of course--just the ones they think are worth saving. Like a fake leopard-skin rec-room chair. Or a brick-red, two-foot-high meditating
Buddha, with a gaudy pink plastic gem embedded in his forehead. Or the music of Ennio Morricone (the guy who wrote those spooky, twangy guitar licks for
Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns).
<P>Or, in the case of gangly guitarist Dave Kenny, a grass hula skirt he's
contemplating wearing for a photo shoot outside the Chapman Highway Laundromat.
<P>"Do you think I should?" he asks. "It might be offensive. I mean, there are people who really wear these."
<P>The skirt waving loosely around his blue jeans, he consults with fellow
axe-grinder Michael "Ponch" Goldman on other possible props. Ponch offers some heavy-duty respirator masks from the trunk of his car. Dave looks skeptical.
<P>"Do you have any with sequins on them?" he asks.
<P>Welcome to the end of the 20th Century. Welcome to the world of the
Ray-O-Vacs, Knoxville's only surf-rock instrumental band. Formed in February by veterans of the Swamis, the Estradas and other local outfits, the Ray-O-Vacs
dogmatically resist all temptations to take themselves seriously. Their
dedication to not being famous, not landing a record deal, not doing much of anything but playing for the hell of it, is almost militant. And very, very refreshing.
<P>"What happens when you get that big break?" Ponch asks. "You spend all of your time on a bus, each record sells progressively less, you end up owing
some record company a jillion and one dollars and you've got nothing to show for it, really."
<P>Besides Dave and Ponch, the quartet includes Gene Krupa worshipper Daniel
Moore on drums, and a bass player who declines to give his name (for reasons
entirely unrelated to the fact that he's an employee of this magazine). We talk about a couple of possible pseudonyms, but never settle on anything. The closest we get is "Shakin' T. Willie."
<P>With the photo session complete, we retire to the interior of the band's
Chapman Highway rehearsal space for an interview. Shakin' T. (or whoever) calls it "the quintessential band practice room," and it is. And then some.
<P>The brown carpet is appropriately grimy and matted down, a few open bags of garbage and empty Budweiser 12-pack boxes sit by the door, and the drum kit and amps along the walls are flanked by a wide-ranging collection of kitsch. From the aforementioned chair and Buddha to the piles of girlie mags on the floor ("High-quality '70s European porn," Ponch assures me) to the
Baywatch poster on the back wall (which the band claims was put there by someone else--most probably the Viceroys, who share the space), it's a slice of post-war American heaven, via John Waters and Russ Myer. It's also a fair
visual equivalent of the Ray-O-Vacs' music.
<P>Although their own posters call their sound "surfabiliumptious," Dave is careful to note that the Ray-O-Vacs are not a real surf band. When I ask why, Ponch responds, "Real surf music is made in California. We're in Tennessee."
<P>Okay. So if it ain't surf, per se, what the heck is it? It's a high-octane mix of roots-rock riffs, Tex-Mex rhythms and a grab-bag of cultural references.
In concert, the Ray-O-Vacs charge through one 8- or 12-bar progression after
another, Dave and Ponch trading off leads while Shakin' T. (or whoever) pogos
madly in the foreground. The covers range from surf obscurities to classics like Del Shannon's "Runaway" (which tears along so frenetically you don't even miss the organ), and are interspersed with reverb-laden originals like "The Haunted Bikini." Accentuating the campiness is an on-stage go-go dancer,
"Sandy," in knee-high white boots and the band's trademark red sunglasses.
<P>If the absence of vocals and the near-uniform tempos sometimes make all the songs sound alike, that's all right with the band. Instrumental rock at its best is background music, they say--think of the themes to Mission
Impossible or the James Bond movies. In fact, the band's mellower pieces tend toward the neo-lounge movement.
<P>But don't confuse the Ray-O-Vacs studied goofiness with a lack of ambition.
Although all the members have white-collar day jobs, they have their own plans for multi-media world (or at least Knoxville) domination. They want to incorporate more visuals into the act--Shakin' T. suggests video monitors
showing Jane Fonda's Barbarella continuously. Also "in the works" is a video of their own. Titled "The Ray-O-Vacs Versus the Planet Von," it will be an homage to the spirit of B-movies.
<P>"You can admire artists, you can admire craftsmen, but I admire people that, no matter how untalented they are, really try hard, on a minimal budget or whatever, to produce something that they think is cool," Dave says.
<P>"That's what we're doing," Ponch concludes.

Revolution Block
</H1><P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>
Adam Bucco, Revolution Block's lanky, limber-limbed bassist, is a flat-out
hoot to watch. Instrument strapped to sternum (none of that low-slung Keith
Richards nonsense), arms cocked at careful angles, he tweaks and whumps
the high-gauge strings on his six-string bass with a bionic thumb, lithe
left-hand digits slinking up and down the extra-wide neck like a spider
dancing on a hot-plate. No wasted effort--all relevant parts moving with
bare-minimum efficiency.
<P>
The rest of his body, however, adheres to no such motion constraint. His
angular frame is draped over the axe with serpentine carelessness, his head
bobbing and whipping about on a rubber-band neck, his torso bending, snaking,
convulsing in sync with his own lewd, deep-dish groove. Betcha he didn't
learn those moves from Rusty Holloway.
<P>
But Bucco's on-stage comportment, part studied rigidity and part bumpin'-ass
jive, is pretty similar (metaphorically speaking) to Revolution Block's
sound. Equally adept at loose-bootied funk and sluggo riffage, these guys
like to come out swinging the heavy stuff, hitting you with a righteous
roundhouse gut-punch before pulling back and settling into a burbling,
percolating
groove.
<P>
"We're 'an eclectic mix of punk, funk and hardcore'--that's my stock
description," drawls Revolution Block guitarist Aaron Standridge, relaxing
in the shabby foyer of the band's rental storage practice hall. "We
go for a raw, aggressive type thing, as honest and direct as possible."
<P>
"The bands we like best are the bands that combine a heavy sound with
a sense of groove," says drummer Dan Orchik. "For us, it's all
about rhythm--it's all about getting people to move. There's nothing I hate
worse than going to a show and seeing everyone just standing there. I'd
much rather see a bunch of crazy mothers out there skanking in the pit."
<P>
But what sets the Block apart from a zillion other jive-happy mosh mavens
is song craft--hooks, melodies, lyrical relevance--elements which they don't
sacrifice in the heat of the moment. Raven-maned singer Jared Hasmuk has
been known to tame his ferocious croak, normally stuck somewhere between
Kurt Cobain's frayed rasp and Lemmy's gargling menace, and grace the band's
more melodic material with a palatable croon. And even though there's chops
a-plenty in the band's blitzkrieg rhythms, solos are few and far between.
<P>
"If a song has lots of energy and you stop for an 8-bar solo, the energy
is gone," says guitarist and chief riffsmith Chris Bertelsen. "I
don't like long solos. For the most part, we like to keep everything focused."
<P>
The band hasn't lacked focus or energy since storming the Knoxville scene
in the fall of '93. They bolted out of the starting blocks by playing their
first several shows in the Cruzer's Lounge tournament-style Battle of the
Bands. After weeks of competition, the heretofore unknown fivesome walked
away with first place, raising eyebrows and garnering more than a few fans
along the way.
<P>
"We had a couple of shows that were borderline disaster, but that contest
really helped get us started," Bucco says. "Winning earned us
lots of gigs without having to do anything."
<P>
Nonetheless, Revolution Block has done plenty in the months following the
Cruzer's triumph, earning a spot in several showcases, contributing to local
compilations (Volume '94 and All Ages, No Cover) and even taking a close
second place to red-hot Superdrag in the semi-prestigious UT Battle of the
Bands. Next up: a homebrew CD. Standridge says six tracks are already in
the can, waiting for the band to stow enough cash to lay down six more.
<P>
"We've talked to a guy who has a small indie label in Florida called
24 Hour Service Station," Standridge says. "He likes us, and we
want to see if he'll put up the remainder of the money for the disc. We're
also trying to get management and increase our out-of-town circulation,
but there's a lot still up in the air."
<P>
"God, I wish we had some idea of where we're going," Hasmuk laughs.
"We've learned a lot through the course of playing out. Of course,
most of it is very trivial information."
<P>
"We're pleased with what's going on so far," Orchik says. "We
just want to keep people coming to the shows. We're five of the most childish,
temperamental idiots you'll ever meet, and I don't think any of us could
get by in any other situation. I can't think of anything else I'd like to
do to make a living."

</H1><P><EM>by Mike Tatum</EM>
<P>It's 9:30 on a Wednesday night, and I'm waiting in the McDonald's parking lot to meet John "Louie" Lousteau of Sandbox for an interview. My first mistake
was arriving a little early. Not only am I the center of attention for the
nonstop drive-through clientele ("Look, mom--a homeless guy!"), but I have to suffer the torture of smelling the French fry factory behind me. The 27 cents in my coat pocket mocks my grumbling stomach. 
<P>My second mistake was in assuming too much. I didn't even ask what kind of car Lousteau would be driving to our rendezvous. He is a musician; I know what kind of car he'll be driving--a beat-up old Plymouth plastered with a bumper sticker papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; collage: Dead Kennedys, Smashing
Pumpkins, Black Flag, New Rock 90. No doubt about it.
<P>One or two cars that meet my requirements for "musician vehicle" drive by, but none stop. Finally, around 9:45, a rather large brown metallic mini-van
whips into the space next to mine. To my surprise, a nuclear family from Ohio does not step out. In fact, it's Lousteau, ready to take me to the Sandbox
HQ. This was to be just the first in a number of quirks that would leave me dumbfounded in Sandbox's rock 'n' roll world.
<P>Lousteau, Sandbox's drummer/vocalist, sports black shaven-top hair, a muscular build, and endless hyperactivity. He's only a few tattoos away from
being a miniature Henry Rollins. Todd Etheridge, vocalist/guitarist, is the
thinker in the band. His every word is well thought out and enunciated with
precision. Marc Inocco, guitarist, meets all the "rock god" requirements. He's got the hair, the good looks and the licks. Luckily for me, bassist Bobby Arndt couldn't make it. According to the others, he's the resident
smart-ass, and would have kept me there all night to talk about nothing.
<P>Sandbox plays self-described "velvet anvil" rock. As primary songwriter
Etheridge explains, "We can be heavy, but at the same time, [we can] have cool melodies too. My favorite kind of music is when a band has a good melody,
but a gut punch at the same time."
<P>Sandbox's music is a melody-infectious concoction of Smashing Pumpkins, King's X and H&uuml;sker D&uuml;. Their double-edged guitars and smooth, yet biting, vocals would satisfy any alterna-head's rock 'n' roll demons.
<P>And what's more, they're popular with their local rock band peers. "They're
such nice guys!" seems to come from the mouth of every person who's ever met these guys. How is it that a super-heavy alterna-rock band has such a
positive effect on all they encounter?
<P>"We've just got so many cool friends in town," Lousteau explains. "We hang out with Hypertribe, Immortal Chorus and The Gone Dogs. It's just a big group of friends that have always hung out together and played the music
scene." 
<P>Okay, so they're not snarling, nihilistic punks. What about on stage?
Nope--Sandbox doesn't cop an attitude there, either.
<P>"We can play with Immortal Chorus one week, and play with the Used or whoever the next, and everyone is cool," Lousteau insists. "Like last night, Tom and Brandon from the Used were there."
<P>"Everyone is out to help everyone else out," Inocco adds. "You can't really
have much of an attitude around here. I mean, so what [if] you play at the
Mercury a lot. What kind of attitude can you develop out of that?"
<P>The camaraderie Sandbox feels with its contemporaries comes from an admiration
for music on both a local and national level. This enthusiasm is not unique among bands just starting out, but it is for Sandbox, considering that
three-quarters of the band were once members of The Innocent Ones, a band that labored through five years of the local heavy metal scene.
<P>The weekend they played the Locals Only Showcase last month was their most successful yet. Over the course of the weekend, they gave out 600 stickers
and about 100 tapes.
<P>"I mean, if we could do that every weekend, that would be killer!" Lousteau
says. "We played in town in front of 700 people, and then we went out of town to play the next night. [We made] just enough money for some gas and some food. It was great!"
<P>Friendly, positive, optimistic... Sandbox runs counter to every precept of rock 'n' roll known to music writers far and wide.

<P><STRONG>Snazzy little quartet the Satellite Pumps are equally at home in the bar or the barn</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>Plenty of bands coming down the proverbial pike can brag, if they're the bragging types, about the uniqueness of their particular style. Every band has its own little bag of je ne sais quoi. Local up-and-coming combo the Satellite Pumps, for their part, certainly indulge in creating a rich and appealing setting for their music. It's a bona fide Cadillac style--and I'm talking about a late '50s Coupe de Ville gunning down a not-so-proverbial Kingston Pike with a trunk full of hi-test white lightning. But when I dropped by to chat with them recently, they won me over with a substantial display of simple character: since I hadn't seen them play before, they performed an entire set for me, in full regalia of coat &amp; tie and cocktail dress, as if they were playing for a full house. And then they served cake.
<P>Like such good manners, the Satellite Pumps sound is vintage, hailing from that 1950s nether region where country and western had not yet fully given way to rock'n'roll. It's a sound suitable for barroom, barn dance, or company Christmas party, which is exactly where the group had its inauspicious beginning (the best kind, of course).
<P>"My mom called me up," says bassist and singer (and a baker of some fine cake) Joy O'Shell, "and said 'Joy, it's two weeks to our Christmas party and we really need somebody to play, do you know anybody?' So we called ourselves Darlin' Daughter and the Do-Ma-Prouds, played for about 45 minutes, and made an amazing amount of money."
<P>O'Shell and guitarists Adam Hill and Harlowe Starrbuck later enlisted local hero Kelly Sprouse on drums and set about forging a more solid thing. Songs like "Killing My Heart" and "WSM 6-5-0" ring with the classic textural meeting of Fender electrics and a big banging acoustic box, carried along by an old-old-school shitkicking backbeat and a gracefully no-nonsense rhythm. Everything old is new again, and earnest songwriting cuts to the top to make the whole package timeless. Hill, the group's primary singer and lyricist, offers a most literate and historically aware explanation of their songwriting motivation.
<P>"I think there's a really good tradition in the 20th century of American loners, or American noble cynic-neurotics," says Hill, "like Humphrey Bogart to Paul Westerberg. It's guys like Neil Diamond and Roy Orbison, those great heart-on-their-sleeve characters."
<P>Hill populates his songs with these characters, drawing on the common historical thread of the cynical lovelorn loners who somehow retain their ethics in the face of amoral existentialism: from '20s hot jazz clubs and cabaret bohemia to '40s film noir. It comes about full circle, of course, through country and rock music, from Hank, Sr., to Westerberg.
<P>"I'm trying to represent that guy who's in the honky-tonk, and he's not really interested in drinking all night and sleeping with every girl he can," says Hill. "But he is there because he'd like to find somebody. He's not content to just sit at home and read a book."
<P>With this thoughtful and well-anchored theme in check, Hill cuts to the chase in his lyrics with a flair for one-liners. Case in point is the song "Killing My Heart": "You gotta have a crush if it's just a brush with destiny/ You gotta have an ache, if it's just for the sake of wishing we/ didn't know to fall in love, you probably need some help/ well you know I've always done it all by myself/ And it's killing my, killing my, killing my heart."
<P>"A lot of times, it's really pathetic--I'm really just trying to impress somebody," says Hill of songs like this one. "If I like some girl and she doesn't know it, I hope I write such a killer song that somebody says 'Gosh, that's a cool song, who's it about?' And they'll go tell her, and she'll be impressed with that song."
<P>They also like to impress audiences with a tasteful bit of showmanship, notably through their snazzy stage attire. Coat and tie is required for the gentlemen, and Ms. O'Shell dresses to the nines in vintage cocktail dresses.
<P>"If you're going to play, you might as well look like you're going to play," explains Hill. "I get sick and tired of bands showing up in their T-shirts and shorts."
<P>"It's like they're trying to be this 'I'm in my garage' kind of thing," says Starrbuck. "And we're not in our garage when we play, we're out there to entertain."
<P>"If you look at a picture of a great blues man," continues Hill, "or a great old honky-tonk singer, are they wearing their jammies? No."
<P>As Starrbuck says, "They're wearing their Sunday best."

<P><STRONG>Never mind pretty pop songs and indie slack -- The Scenesters know how to rock</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>

<P>Something's amiss at the 1996 MAK Showcase. It's not the crowd, which is well-behaved and nearly 700 strong. And it's certainly not the performers; each of the first four bands plays a nearly flawless set. Every cog and gear seems to be in perfect working order, and maybe that's the problem. Maybe this machine's a little too  well-oiled; maybe the collective demeanor is just a little too polite  for righteous rock 'n' roll.
<P>then someone announces the evening's fifth act and shoots propriety all to hell. A twitching and snorting herd comes thundering out of the walls as the Scenesters don axes and grab mikes, and there's a roiling, body-surfing, shoe-tossing human vortex swirling across the floor within moments of frontman Eric Otto's set-opening roar. No grooving. No shuffle-stepping. No pogoing. Just bodies a-flyin', much blood-mad grunting and the soggy FWAP!  of flesh on flesh.
<P>Why are all the wallflowers held suddenly rapt, swarming around like midnight moths on a lone porch light? Why are all the knuckleheads, heretofore unseen, suddenly climbing backs, riding hands and cracking skulls at center stage? Maybe because there's a certain ineffable something about the Scenesters, a slacker mojo essence to which only a handful of other Knox acts can lay claim. It's visceral, yet intangible; palpable, yet hard to define. It's the Rock Factor, and the Scenesters have it, in spades.
<P>"Knoxville has the head-bounce syndrome," Otto says in a quieter moment. "You play a show, and everyone just stands there and bounces their head and stares at your frets. It's like 'Come on--are you rockin', or are you just cockin' off?'"
<P>there's no question as to where the Scenesters cast their lot. Having come of age in the heyday of Sub Pop, these four 22-ish Catholic school refugees are unrepentant disciples of Cobain and Corgan, versed in the Gospels of early Grunge and hard-indie cool.
<P>Their rambling two-story brick house on White Avenue is a tainted temple, a grubby, blighted shrine beset with bad furniture, cobwebs, and missing windows. If you fight past the front-porch roadblocks of endless bottles, pizza boxes and bulging Hefty bags, you'll see the altars: wall-sized black-and-whites and psychedelic velvet homages to living gods (the Pumpkins, in flowing Gish regalia) and fallen heroes (Cobain and fellow Seattle casualty Andy Wood).
<P>But the sanctuary is in the basement, a dank and drafty maze of graffiti-covered yellow brick pillars, rusted radiators, assorted pipes and wires and lots of dirty concrete. Here, nestled among the cigarette butts and Bud cups, is a tiny carpeted stage, the hallowed focal point of a dozen-dozen keggers, and the place where the Scenesters place burnt offerings three times every week.
<P>"It's definitely a music house--among other things," says guitarist Craig Fralick. "Between the bands who've lived here, the bands who practice here and the bands who've played the parties, almost everyone who's anyone locally has been on this stage."
<P>The Scenesters came together in late 1994 after much band-hopping and intra-state mambo. Otto, late of Nashville's Father Ryan High, first joined Kingsport native David Curtright (bass) and Powell's Fralick (guitar) in the Callahans, a UT student "dorm band," two or three years back. The Callahans begat Pale Cast, which eventually begat the Scenesters when drummer Kevin Armbruster pulled up stakes from Nashville's Belmont College and headed East at his old Father Ryan schoolmate's behest.
<P>Now, after a year and a half of party gigs and schlepping around local clubs, the boys boast a respectable following as well as 25 finished songs. Six of those tunes are preserved on "Paprika," a locally distributed tape available at finer music emporiums near you.
<P>Most Scenester songs treat classic themes--young adult anomie and love gone awry. Otto confesses that much of "Paprika" was inspired by a former Pale Cast bandmate's tryst with his ex-girlfriend.
<P>But Otto and Fralick say newer tunes focus on story-telling and deeper themes. "Juniper," for instance, recounts the misadventures of Neptune's stepdaughter, whose fabled beauty was forever lost when she seduced the husband of a goddess.
<P>"It's still got that little whore ethic to it," Otto says with a grin. "But it's really about vanity. We're trying to get away from the more traditional rock 'n' roll ideas."
<P>Which might be a mistake, because the Scenesters' music, potent fuzztone bludgeon edged with ragged white-boy slacker blues, possesses a raw, hormonally charged quality that lends itself to love-gone-bad and other worldly woes.
<P>It's an edgy, combustible essence, evident on every song of every set the Scenesters play. You can see it when Otto, a gangling manchild with hollow eyes and (for now) purple hair, purrs into the microphone in a burnished bourbon drone, then recoils and curls up inside his bandmates' thunderous groove, thrashing away at his battered nut-brown Gibson SG.
<P>Then it happens, without warning, when Otto explodes, leaps forward and SCRREEEEEAAMMMSS, consuming the mike with a galvanic guttural roar, as if the devil himself was branding his twisted slacker soul with irons forged in Hell.
<P>Like a gas truck hit with a spark, audience and band ignite. Forget epic themes and high-concept folderol. It's the Rock Factor again, and the Scenesters have it.

Blowing the Blues
</H1><P><STRONG>The trumpet-assisted blues band Slow Blind Hill opens a vein
in
the Old City</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Jack Neely</EM>
<P>
Bullfrog's has one of the best looks of any bar in town. It's a battered
brick place with framed photographs of reggae bands on the wall, ceiling
fans and a front door wide open to Central Avenue on hot summer nights.
It looks like a beachside fisherman's bar somewhere in rural Cuba, about
six months after the last hurricane. If that's a phony front, it works anyway.
<P>
If you walk near that open door most Thursday nights this summer, you'll
hear some lowdown, dirty, electric blues, and a sly, damp, rolling vocal
that might make you think of Phil Alvin of the Blasters--and a jazz trumpet.
More about that later. You walk in the door, which is easy because there's
no cover, to hear where it's coming from. You look up on Bullfrog's tiny
stairwell stage--and then you keep looking, because all you see up there
are four middle-aged white guys who could pass for computer jockeys.
<P>
They're not. Jaimie Cameron, lead singer and guitarist for the band he calls
Slow Blind Hill, is a kitchen-appliance repairman, and not too proud to
say so in original songs like "Maytag Man." But he's an appliance-repairman
savant. Watching him, you might get the impression he's surprised to hear
those blue riffs rolling out of his guitar, the dark sound coming out of
his throat. But make no mistake--Cameron's already paid his dues with interest,
playing guitar with a series of blues and funk bands stretching back into
the '70s.
<P>
In the '80s, he led the quasi-rockabilly House Rockers, then the bluesier
Big Kabluey. Then his lead guitar galvanized the late Tomato Head sensation
Jacqui and the Tumble Kings. Cameron's back on the bottom again, starting
from scratch, but you get the feeling he doesn't mind. He's one of the city's
finest blues guitarists--so good that Terry Hill took a back seat to his
lead in the Tumble Kings. But for now Cameron's comfortable playing weeknights
on Central for free.
<P>
They heave a mixture of universally familiar standards, like "Stormy
Monday," "Hey, Bartender," and "All Shook Up,"
a few blues songs that might be familiar only to purists, and some original
pieces, like the aforementioned "Maytag Man." Cameron's own "Drinking
Tonight" is a melancholy, hauntingly beautiful piece that can leave
a bluish lump in your throat.
<P>
They play in front of a traffic warning sign, which makes you wonder if
there's an unlabeled Blind Hill somewhere, backed by what appears to be
the national flag of Mali. "The name's my fault," says Cameron,
suggesting we start a myth that there was some old Mississippi bluesman
who went by that name. (I wouldn't swear there wasn't.) Back behind Cameron
on that crowded stairwell where you can hardly even see them are Eddy Roberts
on keyboard bass and Big Kabluey veteran John Hawkinson on drums. And, sharing
the front, Tom Payne on trumpet.
<P>
If you didn't know, it's no ordinary thing to have a trumpet in a blues
band. But Payne, a versatile talent who even plays for 20th-anniversary
crowds on the Star of Knoxville, makes you believe. Some songs, like "Okey-Dokey
Stomp," are instrumentals, guitar-trumpet interchanges. I hesitate
to compare the sound that results to something like Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears,
because Slow Blind Hill is, mostly, better than that--but hearing a trumpet
cut out of a rhythm-and-blues number might make you think, just for a moment,
of something like "Lucretia MacEvil." Then Cameron's meaner guitar
and sincerer vocals return and remind you this is Slow Blind Hill, and there
may not be another band much like it anywhere.
<P>
When Payne plays on the riverboat, you see couples cuddling closer together.
When he plays at Bullfrog's, you see couples splitting up. Husbands and
wives start arguing on the sidewalk as they reach 131 South Central; he
wants to come in, she doesn't, or vice versa. They found a babysitter and
came down for an evening in the charming Old City. The only thing they hadn't
figured on was encountering The Blues. She's got a neat hairdo and a white
pocketbook, but for a moment she looks inspired, as if something just woke
up inside her--then frustrated. She walks in the door anyway, but before
it's too late, he pulls her back. There's no telling what would happen if
she went inside, if she breathed any more of this wicked blues air. Better
get her home safely as soon as possible. I saw this scene replayed, with
different characters, three times that night.
<P>
The main thing Bullfrog's lacks is more authentic riffraff. On the night
I was there, it was a small but diverse crowd, but the only ones dancing
were sorority girls doing that clutched-hands-in-the-air twist, the one
you've seen in all the beer commercials. They were having a good time even
with their dancing-impaired boyfriends, though, and you can't fault them
for that.
<P>
The no-cover thing can't last, of course but, for the moment, Slow Blind
Hill at Bullfrog's is likely the best deal in town. With a name like Slow
Blind Hill, it has to be.

Antsy &amp; Sluggo</H1>
<STRONG>Local punk purists the Slugboys wear their influences--and their attitudes--on their ripped sleeves</STRONG>
<EM>by John Sewell</EM>
<P>Twenty years ago when the news of punk rock filtered through the mass media to the hinterlands, everybody thought it was just a trend. Even the punks themselves would have told you that the move-ment's nihilism would cause a quick burnout and that built-in obsolescence was the master plan anyway. Well, here we are two decades down the road and, in a final ironic twist, punk is deeply embedded in the national scene and has strongly influenced a generation. Today you can expect to find a contingent of punk rockers in almost every town, no matter how small.
<P>Which brings us to Pigeon Forge, Tenn., the unlikely home of punk purists the Slugboys. The trio has been banging out their mix of high octane guitar riffs and adolescent rage for around a year, causing a ruckus in their hometown as well as in Knoxville. During their one year reign of terror, the boys have managed to play several shows in Knoxville, record a four-track demo, and take a couple of field trips to larger cities.
<P>The band's style is a conglomeration of the usual four-chord punk influences: The Ramones, The Misfits, The Subhumans, GG Allin and The Exploited. With titles like "Chainsmoker," "Mr. Rage," and "I Don't Want Her," The Slugboys' songs cover the standard post-teenage traumas of hanging out, girl problems, nothing to do, and--what else--drinking beer.
<P>Lead vocalist and guitarist Robbie says the band tries to avoid the angst of the grunge set in their lyrics. "We're not negative. I don't want to whine to people about hating myself and wanting to die. I mean, GG Allin did that better than I ever could, so we'll let him and Kurt Cobain have that angle. No offense to GG by lumping him in with Kurt Cobain."
<P>"Robbie writes all the lyrics, and the songs are just about everyday life in Sevier County and trying to bring the man down...just country hick bullshit," adds bassist Brad.
<P>Earlier this year, the band made a trip to New York to play at the very birthplace of punk, CBGB's on the Bowery. The trip was a kind of summer vacation for the guys, and they learned a few things along the way.
<P>"We played on a Monday night with a bunch of really bad Sebadoh kinds of bands," says Robbie. "We had to play last, and right before us was this death metal band that totally cleared out the place, so we played in front of five or six people. The only thing that got me through the other bands was drinking, so when I got up there I was slobbering drunk, and I forgot about half of the songs." So much for hitting the big time in the big city.
<P>Though the Slugboys claim that they don't adhere to a strict punk rock party line, they are openly critical of bands that have carried the punk sound to the MTV marketplace.
<P>"There is so much neo-punk going on, and it's all bullshit," says Brad. "I'm talking about bands like NOFX, No Doubt, and The Presidents of The United States. To me the whole punk thing is not just a trend, it's a way of life."
<P>"Brad is the big punk of the band, but I don't try to be totally punk rock," says Robbie. I think we're just rock 'n' roll."
<P>Drummer Bobby agrees, saying, "Punk is what we're doing, so I guess I'm a punk, but my main influences are bands like Slayer and Metallica."
<P>The Slugboys plan to continue to play out around the area and maybe make another trip to CBGB's in the future. They also hope to release a 7-inch record if they can find a backer.
<P>As to categorizing the band, Robbie is a little reluctant to claim too much allegiance with any particular musical clique. "We play fast songs, and we try to have an attitude of not caring what anybody else thinks," he says. "I mean we don't do a half-ass job, we try to do our songs really well. We just want to kick some ass and play some hard music."

My Dinner with Smokebomb
</H1><P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>

<P>This week's scene at Gryphon's is a lot like last week's scene, and probably a lot of scenes before that. It's late on an uptown Saturday night deep in the heart of Fort Sanders, and yet another sweaty triple-bill is under way at the Rock and Roll Palace known as Gryphon's. In the middle slot of the night, after the crowd is primed and ready by the opening band and before it wanders sleepily on home during the last band, Smokebomb is about to go out with--okay, I'll say it--a bang. They wrap up a tight, if tipsy, selection of rock numbers with a frenzied instrumental called "Ugly Good," complete with atonal feedback, the therapeutic yanking of bass strings and not a small amount of mad jumping around. When the noisiness finally dies down, the band members look at each other and laugh. It is, after all, just good, clean fun.
<P>It's a different scene the next day, when I meet up with Smokebomb for dinner amidst the hustle and bustle of a Sunday afternoon in West Knoxville. We opt for the simple pleasures and quietness of Buddy's Barbecue over the razzmatazz of Joe's Crab Shack, avoiding the chance that a waitress might start doing the Macarena on our table in the midst of the interview. After we settle in over BBQ sandwiches, hush puppies and pie, I hit Smokebomb with my most hard-nosed music journalist question: What the hell do y'all think you're doing?
<P>"We're damaging our hearing," says drummer/vocalist Alex McGill. "And the hearing of all those around us."
<P>"And having fun," adds bassist Keith Slayton.
<P>"It kind of depends on what seat you're in," jokes McGill. "The main thing that we've tried to do is create, as corny as it sounds, honest entertainment. We're not trying to be cool, we're just trying to get heard."
<P>To uphold this earnestness, these fellows put up with a lot of inconvenience that would stop most bands dead in their tracks. For one thing, none of them live in Knoxville--where the gigs are--and one lives in another state entirely. The three got together in Niota, Tennessee a few years ago for a loose jam session and, without forethought or intention, they found themselves in a rock band. Slayton and guitarist/vocalist Chris Cook still live in Niota, where Slayton is a student and Cook works as a pest control specialist ("Yeah, I like to kill bugs," he says). McGill, a native of Niota's twin city of Athens, teaches in Roswell, Georgia, where his second grade class has dubbed him "Mr. Big Mac." He commutes back to Niota for weekend band practices and, with increasing frequency, the three of them caravan into K-town for the bright lights of Gryphon's or the Mercury Theatre.
<P>The long-distance relationship doesn't seem to cramp Smokebomb's style, though. Their sound lies on the fresher side of good ol' three-piece rock-n-roll, with aggressive but melodic guitar work a' la the Meat Puppets. McGill and Cook share lead vocal duties Husker Du-style, with some nice overlapping harmonies adding an occasional prettiness to the choppy gee-tar stew. It's an energetic brand of contemporary Southern rock, in the vein of the critically acclaimed Georgia songwriter Jack Logan. While these are the closest comparisons to make, Smokebomb doesn't follow any particular formula.
<P>"You can't follow a rule book," says McGill. "That's a danger to get into, I think, when you like a band and want to emulate their style."
<P>In fact, Smokebomb seems to more enjoy talking about music which doesn't necessarily have an influence on their songs. They get most excited when discussing the finer points of Twisted Sister ("I am, I'm me!"), ELP, Dio and, most notably, the truckers' laments of Red Sovine.
<P>"I used to work a job traveling all the time, and I got a Red Sovine tape, just for the hell of it, just to laugh at it," says Cook. "Man, I got to listening to that tape and I listened to it on every trip. All them trucker songs--it was awesome. You stare on down the road and you can relate with it."
<P>"But then you also can relate to things like Sonic Youth," says McGill.
<P>"Well, I like Sonic Youth," corrects Cook. "I wouldn't say I really relate with them."
<P>"We all have our guilty pleasures and weird tastes," admits McGill.
<P>"I think we all grew up on bad heavy metal," says Cook.
<P>All influences and non-influences aside, the Smokebomb guys know the true futility of trying to describe one's own music. They keep a couple of standard non-sequiturs on hand which may or may not pinpoint their sonic style.
<P>"If the Beatles slept with Nirvana while listening to a Richard Pryor 8-track," offers Cook. "Or I've told some people we sound like a cross between Black Sabbath and Barney the dinosaur."

<H1>Spank Major Hijack<IMG SRC="spank_major.gif" ALT="Spank Major Hijack" HEIGHT=188 WIDTH=240 HSPACE=10></H1>
<STRONG>Setting sail with Knoxville's political pirates of percussion</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>Rock 'n' roll history is full of bands whose names inspire big question marks when first tossed around by the hippest obscure music critics. From the quaint &amp; quirky (Strawberry Alarm Clock, Jeff-erson Airplane) to the bizarrely offensive (Dead Kennedys, Butthole Surfers) to the simply indecipherable (Ein-strzende Neubauten, 'nuff said), it has long been the clever rocker's duty to make the straight news announcer arch an eyebrow and pause sarcastically before mentioning the music world's latest threat to pop sensibility.
<P>Knoxville can now proudly boast of having birthed such an ensemble from the fickle nine-headed beast that is the local music scene, and the eyebrows won't stop furrowing once the music starts, either. It's a complete package of the out of the ordinary. It's not super, it's not cute--hell, it's not quite even syntactical. It's an odd and cacophonous bird known as Spank Major Hijack. These folks draw outside the lines from the get-go. They beat on homemade drums, they do cartwheels, they sing songs about late 19th and early 20th century radical politics. And they like to dress like pirates.
<P>"Our name, of course, incorporates sex and revolutionary politics," explains drummer/vocalist "Jazzy" James Henry. "The 'major' part we're still working out."
<P>"James really wanted the word 'hijack' in our name," says bassist Beau Hart.
<P>"Then I saw a flyer for Jan Svankmeyer, the Czech puppeteer/ animation guy," says lead vocalist Marko Sonnie, "and I thought 'Svankmeyer--that sounds like spank major--Spank Major Hijack!' Then we wrote down about forty other names and voted them all down."
<P>"Sirhan Saran Wrap came close," says Henry.
<P>But Spank Major Hijack by any other name would be as unique. With two drummers, a bassist, a theatrically hyper lead vocalist, and the occasional trumpeter (yes, that's right, no guitars) their line-up hardly fits into the classic rock thing. The Spank Major sound does hearken back to some classic punk sounds, but not to the influences that most contemporary pop-punk bands bother to cultivate. The drum corps of Henry and Marie Potter call to mind late '80s era Butthole Surfers, beating out punk-tribal rhythms on an array of percussion devices, from the standard trap set to bungee-suspended water bottles. Hart's bass playing stomps through all the low-end sludge puddles, from Fugazi-style harmonics to angry, fuzzy rumblings of bands like the Birthday Party. Over this already dynamic stew, the three primary instrumentalists trade vocal volleys with acrobatic front person Sonnie, bringing back memories of the seminal British political band Crass. Filter these influences through a love of in-your-face activism and a disdain of sound-alike alterna-rock, and you begin to grasp the Spank Major Hijack sensibility.
<P>"We're making music and getting off big time," explains Potter.
<P>"That sums it up right there," says Sonnie. "I think it's important for people in a band to basically go berserk and put on a show. A lot of bands just stand there, and they might be good at playing, but the visual aspect of a show is not there." Paul Stanley of Kiss has made similar statements.
<P>"That's a perfect example of how, if you just go off at a show, it makes it a hell of a lot more interesting than if you just play really good music," says Sonnie. "If you're not afraid to act like a total dumbass."
<P>"We're going for a comedy-musical thing," adds Henry. "We want to have songs that personally mean something to us, and that we even hope will inspire somebody. But we also want to have a big sense of humor, because we all like to cut up."
<P>"Let me say the words: Spike Jones--that's where it's at," agreesSonnie. It's a sort of "going off" that the band hopes will be infectious to their audiences.
<P>"Yeah, we'd love for people to dance at our shows," says Henry.
<P>The latest manifestations of this mixture of substance and presentation are the aforementioned pirate outfits: red and black striped shirts, eye patches, and belts with big buckles. Add in a little faux swordplay and the Long John Silver-esque catch phrase ("Argh!"), and the motif is in full effect.
<P>"James went to Key West on his vacation," says Hart. "And eversince, he's been obsessed."
<P>"Pirates," says Henry, "we are pirates."
<P>"I'd like to be pirates as a band," says Sonnie. "Go in and take over a show--kill the band and start playing."
<P>"I just haven't found a bayonet to fit onto my bass yet," says Hart.
<P>It's a fitting theatrical and comedic touch to the presentation of songs concerning historical revolutionaries, as in "Baader Meinhoff Stomp," concerning Germany's Red Army Faction, or "Czolgosz," an anthem about the assassin of President McKinley. Mix in "The Scorcher," an amalgam of 1890s rebel bicycling anthems, and the whole Spank Major Hijack package becomes a history lesson in the realm of revolutionary politics.
<P>"As far as I'm concerned, old timey is always better and more interesting," says Sonnie. "You can resurrect old things, old ideas that are actually still really new ideas because no one's ever accepted them. Most people have never heard any of the shit that we refer to in those songs."
<P>"Besides," adds Hart, "the originators are always more interesting than the imitators."

<P><STRONG>Go underground with local technophiles the Speed Freeks</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Shelly Ridenour</EM>
<P>Once the 1995 critics' picks rolled in, there was no more ignoring it. Albums by Moby and Tricky rode the crest of as many top ten lists as P. J. Harvey, with Goldie and the Chemical Brothers not far behind. "Jungle" and "trip hop" have worked their way into the language of Spin and MTV. And we are all faced with the question: Is techno the new zeitgeist?
<P>Yes, techno, the sensory-assaulting soundtracks of raves, the bucking backlash against all things unplugged, the repetitive blip-boom-blip-boom-blip...
<P>"Uh-uh, we don't want to do that," insists Scott Wilkerson--keyboardist, publicist, manager, agent and, according to his bandmates, "all-around good guy" of Knoxville's own techno band, the Speed Freeks.
<P>"But right now in techno, instead of song structures--verse, chorus, verse--you have more of a Philip Glass type of structure," he concedes. "It's dance music, and it's gotta be repetitive, or it wouldn't work on the dance floor."
<P>The Speed Freeks, however, do follow a traditional--albeit loose--song structure, building bridges and choruses, memorable vocal hooks and intense rhythms, over techno's typical 32 counts of the high hat.
<P>"It's hard to play live and not have that song structure," Heath Shinpaugh insists. "There's no way I could go out there and play a live set of dance music. There's no way I could go out there and play the same thing for 20 minutes and not get bored with it."
<P>Speaking of getting bored ... well, what's so exciting about watching a bunch of programmers up on stage? The band insists that they are actually more connected with their audience than your typical guitar-bass-drum set up.
<P>"Because our stuff is electronic and pre-recorded, that allows us the freedom to not worry about anything going wrong," Shinpaugh asserts. "We're free to entertain. We can connect with the crowd."
<P>"We don't just play our music. We perform," Robert Mitchell adds. "We get into our music. We love it. We go crazy onstage 'cause we love it so much."
<P>Mitchell is the frontman, the emcee, the Bob Barker of the whole affair, all flailing limbs and infectious energy, working to provoke the crowd to action. Wilkerson, Shinpaugh--who also DJs at the Underground on Monday nights--and John Hall are a revolving lineup behind the keyboards, turntables and drum pads.
<P>"We've had the luxury of playing almost exclusively at raves," Wilkerson notes. "So whereas most bands end up playing at a club for maybe 150 people, we tend to play in front of a couple of thousand."
<P>"And it's not like, 2,000 people and maybe 100 people in front of the stage," Mitchell adds. "It's 2,000 people right there in your face, moving."
<P>Those numbers don't come easy, though.
<P>"We face obstacles. Not only is this a college town, it's a one-club town. There's the Underground and nothing else," Wilkerson explains. "And people think, 'If I can go to this big, incredible club with big sound and big lights for $3, why should I spend $10 on a rave?'
<P>"We work extra hard to maintain a live setting," he adds. "We four are the Speed Freeks, but when we play live we have a rapper, Jonathan Wells, and a guitarist, Bing (Numskull) Fu. We're hoping to incorporate and sample some of his riffs onto our next album."
<P>Listening to their first album, The Himalayan EP (Ripchord Records), kickstarts stomach-churning memories of the neckbreaking Tennessee Valley Fair staple for which it is named--and the accompanying soundtrack that serves as a sign of the times, from the Motley Crue of my middle-school years to the Wu-Tang thrills and spills that boomed forth from the midway last fall. The Speed Freeks have managed to duplicate the blood-pressure soaring high and sensory overload sensation of the ride, that whirring air raid siren that blasts when the operator trips the controls to mega-super-hyper speed, or throws the thing into reverse. Either way, you know the noise signals one thing: somebody, anybody, everybody scream.
<P>"Our first CD was hardcore breakbeat [hyper-speed hip-hop beats layered with manic synth lines, booming sub-bass and catchy soundbite samples]," Wilkerson explains, "like the Prodigy--our favorite band. The big thing right now is amyl house, like Chemical Brothers, and that's what you're gonna see from us more. Slower, more danceable. The other stuff ... about 30 minutes of it is all you can take on a dance floor."
<P>In the techno scene, styles--fashion, hair color, piercings, music--are flavor-of-the-month, moving in and out at the speed of the very beats that shake the technophiles' booties. Acid house, dub, breakbeat, jungle, ambient, trance--and by the time this story hits the street, it'll be something else.
<P>"Every six months it's a new thing," Hall sighs.
<P>Is techno the disco of the '90s? The biggest problem with that put-down is that techno has, in fact, been around since the early '80s, when electro pioneers like Kraftwerk and Art of Noise used clean, 120-bpm drum machine patterns and heavy delay to get their point across.
<P>"Our style is constantly broadening, because it has to," Shinpaugh says. "Unless you created a style, you'll never keep up with it. By the time you put it out, it's old. It has to be done before it's even 'in.'"
<P>"You can't slow down for a minute," Wilkerson adds, "or people will forget about you."
<P>And, though they may be their hometown's best kept secret, the Speed Freeks have certainly worked their way into someone's consciousness.
<P>"It's lonely being a techno band in Knoxville," Shinpaugh says, tongue planted only halfway in cheek.
<P>"There may be others, but we're the only ones out of the closet," Wilkerson says.
<P>"Scratch that!" Mitchell cries, reaching for the tape recorder's "off" button.
<P>"Naw, that's pretty literal, man," Shinpaugh figures. "As many people as say they don't like techno, we've sold out of CDs at Cat's, sold out at Disc Exchange ... someone's buying them, and I'm not thinking it's a bunch of little old ladies."

</H1><P><STRONG>Stinkfoot USA takes its rock 'n' roll lifestyle
not-so-seriously</STRONG>
<P> <EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P> Late on a muggy August evening, just south of the Knox-Union county line: the blue glow of a television flickers from inside the modest ranch-style house of the Ratliff family, the nervous scratch of rutting cicadas echoes
through the pines on a lukewarm breeze, and one of a seeming endless number of cats is having kittens under the porch.
<P> In the middle of this pristine East Tennessee moment, haloed by the flat glare of 60-watt porch lights, about all I can get out of Stinkfoot USA are inside jokes and outrageous lies about their musical plans. It's obvious from the start that these guys are smart enough to know the clich&eacute;s of the "rock and roll interview," and they are eager to skewer the whole embarrassing process before honoring me with any inkling of truth.
<P> "We're looking forward to touring Japan next month," smirks bald and burly frontman Jon Wallace, veteran vocalist of numerous Knoxville bands.
"Budokan was great last year."
<P> "Did they put out our laser-disc concert of that yet?" wonders left-stage guitarist Bo Ratliff. Wallace nods affirmation.
<P> "We hope to be featured on ESPN2, with jocks doing their thing to groovy rock music," quips right-stage guitarist Brett Winston.
<P> "I only have two words to say about anything," declares drummer Jason Ratliff. "Frank Zappa."
<P> Wallace, Winston and the Ratliff brothers are part of, literally, the biggest
rock band in town. Along with bassist Bill Ardison and percussionist Jason White, only the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra takes up more room on a stage. But they didn't win this year's UT Battle of the Bands by numbers alone. They won because their sound is one of the freshest in town, and they have stage presence to spare.
<P> Disregarding fads of goth, grunge and techno, Stinkfoot USA (so named to avoid confusion with the Canadian group simply called "Stinkfoot") produces an ensemble sound that is upbeat, aggressive and, dare I say, musical.
They rise above the usual run of "musician" bands, though--as in where the statement "They're really good musicians" is an apologetic euphemism for "They're really boring." They have an infectious energy and likeability that many "technical" bands lack.
<P> Guitarists Ratliff and Winston's intelligent hooks and riffs ride along on the self-assured drive of Ardison's bass groove. The dual drum/percussive
action of the other Ratliff and White provides not just a beat but flavoring,
from straight-up rock to Latin jaunt. The whole package rings with stylistic
echoes of Pere Ubu and rhythmic hints of the Big Boys.
<P> "Actually, it's pretty remarkable that with so many people, our sound is really sparse," says Wallace, and he's right. There is still plenty room in a Stinkfoot song for the listener to breathe.
<P> Wallace's acrobatic vocal expression, honed from a vocal resume ranging from the agitated punk of the STDs to the jazz smoothness of the Lawn Darts, caps the entourage off with a flair of, well, smooth agitation. His voice offers a sharp point of focus for an already tight unit, pulling hooks, riffs, grooves and rhythms into actual songs.
<P> Wallace sums up his lyrical style simply: "I don't know if I write songs really about anything. What I try to do is make little portraits of
somebody's life."
<P> The active-but-not-too-busy nature of their sound works well with Stinkfoot's
jovial attitude and stage manner. When they perform, they put on a
show--especially Wallace, who does something akin to dramatic physical interpretation. His
in-concert posing serves the band live just as his voice does sonically, a focus of drama amidst the jam. Between his antics and White's doodling with an amazing variety of percussion instruments, something is always happening
on stage.
<P> But perhaps the band members themselves best describe their inspiration and style.
<P> "Before I write a lick I ask myself, 'What would Eddie Vedder do?'" claims Winston.
<P> "Before I get up in the morning I ask myself, 'What would Eddie Vedder do?'" counters Wallace. "Then I reach for a pad of paper and write a poem."
<P> "The truth about us is really just too boring to say," continues Winston. "A couple of us, but not all of us, are good enough to be a musicians' band. Even the people who are really good don't do solos. You know, so it's not really about that. It's like a step below that."
<P> "Yet a step above," adds Wallace.
<P> "To say the least," agrees Winston. "A step above with one leg up."
<P> "We're kinda like Supertramp in way," offers Bo Ratliff.
<P> "Which way is that?" asks Wallace with an incredulous chuckle.
<P> "I think a lot of it comes from bands like the Minutemen," suggests Winston, offering a quite plausible reference point.
<P> About this time in our discussion, percussionist Jason White discovers the nearby miracle of birth: "It looks like this cat is having kittens over here."
<P> "Everybody grab one," says Bo Ratliff, looking around at the already plentiful feline population on the porch.
<P> Wallace waxes philosophical about the blessed event. "Jerry dies and then we witness birth," he says.
<P> It's an eerily fitting end to my evening with Stinkfoot USA, as Winston baits me with mock seriousness. "Hey, aren't you gonna ask us what we think of the local scene?"
<P> Intrepidly, I ask the question. The reply is typical Stinkfoot smart-assedness.
<P> "No comment."

like some kind of ancient Chinese torture method just beneath the low ceiling of the 9:30 Club. On stage, Superdrag is tired and hungry, having driven nine hours straight from Knoxville to Washington, D.C. and then loading their
equipment in through the rain. 
<P>It was only when they finally got inside that they discovered they were not, in fact, playing the club's main stage, but the second--and much
smaller--stage ... in the basement. Looks like a basement, smells like a
basement, sounds like a basement. Right now, the floor is littered with a maze of cables, power tools, guitar cases and backpacks, making this hole in the wall seem even smaller than it probably is. The official fire code
capacity for the room is 100, but they're going to have to be 100 really skinny people.
<P>"Check two, check two, check, check, check&nbsp;..."
<P>Finally, after an impossibly long sound check, the static is removed, and the band is free to kill time before the show begins.
<P>"'Ooh, you're signed to a major label, you must have a big bus. Roadies to carry your stuff,'" bassist Tom Pappas mocks as he stuffs a pedal into his bag and struggles to zip it shut. "Right."
<P>Despite what you might have heard, inking a contract with a major record label does not automatically constitute a Cinderella story. Bands are guaranteed
the "Once upon a time," but no Artists &amp; Repertoire man in the world can promise a "happily ever after." And these days, one-hit wonders are here
today and gone tomorrow as quick as the MTV Buzz Bin can spit them out.
<P>Superdrag, Knoxville's own pop stars in the making, are "busting ass" to make their fairy tale come true since signing with Elektra Records, an arm of Time-Warner, last April. The past few months have been a whirlwind of recording, touring, pumping hands, ringing phones, industry schmoozing and basically spreading their name to anyone who will listen. In other words, the Great American Rock 'n' Roll Dream. 
<P>Superdrag has gone from being the biggest fish in Knoxville's little pond to fresh bait in the sea of sharks that is the music industry. Will they sink or will they swim?
<H3>Anticipation is making me wait, keeping me waiting...
</H3><P>"Damn it, Tom, move over! And give me that pillow," guitarist/ vocalist
John Davis grouses inside the Chevy Beauville van as it rolls along I-95 en route from D.C. to the Big Apple, slowing down only long enough for the driver to toss exact change into the hands of yet another vacant-eyed toll booth attendant. Pappas hurls the pillow at Davis, who is sprawled high atop the amps and guitar cases and suitcases and sleeping bags stacked behind the back seat, his nose inches from the roof. 
<P>Drummer Don Coffee is searching the floor for a tape that "rocks," discarding
the Beatles and the Zombies in favor of Foo Fighters. Brandon Fisher, guitarist
and "the literary one," has put down the pages of Oscar Wilde for his turn at the wheel. An anglophile of sorts, whose near-translucent complexion has
earned him the nickname "the Limey" from his bandmates, Fisher is chatting with sound man/engineer Nick Raskulinecz, whose boots are toes-up alongside a menacing pair of plastic rats holding court on the dash. Outside the
grime-streaked and insect-stained windows, the landscapes of Maryland, then
Delaware, then New Jersey zoom past.
<P>Much of the "glamorous" life of a major league-yet-small potatoes rock 'n' roll band is spent cooped up in a van littered with Starburst wrappers, used McDonald's cups, assorted magazines, equipment catalogs and a mountain of cassette tapes. There is never enough room. Napping calls for the talents of a contortionist. Meal times are nearly impossible to coordinate for five
people, to say nothing of bathroom stops. There are no secrets in a touring van; everything, every bodily function, is a subject for conversation.
<P>And it seems that for every minute spent cooped up in the van waiting to get to a club, the band will spend equal time cooped up backstage in said club waiting to play. After the show they'll have to wait around for the
headlining band to play, wait around to collect their money from the club
management (Pappas, with his imposing afro, monotone baritone and penchant for dark glasses, is the designated "hard ass" in charge of this task), wait
around to load out their equipment.
<P>"The way I justify the waiting around is that the alternative is sitting at a desk or washing dishes from 9 to 5," Fisher reasons. "I'm perfectly happy to drive all day and then work a few extra hours. Our days may go from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m., but I'd much rather do this than sit at a desk."
<P>It was that logic that finally convinced Coffee to hang up his badge and
holster. A former investigator for the public defender's office, he was the only one in this mod squad who actually forsook a health plan for a life in the biz.
<P>"For me, it's always been a dream to do this. I've played with some really
shitty bands and people I didn't have a whole lot of respect for because I thought they might be able to get me here. I've always looked to other people to get there, 'cause I couldn't do it by myself. No one's signing up drummers to make records," Coffee admits.
<P>"And from the very first day I heard John play guitar and sing, I knew if anybody was gonna get out of Knoxville it was gonna be him."
<H3>Johnny Thunders
</H3><P>John Davis, 21, grew up in West Knoxville (as did Fisher, 24, and Coffee, 27; Pappas, 25, is an expatriate from Philly), graduated from Farragut
High School in 1992 and spent his adolescent years alternately on a skateboard
and a Gibson Les Paul guitar. A self-admitted Beatles fanatic, Davis boasts an incredible knowledge of trivia--both useful and useless--about the Fab Four, and he's even been known to tote Beatles biographies to the barber shop as a style reference. 
<P>Though he did time behind the drums for local junk punk outfit the Used
(which, at one time or another, included every single member of Superdrag) and wielded bass for the short-lived Punch Wagon, Superdrag is, for all intents
and purposes, Davis's first real band, at least as a frontman. The main
songwriter and melody maker behind the Superdrag sound, it is Davis who makes
those bittersweet love-hate-love songs ring true. And, according to Boston-based
record producer Tim O'Heir (who's also produced albums for indie rock darlings
Sebadoh and Come, to name but a few), it is Davis who will sell Superdrag to America.
<P>"He's it. Period. The kid's a rock star. Who knows how he rehearses, by
watching Beatles videos countless times or by practicing in front of a mirror,
but he's definitely got his own act," O'Heir says. "He's got these guitar moves, he pulls [the guitar] up and cradles it and gives this sickly sweet look to the crowd. And all the girls are standing at the front of the stage just staring at him."
<P>The fact that Davis hit a home run on his first try gives his bandmates cause for at least occasional concern.
<P>"He's 21, and I don't know if he realizes what a big deal this all is. To him it was the next logical step. Ten years I've been trying to do this; it took John not even three years," Coffee says. "John's not having a chance to really grow up. He went from living in his parent's house to this. In a way, Superdrag's like a family. We try to take care of him. Not that he can't take care of himself, but I always want the best for John. If he ever says, 'Man, I'm sick of playing shows, I'm sick of traveling,' I would say what I told myself when I quit my job--do something that makes you happy."
<P>Right now, Superdrag is one happy band. Their major label debut, which is as yet untitled, was originally supposed to be released on an independent
label, paid for and distributed by Elektra. Instead, it's now slated for
Elektra's roster of beginning-of-the-year releases.
<P>"Their expectations were not really big," Davis admits. "When we were done, we sent a work tape to Sylvia [Rhone, chairwoman and CEO of Elektra]. She was on vacation and had a tape of just 'Whitey's Theme,' but she listened to it over and over again. And she called from vacation and said 'We've gotta do this. We don't wanna share the toys, we want all the toys.'"
<H3>So you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star...
</H3><P>So what sold Superdrag to Elektra? Four out of four band members
agree--the songs.
<P>In the most convenient terms available, Superdrag makes power pop, with
classic echoes of the Beatles as well as modern nods to British "shoegazers" My Bloody Valentine and Chapel Hill indie rockers Archers of Loaf, perfectly
suited for college and commercial alternative radio--not to mention MTV. An audio embrace of teasing guitar build-ups, atmospheric riffscapes, punch-drunk
rhythms, and heart-on-the-sleeve lyrics expressed alternately in a jilted sigh, starry-eyed plea and pissed-off wail, Superdrag songs possess the magic
element of infectious melodies that cling to your memory and refuse to let go.
<P>"They're catchy as shit, and Elektra knows they can make money off of them," Pappas reasons. "People sing them in their head. They [Elektra employees]
sing them in their heads. People who work at the studio were humming the songs. That's what freaks me out, when I see the reaction people have. It's
definitely not background music."
<P>Fisher admits, "Whatever musical trend is happening right now may have helped us get where we are as easily as we have. Just as of late, songs have
become popular again and people are remembering that songwriting is good. I think if you dissect our songs, we may not have cool riffs, but when you put it all together it works."
<P>"One of the things that really helped is that we're not all lunatics," Coffee adds. "I mean, we have our moments. But when we sat down at the table and we knew what we wanted, and we knew how to talk to people and how to conduct ourselves ... that sold us, too. We try really hard to make sure we know what we're talking about before we meet with anyone. We don't want people to think we're a bunch of idiot band guys."
<P>Of course, a little luck and a whole lot of talent doesn't hurt, either.
Superdrag had only been together seven months or so when they got their first
lucky break in the spring of '94. Inspired by the lo-fi aesthetic of the
Grifters' "Holmes" single on Darla Records, Davis sent a batch of his own
homemade four-track recordings to the address on the back of the sleeve. James Agren, founder, owner and operator of the tiny San Francisco independent
record label, loved what he heard.
<P>"I was a little worried when we sent him the eight-track demos 'cause the fidelity was totally different," Davis says. "But the next time I spoke to him, he said, 'Do you wanna do a record or what?' Famous last words."
<P>Then, later that summer, Superdrag ventured off on a mini-tour of the
Southwest and West Coast, playing their first and so-far only L.A. gig--to a total of five people. They were paid with a pack of Marlboros. Ironically, that seemingly uneventful show became one of the most important of their
burgeoning career--out of the five paying customers who showed up, the band
gained a manager, a lawyer and a major label A&amp;R rep who later courted them, as well as Agren, who agreed to release some Superdrag 45s in a "no strings attached" deal.
<P>From there, there was no stopping the Superdrag express. Their first single
for Darla, "Senorita," came out in September of '94 and garnered positive reviews in magazines from Alternative Press to College Music Journal, as well as inclusion on a CD sampler of buzz bands CMJ sends out monthly to college radio stations. That's when the labels started nosing around. Mammoth
Records requested a show. Reps from Caroline Records and Sub Pop Publishing flew into town to see the band play on their home turf. Restless Records offered a contract, which they turned down ("It was crap and anyone would've
turned it down," Davis says. "They wanted to take everything and offer nothing in return."). 
<P>Suddenly, Bill Berrol, the lawyer Superdrag shares with label mates the Afghan Whigs--and who does not solicit his bands to labels--began getting calls.
<H3>Major label politics
</H3><P>"Around the fall of '94 it became evident that we weren't going to have any trouble getting a record deal," Davis remembers. "Our worries changed
from 'is anybody going to give us a chance to do this,' to 'who can offer us the best opportunity?'"
<P>By the time major players MCA and Elektra Records were laying deals on the table, "we really started to think about the future a lot," Davis says. "It wasn't later, it was sooner. We knew we had to get our heads together and present a united front. And anyone who thinks we made decisions by the seat of our pants is crazy. We thought things out to the point where we were
going nuts."
<P>In the end, Elektra Records, home over the years to such modern rock favorites
as the Afghan Whigs, Stereolab and the Pixies, won out simply because, as Davis puts it, "They were the best label we talked to. Period. We were totally
turned on by the tour support and promotion that a major [label] can offer, and Elektra offered us the best deal at the right time."
<P>But for the past year or so, internal rumblings have been shaking the Warner Music Group--the world's largest record company and parent to Elektra,
Warner Brothers and Atlantic, among others--to its hit-making core. Power
struggles among label heads and Time Warner exec Robert Morgado lead to the
departure (some would say forcing out) of legendary label patriarchs Mo Ostin of Warner Brothers and Bob Krasnow of Elektra. Atlantic chief Doug Morris won the much coveted seat at the head of the Warner Music table, and used his new power to appoint Rhone, the first black woman ever to head a major label, to the CEO position at Elektra, while former Nirvana manager Danny
Goldberg inherited Morris's old seat at Atlantic.
<P>As simple as it sounds in this context, the shake-up was in fact the biggest
news to hit the music business in years, maybe decades, setting off a storm of controversy within the entertainment industry and the media. When Morris was fired from his post in July, rumors immediately began circulating about the stability of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s; in fact, Goldberg announced his departure just weeks ago. Rhone is still in her office at the Time Warner
Building, though one has to question the status of Superdrag should their
highest-ranking cheerleader leave.
<P>"My biggest worry is that we'll get lost in some sort of shuffle," Pappas
says. "I don't want our February release date to be pushed back."
<P>"I've heard rumors," reports Jake Ottman of Damage Gods Management, who
manages the band along with West Coast partner Scott Cymbala, and who worked
radio promotions and marketing at Elektra from 1991-94. "People on the inside say Sylvia is about to be 'blown out,' industry-speak for 'fired.' I think the worst thing a band can do is get caught up in that stuff and worry themselves
sick over it. If Sylvia was to leave tomorrow, it doesn't put them in total
jeopardy. We're doing as much as we can on our own to sell Superdrag and not be dependent on the label. The goal is to push the band as far as we can, then go to Elektra and hand them the hit single on a silver platter."
<H3>$$$$$$
</H3><P>One of the big questions buzzing its way through the smoky air at the Mercury Theatre and the Longbranch is: How much money did Superdrag get? The answer isn't simple, and it's also not as much as you might think.
<P>The money is referred to in terms of "periods" for each record, with $75,000
allotted the first record. That lump sum is then broken down into budgets for recording, touring, equipment and personal expenses. For instance, $28,000
was the band's original recording budget, spent during studio time at Easley
Studios in Memphis and mixing time at Fort Apache Studios--famous for the power pop sounds of Juliana Hatfield, Dinosaur Jr. and others-- n Boston. That pays for everything from studio time to tapes, the producer's fee and even his rental car, the band's hotel bills and other necessary expenses. 
<P>The current touring budget is $20,000, including a $20 per diem for each
member of the band. Ten thousand dollars is allotted for equipment, ranging from new guitars to road cases, amps and repair work. As for living the big life, the band currently gets monthly checks from Elektra for $500 each to cover rent, groceries, Cuban-heel boots and foosball replacement balls--all the necessities of life.
<P>"The money is overseen by accountants who know where every cent goes," Davis explains. "They put the money back that was to be used for the record, so that couldn't be touched. Taxes are already computed so we don't overspend.
And we have to send in reports and receipts for everything."
<P>The "real" money comes in once they start selling records--Superdrag will earn about 75 cents from each record sold. In other words, if they reach the remarkable goal of going "platinum," or selling one million records, they would earn $750,000. The band is still hammering out the songwriting
royalties, and how best to give credit where credit is due.
<P>"John wants the record to say 'All songs by John Davis, arranged by
Superdrag,'" Fisher says. "The way we've got it worked out is a 70-10-10-10
split."
<P>Of course, although Elektra pays for all of these things, the band must later pay them back--that $75,000 is an advance against royalties. (However, if the band should break up, Elektra would not hound them for the balance, but simply consider it a tax write-off.) Every time their manager "takes them out" for dinner, that receipt finds its way back to their account and they pay for it later. All of the hotel room bills Elektra charges actually come out of Superdrag's pockets in the long run. All of the hours and days and weeks they spent in the studio they will pay for. The music industry takes no one for a free ride.
<H3>Gimme indie rock?
</H3><P>The band and what could be called their entourage (girlfriends, Ottman,
their A&amp;R rep) are lounging around the shabbily chic lobby of RPM Studios in New York City, half-listening as O'Heir and Raskulinecz play the first guitar lick of "Slot Machine" over and over and over. By the time remixing is complete, the song will have been played more than 90 times. Raskulinecz, also known around town as the bassist for HyperTribe, recorded the band's first DIY release, Stereo 360 Sound, and has sat by O'Heir at the board
throughout the recording and mixing of the new record. (The band calls the
creative team "the Tick.")
<P>Someone has brought in a copy of the fresh-off-the-presses Entertainment
Weekly, which is making its way around the room. Right there, on page 58, is a photo of Superdrag's single "HHT" (Darla), accompanying an article on the resurgence of independent 45s. Everyone is psyched, but they have no idea how EW got a hold of the record.
<P>Although most all of the musicians pictured on the page are major-label
players--Courtney Love, Eddie Vedder, Michael Stipe and even Mariah Carey--every
single one of the record sleeves shown was released on an indie. Josh Deutsch,
the band's A&amp;R rep, breaks into a sly grin and a knowing chuckle. "They think you're an indie band."
<P>Indie credibility is a hot commodity within the music world, with small labels admired for their do-it-yourself ambition and unflinching ethic of
supporting artists they believe in, rather than who they think will sell the most records. (The truth is, bona fide independent labels are an endangered
species, especially since Warner Brothers purchased 49 percent of the venerable
independent Sub-Pop Records earlier this year.) Indie rock purists frown upon corporate rock and all its trappings, and turn their pierced noses up in a second when bands they once worshipped go for the forbidden fruit. 
<P>However, for a band that craves excellent tour support, studio budgets,
promotion and distribution, and, yes, money, major labels are the irresistible
temptation. Superdrag sold out and they're proud of it.
<P>"For anyone who would slag us about signing to a major--talk shit until you're blue in the face, have a party," Davis implores. "We don't care. We're
totally unapologetic for breaking the ten commandments of indie rock."
<P>"None of us ever had any delusions of being a cooler-than-thou indie band,"
Fisher adds. "We're not. We play what we like and, fortunately for us, it's
pretty accessible." <HR> <EM>The night is finally winding down outside the New York City lounge Brownie's, where Superdrag has wowed the mostly industry crowd during the last evening of the Macintosh New York Music Festival. Four sweaty, exhausted
band members sprawl on the sidewalk outside as tonight's headliner gnashes
through her radio hit. </EM>
<P><EM>Yellow cabs create a constant blur on the corner, a revolving door of short skirts, go-go boots, eyebrow rings and the festival's laminated passes. No one in the band is really sure where they're spending the night or how they'll get there, and it's at least another hour before they can pack up their equipment. The bouncer is hassling them about having open beverage
containers outside the club, the trendy bar next door is too packed to bother
with, and an eager young woman is pressing her card into Davis's hand, telling
him "You guys are really good, you should give me a call when you think about
getting a manager." </EM>
<P><EM>As the band's manager quietly pockets the card, Coffee wipes his brow with his shirt sleeve and grins. "We drive all day, wait around three hours
before we play, three hours after we play ... just for this." Looking up the cigarette butt-littered sidewalk, where the woman is desperately trying to make eye contact with another Next Big Thing, his pause lasts only a second.
"I love it."</EM>

</H1><P><STRONG>Local scene veteran Mike Smithers finally finds the right lineup with the latest incarnation of 30 Amp Fuse</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>Mike Smithers, veteran singer and stringer for 30 Amp Fuse, is in a quandary, unsure whether to play punk-pop naif or wizened rock sage. He can sound as wide-eyed and guileless as any labret-lipped club urchin ten years his junior--witness the smitten reverie of "All Day Afternoon" off 30AF's Wind Up CD on Darla Records.
<P>But just when you think his fragile inner child has taken over, the Grumpy Old Rocker emerges, skewering the excesses of young punkhood on the She Records single "Punk Rock Virtuoso," or waxing moribund on the skull-beneath-the-skin rumination "Over the Hill."
<P>"I don't feel like an old punk," says Smithers, languishing over a mug of beer on the patio of the Longbranch Saloon. "I still feel like I have that restless edge because I never settled down and acted like other people my age. You can't be too settled and do what we do--play in a touring band."
<P>Song titles aside, Smithers seems anything but over the hill. His cherub cheeks may look a little weathered now, and there are a few more of those hard-set lines mapping out the territory beneath his impish green eyes. But between his foppishly tousled blonde mop-top and earnest buck-toothed grin, he looks pretty spry for a rocker pushing 30 (or maybe pulling it--he won't say).
<P>And after more than a decade spent peeling the paint off shabby beer-hovel walls, his career is finally going somewhere other than in circles. In mid-June, 30AF signed a two-album deal with Dedicated Records, a major European independent label that's just beginning to make inroads in the U.S. The contract will afford the band international distribution and touring funds as well as the option to record a third opus should the first two releases meet label expectations.
<P>It's probably more than just a coincidence that the signing took place shortly after Smithers moved back to Knoxville from Boston, Mass. and found a steady lineup in bassist Mike Knott and drummer Rodney Cash. In two years as 30AF's only "permanent" member, Smithers recorded, gigged and even toured with more than a dozen musicians in a revolving door of volatile egos, conflicting lifestyles and creative differences.
<P>It's also no mere coincidence that his chosen mates are old friends and fellow veterans of the hardcore front lines. In rock 'n' roll terms, all three of these guys have earned Purple Hearts, and have even shared the trenches in a host of local outfits (Cash and Knott in the Clintons and Whitey, Cash and Smithers in Screaming Boy Blue.)
<P>"The timing was never quite right for all three of us to play together," says the slender, baby-faced Knott. "But the chemistry has always been there."
<P>Smithers agrees. "I played with two guys in Boston and we didn't like hanging out together when we weren't working on the band. I found out that doesn't work, especially if you're planning to go on the road. These guys play better and they also happen to be my friends."
<P>It's a testament to Smithers's peerless pop smarts and sheer force of will that 30AF floated around the small-indie scene long enough to anchor itself to such a sturdy rhythmic foundation. A master of the three-by-three (three chords, three minutes), Smithers tosses off sparkling little pop gems like Daddy Warbucks pitching pennies to the orphans. 
<P>His music sounds a little bit like mid-period Hsker D, a little bit like the Buzzcocks, a little bit like Green Day and Jawbreaker and a dozen other three-chord pogo bands you've heard a dozen-dozen times before. The trick to this particular shell game--and Smithers can pull it off with his sleeves rolled up and both hands in plain view--is that if you shuffle those three chords just right, people don't seem to mind paying and playing time and time again.
<P>On the strength of sterling songcraft, 30AF has recorded two widely distributed singles on tiny but hip indies, as well as the full-length Wind Up  disc, which drew gushing reviews from several prominent alterna-journals last summer. All of this came despite the seemingly endless game of bass-and-drums musical chairs, and despite a near-terminal bout of wanderlust that saw Smithers test the frigid waters in San Francisco and Seattle before docking in Boston for the latter half of 1996.
<P>Now he looks forward to recording his first "big-budget" album (to be released in late '96) with what might be Knoxville's most dangerous rhythm section. Knott is a deft, kinetic bassist and suave back-up singer, and Cash, despite his rumpled slouch and little-boy-lost demeanor, brings unparalleled charisma and energy to the skins.
<P>The trio also looks forward to logging some serious road time this fall. They already sport fresh scars from a late-spring tour of the east coast in Smithers's airless jalopy van, new war stories of riding out downpours with duct-taped windshield wipers and digging under torn seats for toll booth change and Dairy Queen funds.
<P>"You've got to go through that stage where you sleep on floors and get paid in beer," Knott says. "We've all been doing it for 10 years. That's how you pay your dues."
<P>"Yeah, you play for beer and you pay your dues," Smithers deadpans with a sardonic grin. The Grumpy Old Rocker, you can tell, has escaped once again. "And when you've done it long enough, you die of cirrhosis."

<P><STRONG>Thumbnail sticks to its own code of punk rock ethics</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Mike Gibson</EM>
<P>Punk rockers have always been roguish blokes, given to mannerless antics and outrageous modes of speech and dress. From nattering churls like Johnny Rotten to Lee Ving, Rollins and other thuggish hardcore he-men, the progenitors and standard-bearers planted punk's tattered banner firmly in jack-booted nihilism and safety-pinned ill will.
<P>Nowadays, you've got raucous revivalists Rancid, all strident purple mohawks and oppressive costume jewelry, setting the truculent tone for pugnacious puritans and nouveau traditionalists alike. And even for the mall set, those puckish punkoids Green Day sport obligatory schnoz rings and rubber-lipped, faux-Brit sneers.
<P>So what are we to make of Thumbnail, the polite, well-shaven Knoxville foursome that just inked a deal with Cargo-Headhunter Records, a Triple-Crown stable for indie punk thoroughbreds? From co-guitarist and singer Justin Sinkovich's brown corduroy coordinates to the gently arching part of drummer David Burns's foppish blond coif, there's nothing about these genteel young men to suggest that they purvey some of the gnarliest post-hardcore white noise this side of Greg Ginn.
<P>"Punk isn't just about three chords and cut yourself with a broken beer bottle anymore," says Sinkovich.
<P>"The dumb scene is definitely still around--'Let's shave our heads and go beat someone up,'" adds Burns. "But in the true D.I.Y. scene, people like us aren't all that uncommon."
<P>By Burns's reckoning, Thumbnail is simultaneously part of, and not a part of, the roiling, chameleonic hodgepodge that is punk rock circa 1995. It's a lumpy, fractal milieu, he says, defined by its diversity and its free-thinkers, but more commonly associated with its trendy primitives, those pierced and painted preservationists who grace magazine covers and rant on MTV.
<P>"Right now, the corporations have decided this is cool to be into, and they've picked up on the obvious things," says new bass player Steve Schmidt. "They're exploiting it to the hilt, and presenting it in a way it really isn't. There are really a million different styles and ideas that fit under the heading 'punk.'"
<P>Thumbnail coalesced when Sinkovich, Burns and singer-guitarist Jason Morris met in a UT astronomy lab in 1992. But while the band began as an outlet, an opportunity for three back-slidden punks to shed bar-band shackles, it soon evolved a life of its own.
<P>Over the next three and a half years, Thumbnail toured sporadically, cutting clangorous swaths across both coasts and portions of the midwest, and released two seven-inches and a long player on File 13 Records, the small but thriving indie label Burns founded as a Little Rock, Ark., high school student.
<P>Offstage, the band's efforts have always been marked by planning, perseverance, and entrepreneurial endeavor. Burns still keeps a watchful eye on File 13, and he and Morris will finish architectural degrees in 1996. Sinkovich is co-owner of Landspeed Records on Gay Street, and will start work on an MBA this spring.
<P>"Punk really starts with kids in high school," Burns explains. "It's easy to be D.I.Y. when you have an allowance, and that's why part of the scene is always changing so much--kids go for four years, then quit. But most of the bands on labels are like us. They hung around a while, got an education and started businesses that support their music."
<P>But even if these guys are plunging headlong into adulthood, they still play with all the delicious abandon and unbridled anomie of 15-year-old malcontents cranking second-hand Marshalls in some dank suburban garage. Just check out their self-titled File 13 vinyl opus; it's brutal, heady stuff, full of steel-toed riffs, fitful changes and lots of venomous vocal yowl.
<P>It's also complex, occasionally pensive, and often eloquent--in its own squawking, abrasive way. It's a sound that scribbles outside the lines that delineate punk rock proper, even in an era when those lines are sometimes hard to see.
<P>"The sound we have doesn't really fit in with lots of the punk and indie rock scene," says Schmidt. "The values are very punk rock, but we're a lot heavier than most of the bands we play with. We're sort of stuck in limbo between scenes."
<P>So what will it mean for Thumbnail to work with Headhunter, one of the hottest labels in indie-dom? An awful lot, says Sinkovich, an awful lot, and not very much. On one hand, the band will tour more extensively than ever before, and release their Headhunter debut in September with Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino sitting in the producer's chair. Trombino will also remix the File 13 record for re-release in the spring.
<P>But Sinkovich says the band's lifestyle and M.O. will remain more or less unchanged.
<P>"Things will pretty much stay the same for us, except that now we'll have money and support for tours," Sinkovich says. "We're in a good situation right now, but there isn't any six-figure deal. You don't quit your day job."

</H1><P><STRONG>Torture Kitty scratches up some punk-pop</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Laura Atkinson</EM>
<P>
If you haven't heard of Knoxville's young urban punksters Torture Kitty,
you will. These guys are gonna be bigger than the Beatles. You think the
British Invasion turned America's youth into a frenzied mob of sexually
charged pop 'n' roll renegades? Well, the Kitty Invasion will have the kids
running wild in the streets, smashing their R.E.M. collections against VW
bus bumpers and screaming "Torture me!" It'll be phenomenal, it'll
be colossal, it'll well, OK, it'll probably never happen. It's punk rock,
and those Torture Kitty boys don't want to be that serious about it.
<P>
Not that they don't give a damn. "If we didn't practice, we'd suck,"
vocalist John Sewell says half-jokingly at the end of a recent session,
cajoling the other guys to agree on the next time they'll jam. Although
Sewell and guitarist Greg Swift have been playing together for two years
as Torture Kitty, it wasn't until they pulled together the current line-up,
with Randall Brown on bass and most-recent addition Robert Noe smashing
the skins, that folks starting coming to their shows in any crowd-size numbers.
<P>
"Since Robert started playing with the band (about three months ago)
people come see us  Robert's the popular guy," says Sewell, alluding
especially to Noe's friendly connections with another local band, Superdrag
(you may have heard of them?), who have helped spread the word to budding
adults that Torture Kitty has evolved into a mighty fine heavy pop-punk
ensemble.
<P>
"This new punk thing, like 15- to 18-year-old kids, they're the ones
that primarily like us and we like them too," Sewell says. "They're
not so cool that they can't jump around and stuff yet." Yeah, Torture
Kitty honestly wants you to have a good time. "I wanna see them flip
out, do somersaults," Swift says wryly.
<P>
Besides Noe, who'd played drums only with his father in a country band called
Southern Mixture before Torture Kitty, the guys had all been in other bands
in town--most of which didn't have a lot of staying power. Sewell, "The
Artist Formerly Known as Swifty," will tell you he was in a lot of
bands "that did anything to be popular," and that there was a
time in his young life when he was pretty messed up. He got it together,
though, and when Torture Kitty started he had a new attitude, which included
showing up for practice remembering what he'd done the night before.
<P>
"When we (John and Greg) first started out we didn't know what we wanted
to do," says Sewell. "We tried to be, quote, kind of alternative,
end of quote, but it didn't work"
<P>
"Alternative to a sharp stick in your eye," Swift interjects.
<P>
"Yeah, we started off being a hardcore band, and then we decided to
make it more pop," Sewell says, "and the poppier it gets the more
we like it, but we don't want it to end up being like Weezer or something.
And it wouldn't anyway, because we don't have we couldn't pull it off if
we tried."
<P>
They do pull off some cool entertainment without posturing, foregoing combat
boots for Converse high tops and writing music that, although by all means
full of punk rock attitude, is much more catchy than confrontational. "I
try to make well-crafted songs these days," says Sewell, and Swift's
and Brown's guitar and bass licks venture much farther up and down the scales
than most of the three-chord punk wunderkinds on the charts these days.
Noe's emphatic drumming style rounds out their sound with an enthusiastic
oomph.
<P>
"This should bring a tear to every eye," declared Sewell during
a recent show, before launching into "Every Day Is Another Soap Opera,"
a lyrically despairing song he penned while thinking of an old friend, though
it hints at Sewell's former lifestyle. "There came a time in my life
when I had to stop destroying myself so I can be an asshole for you guys
today."
<P>
"My motivations are different. Now I play because I like music, instead
of to get laid or to get drugs or to get drunk," says Sewell. "I
was talking with Johnny Puke (of Cletus) about that, and he was going, 'Well
I'm in it for the beer and girls,' and I said, 'The beer and girls are over
and I still like the music.'
<P>
"The difference for me is sobriety, I suppose."
<P>
Perhaps sobriety has made the difference in Sewell's current lyrical bent,
which, with downright dance-around numbers like "Brand New Temptation"
("She's gone and pulled another stunt/my button's pushed") is
relatively light on angst.
<P>
"Punk rock is like '50s music to me now, it's like happy music. I don't
think of it as anger now, it's like, fun. I mean, it should be mildly perturbed
," he says, laughing. "A lot of the songs are self-mockery, really.
I act so stupid when we play 'cause I feel silly. I mean I feel silly, but
then a second later I feel cool too."
<P>
"This whole thing is like regaining my innocence for me," says
Sewell, "'cause the crowd is kids and I like kids, 'cause they're not
so jaded and it's fun instead of like I have to be some supercool guy."
<P>
The name Torture Kitty has on occasion belied the band's good time garage
punk sound. "I've heard people say they thought it was a girl heavy
metal band, I've heard people say it's sexist," says Sewell, who explains
it as originating from an odd little game he played with Swift's girlfriend's
cat involving an X-acto knife. "We don't really like the name that
much, but we've had it for so long that we're gonna keep it."
<P>
To hear them tell it, the Torture Kitty guys' lifestyles tend to belie a
stereotypical punk rock modus operandi. Sewell, an artist who won the local
Golden Staple Gun award for his fliers, is in the journalism program at
UT, puts together a fanzine called, appropriately, Kids Love It! and delivers
pizzas. Swift, the "Fabio" of the foursome (Sewell's teasing),
works construction. Noe is a graphic artist and screen printer, which means
the ink on Torture Kitty tees will be dry by the time you read this. And
Brown, a UT student, newspaper editor and 'Net-head, wants to get Kitty
info on the World Wide Web.
<P>
"Comparatively, (Randall's) the cerebral presence. He's much more mature
than this," Sewell jokes. "He goes home and listens to Nick Cave
and the Palace Brothers and tries to get it out of his system."
<P>
Now that "Teen Idol" is in regular rotation on New Rock 90 and
they've got a five-song demo Sewell's sending to just about anyone who might
listen, the next thing the band would like to get out of their collective
systems is a seven-inch. "Not like anyone'd buy it," quips Sewell,
and adds that Superdragger John Davis has offered to help record something.
They'd like more gigs out of town and have scheduled a "mini-tour"
in Nashville in May, when they'll hit at least a couple clubs with Fun Girls
from Mt. Pilot.
<P>
"Right now is the best part of a local band's career," says Sewell.
"After you play a little while and people start coming that's the very
best time, 'cause after that they get sick of whatever you've done or they
expect you to do more and you don't. This is the peak, probably. I mean
I hope for further peaks, but really this is the best time to be in a band,
when we're not a new band but people think we are."

Tuff Enough
</H1><P><STRONG>The Tuffskins set out to prove they really are your everyday,
average garage band ... and proud of it</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>by Randall Brown</EM>
<P>
No matter what you may overhear, stage-whispered with drunken conviction
in a sticky Naugahyde booth at Gryphon's on a sweaty Saturday night, the
Tuffskins are not a Weezer side project. Sure, there are a few common links
(more about that later) ... but the Tuffskins have a history that pre-dates
the Buzz Bin wunderkinds.
<P>
The Tuffskins are only about two years old as a band, but their roots run
back to the late '80s, probably the local scene's most secret history. Even
Jack Neely's exhaustively chronicled series on the local punk legacy tapered
off around 1987. It's easy to understand why--to all appearances, so did
the scene. But while this was a low-key period, a smattering of bands from
West Knoxville, of all places, was laying down the foundation of the '90s
boon. Enter the Bloo Shrooms.
<P>
They came burning like a bat outta Karns around 1986 and quickly took point
position on the scene. Loud and raw at first--all the best things--they
evolved into a trip-jam monster, Butthole Surfers-cum-Hawkwind. But the
core of the Bloo Shroom sound was always Tim and Glen Maloof, now known
as the designers of the Tuffskins.
<P>
The Brothers Maloof, Tim on bass and Glenn on guitar, rescued drummer and
fellow Karns High alumnus Brad Alison from a local R&amp;B group. Armed
with some tunes Glenn created while teaching himself guitar and Tim's
Sears-blue-jean-inspired
name, the Tuffskins were born. When Tim left town for the charms of Los
Angeles, Joel Thomas (yet another Karns grad) bought a bass and joined up
in the spirit of on-the-job training.
<P>
The end result hearkens back to the loud and raw period of the Bloo Shrooms.
The band's live energy is infectious. They don't stand still for a second,
especially not Maloof. He invokes both Pete Townshend and Paul Simon, all
but wrestling his Harmony Barcley guitar, layering deceptively simple and
catchy riffs with electric vibrato and distortion.
<P>
Stylistically, the Tuffskins are one of the freshest bunch of guitar-rockers
on the pike. Their sound is surf twang with a contemporary hard edge. Maloof's
voice packs an angry wallop into a suede-smooth package. Alison's drumming
shoots the dynamic curls, keeping massive texture shifts seamless.
<P>
To keep it from getting lost in the "Heavy-Rock-meets-Lounge-Lizard"
jungle, though, the band's sound exhibits that rare jewel called Pop
Sensibility--as
if the Jesus and Mary Chain had a better drummer and a bigger record collection.
Or imagine Superdrag obsessed with the Ventures instead of the Beatles,
and you'll be on your way to the Tuffskins.
<P>
Maloof sums it up best: "Just say we're a garage band."
<P>
Lyrically, the Tuffskins' keyword is "straightforward." Maloof
often hits a John Prine-ish note, turning out wry cleverness amidst the
favored rock themes of love and breakup. He's also modest on the matter.
<P>
"It's simple, easy. I don't know if I'm actually trying to keep it
that way, but it's about the extent of my lyrical talents."
<P>
Songs like "Superman," though, show a humble maturity much deeper
than bubblegum. "I ain't nobody/ I ain't no Superman/ I'm mild mannered,
I am what I am/ Ain't got no Superfriends/ Watching over me/ 'Bout as normal
as anybody could be." It's not your normal rock-god grandiosity.
<P>
"I think it fits the music," says Alison. "You couldn't have
the straightforward rock and roll music we play with words about demons
and dungeons and dragons."
<P>
"I guess you could," counters Maloof. "If you're stupid enough.
If there was a band around town like that, I'd probably go see them, though."
<P>
Hanging out recently at their South Knoxville practice pad, the Tuffskins
were eager to dispel certain rumors inspired by their long-time friendship
with Weezer's Brian Bell (also a West Knoxville native), who served back-up
guitar duty during the Tuffskins recent studio sessions at Ripchord Records.
Number one, they aren't Bell's "side project."
<P>
"We had our own songs written long before he ever recorded second guitar
parts with us," explains Alison. Another, more extreme, rumor is just
as false. "We're not really Weezer using a different name so we can
play Knoxville clubs."
<P>
The Tuffskins recently opened for Weezer in Atlanta, and say performing
in front of some 2,000 teenage fans had them spooked.
<P>
"We were expecting a worst-case scenario," admits Maloof.
<P>
"Like a TV show," says Alison. "You play a song and when
it's over all you hear is the crickets chirping."
<P>
"But it went good," says Maloof, still taken aback. "They
liked us."
<P>
Some of the crowd liked them a lot, much to their embarrassment. "We
signed autographs," admits Thomas.
<P>
"It was humbling," says Alison. "We were just hanging out
and all of a sudden about 25 kids came up to us. Why, you know? We're just
a band from Knoxville."
<P>
Maybe so, but the Tuffskins are one of the bands that will help make that
statement mean a whole lot more.

<P><STRONG>With an album in the can and an international tour ahead of them, the Viceroys face unexpected success (and pesky name problems).</STRONG>
<P><EM>by Jack Neely</EM>
<P>It's a Viceroys show at the Mercury Theater on Market Square. As four grown men wearing ties weave plaintive country ballads, you lean forward to hear the words. Then there's a pop song you didn't expect, a melody with enough hooks to catch a bluegill. You don't notice your leg moving. Then the band launches hard into some loud, fast, rock 'n' roll you've never heard. When the rhythm section opens up, you're riding a flatcar on a freight doing 80 mph over an iron trestle, buzzing on seven cups of hobo joe.
<P>People who didn't come to dance start fidgeting, jumping, doing things they didn't expect to do, maybe things they'll regret tomorrow. But it's the Viceroys, after all, and it's not like they play in their hometown every month. On rare evenings in the music business, quality still draws a crowd. The Viceroys aren't copying anybody, aren't making fun of anybody, aren't following any latest trend. This is a local band making music that's original, well-rooted, native, honest, good. And people go nuts about it. 
<P>The Viceroys already seem a bit like a legend. From the first days, there was always a mystique about them, unlikely rumors of outrageous fortune and ill fate that hounded them across state lines. Their complicated reputation was something like that of a successful and maybe benevolent bootlegging syndicate.
<P>They already have a history that approaches mythology. You might easily forget that the first time a local band practiced together as "Viceroys" was only two years ago. Or that one year ago, they barely survived the unexpected departure of their frontman. It's been a rocky road that, to be fair, has been more than two years long.
<H2> </H2>
<P>Smoking cigarettes around a kitchen table in Fort Sanders, the Viceroys don't look like members of a signed rock band. They're short-haired, mature-looking guys in conservative clothes. They're polite, humble, almost courtly in a Southern manner you keep thinking you've seen the last of. Laughing with each other, they're quick to deny that they're even musicians. 
<P>"To call us musicians would be an insult to real musicians," Scott Miller says.
<P>"I'm just a country boy," confesses newest member Mike Harrison.
<P>That's too much for Jeff Bills: "And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny, riddle, is that right, Mike?" 
<P>They're evasive, hard to pin down. They deny they're anything special. To hear words like "charisma" or "magic" or "genius," you'll have to talk to those people out there sweating in a manic Viceroys audience.
<P>Some people call Bills the best drummer in local memory, a distinction he'd never claim for himself. Despite his wisecracks and his wildman reputation, he's humble about the Viceroys, especially humble about his part in the band. He's fascinated by everything from astronomy to Flannery O'Connor, and asks questions. You could meet him and talk to him for a couple of hours and never hear him mention that he's ever touched a drum set, or that he's in a band about to release an international CD, about to launch an overseas tour. 
<P>But he's no side man. If he doesn't lead the Viceroys from the back seat, he drives them like Roy Rogers in some old cowboy movie. 
<P>Having come to UT from West Tennessee, the tall guy with the Buddy Holly specs showed up almost a decade ago playing in "alternative" bands like the Taoist Cowboys and the Swamis. (He earned a degree of some sort in '89, but doesn't care to talk about it.) Working at Raven Records on the Strip, he encountered an unlikely preoccupation: Roger Miller. The same Roger Miller we used to see on TV all the time, singing "King of the Road." 
<P>"It was serious country," Bills says, with no trace of irony. "It blew me away."
<P>He came to share the Roger Miller fetish with Scott Miller (no relation, except spiritually), a singer/songwriter then doing acoustic shows up the hill at Hawkeye's. More than one observer has noted Miller's physical resemblance to Hank Williams. Picture Hank with an education. Raised in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, Miller studied at William and Mary. Arriving in Knoxville in 1990, he quickly became known by word of mouth for his clever, biting lyrics.
<P>Miller has an almost childlike openness about him that's charming, disarming, and misleading. There's steel in his talent and his temperament. 
<P>Bills and Miller hooked up with local legend Todd Steed to form a loony, politically incorrect trio they called "Run, Jump, and Throw Like a Girl." It didn't last. Steed went to Lithuania. Miller and Bills, both past 25, showed symptoms of settling down in ways that most of us do sooner or later. Miller took a clerical job with a downtown law firm, cheerfully pushing a handcart along downtown sidewalks. Bills got work as a research assistant at the Knox County Archives, looking up records for folks doing genealogical research.
<P>For months, Bills and Miller passed each other on Market Street sidewalks, had lunch together on the Square, a couple of nice-looking, short-haired college guys in ties. They had girlfriends and a pretty good living--but they still wanted to cause some trouble. 
<P>"We both like to sing music," says Bills. "And we've had the same kind of influences and things." Unsatisfied with his Hawkeye's career, Miller was open to suggestion.
<P>They met a skinny teen genius from Blaine, one of the finest guitarists to emerge in Knoxville in a long while. John Paul Keith couldn't legally drink in the bars he played in (and wouldn't be able to anytime soon). He got a job in the downtown library, around the corner from Bills and Miller, pushing carts of returned books.
<P>Keith had been playing with a chum from Carter High. Kodak-raised Paxton Sellers was only 20, but had paid some dues, playing bass with a low-rent cover outfit that did Motown and modern country hits for corporate Christmas parties, motel lounges, and seedy dives beyond the city lights. 
<P>Just for fun, Miller and Bills sat in with Keith and Sellers for a four-track session, liked what they heard, and took it to the stage at the Mercury. Faithful smokers, they soon called themselves the Viceroys, a name that's now causing them trouble, as almost everything does. 
<P>Never a big fan of roots country like Miller and Bills, Sellers says the main thing that appealed to him about the Viceroys was the opportunity to play in clubs he liked, for people he liked rather than corporate executives and rural roughnecks (who for some reason share a taste for pop cover bands). Raised on punk and lately immersed in jazz, Sellers's current appreciation for what the Viceroys do was an acquired taste.
<H2> </H2>
<P>They wear ties. Not smartass punk ties. The Viceroys (with the possible exception of Keith) seem so comfortable in ties that they make not wearing ties seem affected. Asked about their dress code, Miller says, "I like it." Bills says, "I like it." They don't agree on a whole lot. When they do, don't mess with it. 
<P>It's the look of what they do. Miller and Bills speak reverently of the raw, honest, pre-1960s country music which much of the Viceroys' best work evokes. Roy Acuff, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams--those guys always wore ties on stage. Come to think of it, it was when Porter Waggoner and them took off their ties that country music seemed to take a dive.
<P>The Viceroys' individual reputations were such that even their first shows were crowded. "Right off the bat there was a great buzz about the Viceroys," says music promoter Benny Smith, who says Viceroys shows have been a phenomenon comparable only to Superdrag. Guitar teacher, performer, and godfather Terry Hill, who's been on top of local music for more than 20 years, was awed by them. "They had a big dose of that thing that's so contagious, that makes a band so much more interesting to hear," he says
<P>Playing rootsy country rock turbocharged with pop/alternative takes on rockabilly, the Viceroys stood way out. Lurching through a spectrum of musical styles from blues to surf, they were, above all, a solid, enthusiastic rock 'n' roll band with a very tight rhythm section. The guitar work bounced off the melody only, the vocals were smart and right in your face, the songs unheard before, anywhere. 
<P>But unlike nearly all other bands of college boys that play music with country licks, the Viceroys were no campy parody. Miller's famous wit took a back seat in the Viceroys' coupe.
<P>Their distinctive look and sound even fired believable rumors that, scarcely a year after they began to practice, they were on the brink of a big-time record deal. 
<P>A reputation for barely suppressed wildness didn't hurt their rock 'n' roll image any. When they returned from a Nashville show a little over a year ago, Miller wore a sling due to a broken collarbone. Those who had to ask heard that Bills had something to do with it. Miller shrugs it off. "We were just wrestling in the yard," he says. "Jeff got the jump on me."
<P>Miller and Bills have battled for years. "Things flare up," says Bills. "The test is how you handle the situation. Scott and I went through a time--but we've gotten along well for five or six years."
<P>"I love him like a brother," Miller says. "There are times we want to kill each other, times we hug each other. There's friction there, and sometimes friction's good. Conflict's good, if it's handled right."
<P>It hasn't always been, and one contest left a wound that didn't heal as easily as a collarbone. "John Paul and I had a good little system going," Miller recalls. "I guess it wasn't as well-oiled as I thought." 
<P>A year ago, as word was getting out that Steve Earle was working with the Viceroys toward a likely album project, the youngest Viceroy quit. 
<P>"We tried to work it out," Miller says. "I guess it's to his credit that he didn't keep doing it when he wasn't happy." 
<P>Few expected the Viceroys to prevail. Keith had been lead guitarist and singer for the band, had written several of their songs, and he was the one the girls yelled at. Moving quickly before they lost momentum, Bills talked an old pal from home into coming to town. 
<P>Mike Harrison isn't a die-cut, razor-thin, wild-timing Viceroy. The 30-year-old Harrison is a married man, a lumber inspector by trade who has run a sawmill back home for years. When he joined the band last May, he and Bills had to go shopping to get him a tie.
<P>But he's no stranger. He remembers when he and Bills played a couple of "hijeous" shows back at Bradford High over a decade ago. All along, Harrison had been messing around with his own songs. He played a few writers' nights at the Bluebird in Nashville. "It wasn't overwhelming or nothing. At least they didn't boo me."
<P>Almost three years ago, Harrison worked with Bills, Miller, and others on his 1993 tape "Don't Bail." One Harrison song, "Sooner or Later (I'll get offa my knees)," was a Viceroys standard even in John Paul Keith days.
<P>After a few months of practicing with Harrison in the fold, the new Viceroys premiered last August--away from Knoxville scrutiny, at a Greeneville music festival. Encouraged by the crowd response--some swore they were better than before--they picked up where they'd left off.
<H2> </H2>
<P>Though all Viceroys songs are collaborative efforts, with everybody adding something of his own, Miller's chiefly to blame for most of them. Harrison's impressed with his pace. "I'll write one," Harrison says, "he'll say, 'I'm not gonna let this happen,' and he'll write three."
<P>He's as loath to call himself a "writer" as he is to call himself a "musician," but Miller confesses he's written well over 100 songs in earnest, but only ten or so that he considers Viceroy songs. He's not especially proud of the early Hawkeye's era work that spawned his local reputation. He now calls it "smartass stuff."
<P>"It did me well, helped me learn to rhyme," he admits. "I could crank out the wit, that wasn't a problem. But it's easy to be a smartass, to tear something down. It's much harder to take something ugly and make it beautiful." That's the Viceroys' job. 
<P>"I still have songs that I write that aren't band songs," he says. He frequently plays with a quieter trio which generally includes Sellers and either Harrison or banjoist John Taylor. "Two kinds of music stuck with me through all my weird phases," Miller says. "Bluegrass and Creedence." He and Bills both talk about Creedence Clearwater Revival with the same respectful hush they otherwise reserve for Roger Miller.
<P>Introduced to the Viceroys by former Knoxvillian and sometime Earle sideman Dub Cornett, Earle bestowed his blessing upon the re-formed 'Roys. He invited them to open for him and tour with him, and offered to produce their album. Weeks after their first public performance last year, the new Viceroys began recording the album they finished this February after several sessions in Nashville.
<P>Most of the guys have been around too long to get big-headed notions. All four still live in old places within an easy walk of each other in Fort Sanders, pop in at the local groceries for cheap beer and cigarettes ("supplies," Bills says, keeping the receipt), and practice three nights a week in a basement cluttered with old furniture.
<P>Tonight they've each had several beers, but direct their attentions toward an earnest, disciplined, practice session of about three hours. They spend a full hour on a song Miller wrote a few days ago. After an hour of replaying the song, and parts of it, Miller's still not convinced they're on the right track. He's clever on stage, friendly in person, but in this basement he's an uncompromising perfectionist, patient only up to a point. "Scott's very into what he does," says Sellers, allegedly the only "musician" in the band, who nonetheless seems a little awed by the intensity that develops between Miller and Bills. "I just do what I need to do."
<P>Harrison's impressed with the band's alchemy, too. If a song needs something to push it over the top, he trusts the Viceroys' rhythm section to find it. "When it needs the cajones there, they put 'em in," he says.
<P>Bills is characteristically modest. "We all have input, but it's basically Scott and Mike. They write it at home--and we kind of tweak it in practice."
<P>You can hear country (not to mention cajones) in almost all their work, especially Miller's guitar playing as it loops around the melody in a bluegrass style borrowed by the Byrds and, later, R.E.M., in a beautiful piece like "No Regrets." Some songs, like "Long Time Leavin,'" are electric hoedowns. A fine song like "Lie I Believe" could stand with the best of country writing.
<P>What was once witty ridicule in Miller's lyrics sometimes survives in the Viceroys, matured into a weird irony. "Goodnight Loser" is a slow song that starts out with an R&amp;B take on Pachelbel's 18th-century Canon. The soft lullaby of the melody belies the bitterness of the lyric: "When you dance with him / You look so thin / I can almost look through you..." 
<P>The Viceroys do throw in the odd whimsical piece like "Cold Beer Hello" (featuring drummer Bills on guitar, easily the funniest solo of the year) just to prove they're not above dopey humor. His guitar playing's fine, it's just that the rest of the band's not changing key fast enough to suit it. 
<P>All three of those songs are on the CD, due for a late-summer release here but out in England by July. The Viceroys will back Earle on a Jimmie Rodgers tribute CD in a song called "In the Jailhouse Now," also due out this summer.
<P>Between practice songs in the basement, Sellers takes off on a Charlie Parker bebop riff, "Scrapple from the Apple." It's unexpected, but then so is a good deal of the regular work. "I'm Gonna Be All Right" is a poppy Beatles-ish song that veers suddenly into something like heavy metal for a few bars. "She's Strange" is of the Secret Agent school, with echo licks. A new song they're working up samples part of the old surf instrumental "Pipeline." 
<P>Miller says Sellers brings musicianship to the band. Harrison offers more of a "pop feel." Bills's grounding is in alternative rock. Miller's own contribution to the band's personality, he says, is the bluegrass he was raised on. That may be a bit of oversimplification, but it's clear that the band members' diverse backgrounds open the Viceroys to an array of influences. 
<P>All four deny any special gift, talent, skill, insight. This frustrated reporter is insistent. People do expect to get something from a Viceroys show, don't they?
<P>"They expect to get drunk," Bills explains.
<P>"They're all girls. They come out for Scott's good looks," Harrison says.
<P>"Paxton's the pretty boy," Miller protests.
<P>Talent, looks, musicianship, or any kind of appeal is a hot potato the Viceroys want to toss into the next guy's lap. Sellers, being the youngest and quietest, ends up with everything.
<P>Unfortunately, there's a problem with that great name. Another group, a Jamaican reggae band, goes by the name of the Viceroys, and allegedly has the copyright. Hearing of these here Viceroys, their counsel apparently implied some challenge. To avoid confusion, our own 'Roys sometimes go by the name "the Knoxville Viceroys" in other cities (an Atlanta club last year billed them as "the Knoxville Viceroys w/ Scott Miller"). They're presently considering permanent solutions. V-Roys is a working title.
<P>No one can guess where the Viceroys, by any other name, will go from here. We can only be confident that whatever they achieve, it'll be their own damn fault.
<H3>The V-Roys have their own <A HREF="http://www.vroys.com/">web site</A> - take a look!</H3>

<H2>Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h2>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/index.shtml">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

Just who the hell does this old joker think he is?  Slyman indeed!  He's still got a chip on his shoulder because of the practice spaces he used to rent to bands that got trashed.  It seems like there's always gonna be somebody trying to squash whatever puny little music scene we manage to get going here.  This is bullshit, and it's pretty damn depressing!

<p>        Once again Mary Lou Horner and other local bigwigs are perpetrating a politically motivated sham upon the taxpayers of this city.  They have disguised this outrage as a public service when it is nothing but political grandstanding. I am referring to the self-declared war upon those of us in the artistic community who cannot afford to advertise shows and events in the mainstream media and must therefore use the public forum of utility poles in a few small areas of the city.  These well padded officials have picked upon this so-called problem not to protect the public but to have one more thing to crow about and to get their faces on television.  I watched the ever present Mrs. Horner, wig and all, as her face filled my TV screen and she declared war on people like myself who have put up flyers on utility poles in specifically the Cumberland Avenue area.  Just who do these people think they are?  They were elected by some of the people whom they have just declared war upon.  Well Mrs. Horner, if you want a war, you just got one!  This opportunistic political ploy will most surely backfire as the populace grows weary of being bullied by a few elitist politicians looking to pad their resumes by taking potshots at easy targets like signs on utility poles.  They seem to think that the people they are declaring outlaw will just lay down and take it with no complaint.  Well they couldn't be more wrong.  This is most definitely not the end of this issue.  I and others like myself will continue to advertise on poles and as soon as these self-righteous con-artists take the signs down, we will be right back to put up more.  This kind of thing is exactly why we need to get the young, non-senile generation out there and VOTE THESE MISCREANTS OUT OF OFFICE!  People like Mary Lou Horner have had a blank check for too long.  She and her cronies know that they are on the way out and they are seizing upon paltry issues like this to get cheap publicity.  I hope it will be obvious to most people that this is what this latest attack is, and nothing more. <p><br>           <br>                <br>

I was distressed to see the public service announcement  on behalf of the Society Against Defenestration (or something similar) in an October issue.  The "just say no" approach seems a rather simplistic approach to a complex problem.  We of the Jan Hus Society have a more proactive response, as noted in our motto:  Close windows, open minds.  May I ask for equal time in your otherwise outstanding newspaper?Thank you, Mary Kay Sullivanmksull@maryvillecollege.edu

According to information filed with the Federal Election Commission and accessible through the FEC website (http://www.tray.com/fecinfo), in his last campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives, John J. Duncan Jr. received $500 from Champion's Political Action Committee. Now $500 isn't a great deal of money, but in my opinion that makes this kind of corruption even worse. We know that Duncan's voted for HR 961, which would have relaxed regulations dealing with the discharge of waste water into the nation's waterways. And he voted against HR 2099, a measure to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce environmental laws concerning, among other things, emissions from industrial sewage overflows.

And yet you support your endorsement of Duncan by citing a 96 percent approval rating from a group calling themselves "the American Conservative Union." A web search for this outfit reveals that their board of directors includes one Charles Black, the head of George Bush's ill-fated 1992 presidential campaign; Phil Gramm, a political hack so repugnant that he could never escape from single digits in this year's Republican presidential primaries; and Ralph Reed Jr., henchman of Pat Robertson, the multimillionaire pseudo-Christian who wants to turn the U.S. into an Iran-like "religious" totalitarian state. In other words, Duncan is rated highly by a bunch of fellow extremist Republicans and influence peddlers. What a surprise! (A full list of these cronies can be found at the union's own website, http://www.savers.org/conservative.) The League of Conservation Voters, on the other hand, is not a well-connected group of Washington insiders; they are concerned citizens who want their kitchen faucets to dispense potable water, not toxic sludge.<br>	Your endorsement of Duncan as an "emerging statesman" is not merely hypocritical; it's downright laughable. He grandstands on one bill that promises to keep the skies safe from seven-year-old pilots, and yet you fail to mention that Duncan, chair of the powerful Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, receives campaign contributions from several transportation PACs, including airline PACs, which are in direct conflict with his committee chairmanship (contributions also listed at the FEC website). So, even though he runs his committee for the benefit of special interests, not for the public, at least we're safe from those flocks of Kamikaze second-graders terrorizing the nation's airways.<br>	The fact that Duncan is owned by these special interests makes your claim that he supports any kind of meaningful "campaign finance reform" equally amusing. <p>Sincerely,<p><br>Stan Ivester<br>

Five Years and Counting...<BR>...what the heck are we doing?</H1>
<P><EM>by Coury Turczyn, Managing Editor</EM><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3>So why are we devoting an entire cover story to our own existence?</H3>
Well, frankly--like so many of our other stories--we're the only ones willing to write about it. And the existence of Metro Pulse--the first major local media resource to start up in Lord knows how long--is indeed a story in itself.
<P>After five years of struggling to carve ourselves a niche in Knoxville's competitive marketplace, the fact that we still exist is just shy of remarkable. Therefore, in this issue we're allowing ourselves a moment to reflect on what it took to get here, the many lives and careers lost in the process, and just how amazingly silly putting out a weekly paper can be.
<P>Five years ago, Metro Pulse existed as only a few ideas in the imaginations of Ashley Capps, Rand Pearson, Margaret Weston, and Ian Blackburn, who thought it would be nice to put out an entertainment publication with club listings. From there, Metro Pulse has taken on a life of its own, growing by leaps due to an odd confluence of highly talented, highly desperate people who just happened to be here when Metro Pulse needed them.
<P>But it takes more than just slapping together articles and printing them to make a publication truly live. It takes a certain amount of self-belief bordering on insanity. 
<P>My first gleanings that Metro Pulse had become an actual "entity"--a publication people paid attention to--came in the summer of 1992. That's when the esteemed daily newspaper, the Knoxville News-Sentinel, attempted to squish us out of existence like a brontosaurus trying to stamp out one of those irksome little mammals. To be sure, we were little (having published maybe 20 issues, and only half of those in the tabloid format) and we were irksome (taking as many potshots as possible at anything we didn't like), but up to that point we were producing Metro Pulse because ... well, what the hell. It was fun and there was a need for our product. Serious competition we weren't.
<P>At the time, a typical issue was about 20 pages long. The content was mostly about arts and entertainment. The events calendar was a two-page, center-spread pull-out. The things that separated us from the melange of other local free rags (The City Pages, Cabin Fever, The Brass Check, etc.) were: (a) we had a production schedule; (b) we had experienced writers; and (c) we had a foolish ambition to make a real go of it.
<P>Our office was a one-room sweat box on the third floor of the Bijou building, a step up from the original facilities in a Fort Sanders living room. The staff consisted of three full-time people (the dangerously committed publisher Rand Pearson, our ever-optimistic, tie-wearing advertising manager Pat Hinds, and me), burly copy editor Jon Wallace, plus two designers who should have gotten full-time pay because they worked around the clock--literally. From Thursday afternoon till Friday morning, UT student and devious antiestablishmentarian Ian Blackburn and self-taught design genius Jared Coffin would peck nonstop at their Macintosh keyboards, struggling to put out another massive 24-page issue that had taken us two weeks to write and sell ads for. 
<P>Well after dawn (in fact, usually around lunch time), we would triumphantly emerge from our lair in the Bijou, blearily parading the box of flats down Gay Street as we jumped into a car to deliver them to the patient employees at Knoxville Printers. After the whopping press run of 13,000 copies was complete, we'd gather at the loading dock to jam the bales into our cars. (Unfortunately, the only people we could afford to pay to distribute the papers were usually ex-cons; one after another they'd disappear in the night without a trace when Johnny Law was hot on their tails, leaving us to do the job ourselves.) Finally, by Friday evening, we'd be done doling them out, our hands and faces smeared with ink. And then we'd do it all over again.
<P>This isn't to say we five were always a smooth team. At times, tensions would, as they say, "flare" in that un-air-conditioned room. I clearly remember Rand gibbering and flailing about the office in a daze when our first job-for-hire, the program guide for the Knoxville Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, had four different spellings of "Ricki Lee Jones" in it (lasting image: owner Ashley Capps shaking Rand by the shoulders and screaming "GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, MAN!").
<P>Then there was the time Jared flung a book (or was it a bottle?) across the room, screaming, sobbing, that we had "destroyed his design" by cutting a marginalia column in half to fit an ad (he later came back, newly resigned to the harsh realities of publishing). Pat, normally a happy-go-lucky sort, slammed his fist through a wall one day in a disagreement with Rand (admittedly, this happened later in our history, but it's the best example). I contented myself by making sarcastic remarks, and Ian persisted in being calm at all times (although he was later known to occasionally toss an office chair off the roof). We took our mission seriously, though, even if the majority of Knoxville still wasn't aware of our existence.
<P>What brought us to the attention of the News-Sentinel was not our content; it was our ad sales. Reputable local businesses were buying ads in our meager publication because they knew they would hit an audience with us that other media outlets could only graze. And somewhere deep within the sales department of the mighty Sentinel machine, the order was given: Nip 'em in the bud.
<P>Their devious plan (which we discovered by intercepting one of their rate cards) was this: Take Detours on Campus, rename it Detours on the Street, and put it in boxes around downtown.
<P>This in itself wasn't very frightening. Detours on Campus was merely a 16-page giveaway of AP wire copy that was supposedly "youthful" (typical headline: "Sexual Fantasies: Let Your Mind Wander"). The new, improved Detours on the Street was just more of the same, along with regurgitated movie and music reviews from the daily edition. The sheer waste of paper is frightful to consider.
<P>But here was the sales department's masterstroke: They would individually target each one of our advertisers and promise them the same readership for considerably less than our already pitiable ad rates. Obviously, profit was not the goal foremost in the minds of the News-Sentinel powers when they hatched this plot. 
<P>And that was when I realized that Metro Pulse was going to stick around for a while. Our advertisers stood by us. They didn't buy into Detours on the Street, knowing exactly what it was worth, even at a bargain rate. They wanted us. (The Sentinel's attempt at a Pulse-killer limped along for about a year before it was quietly put out of its misery.) The effect on me, and perhaps the others on staff, was to make a real commitment: Whatever it takes, we're staying.
<P>Soon, Rand was thinking up even bigger schemes than usual. Let's tackle news and issues, he said. Let's get serious. He recruited Betty Bean, esteemed reporter from the late Knoxville Journal, to contribute news features. He convinced Ashley to employ Jared full-time, take on a bona fide calendar editor, Shelly Ridenour, and to hire an actual production manager, Laura Atkinson. 
<P>Rand then courted ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Joe Sullivan and convinced him that a bunch of people in their twenties could put out a solid paper, and that he should buy Metro Pulse. He did, and with that infusion of cash, new staff members, and credibility, we thought we had finally made it. Little did we know it was just the beginning.
<P>Over the years, we've grown considerably: from a staff of five to over 20, from biweekly to weekly, from light features to heavy news. We've won numerous awards for our writing and our design, and have been threatened with a handful of lawsuits as well. Although we're far from becoming a Knoxville "fixture," I think it's safe to say that we're an "entity." 
<P>Still, I'm not sure people know what to make of us. Based on our mail and phone calls, I'm forced to conclude that conservatives think we're a liberal Commie rag. Liberals think we're spineless, conservative weenies. Punk rockers think we're pathetic, Lawrence Welk-loving fogies. The Lawrence Welk-loving fogies think we're anarchy-fomenting MTV doodleheads. Restaurateurs who get less-than-positive reviews simply hate our guts, and exact revenge any way they can. 
<P>"What are you trying to do?" I can hear these people asking. "What's your agenda? How come you wrote about this in that way?"
<P>Well, let me reveal to one and all--our agenda is this: To find good stories and tell them the best we can. Whether they're going be construed as "liberal" or "conservative" is not often a consideration (we've pissed off both camps numerous times). Knoxville is a city starving for information about itself because what it usually gets from the major media sources is often trite, shallow, or filtered through, yes, someone's political or financial agenda. We attempt to fill the gap, with fewer sacred cows than most. Deep in my heart, I must believe that the silent majority of our readers like our coverage--most of the copies get picked up, our marketing surveys reveal a readership of startling diversity, and we've yet to have any threats of physical violence.
<P>By no stretch of the imagination, however, are we perfect--there are only a handful of cover stories I can say were printed without much room for improvement--but we try like hell to be damn good. Sometimes we hit the mark, sometimes we miss. We'll never be able to find every story worth telling, or to prove every rumor we've heard. But by introducing you to the people, places, issues and news that we think are important, we're hopefully giving you a fuller understanding of this city we live in. 
<P>By letting voices speak that aren't often heard elsewhere, we're trying to better define this community. Consequently, our pages span a lot of different interests, beliefs and hopes. Some have accused us of being schizophrenic. I like to think of us as having a lot of variety. No matter what copy you pick up, no matter who you are, if you live in Knoxville and like to read, you'll find something of interest here.
<P>Whether or not this philosophy will lead us to great financial success is still an open question. But for five years it has made us a publication worthy of your attention. 
<P>Here's looking forward to five more.

<P><EM(Special Bonus Personal Aside: I'd like to personally thank all those who have brought Metro Pulse into being, from those hardy souls at the very beginning to the extremely patient ones today. To the writers, artists, editors, photographers, ad execs, designers, readers, generous advertisers, Joe Sullivan and, especially, Hillari Lynn Dowdle: thank you all for the best gig in town.)</EM>

And Now, A Word From Our Sponsor...</H1>

Before Metro Pulse sprouted, Knoxville soil had not been fertile for new publications, at least in recent times.
<P>Three attempts at glossy city magazines--then the vogue in bigger cities--came and went in the '70s and early '80s. Ditto for two short-lived local business journals that came along a few years later. Chris Whittle "knew" the Knoxville market wasn't big enough for more than a Nutmeg, but his more expansive Tennessee Illustrated also came a cropper. Even the Knoxville Journal, after getting megamillions from the News-Sentinel to cease daily publication in 1991, couldn't make a go of a reconstituted weekly in 1992.
<P>Why has Metro Pulse flourished where so many others (the full list runs much longer) have foundered?
<P>It's hard to answer this question without appearing boastful. Vision, dedication, ingenuity, integrity, talent--we've been blessed with all of these, but the words all sound pretentious.
<P>Metro Pulse would much rather be known for its lively style and straightforward approach to connecting with our readers. We try to tell it like it is--but with a lot more depth and with a lot more flair than other local media. No, we're not the publication of record in Knoxville, except for the entertainment scene. But when Metro Pulse tackles a story on any of the vast array of topics we've covered over these past five years, we do our best to make it more enlightening and engaging than the daily newspaper's frequently humdrum fare.
<P>Metro Pulse's mission is to enlighten and enliven this community--including the lives of the people who work here. I didn't use the word enrich because we haven't turned a profit yet and can't afford to pay our people as much as they deserve. Thank goodness, journalism is a field that attracts people for whom psychic satisfaction can outweigh monetary reward.
<P>Attracting enough readers to attract enough advertisers at rates sufficient to pay the bills is what survival is all about at publications such as ours. And Metro Pulse's award-winning mix of well reported, well written stories and columns has enabled us to do just that.
<P>Readership has grown to more than 70,000, and their attributes are just as impressive as their number. Metro Pulse readers are better educated, more affluent, and more concentrated in their prime years than the News-Sentinel's. Nearly 60 percent of our readers are college graduates, compared to 31 percent of theirs. Well over half our readers have household income in excess of $35,000, compared to 41 percent of theirs. Nearly 90 percent of our readers are in the 18-54 age bracket, compared to less than 70 percent of theirs. These statistics, by the way, are drawn from a readership survey conducted for Metro Pulse this past spring by Simmons Market Research, a national leader in the field.
<P>Please don't jump to the conclusion from these numbers that Metro Pulse has an elitist bent or even defines itself in demographic terms--or any other terms, for that matter. Truth be told, whenever we try to engage in self-definition, the best we can come up with is that diversity and variety are our hallmarks.
<P>Cultural, political, generational and gender differences get so much ventilation at our editorial meetings that I sometimes worry we may suffer from multiple personality disorder. But our ad sales staff has managed to keep its sanity and to keep Metro Pulse's revenues growing along with our readership. Indeed, revenue growth has exceeded 50 percent in each of the past three years. If only our expenses hadn't managed to keep pace...
<P>I cannot resist closing on a highly personal note. From my office in the Arnstein Building on Market Street, I look across Krutch Park at the Fidelity Bankers Trust Co. Building where my father presided for most of his career over estates and trusts that owned a lot of Knoxville businesses and real estate. My view extends down the block on Gay Street to what I still think of as the Farragut Hotel, which was Knoxville's finest for many years after my grandfather, William Ross, and two partners built it in 1915. Looking west of Clinch, I can see the third floor of the Customs House which houses the McClung Collection, accumulated over a lifetime by my great-grandfather, Calvin McClung, and donated to the Lawson McGhee Library by his widow. The library, in turn, was named in memory of a daughter of my great-great grandfather, Charles McGhee, who gave Knoxville its first public library in 1885. My personal goal for Metro Pulse is to add in some small way to the contributions that my forebears have made to this community.

1991</H1>

<STRONG>by Jack Neely</STRONG>
<P>They always tell me that as we get older, time always seems to pass faster. As we approach middle age, years pass in about seven months or so. Other people's kids always grow up alarmingly fast. People always say, "It doesn't seem like five years ago..."
<P>Maybe I'm weird, but sometimes five years seem like every bit of five years. Maybe even six or seven. 
<P>Five years ago, we were gawking at the huge building Whittle was finishing on Main Street. Nobody had yet seen the inside of it. The company was every bit as prosperous and extravagant as it had been for years, and was now a month away from moving into its enormous and mysterious new headquarters, the palatial insides known only by rumor. 
<P>Whittle was huge, Whittle was high-tech, Whittle was the future. Its computers were equipped with a new thing called e-mail. The new building had whole wings being fitted out as TV studios and the break rooms were furnished with state-of-the-art snack machines that didn't take money, but rather special magnetic cards. You even got into the place with the same magnetic cards. (Low-tech stuff like keys and coins had nothing to do with the future Whittle was guiding us into.) 
<P>But for the time being, Whittle's hundreds of employees from all over the country were still straining at the seams of five old buildings downtown. They were getting a lot of national press for  Channel One and an even newer project called SRTV. Some were calling Whittle immoral, some called Whittle esthetically unpleasant--but no one was alleging the company was unprofitable. 
<P>Today, "the old Whittle building" sits silent, controlled by the metal-detector-equipped federal people. Try to remember the summers when they sold ice cream in the little shop under the arch and you saw girls--or, rather, extremely young women--in shorts and sun visors throwing Frisbees on the green lawn. Or remember when the courtyard played host to band concerts there in the grass, and public debates, and volleyball tournaments. Then remember, if you can, back before any of that ever happened. If you can, that was five years ago. 
<P>Knoxville was a different town. There was no such thing as a Knoxville brewpub or local modern-rock radio station or a Museum of East Tennessee History. There was only one Knoxville coffee house, and many regarded it as a subversive aberration. But we still had two daily newspapers. Both newspapers' restaurant critics, including the Journal's Quiche N. Tell, were raving about an especially promising new restaurant in Homberg Place called "Jonathan's."
<P>Johnny Majors was coach of the Vols, confidently anticipating another winning season in spite of an NCAA investigation into recruitment improprieties. Andy Kelly was the Vols' star quarterback. Heath Schuler was down the list, a freshman mentioned in the same breath with another second-string QB, Quincy Prigmore. Freshman tailback James "Little Man" Stewart was reportedly a disappointment. 
<P>Meanwhile, Knoxville's baseball team, the K-Jays, led the Southern League.
<P>Mikhail Gorbachev was still in charge of the Soviet Union, Larry Bird was trying to decide whether he was up for the Barcelona Olympics, and Sam Kinison irritated Joan Rivers when he didn't show up on her late-night talk show. A wacky new movie called Delirious, starring John Candy and Raymond Burr, was opening at the Capri in Bearden. 
<P>Congress was Democratic and the White House was Republican, as they would always be forever, we thought. Riding high in the popularity polls--after the Gulf War victory and the surely imminent fall of Saddam Hussein--President Bush was looking forward to re-election next year--despite his Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, who was in hot water over an investigation into his wife's financial dealings. 
<P>If a large, puffy-faced man named Bill Clinton showed up in your office lobby five years ago, your receptionist would have said, "And you are...?" 
<P>Meanwhile, from that primordial swamp emerged a new tabloid magazine on the streets of downtown Knoxville. Not many people paid much attention to it at first. I know I didn't. There were half a dozen others, all sorts of wacky free papers on the sidewalks. If this Metro Pulse was different from the others, it was just that it was more earnest with its carefully comprehensive entertainment calendar, and therefore a little duller. 
<P>Every once in a while, you run across somebody who hasn't noticed the magazine until lately. (I always assume they're surgeons who spend 14 hours a day in the operating room and go home on the interstate, to sleep.)
<P>When people say Metro Pulse--is that a new paper? I always say, "Um, yes."

A Brief History of Metro Pulse</H1>

Knoxville journalism, circa 1991, is a primal chaos, spewing random "alternative" publications across local sidewalks: The Lame Monkey Manifesto, The Addict, The Brass Check, The Watch, Township Jive, Skin Flute, The Warm Jet, Cabin Fever, 14 Days. Amid this swirl of media excess comes a new addition, one that somehow manages to outlive its peers...<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><HR>January, 1991</H3>
<STRONG>Rand Pearson,</STRONG> a cocky 22-year-old University of Georgia graduate who'd recently worked as an underling with Athens Magazine, returns to his home town with few clues. The aspiring writer works as a cook and lands a walk-on role as a grief-stricken father in a Heartland Series special. Failing to find work at Whittle Communications and humiliated by a public poetry reading at the Torch, he mulls the prospect of starting a lifestyle magazine in Knoxville.

<H3><HR>April, 1991</H3>
<STRONG>Ian Blackburn,</STRONG> one of the former publishers of the subversive journal Lame Monkey Manifesto, meets at the Falafel Hut in Fort Sanders with sometime associate <STRONG>Ashley Capps,</STRONG> cutthroat music promoter, jazz D.J., and brains behind ill-fated nightclub Ella Guru's. The two discuss an alternative newspaper project. Capps would handle advertising and editorial. Blackburn, an eccentric longhaired computer wizard and known juggler, would design and produce.

<H3><HR>July, 1991</H3>
Over a pizza of pesto and sun-dried tomatoes at the Flying Tomato, Capps introduces Blackburn to Pearson and his friend <STRONG>Margaret Weston.</STRONG> Over conversations at the Tomato, Pearson, Weston, and Blackburn refine an entertainment calendar project that would only later become something like a magazine.

<H3><HR>August 18-19, 1991</H3>
In Blackburn's cluttered Fort Sanders apartment, Pearson, Weston, and Blackburn assemble the first issue of a new magazine. One promising title is Hot Stuff. Unable to come up with anything better, the near-editors call the magazine Metro Pulse. Blackburn recalls it as "an all-night affair that made plain what kind of hell we had gotten into." Local authorities seize Pearson's car from the private-apartment parking lot, delaying delivery of the first issue. The project seems cursed.

<H3><HR>August 19, 1991</H3>
Days before Whittle Communications moves into its shimmering new headquarters, the first issue of Metro Pulse appears in downtown Knoxville in a small format, about the size of a real-estate sales tabloid.

<H3><HR>Fall, 1991</H3>
A pool of writing contributors largely composed of UT students and Whittle refugees, with a median age of perhaps 21, produces the first issues of Metro Pulse. The staff witnesses several dawns in Blackburn's chaotic chambers.

<P><STRONG>Jon Wallace,</STRONG> burly, overshaven frontman for a hardcore punk band, the STDs, becomes the copy editor too late to have prevented early damage.

<P><STRONG>Coury Turczyn,</STRONG> a Detroit native of Eastern European extraction who'd left a perfectly good job as a magazine editor at Whittle Communications to seek his fortunes as a screenwriter in Hollywood, returns to Knoxville, older, wiser, and desperate. After months of lurking around the corridors of the Whittle Building looking for scraps, he begins writing a Metro Pulse column called Bar Spy. It is rumored that people are actually reading the entire column.

<H3><HR>December, 1991</H3>
<STRONG>Jared Coffin,</STRONG> who'd created some artsy ads for Java, draws a Metro Pulse cover and later joins as art director. The paper follows Blackburn's move to a Sutherland Avenue apartment after he was evicted for having a cat.

<H3><HR>December 31, 1991</H3>
The Knoxville Journal ceases publication just as people had begun to pay attention to it. Out-of-work Journal-ists cast around town for hack work. 

<H3><HR>January, 1992</H3>
Metro Pulse moves into its new headquarters on the third floor of Bijou Theater, sharing quarters with Ashley Capps's AC Entertainment. That month, the bi-weekly publishes its first full-size tabloid issue and experiments with actual reporting.

<H3><HR>February, 1992</H3>
<STRONG>Pat Hinds,</STRONG> former publisher of a successful student publication called The Watch, joins Metro Pulse as ad manager. There's brief discussion of combining the two ventures as a new journalistic monster called Metro Watch.

<H3><HR>March, 1992</H3>
Unable to sell a single movie script in Hollywood, Coury Turczyn replaces the retiring Margaret Weston as managing editor of Metro Pulse. He introduces the innovative concept of having actual "cover stories."

<H3><HR>April, 1992</H3>
<STRONG>Bonnie Appetit,</STRONG> rumored to be a libidinous editor of medical trade books, introduces her singular style of restaurant reviewing with a critique of Hooters. She suggests the owners open a version for female diners named "Peckers." Optional motto: "Sportin' a Woodie."

<H3><HR>May, 1992</H3>
<STRONG>Jack Neely,</STRONG> disgruntled Associate Hack for a magazine distributed in doctors' offices, writes 600 words blaspheming Andrew Jackson. Turczyn proposes it become a regular feature of Metro Pulse to be called "Knoxville Babylon." Neely, who'd been reading a creepy murder book called The Secret History, has another idea. Turczyn offers $15 for each one. Astonished, Neely accepts.

<H3><HR>May, 1992</H3>
A fluorescent light mysteriously shorts out, causing a sinister blaze in the Metro Pulse offices. Ceiling sprinklers prevent the fire from destroying the most historic building in East Tennessee, but flood the staircase, moistening an art show on the second floor and swamping the paper's photo scanner.

<H3><HR>June, 1992</H3>
Latin bombshell and Journal investigative firebrand <STRONG>Betty Bean</STRONG> begins writing occasional pieces.
Bean conveys intelligence that County Executive Dwight Kessel and friends were plotting to start their own weekly paper in the wake of the Journal fallout--only after they realized it would cost too much to restart the daily. Pearson alertly presents Metro Pulse to the so-called Phoenix investment group, but later scuttles an offer to make Metro Pulse the entertainment section of this new venture. Nonetheless, the stir brings Metro Pulse to the attention of one <STRONG>Joe Sullivan.</STRONG>

<H3><HR>July, 1992</H3>
<STRONG>John Mayer,</STRONG> shadowy former beatnik and pulp-novel connoisseur, launches the darkly brilliant but impossibly complex detective comic series, "Knoxville Confidential." 

<P>Metro Pulse launches its newer, hipper look, enhanced by the appealingly disturbing icons of <STRONG>Timothy Winkler,</STRONG> a moody local artist about whom very little is known for certain. Soon afterward, he starts charging real money for his illustrations.

<H3><HR>August, 1992</H3>
Former intern <STRONG>Shelly Ridenour</STRONG> becomes calendar editor; soon, her Spotlights and band descriptions are among the shortest and most memorable paragraphs ever printed in Metro Pulse.

<P>Joining the paper is willowy production manager <STRONG>Laura Atkinson,</STRONG> who vows to make sense of the madness.

<H3><HR>November, 1992</H3>
Financially embarrassed by a year of Metro Pulse, Pearson's group and Ashley Capps sell the white elephant to Joe Sullivan. An Ivy-League financial czar allegedly linked to old Knoxville families, Sullivan is a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and longtime boss of a Chicago securities-exchange mob. Convinced that Metro Pulse could give Knoxville's remaining daily a run for it, Sullivan re-establishes his roots to realize a cub-reporter's dream.

<P>Metro Pulse moves to larger quarters on the mezzanine of the Burwell building--again, above the box office of an ancient Gay Street theater.

<H3><HR>December 1992</H3>
In response to a single letter written by a member of a Baptist church, Kroger boots Metro Pulse from the racks in all of its stores. At question is a handful of gay personal ads, deemed inappropriate for sensitive grocery shoppers. After managing to get back on the racks, Metro Pulse is booted again for a story on Knoxville's gay club scene (though the back-breaking straw is claimed to be a single quote from the story by a drag queen who says, "They love me because I'm so f---ing gorgeous.")

<H3><HR>January, 1993</H3>
<STRONG>Lee Gardner</STRONG> leaves his relatively new job as a Whittle editor to join Metro Pulse as staff writer. His Whittle colleagues tell him he's crazy. "Metro Pulse? Are you serious? It can't last. Lee, think of your future."

<H3><HR>June, 1993</H3>
Peppery promotions coordinator <STRONG>Charlotte Klasson</STRONG> joins the paper's front lines, later to become advertising manager.

<H3><HR>July, 1993</H3>
In its annual convention in Austin, Texas, the ordinarily discerning Association of Alternative Newspapers, which had denied Metro Pulse official sanction one year earlier, unanimously votes to admit Metro Pulse to its ranks.

<H3><HR>August 1, 1993</H3>
<STRONG>Barry Henderson,</STRONG> another hard-boiled veteran of the Journal, returns home after an extended sojourn in Communist China. An angst-ridden caffeine addict and known associate of Jim Dykes, Henderson joins Metro Pulse as editor to combat the widespread prejudice that Metro Pulse is staffed entirely by spoiled, fruity brats. He brings with him an innate ability to write baffling headlines ("Like Topsy, West Knoxville Just Grows," "Strings But No Towrope," "Pressure for Equity Brings More Women Into Sports-Happy UT Fold").

<P>Betty Bean quits to seek more challenging work at the Halls Shopper.

<P>Editors succumb to a bizarre publicity ploy, persuaded by the TNi cable channel to send one reporter to appear on the "i-Channel News" and talk about his or her current story in Metro Pulse for fully 90 seconds each week. Stunned by the mystery of Lance West's hair, writers say little of substance on the air.

<H3><HR>January, 1994</H3>
Smarting from a reader letter ridiculing his writing style as "hyper, yet flaccid," Lee Gardner quits Metro Pulse to write promotional copy for Ardent, a Memphis record company. To replace him, the paper hires one <STRONG>Chris Barrett,</STRONG> an obscure nuclear submariner from Kentucky discovered openly writing for the Morristown paper.

<H3><HR>March, 1994</H3>
Metro Pulse conducts its first annual Best of Knoxville survey.  Entrepreneurs voted "Best" finally take Metro Pulse seriously.

<H3><HR>May, 1994</H3>
Metro Pulse shocks the journalistic establishment by winning several regional awards at the annual Society of Professional Journalists banquet, beating out several well-known local celebrities. Staffers were especially astonished. None of them are even members of the Society of Professional Journalists. 

<P>The jocular <STRONG>Stephanie Moyers</STRONG> enlists as an account executive. Cohesion expert and all-around office guru <STRONG>Betty Franklin</STRONG> also joins the ranks.

<P>On the condition she not be expected to appear physically in the Metro Pulse office, Betty Bean returns as staff writer, vague about her experiences with the Halls Shopper. Likewise, Lee Gardner returns as staff writer, vague about his experiences with Ardent Records.

<H3><HR>December, 1994</H3>
Metro Pulse moves a third time, to the third floor of the Arnstein Building, the longtime headquarters of the now defunct Whittle Communications. 

<H3><HR>February, 1995</H3>
Envious editors of big-city alternative magazines offer big money to lure Metro Pulse staffers away from Knoxville. Lee Gardner leaves to become music editor for City Paper, Baltimore's alternative weekly, becoming the first--and to date only--Metro Pulse staffer to quit twice. Meanwhile, Jared Coffin quits to take the artistic helm of the massive Dallas alternative weekly, the Dallas Observer. 

<P><STRONG>Lisa Horstman,</STRONG> longtime Whittle vet and national award-winning author/illustrator of a children's book called Fast Friends, takes over as art director. Tranquillity reigns. And smilin' <STRONG>Jay Nations,</STRONG> former proprietor of the near-mythical Raven Records, a longtime front for subversive musical activities, joins the staff as account executive.

<H3><HR>April, 1995</H3>
Bonnie Appetit quits as Restaurant Rover to flak for a certain presidential campaign in Nashville. <STRONG>Gourmet Pyle,</STRONG> the clever nom de guerre of a nationally famous author, takes her place and promptly makes Metro Pulse readers even angrier than Bonnie Appetit ever did.

<H3><HR>June, 1995</H3>
Bonnie Appetit returns, vague about her experiences with said presidential campaign.

<H3><HR>June 1, 1995</H3>
After more than a year of threats, Metro Pulse doubles its frequency, becoming Knoxville's most exciting weekly since Parson Brownlow's Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator.

<H3><HR>June 29, 1995</H3>
Metro Pulse publishes its 100th issue, approximately 96 more than most people predicted back in 1991.

<P>Mysteriously efficient business manager <STRONG>Judy Rone</STRONG> brings Metro Pulse closer to the long-awaited black. 

<P>Post-punk State Champs drummer and half-breed Italian lasagna chef <STRONG>Chris Leather</STRONG> takes the designer's seat in the dangerous, often rhythmic production room.

<H3><HR>July, 1995</H3>
Chris Barrett hosts the First Annual Metro Pulse Brew-Off, allegedly the largest regional beer-brewing contest in modern times. He appears tipsy at work the next day, is often missing from his desk, and starts calling co-workers "Bubba." 

<H3><HR>August, 1995 </H3>
Metro Pulse scoops the entire planet with Shelly Ridenour's cover profile/travelogue about Superdrag's New York recording sessions, 11 months before the boys hit the Billboard charts. 

<H3><HR>November, 1995 </H3>
<STRONG>Regina Williamson,</STRONG> aspiring novelist from Somewhere Out West, takes the hot seat as MP receptionist. 

<P><STRONG>Leslie Buxbaum</STRONG> and <STRONG>David Moore</STRONG> brighten Metro Pulse's day as ad reps. 

<H3><HR>December, 1995 </H3>
Rand Pearson's Scruffy City Publishing inexplicably publishes a collection of Jack Neely's Metro Pulse columns, entitled Knoxville's Secret History. After several book signings, Neely begins endorsing his paychecks Who loves ya, baby? Jacko.

<P>Grizzled editor Barry Henderson, the last of a generation of hard-living newspapermen, stuns the local publishing establishment when he accepts a job as editor of the Prague Post. He chose the Czech Republic as his new home because its layer of carbon monoxide reminds him of the Arnstein Building stairwell.

<H3><HR>January, 1996 </H3>
Ponderous News-Sentinel editorial page editor <STRONG>Bill Dockery</STRONG> leaves his lucrative post to take Henderson's place at the helm of Metro Pulse, explaining his action to the stunned publishing establishment by paraphrasing John Milton: "I would rather reign in Hell than serve in Hell."

<P>Metro Pulse staffers, who had been baby-free for the paper's entire history, undergo a mysterious plague of infants, as one female employee after another vanishes from the office--only to return with wailer in arms. Stephanie Moyers, Betty Franklin, and new classified ad rep <STRONG>Eve Mynatt</STRONG> are victims. 

<H3><HR>February, 1996</H3>
Clean-shaven bachelor <STRONG>Mike Gibson,</STRONG> formerly of the Mountain Press, joins as staff writer, specializing in the more dangerous assignments that spouses and parents are reluctant to accept.

<P><STRONG>Julie Lewis,</STRONG> a blonde, nimble Marylander who claims not to be kin to Juliet Lewis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Huey Lewis, Jerry Lewis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jewel, or Julie Andrews, begins as assistant account executive.

<H3><HR>April, 1996</H3>
After the Best of Knoxville results are made public, oft-maligned Mayor Victor Ashe and desert-isle fantasy Kristin Hoke make unexpected but brief appearances at the Metro Pulse party at the Lord Lindsey. Editors regret not showing up.

<H3><HR>April, 1996 </H3>
Metro Pulse founder and karaoke star Rand Pearson stuns the local publishing establishment when he accepts a position as general manager of the Reno News and Review. He breaks a long-baffling murder case when he overhears the confession of a darkly garbed male Caucasian: "I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die..." 

<P>The daring Dogwood Arts Festival parody is noticed by no one but the Dogwood Arts Festival, which quickly blackballs Metro Pulse from all its functions in retaliation. 

<H3><HR>August, 1996 </H3>
Five years of hard work pays off when Metro Pulse is mentioned in the "Thanks to" paragraph on the credits of the V-Roys' debut CD, Just Add Ice. 

<H3><HR>More to Blame</H3>
Here are even more people who played important roles in Metro Pulse's development (and about whom we couldn't think of anything funny to say).

<P><STRONG>James Raxter,</STRONG> misunderstood ad manager
<BR><STRONG>Carla Perkins,</STRONG> our first overworked business manager
<BR><STRONG>Betty Caughron,</STRONG> our second overworked business manager
<BR><STRONG>Hillari Dowdle,</STRONG> writer and secret editor
<BR><STRONG>Tracy Jones,</STRONG> book critic and feature writer 
<BR><STRONG>Greg Howard,</STRONG> music critic

Lines Sublime</H1>

It's our goal here at Metro Pulse to eliminate your need for critical thinking. After all, why should you have to worry yourself about whether things like movies, records, concerts, and restaurants are good or bad when we've got a staff of highly trained professionals to do it for you? Yessiree, just sit back, take it easy, and we'll do the discriminatin' for you. Here are some of our most vicious summations.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3><HR>Hollywood Infant Terrible Wanna-be Zak Weisfeld:</H3>
One can almost see the corporate flacks chained in the office complex in Culver City, eyes glazed with almost religious intensity, shaking like pentecosts and shouting out, "ancillaries," "foreign sales," "licensing," "action figures," as though channeling the sacred words from Mammon himself. 
<BR>--on <I>Batman Forever</I>

<P>"Mr. Stallone," I said, "don't you think that the real reason you were attracted to this role is because of your deeply held belief in fascism, your twisted fantasy of imposing your cult of personality on millions of children everywhere ... forging them into a fanatical paramilitary order that will carry you into the future  as a new Il Duce? Isn't it true that you like the role because you get to wear tight pants by Versace and the character of Dredd is flat enough that it doesn't stretch even your nonexistent acting ability..."
<BR>--on <I>Judge Dredd</I>

<P>With 200 million dollars I could wipe out polio in Brazil or I could spend the rest of my life in an exotic Bhutanese retreat, ass deep in hookers and high-grade opium. Hell, for 200 million dollars I could probably lease Bhutan outright.
<BR>--on <I>Waterworld</I>

<P>It may be giving away too much to begin a review of Johnny Mnemonic  by saying that Dolph Lundgren steals the show.
<BR>--on <I>Johnny Mnemonic</I>

<P>Both Lucy and Joe are fast approaching the dreaded three-zero, the age at which, if ancient rituals were adjusted for inflation, my generation would have their bar/bat mitzvahs.
<BR>--on <I>If Lucy Fell</I>

<P>Demi's breasts appear barely a part of her at all; rather, they seem like two satellites in a stable geosynchronous orbit around her eerily taught body.
<BR>--on <I>Striptease</I>

<H3><HR>Hyper-Yet-Flaccid Rock Critic Lee Gardner:</H3>

Their whole po-faced we're-so-intense-yet-so-sensitive-love-ya-dude thing got right up my nose like a gnat on bennies. And worst of all, people were confusing their competent, catchy hard rock with something new or different or special. I considered them coattail riders, grunge without the gr, sheep in wolves clothing. Night Ranger posing as Nirvana. 
<BR>--on Pearl Jam

<P>If you like the way he says it ["bee-yutch"], go buy the album.... But if you don't like what he's saying when he says it, don't bother. If you don't like what he says, but sheepishly like the way he says it, well, join the club, G.
<P>--on Snoop Doggy Dogg's <I>Doggy Style</I> 

<P>Betcha those wicked-looking runes on the cover read "For ages 9 to 14."
<BR>--on Danzig's <I>Danzig 4</I>

<P>I don't know why Alligator thought this dude would go over in America. I mean, he's just a white guy from Australia who sings his lame originals hard and tunelessly while he wee-wee-wees gratuitous groove-ignorant slide guitar everywhere. We have plenty of guys here who do more or less the exact same thing already.
<BR>--on Dave Hole's <I>Working Overtime</I>

<H3><HR>George Logan, World's Most Polite Drama Critic:</H3>

<P>The plot goes beyond the merely Freudian. If you had a Freudian dream about Freudian theory, it might come out a little like this, and you'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to go wash your face.
<BR>--on Joe Orton's <I>Entertaining Mr. Sloane</I>

<P>A few moments are so overdone that they almost remind you of real life. 
<BR>--on a local production of <I>The Cemetery Club</I>

<P>I almost wished the theater featured operatitles, in Romanian, to distract you from the English. 
<BR>--on <I>Dracula, Prince of the Dark</I>

<P>The cast displayed a trait common to talented kids learning the piano. The better they learn their parts, apparently, the faster they play them.
<BR>--on a local production of <I>The Last Laugh</I>

<P>"It's really just a wacky lounge act," I observed to a willowy brunette on the poop deck. "Not a murder mystery..." She gave me a pained look, then tumbled into the paddle wheel, a steak knife in her back. The engine groaned once as she churned through the works, and she was gone.
<BR>--on a Knoxville riverboat "murder cruise"

<P>In the urinal after the show, a middleaged man standing next to me offered his assessment of this play that treats murder, mortal disease, and existential doubt: "That was a real neat deal," he said. 
<BR>--on the Blount County production of <I>Christy, the Musical</I>

<H3><HR>Music Scenestress Shelly Ridenour:</H3>

Just think, if a bomb hit the arena, East Tennessee's crop of acoustic patio guys would be seriously depleted. Hmmm...
<BR>--on an upcoming James Taylor concert

<P>This one could've been subtitled 'Money-sucking leeches reunite for one last wheezing hurrah' and it still would have sold out. Sigh.
<BR>--on an upcoming Eagles concert

<P>Gotta borrow from the official bio for this one: "The voice. The hair. The savoir faire." The wimp-out. The cheese. The flatulent, easy-listening wheeze. Rod the Mod, where are ye?
<BR>--on Rod Stewart

<P>Over the years, more sap has come from this man's lungs than a forest of maple trees. The question is not can he still over-emote, the question is who cares?
<P>--on Steve Perry

<P>Some men are inspired by God, others the divine intervention of the IRS. What else would reduce Willie Nelson to pitch zesty Burrito Supremes for Taco Bell?
<BR>--on Willie Nelson

<P>Maybe if he cut the neckwarmer 'do and owned up to his impending baldness. Maybe if he quit over-emoting those soul covers. Maybe if he quit singing in clichs--'love is a wonderful thing!' Maybe, just maybe, then I would get Michael Bolton.
<BR>--on Michael Bolton

<H3><HR>Zaftig 'n' Zany Restaurant Reviewer Bonnie Appetit</H3>

<P>But perhaps the most revolting part of the dining experience was being exposed to the too-loud, sophomoric conversations of the philosophy majors all around us. While we fretted about food poisoning, they wondered aloud about the nature of God, man, and the universe. Sample quote: "I often wonder if there's anything beyond experience--maybe there's no tomorrow and the now is all that truly is." (Perhaps, at Champa, a valid concern.)
<BR>--on Champa

<P>I'm told that drinking is the main attraction, and guess once you're drunk enough your taste buds cease to care. But if you're into sobriety, I suggest you avoid the place at all costs. Unless, that is, you're feeling too lazy to defrost your own meals.
<BR>--on Applebees

<P>The employees of the Blue Moon appear to be experiencing the passage of time in a very different way from you and I. Nice enough folks, they apparently are into the Zen of sandwich making. ("It's like they've never noticed the beauty of a leaf of lettuce before," said my friend Puck.)
<BR>--on Blue Moon Bakery

<P>The food itself sports a fresh-from-the-freezer flavor, and therefore seemed kinda "homestyle" to me, as if I could have stuck it in the microwave myself.
<BR>--on Miami Subs Grill

<P>I settled in, safe in the knowledge that there was literally nothing I could do here to make a mess that hadn't already been done before. I could eat with my fingers, I could show Zippy my mouthful of food, I could lunge across the table at his plate, and who would care? Certainly not the table of four-year-olds next to us.
<BR>--on Red Lobster

<P>We had plenty of time to contemplate our dogs while the teenage wait staff struggled to suppress their raging hormones long enough to remember all three items of the order they were preparing.
<BR>--on Frank &amp; Stein

<H3><HR>Coury Turczyn, Master of the Blurb-a-Quote<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>:</H3>

Relationships, achievement, emotional fulfillment--what do they all really mean in the grand equation of life? Amazingly, it all adds up to dating Uma Thurman.
<BR>--on <I>Beautiful Girls</I>

<P>Screamers  is one of those movies that strikes you dumb with wonder: Who in the world thought that this insanely silly idea was worth making? Which executive at what studio said to himself, "Hmmm, little whiny metal rat things that fly out of the ground and slice people's heads off ... ingenious! We must make this film!"
<BR>--on <I>Screamers</I>

<P>Faye Dunaway, Rupert Everett, Jason Alexander, Paul Reubens ... and a monkey?! Yes, it's mass career suicide as people we actually respect immolate their reputations on a bonfire of inanity.
<BR>--on <I>Dunston Checks In</I>

<P>Disney's Pocohontas gets five years added to her age, not to mention her cup size.
<BR>--on <I>Pocohontas</I>

<P>Upon finding a dazed Slater in the desert, Mathis immediately aims a gun at his head and declares him "under arrest!" Gosh, do park rangers often pull guns on the downed pilots they're rescuing--or was Slater guilty of slamming his plane into a no-crash zone?
<BR>--on <I>Broken Arrow</I>

<P>When you think of kinky S&amp;M sex games, who immediately comes to mind? If you fantasize about Dan Akroyd and Rosie O'Donnell suiting up in rubber bodysuits, then, boy, do we have a movie for you.
<BR>--on <I>Exit to Eden</I>

<P>Although it posits itself as an "issue" movie about sexual harassment, Disclosure still boils down to simply watching Michael Douglas screw around with a libidinous woman, then suffer the consequences afterward. (Because, as we all know, libidinous women are DERANGED!)
<BR>--on <I>Disclosure</I>

<P>Oh Lord. You'd think Bernie would be decomposing by now, right along with the script.
<BR>--on <I>Weekend at Bernie's 2</I>

<P>If Eddie Murphy ever walked a Detroit street in real life, he'd be stripped of his Gucci loafers and Rolex, then hung by his toes from the Joe Louis memorial. "Street" he ain't.
<BR>--on <I>Beverly Hills Cop III</I>

Bar Spy Returns!</H1>

<P>Our fifth anniversary issue seemed like the perfect time to pony out the <STRONG>Bar Spy,</STRONG> our first verifiably popular column (this was before Secret History appeared, of course). The brainchild of MP managing editor <STRONG>Coury Turczyn,</STRONG> the column reviewed dive bars, those oft-ignored watering holes. Bar Spy never failed to delight/ anger/ interest/ disgust/ intrigue/ revolt/ horrify/ amuse/ sadden our early readers. So it is in homage to the king of pickled eggs that we present these much-loved highlights:

<H3>On the Circle N:</H3>
<P>The Lucky Lady, the Conversation Pit, the Hollywood Lounge. These aren't the type of bars that attract moussed fun-seekers from across town. Instead, these quiet edifices to wino-hood gather up their own regulars from around the block. The advantages are innumerable. Just image, if you can: no frat boys drunkenly brawling with the Pop-a-Shot machine, no big-haired femme fatales giggling like dervishes, no black-attired bohemians radiating their superior alternativeness. None of that. Just a bar, some stools, a pool table if you're lucky, and an occasional barfly. The drinking experience stripped down to its very essence.
<P>To truly kick off the series with a bang, I chose what is possibly the Mt. Everest of dives, the Circle N. Literally located "across the tracks" from the Old City, this drinking establishment enjoys a reputation for being Knoxville's most popular source of sex crimes and illegal narcotics. They also serve popcorn.

<H3>On the Ol' Plantation:</H3>
<P>Going into an unfamiliar bar is a plunge into the unknown. Will you meet friendly faces and outstretched hands, or knuckle-dragging fellows with occipital ridges who really, really dislike your choice of shoelaces? Ah, adventure!
<P>It's in this spirit of discovery that I chose the Ol' Plantation for my weekly rendezvous with excitement. From the outside, the Fourth &amp; Gill neighborhood bar looks like a frontier outpost with its all-wood, windowless construction and metal-barred door. I imagined grizzled, out-of-work factory men inside drinking cases of Olympia tall-boys, angrily thumbing well-honed Bowie knives and hoping for a stranger to walk in. "C'mere, hippie boy! Whoop-whoop-whoop!"
<P>We took a table away from the bar over near the jukebox and surveyed the scene. Against he wall was a hardwood dance floor with multicolored lights flashing overhead; pretty sophisticated equipment for a down-n-dirty dive like this.
<P>A hard looking fellow in a swelling shirt stood up and began walking toward our table. This was it. I could see it coming ... the ring of screaming, spitting rednecks around us in the parking lot, cheering on their buddy as he uses my head to repaint the parking spaces....
<P>The brooding monster stopped at our table and looked down at us.
<P>"You guys wanna dance?" he asked.

<H3>On Tom's Place:</H3>
<P>Located directly across the street from Theatre Central, Tom's Place raised my hopes. I envisioned circles of thespians and writers gathered at its tables, fervently debating the vicissitudes of their craft, snifting the heady inspiration of grain and hops through the wee hours of the night. My friend and I entered the bar prepared for an evening of intellectual fencing, ready to do battle for our seats at Knoxville's own Algonquin Roundtable.
<P>We were immediately greeted by the sight of a busty woman in her 40s playing video poker and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "Vicious Power Hungry BITCH."

<H3>On the Unnamed Pickup Joint That Wanted to Sue Us:</H3>
<P>Never before have I been forced to witness such lows in the human condition, such feral scuttlings of people stripped to their most sickening urges! It took every bit of willpower I had to quell my nausea in order to make this report. I assure you, that was my last visit to [the Unnamed Pickup Joint That Wanted to Sue Us].
<P>I walked inside, turned a corner and was stunned by a scene of unrelenting horror. On every seat, at every table, lined up at the bar, occupying every available space were yuppies brazenly socializing. A veritable swarm of stubby men in white shirts and red ties slavered over women in tarty cocktail dresses, a cloud of hair spray hovering overhead.
<P>Staggered, I held on to the bar and tried to retain consciousness. Gathering every shred of courage I had left, I forced myself to walk further into the darkened lair. Squeezing through, and desperately trying to find some space, I popped out into an open area. Calmed, I took a few breaths and steadied myself.
<P>But that was before I realized I was on the dance floor. Cold fear gripped my entrails....
<P>A flood of people crowded around me as I sought much needed escape. Blinded by the glare of faux gems, I groped for a way out. I was blocked by a wall of unnaturally suntanned flesh. I think I started to moan at that point.

<H3>On Miss Nina's Saloon:</H3>
<P>"Quit jackin' yer jaw and get on the dance floor!"
<P>It's a Wednesday night at Miss Nina's Saloon and the glitter balls are spinning. George Jones is on the jukebox, crooning over some godawful pain, and the regulars line the bar like a row of dominoes about to fall. Every so often, in between the whispers and chuckles, they peer over their shoulders to the dance floor. There, beneath the wagon wheel lamps and posters of Elvis, dances the sweet angel of their dreams: Miss Nina.
<P>"The song's over!" she bellows to her partner. "Get your hands offa my ass!"

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

"In <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of liberalism than personal peccadilloes."<br>
-- Cal Thomas<p>

"The liberal media have the power to set the national agenda, and <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> proves that this is just what they're doing."<br>

<P>
<DD><B>Alexandria, VA</B> -- The television networks substantially increased the number of labels they
applied to Democrats during their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers to a barrage of questions from
the left. For Republicans gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the issue. For
Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the right on welfare reform became the media
focus. Adding up both questions and statements made by reporters to one another, abortion or
exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers
heard about welfare reform 43 times in Chicago.
<BR>
<DD>After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter during the August political
conventions, the Media Research Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN
(starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the joint NBC/PBS broadcast. Key findings:
<BR>
<h4>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged conservative.</h4><BR>
 Studies of the 1984,
1988 and 1992 conventions found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats. In
1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118 conservative labels during the GOP conclave,
but just 38 liberal labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans were tagged
59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled
119 times (44 moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).
<BR>
<DD>In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured about half as many liberal tags
with 16. In San Diego, the networks focused most of their labeling on conservative delegates and
speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged -- three moderate and two conservative labels. The
Republican platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform was never described as
liberal. See page 3 for a summary table and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left side of the political
spectrum.</h4><br> On 51 occasions in San Diego Republicans were hit with questions from the left,
especially about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six inquiries from the right. Two
weeks later instead of questioning Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the
left, the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President Clinton's decision to sign the
welfare reform bill, but just 11 questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same treatment, hearing 131 questions from
the left compared to 17 from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46 questions
from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite
some pretty vitriolic speeches.</h4>
<BR>In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans with terms
like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34
times. Democrats were hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their convention,
but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992,
the networks questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but never once raised the
subject against Democrats at their convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of
the contrast.
<BR>
<h4>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely acknowledged.</h4><br> The Clintons are under
active investigation by an independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references to
Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN,
only one. Topics never mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and the
special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy.
Controversies about Republicans, such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.

<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, ABC News: </I>
<DD>At both conventions his podium reports provided even-handed observations on what each speaker
hoped to accomplish. In San Diego he refrained from gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for
being too intolerant. In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson offered a
balance appraisal of the party delegates, noting that the Democratic delegates "are far to the
left of the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In the
midst of network hoopla over Clinton's acceptance speech, only Donaldson realized that while
Clinton gave a "great speech," the "record shows that the next day he may give a different
speech, change his mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>One of the few reporters to pose questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has generally opposed efforts to cut
off benefits to illegal immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why would
hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here illegally?" Then she asked her about
how people who saw her speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree
to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do you think you went too far?" On the first
night in Chicago Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats control the
party. Myers was the only broadcast network reporter to provide details in prime time from the
Star story on Dick Morris.
<BR>
<DD><I>Brian Ross, ABC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared early in prime time with stories on corporate
contributions and union influence, ABC's Ross must be highlighted despite the fact his pieces
did not air in prime time. In a series of World News Tonight stories, Ross went after, with
equal vigilance, the big money contributors to both parties. Ross raised issues never mentioned
anywhere else on the networks, such as "the giant media corporations," which are "very much in
the middle of the mix." In San Diego he noted that "Last night, the ABC hospitality was a
lobbyist's dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor, "His name is Arthur Coia, who despite
being President of a labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become
one of the Democrats' top money people."

<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Seemed baffled why a rape victim would have anything to do with Republicans and her interview
with Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more two like old friends sharing
tales of their suffering than a dispassionate interview. Just after rape victim Jan License
addressed Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why [speak] at a Republican
convention? So many people have said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party,
is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?" Shriver's under the podium interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver
posed questions like "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the
way you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go
away?" And, noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered "How did that affect you when you
heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff, CNN</I>
<BR>
<DD>In San Diego she repeatedly demanded that Republicans explain why there weren't more female
delegates, but in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on their pro-partial birth abortion
stand, she worried about welfare reform going too far and defended Hillary Clinton from
Republican attacks. She peppered Hillary Clinton with six welfare reform questions, all assuming
that it is going too far. By the end she was pleading with Mrs. Clinton to do something:
"Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time
she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that
she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, the what?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Found Republican speakers threaten to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald
Reagan, and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised the speaking power of
Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived
meanness on the part of the country. In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's speech which attacked
conservatives, he admired how his words grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least
mention Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald Reagan in San Diego he
took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have to learn how history will judge his time in office --
the deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told a rape victim "this is a
party that is dominated by men," so he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever thought
about what happens in America with rape?" 
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="networks">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>In 1992, the networks questioned the convention's tone</B></FONT>
as too negative 70 times during the GOP convention, to zero at the Democratic convention. This
year, analysts again searched for questioning of negative tone (such as the use of words like
"attack" or "bash"), and found a similar tilt. In San Diego, prime-time network analysts
suggested Republican negativity on 34 occasions, to one NBC reference to Clinton "pummeling"
Dole in TV ads. In Chicago, the network suggested Republican negativity again on 23 occasions,
to only six occasions for the Democrats. In total, a negativity discrepancy of 57 to 7.
<BR>
<B>Republican convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>On August 13, keynote speaker Rep. Susan Molinari said: "Americans know that Bill Clinton's
promises have the lifespan of a Big Mac on Air Force One." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison remarked
earlier: "America -- it's time to wake up to President Clinton and his high-taxing,
free-spending, promise-breaking, Social Security-taxing, health care socializing, drug-coddling,
power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, UN-following, FBI-abusing, IRS-increasing,
200-dollar-haircutting, gas-taxing, over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting,
privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging, Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking,
job-destroying friends."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction: </I>On NBC, Tim Russert warned: "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas
is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean." On
CBS, Dan Rather announced Hutchison was "expected to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with
everything short of a tire tube." CBS's Bob Schieffer called her "Attack Dog Hutchison." CNN's
Judy Woodruff announced: "A Clinton-bashing night." 
<BR>
<B>Democratic convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>Jesse Jackson said: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense against the Newt
Gingrich Contract, America's right-wing assault on our elderly, our students, and our civil
rights." Mario Cuomo charged: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the real threat to
our women. They are the real threat to our children. They are the real threat to clean air,
clean water, and the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells hope and the
Republicans spell disaster."
<BR>
<DD>On August 29, Sen. Ted Kennedy used the same literary device that caused Hutchison to be bashed
for negativity, in this case describing the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish list of the
education-cutting, environmental-trashing, Medicare-slashing, choice-denying,
tolerance-repudiating, gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting...minimum wage-opposing Republican majority..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction:</I> On Jackson, "The most stirring speech of the convention so far," cooed Dan
Rather. "The old lion has not lost its roar," oozed Tom Brokaw. "Convention rhetoric has not
been much better than it was tonight," exclaimed Ken Bode on CNN. On Cuomo, ABC's Jim Wooten
noted wistfully: "For a quick moment, deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a glimpse of conventions past, when
liberals were still the lions of the party, and rhetoric roared." CNN's Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo about his father: "You really are a fan of his speaking style.
It's amazing, isn't it?"
<BR>
<DD>On Kennedy,  Tom Brokaw came out of the speech on NBC/PBS: "Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in
full voice after all these years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the liberal
cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he does every four years." On CNN, Ken Bode
observed: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the other party. You get it at any
convention. Ted Kennedy does it as well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."

<DD><I>Peter Jennings, 8/12:</I> "Michel McQueen on the floor, do tell us, Michel, about the conservative
Christians who make up a very large part of this convention. What's the challenge there?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen, 8/12:</I> "Peter, there is no mistaking the passion and the conviction of the
Christian conservative movement to this convention. We told you before that about half of the
delegations are controlled by people who consider themselves to be pro-life and very
conservative...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen to a black delegate, 8/13:</I> "Contrary to the stereotype many people have of
African Americans who are active in politics, Mr. Fobbs is very conservative, he is pro-life, he
is not a life-long Republican, isn't that true?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Jim Wooten, 8/15:</I> "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have to identify themselves tonight and they have to
choose whether they're going to be the ticket of the Ralph Reed, religious right, Christian
Coalition Republicans or whether they're going to be the ticket of the more inclusive party
we've seen from the podium this week."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lesley Stahl, 8/12:</I> "You know, TV programmers have an expression: target audience. The target
audience tonight is women, particularly those 30 to 60. The whole purpose of tonight's
convention, the whole program, is to diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's
what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the convention, the Republican
convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be
Colin Powell, he will appeal for civility. On the platform, women find that extreme, it's
turning them off."
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "I want to read you a quote, a party official here
said that the role of the prime time speakers, that would include you, is to confuse voters
about the real influence of your party's most conservative wing and the, quote, `Christian
right.' Are you part of that effort?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Pat Robertson, 8/13:</I> "True or untrue: that if elected, a President Dole would be
more to the right than candidate Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to two Missouri delegates, 8/13:</I> "We had talked earlier about the fact that polls
show that most of the delegates of this convention are more conservative than Republicans at
large. How do you get that message out to people who are not, perhaps, not as conservative as
you? How do you convince them to support the Republican ticket, the Republican platform?" Lesley
Stahl, 8/14: "We're hearing a lot of grousing about the re-packaging of the party. We've spoken
to delegates in Louisiana, Missouri, other delegations, who are saying, Where are our issues? In
gagging opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob Dole may be
turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention gung ho. They say putting three,
pro-choice women on last night was too much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he
does have to change the perception of this party as too extreme. Dan."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to a Buchanan delegate, 8/14:</I> "There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to
this convention. How does this sit with you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to Gerald Ford, 8/12:</I>  "President Ford do you worry  the Republican Party in the last
couple of years became a more conservative, or at least was pictured as a more conservative
sometimes a party that seemed to be going away from the politics that you stood for?"
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/12:</I> "President Ford mentioned what he called a drift to the right in the
Republican party. He was always known as a moderate Republican from the center of the party. And
he says it's been reversed by this convention. Well, I'm sure he believes that, a lot of people
do. But they wrote a platform that is very much a right wing platform. It was written by a lot
of social conservatives."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to an Idaho delegate, 8/13:</I> "Do you feel that the line-up of speakers at this
convention reflects a platform which seems to be much more conservative than the speakers?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to Phyllis Schlafly, 8/13:</I> "With me is Phyllis Schafly, an ardent anti-abortion
rights advocate. Do you think the speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw, 8/13:</I> "Bob Dole did not get the tolerance language he wanted in the abortion plank
which came out of this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other things.
The conservatives have iron clad control over this convention."
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken, 8/14:</I> "It's interesting they just had a moment ago a very brief tribute to the
Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly
controversial. It's the freshman of the House of Representatives that really gave Bill Clinton
the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/12:</I> "There is a sense of pride among these Republicans that he [Colin Powell]
will articulate why he is a Republican. Frankly, there is some trepidation on part of some of
the more conservative delegates. They do not see eye-to-eye with him on their views."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert, 8/13:</I> "Key word: mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They
have thus far after two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time
tonight. I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she uses
words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert after Dole's speech, 8/15:</I> "These are difficult speeches to give as you know, Tom.
He's appealing to a very conservative audience in the hall here but he's trying to reach
independent voters out in the country."

<DD><I>Margaret Warner to Newt Gingrich, 8/12:</I> "The Dole campaign officials do say that partly this
convention is designed to undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican
Congress, which fairly or unfairly the voters seem to see as extreme, you've heard all the
words. Do you think that's true and does it make you feel repudiated at all?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Charlayne Hunter-Gault to former Senator Howard Baker, 8/14:</I> "You heard Dole is] moderate to
conservative from Senator Lott, but tonight on the NewsHour, Pat Buchanan said most of his views
were consistent, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, and he cited
specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position on illegal immigration. And as you
all know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest extreme of the right wing of the party. How does that
set with you?"

<DD><I>Dan Rather to CBS analyst Kevin Phillips, 8/26:</I> "We said in San Diego, we pointed out, that a
large percentage of the actual delegates on the floor, not people who spoke from the podium,
were members of the quote `religious right.' A very large percentage of these delegates
represent organized labor, but we're not seeing that many union/labor people speak from the
podium itself." Dan Rather to Jesse Jackson, 8/26: "Bill Clinton's been running pretty hard to
the right, so far that some Democrats now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney, 8/29:</I> "Who do you think Bill Clinton is: liberal,
moderate?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Senator Ted Kennedy, 8/29:</I> "A liberal has been defined as a person too
broad-minded to take his own side in an argument. That's never been a problem for our guest in
the booth now, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Thanks for being here. They say Bill
Clinton is the ultimate pragmatist; That he fakes left, runs right, but has really no immovable
core principles of his own. Has that been your experience?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rather:</I> "You know that Senator Dole, Jack Kemp, House Speaker Gingrich say, to the public, Bill
Clinton's posing as a centrist but as soon as he gets elected he's going to be right in there
with Ted Kennedy and they'll be working the same old liberal agenda. True?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I> "Well first of all they want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans
accomplished -- showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican delegates were to the
right of the mainstream...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/26:</I> "What's interesting to me, Peter, is the delegates who clearly are way to
the left even of rank and file Democrats, much less the country, have signed on to a moderate
centrist platform." 
<BR>
<DD><I>Cokie Roberts 8/26:</I> "What the delegates there [Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia delegations] and the
politicians there have been telling me tonight is this convention has got to look very moderate
for their Democrats to win in those states..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I>  " Cuomo and Jackson were supportive of the President, but they preached the
liberal line."
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings, 8/27:</I> "Well, whether this is orchestrated or not, it's almost as if Democrats
here who share many of Mrs. Clinton's liberal views are saying to the Republicans we like you as
they liked Mrs. Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/27:</I> "That's right, which is why I have come to think of her speech as
liberalism lite. This was a speech in the first place aimed at Democrats who do believe in a
much more communal concept of family..."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "Well I think the word Kennedy or Kennedyism to Democrats means tough
liberals. It's a combination that's become very rare these days."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider on Mario Cuomo's speech, 8/27:	</I> "And he had a unique twist on Clinton's move to
the center. Very controversial among liberal Democrats when he said, the President actually
lifted the albatross from the party so that we could better sell our core Democratic
principles."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "You know if this night, this day of the convention, the afternoon,
evening, remembered for anything I think it's two things really. One is Jesse Jackson and Mario
Cuomo early in the evening who were making the liberal case for the reelection for Bill
Clinton."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Broder after Cuomo and Jesse Jackson, 8/27:</I> "Well, they've [Democrats] let the country in
on a big secret, there are still liberals in the Democratic party. In fact this convention hall,
delegates, are filled with liberals. And the Congressional Democratic party is still a liberal
party. But most of the message so far has been, `We've changed, we're new, we're different.'
What you heard tonight was a very old fashioned partisan Democratic message."
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/28:	</I> "The Republicans are now saying, `Just wait. If you
think Bill Clinton's been liberal up until now. Just wait. When he's reelected he's gonna feel
free to move to the left and do all those liberal things that he's really wanted to do all
along.' And you're aware of this debate that's going on about whether it's gonna be Bill Clinton
to the center or Bill Clinton to the left. What do you think?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to Vice President Al Gore, 8/26:</I> "Let me ask you about the state of the Democratic
Party and President Clinton's fortunes particularly. It seems to me that he's doing a lot better
now because the win by the Republicans in 1994 really forced your administration to move much
more swiftly to the center. Is that proposition wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Brokaw, 8/26:</I> "The Vice President was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the
Republicans, we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first place. But since 1994
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by
the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/27:</I> "Tom, I'm down here with Joe Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy, a liberal
legacy. When many Americans look to that podium tonight, they'll say that's a liberal First
Lady. What does she need to say, what ought she say tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to James Carville, 8/29:</I> "Lot of buzz out there about Dick Morris having to leave the
campaign. He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that you had some philosophical
differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean that the door has been opened again for those of
you who believe that the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/29:</I> "Clinton will have something tonight for the more liberal Democrats who are
here and not happy that he signed the welfare reform bill, which they believe is too radical.
He's going to talk about a proposed program to encourage job creation for welfare recipients and
businesses, especially in the inner city."

<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>Democratic convention labeling</B></FONT>
<BR>
<DD><I>Mark Shields, 8/26:</I> "Bill Clinton has another great advantage that Bob Dole didn't have. Bob
Dole had to deal with the most activist wing of his party, which in this case are the cultural
conservatives. He had to appease them, he had to mollify them, he had to best them at some
times. Bill Clinton, because of the fact as we've discussed in the past, is unchallenged and has
been unchallenged for renomination within his own party, that the party has accepted him as the
standard bearer, for the last 12 months has been able to run for the middle, so there is no
faction of the party that he has to spend any time, effort, or energy this week really
mollifying."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to a California delegate, 8/26:</I> "Is the party today more or less liberal than it was then?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 8/27:</I> "So are you saying that though she
[Hillary] may not change the numbers for her husband, that she either helps or hurts in the
intensity of the feeling. That for instance, liberals like the delegates here feel more
enthusiastic about the President because they know she's really a committed liberal?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/27:</I> "There will be other speakers tonight as well, some stars from conventions
past; the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mario Cuomo, two of the, of course, large liberal voices in
this party of diminishing liberal voices, so we have a full night ahead here, Jim."

<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux (D-LA), 8/28:</I> "I'm here with one of the smoothest operators in
the United States Senate. A man who worked very hard to pull President Clinton to the center,
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana. Senator, you said today, that you thought the President went
left in the first two years, not because he is a liberal at heart, but because he wanted the
liberals to like him. Explain what you mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gwen Ifill, 8/28:</I> "Barney Frank certainly is an outspoken liberal, one of the last few standing.
And I'm interested in finding out whether pragmatism has replaced true liberalism at this
convention?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to Clinton/Gore Deputy Manager Ann Lewis, 8/29:</I> "Alright, let's talk briefly
about campaign strategy. As we've heard a million times tonight, Dick Morris was the strategist
that helped Bill Clinton figure out how to move back to the center and so on and it was
controversial as Dee Dee Myers just said, even inside the White House. Do you think that that
course will be maintained, Ann Lewis, with Dick Morris gone?"

<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>Republican convention questions</B></FONT>
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Cokie Roberts to a delegate, 8/13:</I> "Do you disagree with the platform plank on abortion, for
instance, and still you're happy?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings to Pat Buchanan, 8/13:</I> "We all know that tonight is about getting it beyond this
convention hall at home and one of the things that this year's convention wants is a convention
that doesn't look like Houston, in which you set the tone for George Bush's convention. What do
you think about that now?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "Let's talk politics. You come from a political
family. I'm a little confused. Bob Dole says this is the party of inclusion, but Governor Weld,
of Massachusetts, who's pro-choice, is not allowed to speak here, Pat Buchanan is not allowed to
speak here. Why is the party trying to keep its divisions, its different voices out of prime
time?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to Michigan Governor John Engler, 8/13:</I> "Governor, in a state where the economy is
good, you've got five percent unemployment, in the last four years you've created more than
160,000 jobs in that state. How do you sell the notion that the guy in the White House is doing
a bad job with the economy?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Lesley Stahl to Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, 8/14:</I>
"Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on
affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Schieffer to Kay Bailey Hutchison, 8/13:</I> "You had some pretty tough lines in there, I know.
Of course, this Republican crowd really loved it, it really put electricity into the hall
tonight. You talked a lot about Bill Clinton's broken promises. What promise do you think -- I
know Republicans are trying to bring women into the big tent -- what promise has he made or
broken, in your view, that has hurt women the most?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Pat Robertson, 8/13:</I> "Now the main speaker tonight, as was the case for the main
speaker last night, is pro-choice. How mad does that make you?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to Jerry Falwell, 8/12:</I> "Let me ask the candid question. Many of the AIDS activists
would claim that part of the problem they have is the attitude towards AIDS victims among
fundamentalists, among conservatives like yourself. How do you respond to that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff to keynoter Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "Leading up to this convention Bob Dole was
running well behind President Clinton with women voters. We look at the statistics of how many
women delegates. What, 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year.
What sort of signal does that send the country you think?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to the NRA's Wayne LaPierre after address by police officer who was shot, 8/14:</I> "Here we have a policeman who was
shot by weapons that might not have been out there, the critics say, were it not for the NRA?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to New York Governor George Pataki:</I> "Governor, the focus tonight of course is on
the keynote speech and that is by Representative Molinari who it's well known favors abortion
rights. Do you sense a dissatisfaction on this floor that she will be giving this address?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence, who gave speech about victims' rights, 8/13:</I> "Do you
think -- this is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated by men as
well, and I don't mean that in a pejorative sense. I mean it's just an objective reality here.
Do you think before tonight they thought very much about what happens in America with rape,
which is a terrible epidemic that we're suffering in this country?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to a delegate, 8/13:</I> "Many moderate Republican women are actually considering
voting for the Democratic ticket because they look at this platform, they look at this party,
and they don't see anything they can embrace. Why should you tell them to stay?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator Olympia Snowe, 8/13:</I> "There are those who talk about their party believing
in tolerance and diversity, yet that in the reality the policies just don't reflect that, what's
your quick response?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Jan Licence, rape victim, after her speech on victim's rights, 8/13:</I> "But why
[speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that they don't think this
ticket, or perhaps this party, is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to U.S. Rep. John Boehner, 8/13:</I> "But do you think this convention in part has
been designed and stage managed as we're seeing, to soften the ideological edge that many voters
thought was either, too harsh about the Republican Congress?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to Virginia Governor George Allen, 8/13:</I> "Governor, are you not at all concerned
about what happens to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most of the
delegates at this convention, based on the polling that we've done, if Bob Dole is able to put
into effect his 15 percent tax cut?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Brokaw to Allen:</I> "But if you say to your constituents in the state of Virginia, ` Listen, we're
going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but I can't touch 60 percent of the budget that we're
dealing with here,' and that's the reality that's facing Bob Dole because of Medicare and
defense spending and other things, do you think that we can get home-free here in seven years
and balance the budget?"
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="dem questions">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>Democratic convention questions</B></FONT>
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, interviewing Representative Charles Rangel, 8/26:</I> "Charles Rangel of New York
will be the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee should the Democrats retake the
Congress. Congressman, it used to be said that when the Democrats make a firing squad they form
a circle, they love to rebel against an incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and
the move to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the country, why is the
dog not barking in the night? Why are you staying with the President given that discontent?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen interviewing Lynn Cutler, 8/26:</I> "I'm here with Lynn Cutler, whom many people who
follow in politics probably remember as the former vice chairman of the Democratic National
Committee from Iowa. She told me earlier when I was asking about concerns the President has
abandoned the liberal wing of the party that she is comparing her candidate not to perfection
but to Bob Dole. Isn't that right, Lynn, do the liberals in the party as you unashamedly
describe yourself feel abandoned by the President this year?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right: </B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings to Senator Christopher Dodd, 8/26:</I> "Lesson learned clearly in San Diego. When you
yourself were at the Republican Convention you accused that party of not being representative of
the mainstream of Republicans in the country. You're not much mainstream here either, are
you?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to Tom Hayden, 8/26:</I> "Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election, they've given up their principles.
Your response to that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rita Braver to Geraldine Ferraro, 8/27:</I> "That's right, Dan, and there have been times that you
could actually feel the floor shaking with all the cheering here [in response to Hillary
Clinton's speech]. Mrs. Ferraro, why was there such a huge reception for the first lady? Is it
because she's been such an object of attack?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, 8/27:</I> "Do you think it's going to be difficult [to mobilize
Democrats] given the positions he's taken, particularly on welfare, to get some people out?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rita Braver to a Minnesota delegate, 8/28:</I> "Now that you've had some time to be here at the
convention, have your reservations gone away? How'd this speech cut through to you? You've been
worried about welfare."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums, 8/29:</I> "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President
signed the welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a budget cut. What
does he have to do to fix it?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bradley to Dellums:</I> "When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to propose a
$3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that enough?" 
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Hillary Clinton, 8/27:</I> "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these
bitter attacks against you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/25:</I> "How can you do that when the leader of your party has
vetoed a welfare bill that many people in this hall feel he should have signed? I mean signed
which he should have vetoed. But politically he had no recourse."
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Mario Cuomo, 8/27:</I> "But on this issue of welfare reform which maybe, even if
Bill Clinton is reelected over eight years the most significant decision he makes. He signs this
welfare reform legislation into law. Could have this enormous, from your perspective, negative
impact on a million children could go into poverty. How do you rationalize that kind of decision
and now come forward and give this rousing endorsement for Bill Clinton to be reelected?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right: </B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Candy Crowley to a delegate, 8/28:</I> "Do you think that the teacher's unions have done enough to
change schools?  What I'm wondering is, the point from the Republicans is that the schools, most
everyone agreed, need help. Why not get some parent involvement in there through school
vouchers? Let people pick schools. Are you against that idea?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney, 8/28:</I> "Many of your members are Republicans. How do
you explain to them that you're using, in effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to former Texas Governor Ann Richards, 8/27:</I> "You paid the price to some degree. You
lost the governership of Texas because this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it,
about the role of women in American politics?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Hillary Clinton after her speech, 8/27:</I> "You are credited with really
redefining the role of First Lady and for doing that you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wish you'd redefined it a little less?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "You talked a lot tonight about It Takes A Village, your book. And as you well know,
that was a lightning rod for criticism at the Republican convention. Kay Bailey Hutchison took
off on it, Bob Dole took off on it. How did that affect you when you heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the Right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom to James Carville about Hillary Clinton's speech, 8/27:</I> "I was struck by the fact
that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the
unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago.
Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Elizabeth Farnsworth to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, 8/26:</I> "We're looking
tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are. Did the President turn his back on
fundamental Democratic principles when he signed the welfare bill?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Farnsworth to Ickes:</I> "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing the welfare bill is unraveling
the safety net that took so long to put together?" Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala,
8/26: "If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't
many jobs for people who have real skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the
next two years?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Georgia Governor Zell Miller, 8/27:</I> "We were just hearing Tim Russert talk
about the platform. A lot of the delegates here don't feel that the platform reflects the
Democratic Party that they joined five, ten years ago. Why are they wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But how concerned are you about the divisions, that people would say tension, this
isn't reflective, the Democratic Party sold out, it's a, it's a Republican Party with a
different name?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But when you get out and you walk this floor of this convention center, do people come
up to you and say, `I am really angry about welfare reform, this is not what the Democratic
Party is about.'"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux, 8/28:</I> "Doesn't that [Clinton moving to center] reinforce
claims of the President's critics who say that he is a man without many deep convictions, who in
fact is guided by the need to be liked, and by a burning desire to get re-elected?"

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<CENTER><h2>Media Research
Center History</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<dd>Founded by <a href="/mrc/about/bozelbio.html">L. Brent Bozell III</a> in 1987 with a mission
to bring political balance to the nation's news and entertainment
media, the Media Research Center has become the nation's largest
and most respected conservative media watchdog organization.<BR>

<P>
<dd>With the most sophisticated computerized tape archive
(over 115,000 hours of footage) and database of its kind in the
world, the MRC tracks and analyzes virtually everything in the
national media. Every day teams of MRC analysts input into a custom
designed computerized database everything the leftist press is
saying. And then confront liberals in the press directly with
evidence of their slanted reporting.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <A HREF="/mrc/news/"><B>News Division</B></A> publishes two newsletters,
<I><B><A HREF="/mrc/mediawatch/">MediaWatch</A></B></I> and <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/nq/">Notable Quotables</A></B></I>,
which document the leftist bias in the news media every month.
At a national press conference on June 5th in Washington, D.C.,
the MRC formally launched <B><A HREF="/mrc/reality/">&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot;</A></B>a $2.78
million campaign that represents the most ambitious, comprehensive,
and technologically advanced effort ever undertaken to neutralize
the left-wing news media. And the MRC's new book <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/bookstore/">Pattern of
Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</A></B></I>
is a result of four years of research and analysis.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/">Entertainment Division</A></B> exposes the left-wing
agenda in the entertainment media.  In 1995, it opened
an office -- the <B><A HREF="/mrc/ptc/">Parents Television Council</A></B> (PTC) -- right
in the heart of Hollywood. Its two missions are to bring family
programming back to television and to identify, recruit, and mobilize
the emerging conservative movement in Hollywood. In early February,
the MRC held a bipartisan press conference featuring Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Seventy-four
lawmakers also signed a letter calling for a return to the <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/famstuff.html">Family
Hour</A></B> which would enable parents and their children to
share in quality programming.<BR>

<P>
<dd><B><A HREF="/mrc/freemarket/">The Free Market Project (FMP)</A></B>
is another division of the MRC and works to educate the media
on what they know so little about -- the free market system. FMP
publishes a monthly newsletter, <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/medianomics/">MediaNomics</A></B></I>, as well as other books, monographs, and <A HREF="/mrc/news/sreport.html"><B> Special Reports </B></A>.
FMP also hosts <B>Quarterly Breakfast Forums</B> which bring together
conservative public policy makers and the media. The goal is to
teach the media to report more accurately conservative positions
on key economic and business issues.<BR>

<P>
<dd>MRC spokesmen challenge reporters with evidence of
liberal bias regularly on television programs like NBC's <I>Today</I>; CNN's <I>Crossfire</I> and <I>Reliable Sources</I>;
CNBC; and NET programs.  MRC research is used by every major national
(and local) conservative talk show host, like Rush Limbaugh, G.
Gordon Liddy, Ollie North, Paul Harvey, Mark Rosen, and dozens
of others.  The MRC produces a nationally-syndicated newspaper column
and articles for the top newspapers in America, including
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the
<I>Washington Times</I>, the <I>New York Post</I>, the <I>L.A.
Times</I> and many others.<BR>

<P>
<dd>In 1992, the MRC founded the <a href="/mrc/about/internad.html">
<B>Montgomery Internship
Program</B></a>, with the purpose of helping young conservatives in
their pursuit to bring balance to journalism.<BR>

born again in Jesus Christ. Everybody left behind will basically
go to Hell, but not before experiencing Armageddon, which is a
really bad end of the world. If you find yourself in this
situation, there isn't much you can do except one, starve
yourself, and two, get your head cut off. This loving Christmas
message coming as it did amid the jingle of the mall Santa and
the twinkling manger at the corner of Canal and the Ramparts made
it clear that the Rapture is indeed necessary. The evaporation of

<P>
<center>December 18, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 26)</center>
<P>
<br><P>
Welcome to the Media Research Center's annual awards issue, a 
compilation of the most outrageous and/or humorous news media 
quotes from 1995. To determine this year's winners, a panel of 57 
talk show hosts, magazine editors, columnists, editorial writers 
and media observers each selected their choices for the first, 
second and third best quote from six to ten quotes in each 
category. First place selections were awarded three points, second 
place choices two points, with one point for the third place 
selections. A list of the judges appears on the back page. (This 
issue covers quotes from December 1994 through Nov. 1995.)
The first quote under each award heading is the winner, followed 
in order by the top runners-up.

<center><h3>The Contract's Not Done Until Every Child Is Dead Award</h3></center>
<P>
"When you look at the reality of cutting people off, of saying you 
can't have more benefits if you have children while you are on 
welfare, you're talking about putting children on the street who 
are hungry and naked, and that's a sin." -- Washington Post writer 
Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang, March 25.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Public antagonism toward government has been one of the principal 
themes of American political discourse for nearly two decades, 
growing in shrillness in the past year. This sentiment has been 
voiced and amplified by the new Republican House, which just this 
month completed its 100 days of action, much of it aimed at paring 
back the growth of the federal government. But now that an attack 
on a government building has left scores dead, including children, 
the allure is coming off the anti-government rhetoric." -- Boston 
Globe Washington Bureau Chief David Shribman in a front page "news 
analysis," April 25.
<P>
"The new Republican majority in Congress took a big step today on 
its legislative agenda to demolish or damage government aid 
programs, many of them designed to help children and the poor." -- 
Dan Rather, March 16 CBS Evening News.
<P>
"This is some of the greatest redistribution of income I've ever 
seen, from have-nots to the haves...This is enough to put Robin 
Hood to shame." -- Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt on CNN's Capital 
Gang, March 18.
<P>
"The Republican Congress, of course, is not likely to embrace 
raising taxes and cutting defense spending. It is beholden to 
three constituencies: The corporations, whose lobbyists finance 
politicians and then finagle billions in bizarre subsidies for 
clients. The rich, who write campaign checks and simply ask to be 
left alone. And many hard-working, middle-class men and women -- 
mostly white -- who resent handouts to the needy....About the best 
[the Democrats] can do is temper excesses of Republican plans -- 
excesses that could lead to class warfare or race warfare, 
excesses that will widen the already widening gap between rich and 
poor." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA 
Today column, May 30.
<P>
"In practice, personally, I think it will destroy the future 
competitiveness and security of the country, in terms of 
education, infrastructure, and medical practice as we know it 
today." -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on the GOP budget proposal, 
May 13 Inside Washington.
<P><br><p>
<center><H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3></center>
<P>
"These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make 
black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and 
Jesse the crank -- Helms, that is, not Jackson. But the scariest 
of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since 
George Bush chose him to fill the `black seat' vacated by Thurgood 
Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive 
advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. 
The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the 
kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate." 
-- Time National Correspondent Jack E. White in a June 26 column 
"Uncle Tom Justice."
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Even your sister concedes, although some supporters might like 
what you have to say about the economy and these very specific 
issues you just mentioned, they're very turned off by some of your 
social policies. And you know you've got political enemies out 
there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and 
some even go as far as saying that your social stands are 
reminiscent of Nazi Germany. How are you to win them over?" -- CBS 
This Morning co-host Paula Zahn to Pat Buchanan, July 5.
<P>
"Its story line could be a Republican parable about 1995 America: 
A marvelous vessel loses its power and speeds toward extinction, 
until it's saved by a team of heroic white men. I can imagine the 
political commercials in which Hanks morphs into Phil Gramm. 
Although the movie's publicity trumpets its historical accuracy, 
the movie itself celebrates the paradisiacal America invoked by 
Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan -- an America where men were men, 
women were subservient, and people of color kept out of the damn 
way." -- John Powers writing about Apollo 13 in The Washington 
Post Arts section, July 9.
<P>
"Unless Gingrich and Dole and the Republicans say `Am I inflaming 
a bunch of nuts?', you know we're going to have some more events. 
I am absolutely certain the harsher rhetoric of the Gingriches and 
the Doles...creates a climate of violence in America." -- 
Columnist Carl Rowan, April 25 Washington Post story.
<P>
"The conservatives' agenda, if it goes through, is going to 
depress the quality of cultural and educational life for everyone 
in America, young and old, black, brown, male or female. This is 
one of the most ill-conceived, profoundly anti-democratic ideas 
ever to get loose in Congress. Private philanthropy will never be 
able to restore what seems about to be taken away. Some will not 
notice it; others won't care; given the shortness of American 
social memory, perhaps the next generation won't know what 
happened. Partial lobotomies work that way. They favor Beavis and 
Butt-head. Is that the business of American government?" -- Time 
art critic Robert Hughes, concluding August 7 story on plans to 
cut NEA and NEH funding.
<p><br><P>
<center><h3>Republicans Make Us Sick Award (for Irrational Fear of Less Regulation)</h3></center>
<P>
"Next week on ABC's World News Tonight, a series of reports about 
our environment which will tell you precisely what the new 
Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment 
in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?" -- Peter Jennings in 
an ABC promo during the July 9 This Week with David Brinkley.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"This is deregulation madness! We're gonna have dirty water, dirty 
air. OSHA regulations are being rolled back. There's gonna be no 
competition in the telecommunications industry. And between local 
cable and local phone, there's not gonna be competition at the 
present time. It's gonna take awhile and there's gonna be no 
regulation in the meantime. And so no, he [Clinton] can't go along 
with this. And the people, the public isn't going to go along with 
this. They don't want E. coli bacteria in their drinking water." 
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, August 5 CNN's Capital Gang.
<P>
"Safe food, safe water, safe air, safe transportation. You have 
this protection now, but you might be about to lose it. Why? Watch 
a special In Depth report on NBC Nightly News tomorrow." -- July 
17 NBC promo.
<P>
"There will be change, but most hope the original intent of the 
law will not be lost. Because if the plants and animals can't 
survive, what future is there for the human species?" -- NBC 
reporter Roger O'Neil concluding a story on proposed changes to 
the Endangered Species Act, July 28 Nightly News.
<P>
Afraid of the Competition Award (for Impugning Talk Radio)
"Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to 
the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usually robust, 
sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left 
with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for 
information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may 
be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful 
listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." -- Marvin Kalb, 
former CBS and NBC reporter and current Director of the Center on 
Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, reviewing three 
books on talk radio, May 21 Washington Post.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Some people are very concerned about talk shows, radio talk shows 
in general, of course. Most of them around the country have a 
decidedly conservative bent. The rap that some people give them is 
that they reflect the views of a very vocal minority, the 
extremists in this country, and don't really reflect the true 
nature of political debate in the United States. And, as a matter 
of fact, they tend to be quite divisive and sort of have a bad, a 
negative impact on the country." -- Katie Couric to Oliver North, 
March 13 Today.
<P>
"The issue is whether what's going out over the airwaves here and 
elsewhere is fanning the flames, is making the situation worse, 
that talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run 
amok." -- NBC reporter Bob Faw concluding a January 3 Nightly News 
story.
<P><br><P>
<center><h3>Purveyors of Hate and Division Award (for Post-Oklahoma Talk Radio 
Bashing)</h3></center>
<P>
"In a nation that has entertained and appalled itself for years 
with hot talk on the radio and the campaign trail, the inflamed 
rhetoric of the '90s is suddenly an unindicted co-conspirator in 
the blast." -- Time Senior Writer Richard Lacayo, May 8 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runner-up</H4>
<P>
"The bombing in Oklahoma City has focused renewed attention on the 
rhetoric that's been coming from the right and those who cater to 
angry white men. While no one's suggesting right-wing radio jocks 
approve of violence, the extent to which their approach fosters 
violence is being questioned by many observers, including the 
President....Right-wing talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Bob 
Grant, Oliver North, G. Gordon Liddy, Michael Reagan, and others 
take to the air every day with basically the same format: detail a 
problem, blame the government or a group, and invite invective 
from like-minded people. Never do most of the radio hosts 
encourage outright violence, but the extent to which their 
attitudes may embolden and encourage some extremists has clearly 
become an issue." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, April 25.
<P><br><p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes 
a Cut)</h3></center>
<P>
"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved 
federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion 
more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and 
the poor, to pay for that `pouting sex kitten' mistress of their 
dreams -- tax cuts." -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer 
Gerald Parshall, March 27 story.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"When NBC Nightly News continues: in Washington, if they cut food 
stamps, who doesn't eat?" -- Tom Brokaw, March 22.
<P>
"The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have 
advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show 
an elderly person in a hospital bed, ringing for a nurse who 
doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be." -- 
Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, September 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
"March madness has begun on Capitol Hill, and almost as 
predictable as a B horror film, the slashing has begun. House 
Republicans have made a small down payment on their plan to make 
massive budget cuts." -- CNN anchor Judy Woodruff on Inside 
Politics, March 16.
<p><br><P>
<center><h3>The Embodiment of All Evil Award (for Newt-Bashing)</h3></center>
<P>
"The election returns start with a stark fact so disturbing that 
no one in the media wants to state it plainly: The U.S. House of 
Representatives is now to be led by a world-class demagogue, a 
talented reactionary in the vengeful tradition Gov. George Wallace 
and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Like Wallace before him, Newt Gingrich 
evokes the nation's boiling anxieties as a rancid populism of `us 
vs. them,' though he is too shrewd to make the racial resentments 
explicit. Like Joe McCarthy, Gingrich depicts his adversaries not 
simply as mistaken in their political views but as sick, 
traitorous people who are invidiously subverting the national 
character....We shall soon find out if there is a kinder, gentler 
Newt lurking beneath the rock. Somehow I doubt it. His hatred 
seems to be from the heart." -- William Greider, past producer of 
PBS Frontline shows and former Washington Post Assistant Managing 
Editor, in the December 29, 1994-January, 12, 1995 Rolling Stone.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Newtie has gone too far. When you take food out of the mouths of 
babes and claim it is in their best interests, as Gingrich did in 
defending his Draconian budget cuts, you cross the line from mere 
heartlessness to dangerous demagoguery. It is one thing to play 
the mean-spirited reactionary, gutting one social program after 
another while pandering to the greed of the more affluent voter. 
That is a morally wrong but logically consistent position. Taking 
$500 from a child on welfare and giving it to one whose parents 
earn more than $200,000 a year is a loathsome but defensible 
position to advocates of a social Darwinism that holds that only 
the strong deserve to live." -- Former Los Angeles Times reporter 
Robert Scheer, May 16 Times column.
<P>
"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one 
scary white man....One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his 
speech to Congress last week....That could mean Gingrich is 
serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, 
blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the wilder 
impulses of one very scary white man." -- Time National 
Correspondent Jack E. White, January 16.
<P>
"You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, `trickle-down 
terrorists who base their agenda on division, exclusion, and 
fear.' Do you think middle class Americans are in need of 
protection from that group?" -- Bryant Gumbel to House Minority 
Leader Richard Gephardt, January 4 Today.
<p><br><P>
<center><H3>Good Morning Morons Award</H3></center>
<P>
"Janet Reno has asked for an independent counsel to investigate 
charges against HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros. Commerce Secretary 
Ron Brown is being investigated. Questions have been raised about 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy resigned under pressure, as did Surgeon General Joycelyn 
Elders. The Clinton White House seems to be having a hard time 
retaining high-profile minorities particularly. Do you think, 
Senator, they are being held to a higher standard in Washington 
than their white predecessors?" -- Bryant Gumbel to Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, March 15 Today.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"He has hope of staying out [of a gang] as long as he has a 
basketball in his hands....Without the basketball this kid is 
running drugs, carrying a gun and soon to kill somebody. And 
that's true in place after place. Now we get to decide: Do you 
want a basketball in his hands, to continue trying to convince him 
to stay out of a gang, or do you want to face him in a dark street 
some night with a nine-millimeter Glock in his hands?" -- Dan 
Rather on the January 26 CBS This Morning promoting their prime 
time special on youth violence In the Killing Fields of America.
<P>
"President Clinton will be attending more ceremonies in Hawaii 
marking V-J Day, Victory over Japan. Saturday, Mr. Clinton went to 
a ceremony on a hill high above Honolulu. He praised those who 
served in the military 50 years ago, saying they saved the world. 
After today's ceremonies marking the end of World War II, 
President Clinton will head back to the United States." -- NBC 
anchor Giselle Fernandez, September 3 Today. Hawaii became a state 
in 1959.
<P>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is 
still being treated as if he were guilty." -- Bryant Gumbel, 
October 16 Today.
<p><br><P>
<center><H3>I Still Hate Reagan Award</H3></center>
<P>
Thomas Friedman, New York Times reporter and columnist: "Governor, 
I'm kind of a foreign policy wonk, and it scares the bejesus out 
of me to have someone as President of the United States, 
Commander-in-Chief, and finger on the nuclear button who is such 
an outsider to Washington and American foreign policy."
<P>
Lamar Alexander: "Well, did Ronald Reagan scare you, Tom?"
Friedman: "He sure did."
Alexander: "Did he? He didn't scare me. I thought he was the best 
national defense and Commander-in-Chief and foreign policy 
President we've had since Eisenhower."
Friedman: "Ask 245 Marines in Beirut about that." -- Exchange on 
CBS's Face the Nation, March 5.
<P>
<H4>Runner-up</H4>
<P>
"How much did Reagan fool the American people and how much did he 
simply play into their wishes? Were they misled by the nature of 
his campaigning or were they led into ways they wanted to go? Was 
Reagan sort of a modern Pied Piper? It's my instinct about it that 
he very successfully delayed the apprehension of reality by this 
country for about a decade. He made people feel that things were 
better than they were, that the external dangers were greater than 
they were." -- PBS anchor Robert MacNeil in the 1995 Liz 
Cunningham book Talking Politics: Choosing the President in the 
Television Age. 
<P>

"Despite her soaring popularity and role as queen of the 
Democratic Party, she was ousted from office in the nation's sweep 
to the right. Today more than half a year since her surprising 
defeat, she remains as popular as ever....Six months after her 
defeat, the light of this Lone Star legend doesn't seem to have 
dimmed one bit." -- NBC weekend Today co-host Giselle Fernandez in 
a June 18 profile of former Texas Governor Ann Richards who was so 
popular that she lost her re-election bid.

"A lot has been written about you in the last couple of weeks. 
Much of it has a sense that Mario Cuomo is a man full of promise 
and now that your 12 years in Albany is done, much of that promise

promise that you may have been able to deliver to people, your 
eloquence, your intelligence, that did not translate, for lack of 
a better term, into dynamic governance?....How are you going to 
use this? Are you, will you continue to use this passion, will you 
continue to use this eloquence? Some people have suggested you

"It's one of the great political myths, about press bias. Most 
reporters are interested in a story. Most reporters don't know 
whether they're Republican or Democrat, and vote every which way. 
Now, a lot of politicians would like you to believe otherwise, but 
that's the truth of the matter. I've worked around journalism all 
of my life, Tom Snyder has as well, and I think he'll agree with 
this, that most reporters, when you get to know them, would fall 
in the general category of kind of common-sense moderates. And 
also, let me say that I don't think that `liberal' or 
`conservative' means very much any more, except to those kind of 
inside-the-Beltway people who want to use it for their own 
partisan political advantage. I don't think it holds up." -- Dan

"The Republican jihad against the poor, the young and the helpless 
rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no 
budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of 
Congress at the beginning of the year and has spent all its time 
since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and 
compassion in government....If anything is funny in this dismal 
period, it's that the Republicans are touchy about being called 
heartless and cold. That's a riot. Has anyone listened to Newt 
Gingrich lately? To Dick Armey? To Phil Gramm? This is the coldest 
crew to come down the pike since the Ice Age." -- Former NBC News

conscience, General Powell could serve as the standard-bearer of a 
party that is waging all-out war against the poor and racial and 
ethnic minorities (and which is hostile to the interests of the 
middle class as well)....For years, the insidious and blatantly

"So perhaps the weekend of World War II commemoration was somewhat 
of an epiphany for Clinton, and for the nation. Maybe the 50th 
anniversary of the end of World War II was a time when he came to 
the realization that his reluctance to answer his country's call 
was a mistake, and those who answered without a second thought 
forgave him. How else do we explain aging World War II veterans,

"In the post-Oklahoma City debate over the links between violent 
rhetoric and violent action, some social critics have begun 
looking beyond talk radio, focusing instead on the metaphors and 
imagery that have helped to define America from the earliest days 
of the Republic. What they conclude is that the disturbed and 
disgruntled -- who have already made up their minds to kill or 
terrorize -- can lean on a slew of cultural icons to legitimize 
their feelings of aggression. After all, these theorists say, the 
United States is a nation founded in rebellion and riddled with 
mottos, slogans and images grounded in battle and aggression. 
`Live free or die,' says the New Hampshire license plate. `With 
the sword we seek peace, but under liberty,' goes the less-known 
Massachusetts state motto. And what schoolchild cannot recite 
Patrick Henry's stirring words, `Give me liberty or give me 
death'? Whether consciously or not, a growing number of academics 
say, some homegrown terrorists and killers may warm themselves in 
the rhetorical glow of the rocket's red glare." -- Boston Globe

rose in defense of a comparatively tiny $800,000. But the cause 
was apparently dear to him, preserving endangered 
animals....Humans, however, didn't fare that well: funding for the

category. First place selections were awarded three points, second 
place choices two points, with one point for the third place 
selections. A list of the judges appears on the back page. (This

"Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any 
two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: 
the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming. It's clear 
that the anger controls the child and not the other way around. 
It's the job of the parent to teach the child to control the anger 
and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of 
uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum 
last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: 
the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." -- ABC World

service. Unlike Barbara Bush, she got involved. She has taken 
stands. She has been a leader. It's too bad, of course, that there 
is not health care legislation this year, but that is Congress' 
failure, not Hillary Clinton's. Her role has been a success. She 
awakened the nation. She educated the nation. She enlightened the 
nation....For when a nation gets two leaders for the price of one

twice as many problems, find twice as many solutions, make twice 
as much progress." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in

"Bill Clinton evoked sympathy and understanding by acknowledging 
marital problems on the famous 60 Minutes interview. His wife is 
too dignified for confessionals, but she could benefit from 
admitting that she, too, has occasionally yielded to temptation 
and made the wrong choices. The public might even be tickled to 
discover that the prim and preachy First Lady has a gambler's 
streak. Hillary's brief fling in commodities was possibly 
reckless, but it shows a glimmering of a more credible, if more 
flawed, human being." -- Eleanor Clift and Mark Miller, April 11

"There is a lot of gleeful sexist reaction to her difficulties, a 
lot of piling on, a lot of men who never stood up for a woman's 
right to do anything who would be completely content to have her

way, and are simply terrorized by the thought that she may have 
real, formal, out-front power." -- NPR's Nina Totenberg on Inside

"The American Spectator broke the story, as Gwen mentioned, 
because they're a very right-wing ideological publication....What 
really happened was there was a conspiracy, in my opinion, by 
right-wingers, including some right-wing journalists, to press 
this newspaper [the Los Angeles Times] into running this story 
before it was ready to, trying to get it out, and so they spread 
the rumor all around town that I had threatened to resign if it 
did run...I know one of the guys who was spreading it: Brit Hume 
of ABC, who covers the White House, who writes for The American 
Spectator. I know there's another conservative journalist who 
covers the White House, Fred Barnes, who's on the editorial board 
of The American Spectator...So they were all promoting this

"She [Hillary] is really convinced that the right wing is 
incredibly well-organized, and there is kind of a hate campaign 
going on in this country that is, is deeply and well-organized,

personally. And I mean, she may be right." -- Newsweek Washington 
Bureau Chief Evan Thomas on Inside Washington, August 13.

"Some of us were called in by Caspar Weinberger, when he was the 
Secretary of Defense. This was after Grenada, after the Grenada 
invasion, which again was not covered. We don't know the full 
story today. No reporters got in for three days. I don't know 
whether we really found a warehouse full of AK-47s there or not. 
Maybe we planted them there. I'm not saying we did, but we had 
three days to do it if we wanted to because we had no reporters 
get there at the beginning." -- Walter Cronkite on CNBC's Dick 
Cavett, March 4.

House in those days, and my work -- which consisted of reporting 
on President Reagan's success in making life harder for citizens 
who were not born rich, white, and healthy -- saddened me....My 
parents raised me to admire generosity and to feel pity. I had

"America is cheering [for Forrest Gump]. Much as it cheered Ronald 
Reagan, who more than Schweik or Candide, is the real proto-Gump. 
Reagan too was relentlessly upbeat. Reagan too was extraordinarily 
lucky. And his luck, like Gump's, was often built on the backs of 
people who suffered off-screen. Forrest had bankrupt shrimpers, 
martyred Vietnam buddies, and his wife, whose death was remarkably 
demure, considering her ailment. Reagan scored points off 
America's poor; somehow managed to cloak himself in heroism while 
apologizing for a needless screw-up that killed 241 servicemen in 
Beirut; and avoided tarnishing his reputation for optimism by 
spending too much time on AIDS." -- Essay by Time Associate Editor

whether people are being shot every day on the streets of America? 
If that's liberal, so be it. I think it's everything that's good

there's a precedent. In 1895 [Elizabeth Cady] Stanton finally 
published a book she had been planning for many years: a roaring 
attack on the Bible for its misogyny. The book was a best seller, 
the horrified suffrage association voted to censure her and to 
Stanton's pleasure, `the clergy jumped around...like parched peas

"Everyone is applauding, I think, in the health care community, 
the emphasis on universal access, because they know that unless 
they're going to let some people just die in the streets, it makes 
sense to get medical care early, when it's going to be more 
effective and less costly....the insurance companies are the focal

"Most of the riders saw themselves as missionaries spreading the 
word about how the current health care system had failed them. 
Some were Republican, others Democrat; some were against abortion, 
others supported abortion rights. Most said they were not

covered by health insurance. In their view, the Health Security 
Express was a nonpartisan effort to persuade Congress to pass 
legislation that provides universal coverage." -- Washington Post

August 9. 
<P>
Reporter Tom Pettit: "Of all of the states, Hawaii has the most 
coverage, the closest thing to universal coverage, which the 
President has made the centerpiece of his health plan. Since 1974, 
twenty years ago, Hawaii has required employers to insure their 
workers and the state to cover the unemployed."

"Well, it may seem the sheerest act of heresy to say so, but far 
from being pathologically dishonest, Bill Clinton has been more 
faithful to his word than any other chief executive in recent 
memory. He may have skirted the truth about the draft, Gennifer 
Flowers, Paula Jones, and so on. But Clinton has kept his contract 
with voters. On policy issues, he has done almost exactly what he 
said he was going to do, despite setbacks and enormous obstacles. 
And by so doing, he has made himself an excellent President." --

"In less than two years, Bill Clinton had already achieved more

it's Clinton who has had the most legislative success of any 
President since Lyndon Johnson. Inhale that one....The standard 
for measuring results domestically should not be the coherence of 
the process but how actual lives are touched and changed. By that 
standard, he's doing well." -- Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan 
Alter, October 3 magazine story.

Host Tina Gulland: "Are we agreed generally that it was a plus 
week for Clinton in the sense that he was viewed as presidential 
and in charge of foreign policy?"
ABC and National Public Radio reporter Nina Totenberg: "He was 
there in the middle of the desert. I mean, it was biblical!" -- 
Exchange on Inside Washington about Clinton's Middle East trip, 
October 29.

"Around the country, President Clinton is routinely trashed by 
conservative talk-show hosts and Repub- lican candidates for being 
the most liberal President in modern times...But based on the 
measures that Mr. Clinton succeeded in getting through Congress in 
his first two years, he looks like Mainstream Bill....The Clinton 
record is surprisingly pro-business and centrist." -- Wall Street 
Journal reporter Jeffrey Birnbaum, October 7.

"The first time I shot somebody, it felt, God, it felt great. I 
mean, years later, I read this like, magazine, and it likened the 
feeling to ejaculation, or orgasm, and I thought about it, and it 
really was....When John Wayne shoots somebody, he rides off into 
the sunset. Why can't I, you know? Young people don't make the 
logical connections that adults assume they make about those kinds 
of things. That's why you've got to get rid of the guns." --

"One standard conservative argument against antipoverty policies 
is their cost: taxes burden the affluent and thus, by lowering 
work incentive, reduce economic output. But if one goal of the 
policy is to bolster monogamy, then making the affluent less so 
would help. Monogamy is threatened not just by poverty in an 
absolute sense but also by the relative wealth of the rich. This 
is what lures a young woman to a wealthy married or formerly 
married man. It is also what makes the man who attracts her feel 
too good for just one wife. As for the economic consequences, the 
costs of soaking the rich might well be outweighed by the 
benefits, financial and otherwise, of more stable marriages, fewer 
divorces, fewer abused children and less loneliness and 
depression." -- From August 15 Time cover story on infidelity, by 
New Republic Senior Editor Robert Wright.

"Programs designed to aid inner city youths...are not 
pork....`Pork!' scream the demagogues. `Give us the death 
penalty!' The next time you or a loved one find yourself trapped 
in the nightmare of a violent crime, ask yourself if it wouldn't 
have been better for the `perp' to have been off playing 
basketball somewhere. You may find yourself suddenly in favor of 
even an imperfect attempt at prevention." -- New York Times

"To his fans, David Brock, the writer who ruined the Clintons' 
Christmas, is a hard-hitting investigative reporter. To everyone 
else, he is a smear artist with a right-wing agenda. But a reading 
of Mr. Brock's oeuvre in the conservative journal The American 
Spectator suggests that his motives are at least as twisted as his 
facts. It's women, not liberals, who really get him going. The 
slightest sighting of female sexuality whips him into a frenzy of 
misogynist zeal. All women are the same to Mr. Brock: terrifying, 
gutter-tongued sexual omnivores." -- New York Times columnist (and 
former theater critic) Frank Rich, January 6.

"There is very little in the press accounts to suggest that he is, 
above all, a sophisticated propagandist, an avatar of the politics 
of meanness and envy....Limbaugh is defending the successful 
against the impudent demands of the poor; by making all that 
funny, he gives the comfortable a way to think that greed and a 
cold-hearted wit comprise a cohesive ideology....his style is pure 
demagoguery. Just as Reagan talked of welfare queens in Cadillacs, 
Limbaugh seizes on the absurd detail, gives it an absurdist twist 
of his own, and sends it out into the world under the guise of 
analysis and principle....
It is not enough for him to oppose liberalism. He must, like all 
demagogues, scare his listeners, get them to believe in 
conspiracy, rumor....Like Reagan, Limbaugh is neither curious nor 
brave; he would rather tell his audiences fairy tales than have 
them face the world; he would rather sneer at the weak than 
trouble the strong." -- Former Washington Post reporter David 
Remnick in the Post's Outlook section, February 20.
<P>
"Why does anyone take Rush Limbaugh seriously?....He's 
entertaining. But, come on, he is to truthfulness as President 
Clinton is to faithfulness -- he has but a passing acquaintance 
with it. He's toying with you, folks, getting you all riled up 
with a stew of half-truths and non-truths. He's making fools of 
you, feeding you swill -- and you're taking it in....So keep 
listening if you want. But just remember that he's a charlatan."

column, July 12.

"One of my losers of the year is David Brock, who wrote that slimy

While she provided little new information on the tangled Arkansas

was her attitude and her poise." -- Time reporter Michael Duffy,

"She's been re-zoned back into the stratosphere. And when you 
watch that [commodities press conference], you just wonder why 
they waited so long. She's at least as good a communicator as her 
husband, and people have said about Clinton, `If you've got Elvis 
let him sing.' Well, I don't know what the analogy is, this was 
Streisand...For anybody except the Whitewater fanatics, this was 
an A-double-plus in both categories [style and substance]." -- 
Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on The McLaughlin Group, April 23.

"But Whitewater so far is a parody of a political scandal, full of 
sound and fury, signifying next to nothing. If it walks like a

"Gays and lesbians are beaten to death in the streets with 
increasing frequency -- in part due to irrational fear of AIDS but 
also because hatemongers, from comedians to the worst of the 
Christian right, send the message that homosexuals have no value 
in our society. Sometimes that message has a major-party 
affiliation and a request for a campaign contribution. In the 
post-cold war era, gays have been drafted to replace communists as 
the new menace to the American Way: We're told gays corrupt youth 
and commandeer art and entertainment to win converts." -- Dan

"Life has become so much worse for so many Russians under 
democratic pseudo capitalism...the first market reforms and the 
erosion of state authority have fostered a brutal cowboy

among a flamboyant and vulgar new class of businessmen, made up 
mostly of speculators, traders and outright criminals, all of whom 
are stealing the country blind...No freedom from fear and no 
freedom from want: Small wonder many Russians feel nostalgic for

"For more than 70 years, Russia dreamed the Soviet dream: the

that happens. There was no smile. It's as if he's soaking up the 
people like he's soaking up the sun, with the warmth pouring deep 
and direct into his political soul and recharging him, refilling 
him somehow once again with his own humanity and some sense of his 
role in the destiny of his country. Then, the hunger slaked, the 
great beast of Need fed once again, it seemed you could almost see 
the gratitude pouring off his brow like sweat as he made his way."

"Hillary Rodham Clinton is as pious as she is political. 
Methodism, for her, is not just a church but an extended family of

<center><h3>The Sixth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting</h3></center>
<P>
<center>December 20, 1993 (Vol. Six; No. 26)</center>
<p><br><P>
Welcome to the Media Research Center's annual awards issue, a 
compilation of the most outrageous and/or humorous news media 
quotes from 1993. To determine this year's winners, a panel of 39 
members of the media and media observers each selected their 
choices for the first, second and third best quote from six to ten 
quotes in each category. A list of the 1993 judges appears on the 
back page. (This issue covers quotes from December 1992 through 
November 1993.)
The first quote under each award heading is the winner, followed 
in order by the top runners-up.
The I Am Woman Award (for Hillary Rodham Hero Worshipping)
<P>
"As the icon of American womanhood, she is the medium through 
which the remaining anxieties over feminism are being played 
out....Perhaps in addition to the other items on her agenda, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will define for women that magical spot 
where the important work of the world and love and children and an 
inner life all come together. Like Ginger Rogers, she will do 
everything her partner does, only backward and in high heels, and 
with what was missing in [Lee] Atwater -- a lot of heart." -- Time 
White House correspondent Margaret Carlson, May 10.

<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"I saw a Hillary Clinton that I'd never seen before. She was 
funny, charming, sexy -- yes, gang, sexy. We are both Scorpios, 
which tells you a lot. She's informal -- called me `Larry' and 
told me to call her by her first name...Meanwhile, she's earned 
the respect of everyone (except the wackos) with her handling of 
the health care issue. Indeed, she has gotten everyone (except the 
wackos) to agree that we need health care for everyone. This is a 
very formidable idea, ladies and gentlemen." -- CNN/Mutual 
Broadcasting talk show host Larry King on his October 2 interview 
with the First Lady. October 4 USA Today column.
<P>
"She's ecumenical but prefers Italian and Mexican. The President 
fixes her eggs with jalapeo peppers on the weekends. One 
Christmas she served black beans and chili as part of a buffet. 
She carries Tabasco sauce wherever she goes....Valentine's Day at 
the Red Sage restaurant. Even at a romantic outing, the President 
can be the date from hell, talking to everyone but the girl he 
brung....Finally alone, they have `painted soup' and the lamb 
baked in herbed bread. They exchange gifts and touch each other 
more in two hours than the Bushes did in four years." -- Time 
reporter Margaret Carlson in the June Vanity Fair.
<P>
"In the midst of redesigning America's health care system and 
replacing Madonna as our leading cult figure, the new First Lady 
has already begun working on her next project, far more 
metaphysical and uplifting... She is both impersonal and poignant, 
with much more depth, intellect and spirituality than we are used 
to in a politician...She has goals, but they appear to be so huge 
and far off -- grand and noble things twinkling in the distance-- 
that it's hard to see what she sees." -- Washington Post<M>'s 
Martha Sherrill, May 4.
<P>
"You've been working hard already to introduce this plan to 
people, sell this plan to people. Are you having any fun with this 
or is it all just hard work? It looks to be very hard work."
"I hear you talking, and as I have before on this subject, I don't 
know of anybody, friend or foe, who isn't impressed by your grasp 
of the details of this plan. I'm not surprised because you have 
been working on it so long and listened to so many people..."--

"If we could be one-hundredth as great as you and Hillary Rodham

about his new on-air partnership with Connie Chung.

"Clinton's campaign, conducted with dignity, with earnest 
attention to issues and with an impressive display of 
self-possession under fire, served to rehabilitate and restore the 
legitimacy of American politics and thus, prospectively, of 
government itself. He vindicated (at least for a while) the honor 
of a system that has been sinking fast. A victory by George Bush 
would, among other things, have given a two-victory presidential 
validation (1988 and 1992) to hot-button, mad-dog politics -- 
campaigning on irrelevant or inflammatory issues (Willie Horton, 
the flag, the Pledge of Allegiance, Murphy Brown's out-of-wedlock 
nonexistent child) or dirty tricks and innuendo (searching 
passport files, implying that Clinton was tied up with the KGB as 
a student)." -- Time Senior Writer Lance Morrow in Man of the Year 
cover story, Jan. 4 issue.
<P>
"There's no doubting that the nation is about to be led by its 
first sensitive male chief executive. He's the first President to 
have attended both Lamaze classes and family therapy (as part of 
his brother's drug rehabilitation). He can speak in the rhythms 
and rhetoric of pop psychology and self-actualization. He can 
search for the inner self while seeking connectedness with the 
greater whole." -- Newsweek Washington reporter Howard Fineman, 
January 25 news story.
<P>
Without running the risk of being considered `touchy-feely,' 
Clinton is known as a hugger of men and women. Simple handshakes 
aren't enough for this man whose theme song easily could be 
borrowed from the cotton industry's `the touch, the feel, the 
fabric of our lives'....What one does with hands, lips, arms, 
trunks, and legs carries far more weight that a barrage of 
insults, eloquent speeches, or sweet poetry whispered in the ear. 
The problem is that many of us, unlike Clinton, have lost touch 
with touch." -- "Style Plus" article in the December 14, 1992 
Washington Post.
<P>
"[Clinton] pointed out the Andrew Jackson magnolia tree. He's a 
very good historian. Harry, I think if you had been in the room, 
any viewer-listener who had been in that room, would have been 
impressed with the breadth of his knowledge. I mean he talked 
about the Oscars. He talked very knowingly about Clint Eastwood 
and his new movie Unforgiven, Jack Nicholson's role in A Few Good 
Men, and then switched very quickly to a knowledgeable analysis of 
Arkansas's chances against North Carolina in the big basketball 
game tomorrow night." -- Dan Rather to CBS This Morning's Harry 
Smith, after March 25 Clinton interview.

indifference, hostility, opportunism, and idiocy -- government 
fiddled, medicine diddled, and the media were silent or 
hysterical. A gerontocratic Ronald Reagan took this [AIDS] plague 
less seriously than Gerald Ford had taken swine flu. After all, he

"Then you've got Bill Bennett out there, who is kind of a 
Torquemada...Bill Bennett is basically a schismatic heretic 
practicing his own contrived lunatic version of the Latin Mass in 
the basement. That's what Buchanan is doing, only with Confederate 
flags flying. You have Phil Gramm from Texas, an incredibly 
mean-spirited right-wing character backed by big-oil money. He is 
the kind of perverse version of Lyndon Johnson whittled down to 
his vices and exaggerated. Then you have Bob Dole: when he's most 
sardonic and cruel is when he's most sincere. I think that's the 
Republican Party right now." -- New Yorker Washington reporter and

"The President permitted Buchanan, the man who tried to destroy 
him, to speak at the Houston convention during prime time. 
Buchanan delivered a snarling, bigoted attack on minorities, gays 
and his other enemies in what he called the `cultural war' and 
`religious war' in America. Buchanan's ugly speech, along with 
another narrow, sectarian performance by Pat Robertson, set the 
tone of right-wing intolerance that drove moderate Republicans and 
Reagan Democrats away from the President's cause in November. If 
Houston represented the Republican Party, many voters said, they 
wanted out." -- Time Senior Writer Lance Morrow in the Man of the

"Bob Michel is a great guy but his time was up. He was a moderate, 
and it's the unmoderates who control the House Republicans, that

this village in order to save it, destroy the House in order to 
try to elect Republicans, have term limitations....Bomb throwers 
don't believe in civility, bomb throwers believe in throwing 
bombs...opposing every principle of the other party simply for 
partisan opposition." -- Sam Donaldson on This Week with David

"You claim the debt problem actually began with Lyndon 
Johnson...But he was fighting the Vietnam War and that was most of 
his problem?...So he had a good reason."
"...I'm not sure there's a grade low enough for this next one: 
Ronald Reagan. He spoke regularly of balancing the budget, but he 
broke the bank. In return for his own personal popularity he spent

"The Reagan Administration used to boast they created a lot of

"As we have seen in the past, during Reagan-Bush administration

"For members of Ronald Reagan's Administration, the metamorphosis 
has been traumatic. Just a few years ago, they commanded 
Washington. They were privy and powerful, setting the country's 
intellectual and moral compass. Their mission was called noble. 
But after they left, their crusade was rejected, their ideology 
repudiated much as the Russians have repudiated communism. They 
were accused of making greed into the country's unofficial 
religion. Their fall was far and fast and the crash was painful."

more in taxes....It's time that people like me start paying more

"Thanks to a cartoon character called Col. Oliver North, scandal

North obligingly took the fall, many said that Reagan was the true 
culprit because he must have known. But they were the same people 
who had already made Reagan famous for not knowing anything. They 
couldn't have it both ways. So all Reagan had to do was look as 
vague as usual and he was invulnerable....But there was only one 
phrase for the way the two famous men [Reagan and Gorbachev] got 
on: they got on famously. Incredulous observers said that although 
their double act looked like Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, the real

Welcome to the fourth annual Linda Ellerbee Awards for

after the ABC and NBC veteran who earned the distinction for a 
Cable News Network commentary which won the 1989 "Award for the 
Silliest Analysis." Ellerbee had wondered about the sanity of 
Vietnamese boat people: "Why would any Vietnamese come to America 
after what America did for Vietnam? Don't they remember My Lai, 
napalm, Sylvester Stallone? Clearly they have no more sense over 
there, than say, Mexicans who keep trying to get into this 
country even though this country stole large parts of their 
country from them in the first place."

"The Republicans, for 25 years, have seldom avoided the 
temptation to play the race card politically in this country. It 
goes back to the '60s, when Richard Nixon ran as a law-and-order 
President. In the '70s, Ronald Reagan, and the late '70s, he ran 
for President in 1980 talking about welfare queens, associating 
the Great Society programs with minorities, and with waste, and 
with crime in the streets. There has been a consistent impulse, 
Willie Horton was just a continuation of that, to use this issue 
to divide people." -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer

"The boom years following World War II saw the U.S. economy take 
off, giving rise to the growth of the great American middle

burdened the working poor and middle class by raising Social 
Security taxes while calling for cuts in the capital gains tax. 
Such policies widened the gap between rich and poor and 
contributed to the psychological chasm between haves and

<P>
<H3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1991</H3>
<h4>December 23, 1991 (Vol. Four; No. 26)</h4>
<p>
<A HREF="#judges"><small>Judges</small></A>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Welcome to the third annual Linda Ellerbee Awards for 
Distinguished Reporting, a compilation of the most outrageous 
and/or humorous news media quotes from 1991. The awards are named 
after the ABC and NBC veteran who earned the distinction for a 
Cable News Network commentary which won the 1989 "Award for the 
Silliest Analysis." Ellerbee had wondered about the sanity of 
Vietnamese boat people: "Why would any Vietnamese come to America 
after what America did for Vietnam? Don't they remember My Lai, 
napalm, Sylvester Stallone? Clearly they have no more sense over 
there, than say, Mexicans who keep trying to get into this 
country even though this country stole large parts of their 
country from them in the first place."              
<P>
To determine this year's winners, a panel of 36 members of the 
media and media observers evaluated over 125 quotes.  A list of 
the 1991 judges appears on page 8. [This issue covers quotes from 
December 1990 through November 1991.]
<P>
First under each award heading is the winner, followed in order 
by the top runners-up.

"Remember all the chatter about a short war? Well, forget it."  
-- Time Senior Writer George J. Church, March 4 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

<P>
"Well, they [U.S. soldiers] really didn't risk that much, number 
one. And second, to honor people who believe in violence is to 
honor the ethic of violence. And if you believe violence solves 
problems, you overlook quite a lot of morality. You overlook what 
Gandhi said: `An eye for an eye and we all go blind.' So why 
celebrate that? Why honor these people?....Instead of 
celebrating, we ought to have a national month of mourning for 
what we did in that area of the world. We supplied them weapons 
endlessly and they used them. And then after we mourn, we ought 
to ask them to forgive us for what they did." -- Washington Post 
columnist Colman McCarthy on CNN's Crossfire, April 19.
<P>
"Certainly a lot of Americans would die, an estimated 2,500 of 
them in just the first ten days of battle. American troops would 
do most of the fighting and thousands, perhaps tens of thousands 
of them would be casualties along with countless thousands of 
Iraqis, soldiers and civilians." -- CBS News reporter Richard 
Threlkeld on war prospects, January 4 Evening News.
<P>
"And why do they do these unnatural, unhuman things, these 
soldiers? Not for God or country or freedom or even because 
they've been ordered to. They do them, finally, as James Jones, 
the author put it, because they don't want to appear unmanly in 
front of their friends." -- CBS reporter Richard Threlkeld on 
U.S. soldiers, February 8 Evening News.
<P>
<H3>Peter Arnett Media First Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
Pat Buchanan: "If there was information you could have gotten out 
that could have saved scores, hundreds of American lives, you 
wouldn't have transmitted that information?"
Peter Arnett: "I wouldn't have transmitted that information. I 
would not have gotten that information in the first place. But I 
would not have transmitted it. I was in Baghdad because I was a 
correspondent for CNN, which has no political affiliations with 
the U.S. government, thank goodness." -- CNN's Crossfire, August 
2.

"[After World War II] Many of the Germans came to us after the 
revelations of the horrors of the concentration camps. They said 
`We didn't know, we didn't know' -- the tears were rolling down 
their cheeks. They claimed they couldn't be held responsible, but 
they were. They accepted with cheers, and great enthusiasm, 
Hitler's clamping down on a free press...Today we're in the same 
position."-- Walter Cronkite quoted on Gulf War coverage in the 
October 22 Philadelphia Daily News. 
<P>
Reporter Arthur Kent: "Saddam Hussein is a cunning man and 
nowhere does he show that more clearly than on a battlefield when 
he's under attack."
Anchor Faith Daniels: "And that, Arthur, really seems to be this 
Administration's greatest miscalculation."
Arthur Kent: "That's right, Faith. He is ruthless, but more than 
ruthless. In the past 11 days, he's surprised us. He's shown us a 
capable military mind and he still seems to know exactly what 
he's doing." -- Exchange from NBC special America: The Realities 
of War, January 27.
<P>
"Allied military units are on the move. Their positions, 
movements, and plans must be carefully safeguarded. We must 
assume that the enemy is confused about what is happening on the 
battlefield and it is absolutely essential that we not do 
anything inadvertently ourselves to clarify the picture for him." 
-- Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in a press conference at the 
start of the ground war, February 23.
vs.
"As part of our CBS News live coverage of the beginning of the 
ground war offensive, we're talking to Bob McKeown, a CBS News 
reporter who's one mile from the Kuwaiti border. Bob, any 
indication of how far up you the think the Allies are now?" -- 
Dan Rather, 21 minutes later.
<P>
<H3>Bring Back the Iron Curtain Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Ten months after the new Germany merged, women in the eastern 
sector are coming to the stunning realization that, in many ways, 
democracy has set them back 40 years." -- Los Angeles Times staff 
writer Tamara Jones, August 6.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"Inefficient as the old communist economy was, it did provide 
jobs of a sort for everybody and a steady, if meager, supply of 
basic goods at low, subsidized prices; Soviet citizens for more 
than 70 years were conditioned to expect that from their 
government. Says a Moscow worker: 'We had everything during 
[Leonid] Brezhnev's times. There was sausage in the stores. We 
could buy vodka. Things were normal.'" -- Time Associate Editor 
George J. Church, September 23.
<P>
"Like many other women in what used to be the German Democratic 
Republic, she worries that political liberation has cost her 
social and economic freedom...The kindergartens that cared for 
their children are becoming too expensive, and West Germany's 
more restrictive abortion laws threaten to deny many Eastern 
women a popular method of birth control....East Germany's 
child-care system helped the state indoctrinate its young, but 
also assured women in the East the freedom to pursue a career 
while raising a family." -- U.S. News & World Report special 
correspondent John Marks, July 1 news story.
<P>
"But most of his fellow countrymen do not share John Paul's 
concept of morality...many here expect John Paul to use his 
authority to support Church efforts to ban abortion, perhaps the 
country's principal means of birth control. And this, they say, 
could deprive them of a freedom of choice the communists never 
tried to take away from them." -- CBS News reporter Bert Quint on 
the June 1 Evening News.

Peter Arnett: "While we were there [at a bombing site], a 
distraught woman shouted insults at the press and vented anger at 
the West."
Woman: "Mea culpa! Mea culpa! All of you are responsible, all of 
you! Bombing the people for the sake of oil! Hunted as if we are 
Iranian! We are human beings! Who made this area like this? The 
flames in the area, it's the West! Mea culpa, the blood, she is 
on your head!" -- CNN live from Baghdad, February 1.
vs.
"Iraq has been polishing up its propaganda game for years. A 
woman wailing in TV-perfect English about civilian casualties 
turned out, as CNN later reported, to be an Iraqi official [aide 
to the Foreign Affairs Under- secretary]. She also showed up on 
French TV wailing in French." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Feb. 
25.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"I saw various plans that the manufacturers had left behind 
talking about its use as a shelter and I can tell you that I saw 
no sign of military equipment on that lower level and I looked 
into all the main rooms." -- BBC reporter Jeremy Bowen on the 
"shelter" bombed by the U.S., February 14 NBC Nightly News. 
vs.
"Intelligence sources told Newsweek that only the top two levels 
sheltered senior military commanders and Baath officials, along 
with their families. Beneath them was a secret basement filled 
with equipment for communicating with Army leaders at the front. 
Last week the Iraqis flooded the secret basement to prevent 
reporters from seeing it after the bombing." -- Newsweek defense 
reporter John Barry, February 25.
<P>
"The message that came from them very strongly in Baghdad was 
that they're pretty sick of Saddam Hussein. They don't like the 
man, they don't like what he's done to their country, and they'd 
like to be rid of him." -- BBC Baghdad reporter Jeremy Bowen on 
NBC News at Sunrise after reporters were kicked out of Baghdad, 
March 8.
vs.
"But the air war itself, as it goes on, has shown no sign of 
diminishing Saddam's support here....all the people that we talk 
to with the television cameras say that the continuing air 
attacks have in fact strengthened their desire, their will to 
resist the Allied coalition." -- Bowen on the NBC Nightly News, 
Feb. 16.
<P>
<H3>Media Hero Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"And then there was Anita Hill, the poised daughter of so many 
generations of black women who have been burned carrying torches 
into the battle for principle. The cause of civil rights and 
social justice has so often fallen to them to defend. Harriet 
Tubman and Sojourner Truth were slaves by birth, freedom fighters 
by temperament. Rosa Parks was a tired seamstress who shoved 
history forward by refusing to give up her seat on the bus....The 
latest to claim her place in line is Anita Hill, a private, 
professional woman unwilling to relinquish her dignity without a 
fight." -- Time Associate Editor Nancy Gibbs, October 21 issue.

"Once, long ago, he was the Prince Hal of American politics: 
high-spirited, youthful, heedless. He never evolved, like Prince 
Hal, into the ideal king. Instead he did something that was in 
its way just as impressive. He became one of the great lawmakers 
of the century, a Senate leader whose liberal mark upon American 
government has been prominent and permanent. The tabloid version 
does not do him justice. The public that knows Kennedy by his 
misadventures alone may vastly underrate him." -- Time's Lance 
Morrow, Apr. 29.
<P>
"And finally President Carter, you are now considered one of the 
world's foremost statesmen. You've been called the best 
ex-President this country has ever had. Your reputation has been 
bolstered tremendously since you left office. How does that make 
you feel?" -- Today co-host Katie Couric to Carter, Nov.13.
<P>
"Elizabeth, his wife of 56 years, applauds him as a good family 
man. Indeed, how can anyone think ill of Hall when he beams so 
about cooking pancakes for his grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren, or shares his secret for making tasty beef 
stew. (It's the apples.)" -- Time reporter Michael Riley in 
September 9 profile of Communist Party USA leader Gus Hall.
<P>
<H3>Willie Horton Award (for Sophisticated Political Analysis)</H3>
<P>
"Demagogues don't yell `nigger' or `Jew boy' anymore. They've 
learned better...[Duke] traded in his bigoted rhetoric for a 
slick new glossary of coded appeals to racial resentment, market 
tested over the past two decades by mainstream conservative 
politicians." -- Time Washington reporter Dan Goodgame, November 
25 news story.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"[Lee Atwater] was a scoundrel, one of the darkest figures to 
dominate our recent politics, a man with a comprehensively 
cynical view of his fellow creatures....He made it in the most 
improbable way, learning to dress at Brooks Brothers and keep his 
funky white trash wickedness too....In running campaigns that 
played on racial divisions, he was something worse than a bigot; 
he was a man who pretended to be a bigot in hope that it would 
sell." -- Washington Post op-ed by reporter Marjorie Williams, 
March 30.
<P>
"I think that he [Thomas] had the advantage of prime time on 
Friday night. He had everything going for him. The Democrats did 
not ask him tough questions about the facts of her charge and 
they did, the Republicans did a great job of hammering her. It's 
basically what happened in the '88 campaign. The Republicans know 
how to fight dirty." -- NBC congressional reporter Andrea 
Mitchell, October 15 Today.
<P>
<H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"You big [expletive]....You are so full of [expletive]. You are 
an evil man....I don't have to listen to this [expletive]. You're 
a bitter and evil man and all your colleagues hate you." -- NPR's 
Nina Totenberg to Senator Alan Simpson after Nightline, as 
Simpson told The Washington Post, October 9.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Twelve million American children who do not have enough to eat, 
who lack adequate health care, and who are behind in schools and 
being left behind in life. Much of our broadcast will be 
dedicated to that. Which makes the major news in Washington today 
seem even more of a contrast. The President's Chief of Staff, 
John Sununu, is at the center of attention again having to do 
with his use of limousines and corporate jets." -- ABC's Peter 
Jennings opening the June 18 World News Tonight.
<P>
Hays Gorey, Senior Correspondent: "Well, (Republican Sen. John) 
McCain has got this ad hoc group of superpatriots that he's 
organizing."
Jerome Cramer, NASA & Technology Correspondent: "They wear brown 
shirts and march around. Small potatoes." -- Exchange from 
February 8 Time Washington bureau meeting aired on C-SPAN. 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Armand Hammer Memorial Award (for Foreign Reporting)</H3>
<P>
"It's short of soap, so there are lice in hospitals. It's short 
of pantyhose, so women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so 
babies stay home in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody 
even talked about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
-- NBC's John Chancellor on the Soviet Union, Aug. 21.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"If nothing else, the Cuban revolution has eliminated abject 
need. The cost may be generalized poverty and zero political 
pluralism, but, even with shortages, there is no starvation here. 
Education and medical care are assured for all. And, unlike in 
most of Latin America, you don't see naked or even shoeless 
children in the streets. When Castro speaks of the need to defend 
the gains of revolution, he means a level of social welfare rare 
in the underdeveloped world." -- Washington Post Asst. Foreign 
Editor Don Podesta, April 28 "Outlook" article.
<P>
"Young Cubans increasingly see themselves as the last idealists 
in a world that cares only about money....Ninety miles away in 
Miami, Cuban emigres wish for Fidel's imminent collapse, but the 
island's university students who volunteer to take a two-week 
'vacation' in the fields don't see trouble brewing in Paradise." 
-- Time reporter Cathy Booth, August 12 issue.
<P>
<H3>The Real Reagan Legacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"In the 1980s, a time when wealth accumulated and men decayed, 
the superpatriots entered Gloryland. They were the anointed Moral 
Majority. They stood foursquare for God, Reagan, and the bombing 
of abortion clinics....We could only wince when the President 
called the Contras 'freedom fighters,' when Oliver North became a 
national hero, when the pledge of allegiance became -- with 
sinister embellishments -- a campaign issue...We winced -- and 
some of us wept in shame -- when George Bush, wearing the white 
flower of a blameless life, won the 1988 election with tactics 
only a Mafia don could admire." -- Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
television critic Harriet Van Horne in The Nation's "patriotism" 
issue, July 15/22.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Tonight, the NBC News program Expose looks at incidences of 
sexual harassment in [federal low-income] housing. It's reported 
by correspondent Michele Gillen....Well, I guess that's where the 
problem began. Actually, it was when the budget was taken out of 
the affordable housing market during the Reagan years and thus, 
the problem came about." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, 
September 20. 
<P>
"Cannon starts off by proclaiming that Reagan is not a dunce, a 
point that can be questioned by the very fact that it has to be 
made, a point we all want to believe but a point that Cannon 
tends to undercut every few pages....Acting might be all right if 
you're a king, but it just won't work for a President...the 
nation needed more than inspiration in the 1980s. It needed 
leadership -- moral leadership, intellectual leadership, 
political leadership. It needed a manager, not a cheerleader. It 
needed a statesman, not a star. It needed answers, not anecdotes. 
It needed ideas as well as ideals. And Ronald Reagan wasn't up to 
that task." -- NBC News President Michael Gartner reviewing Lou 
Cannon's book on Reagan, April 21 Washington Post.
<P>
Reporter Lea Thompson: "The Consumer Product Safety Commission 
can stop manufacturing; it can fine; it can even seize clothes 
right off the rack if PJs don't meet flammability standards. None 
of that's happened. So far the agency has only hoped a 
manufacturer will take its advice. So you can't depend on 
government to police this for you. We did find this flammable 
sleepwear everywhere we went."
Bryant Gumbel: "Lea, Lea, real quick. Why is the government 
abdicating its responsibility on this? Is this another holdover 
from the Reagan years and the cutbacks?"
Thompson: "Absolutely. And somebody's gotta do something." -- 
Exchange on Today, November 13. 
<P>
<H3>Long Dong Silver Award (for Exaggerated Indignation)</H3>
<P>
"The days of Simpson Chic are over. Now he is more often compared 
to Red-baiter Joe McCarthy. The image of Simpson flinging open 
his jacket and declaring he had lots of `stuff' against Anita 
Hill -- while revealing nothing -- was the lowest of many low 
points in the Clarence Thomas hearings. Any Senator with a sense 
of history should have said, as attorney Joseph Welch eventually 
did to McCarthy, `Senator, have you no shame?'....[Simpson] is 
writing a book about the media -- a little like Stalin discussing 
intergovernmental relations." -- Newsweek Washington reporter 
Eleanor Clift, October 28 news story.  
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"I've been in this town for 21 years, and they play a vicious 
brand of politics in Washington. Washington can be a mean town. 
This was as vicious a fight as I've ever seen except it was 
totally one-sided....When you had Alan Simpson standing up there 
like Joe McCarthy, reaching in his pockets and saying `I'm 
getting stuff through faxes, and all over the country,' he 
sounded just like Joe McCarthy, let's face it. And you had Arlen 
Specter, who was a prosecutor at one time, saying that she 
committed perjury, when probably you couldn't find another 
prosecutor in the country that would tell you that she had 
committed perjury." -- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief 
Jack Nelson on Washington Week in Review, October 18.
<P>
"Arlen Specter accused her of perjury. If you read the record, 
Arlen Specter was the one who distorted what she said. Orrin 
Hatch even suggested that she got one of her charges by reading 
The Exorcist, I mean that she was besieged by demons. Orrin 
should really stick to talking dirty. He does that better. Alan 
Simpson, for those of us who were too young to know what Joe 
McCarthy was really like, Alan Simpson showed us. `I have in my 
pocket two dozen card-carrying smearers against this awful 
woman,' and then he produced those smears, those bombshells, and 
they were duds." -- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief 
Al Hunt on CNN's Capital Gang, October 19.
<P>
<H3>Thurgood Marshall Award (for Judicial Activism)</H3>
<P>
"The genius of the Constitution is that it sides with the citizen 
against the state. That's why it's such a worldwide success. But 
today's Supreme Court tends to favor the state over the 
citizen....In this Supreme Court, the state wins more often than 
the citizens. Something to keep in mind when they give you the 
old malarkey about the Court being true to the spirit of the 
Constitution. This Court isn't." -- NBC commentator and former 
anchor John Chancellor, July 23 Nightly News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"What was astonishing here was not that the Court opposes 
abortion. What was astonishing was its absurd view that medical 
personnel paid with government money lose their right to free 
speech. The Constitution says no law shall abridge freedom of 
speech, no law. Could it be that the Court hasn't read that part? 
....Was [David Souter] able and willing to read the Constitution 
as a member of the Court? Would he abide by it? Well, now we know 
the answer. It's no." -- David Brinkley ending ABC's This Week, 
May 26.
<P>
"Under Rehnquist, the Supreme Court no longer sees itself as the 
defender of civil rights and civil liberties, the champion of the 
individual. Gone is the Court majority that breathed new life 
into the Bill of Rights, dismantled Southern segregation, 
disciplined police who violated the rights of citizens, removed 
religion from the public schools, pushed a President into 
resignation, and swept aside the laws forbidding women to end 
their pregnancies." -- Los Angeles Times Supreme Court reporter 
David Savage in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, September 29.
<P>
"On the same day major groups announced their opposition, Thomas' 
friends from Georgia showed up on Capitol Hill. But Thomas has 
taken controversial positions, such as suggesting that natural 
laws may supersede individual rights." -- NBC congressional 
reporter Andrea Mitchell, September 9 Nightly News.
<P>
<H3>Borking Award (for Character Assassination)</H3>
<P>
"Clarence Thomas is the best only at his ability to bootlick for 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush....They didn't pick him because he 
was black. They picked him because he's a black conservative. And 
the thing that bothers me about his appointment -- if they had 
put David Duke on, I wouldn't scream as much because they would 
look at David Duke and reject him for what he is. If you gave 
Clarence Thomas a little flour on his face, you'd think you had 
David Duke talking." -- Columnist Carl Rowan on Inside 
Washington, July 7.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"It may sound bigoted; well, this is a bigoted world and why 
can't black people be allowed a little Archie Bunker 
mentality?....Here's a man [Thomas] who's going to decide crucial 
issues for the country and he has already said no to blacks; he 
has already said if he can't paint himself white he'll think 
white and marry a white woman." -- USA Today "Inquiry" Editor 
Barbara Reynolds in The Washington Post, September 10.
<P>
"Who is this guy, Clarence Thomas, and why should we want him on 
the Supreme Court? I can't think of any good reasons. The man is 
not distinguished and he doesn't seem to have a heart...Let's be 
straight about this. Clarence Thomas is a tool of the rich and 
powerful. His supporters include Dan Quayle, Strom Thurmond, 
Jesse Helms. Even David Duke, former Ku Klux Klan leader, is 
crazy about Clarence Thomas. Make no mistake, old people, poor 
people, black people, women, forget about it. Clarence Thomas is 
not your friend."  -- NBC News reporter Bob Herbert in Sunday 
Today "Viewpoint" segment, September 8.

<P>
<H3>Wilson-Weicker Tax Hike Advocacy Award</H3>
<P>
"American tax rates today are, relatively speaking, low. Repeat, 
low. About half the top rate in the rest of the industrialized 
world. Our sales taxes are equally low. Fact: the United States 
is a tax bargain, believe it or not. The difference, of course, 
is that in other countries, people see their tax money coming 
back to them to make life more agreeable and secure. In Western 
Europe, health care for everyone. In Scandinavia, day care 
centers for mothers and children. In Japan, modern, efficient 
cities that work." -- NBC Nightly News anchor Garrick Utley on 
October 19, Taxpayers Action Day.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

<P>
"Every Governor in America last year could have recited the Jim 
Florio rule of political survival: never mount an honest attack 
against a state deficit. The New Jersey Governor, who combined 
service cuts with the highest tax hike in the state's history, 
was all but tarred and feathered for his efforts. But now, with 
at least 29 states facing potential deficits, Florio's approach 
is beginning to seem almost prescient." -- Time Associate Editor 
Priscilla Painton, March 4.
<P>
"If you're going to raise a child who escapes this cycle [of 
poverty], you're going to have to start a little earlier. And 
that requires money -- M-O-N-E-Y. Read my lips. And it's 
something this nation still isn't ready to commit to...without 
the hard billions of dollars, lots of money which must come from 
you dear taxpayers, we're not going to do this." -- Sam Donaldson 
on This Week with David Brinkley, June 23.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"The earth is home, and all its refugees, its homeless, sometimes 
seem a sort of advance guard of  apocalypse. They represent a 
principle of disintegration -- the fate of homelessness 
generalized to a planetary scale....The flesh is home: African 
nomads without houses decorate their faces and bodies instead. 
The skull is home. We fly in and out of it on mental errands. The 
highly developed spirit becomes a citizen of its own mobility, 
for home has been internalized and travels with the homeowner. 
Home, thus transformed: is freedom. Everywhere you hang your hat 
is home. Home is the bright light under the hat." -- Time "Essay" 
by Senior Writer Lance Morrow, December 24, 1990.

"Politicians led a victory parade of ga-ga worship, with people 
hugging tanks that have vacuumed billions from social programs. 
The Supreme Court ordered family planning centers to help keep 
women barefoot and pregnant by not telling poor women about 
abortion, while Congress refuses to appropriate enough funds to 
feed poor children. And the President says his big-deal domestic 
programs are highways and executions. Meanwhile, the S&L and 
banking fiascos flash around the country Willie Horton-style, 
raping not only women but men and children yet unborn." -- USA 
Today "Inquiry" Editor Barbara Reynolds, June 14.
<P>
"Oh say, we've seen too much. The Star-Spangled Banner pushes 
like a cough through America's mouth and the twilight's last 
gleaming is just that, a sickly flash above our heads as we ride 
unsuspecting in the bellies of sleek trains, plop to our knees in 
churches, embracing truths that disgust us." -- Boston Globe arts 
critic and "poet" Patricia Smith in The Nation's "Patriotism" 
issue, July 15/22.

<P>
"There is a `logic' too to Dahmer's crime. Raised in a culture 
that condoned racial prejudice and despised homosexuals, Dahmer 
appeared to believe he could preserve a place in mainstream 
society -- with all its furtive hopes of family, friends, and 
future -- by destroying the evidence of his homosexuality. He 
killed his 'lovers' -- mostly blacks -- dismembered them, and in 
some cases, may have devoured their remains. Crime is a logical, 
if messy, quick fix to the shortcomings of society. Is that the 
lesson then? That we get the criminals our societies deserve? 
Yes, of course." -- Time Associate Editor Howard G. Chua-Eoan in 
the magazine's "Essay," August 19.

<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"How can you who protest abortion be so certain that we aren't 
swimming toward a fate worse than death? Is homicide in the womb, 
swift and merciful, not better than the slow death that lies 
ahead for some of us once our lives begin?...Better to die now, 
before we can feel real pain, than to enter a world where life is 
so painful it's criminal to be born." -- USA Today "Inquiry" 
Editor Barbara Reynolds, August 16.
<P>
"It's a morbid observation, but if everyone on earth just stopped 
breathing for an hour, the greenhouse effect would no longer be a 
problem." -- Newsweek Senior Writer Jerry Adler, December 31, 
1990 issue.
<P>
"Tanks could crunch grass and other vegetation, knock down dunes 
and kick up sandstorms, said Ken Nagy, who teaches about deserts 
at the University of California at Los Angeles. `Plants and 
animals there are already living on the edge,' he said, 'and this 
insult could be enough to push them over the edge.'" -- Boston 
Globe reporter Larry Tye on impact on war upon Iraq and Kuwait 
desert life, January 18.

<H3>Bring Back the Iron Curtain Award</H3>

"This is Marlboro country, southeastern Poland, a place where the 
transition from communism to capitalism is making more people more 
miserable every day....No lines at the shops now, but plenty at 
some of the first unemployment centers in a part of the world 
where socialism used to guarantee everybody a job." -- CBS News 
reporter Bert Quint on the April 11 CBS Evening News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Communism is being swept away, but so too is the social safety 
net it provided....Factories, previously kept alive only by edicts 
from Warsaw, are closing their doors, while institutions new to 
the East, soup kitchens and unemployment centers are opening 
theirs...Here are the ones who may profit from Poland's economic 
freedom. A few slick locals, but mostly Americans, Japanese, and 
other foreigners out to cash in on a new source of cheap labor." 
-- Reporter Bert Quint on CBS This Morning, May 9.
<P>
"These refugees have been told little about the realities of life 
in the West, including the fact that some people sleep on the 
street...They will soon learn that jobs are hard to find, consumer 
goods expensive, relatives in Albania will be missed. Many 
refugees, according to experts, will suffer from depression, and 
in some cases, drug abuse." -- ABC's Mike Lee on what's facing 
fleeing Albanians, July 14 World News Tonight.
<P>
<H3>Kevin Phillips Tax Fairness Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"[C]ountless liberal analysts over the last five years have 
documented time and again how Reaganomics delivered a feast to the 
greedheads and starvation to the poor....[The Gilded Age and The 
Roaring Twenties] were marked by the same kinds of excesses as the 
1980s -- gross concentrations of wealth in the hands of a tiny 
privileged elite, achieved primarily by deliberate Republican 
policies that left most Americans behind while debt, greed, and 
conspicuous consumption soared out of control." -- Robert Rankin, 
national economics correspondent for Knight-Ridder Newspapers, in 
the July 22 Philadelphia Inquirer.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>

"For ten years Ronald Reagan taught us there was a free lunch. 
Folks, he said, we're going to cut your taxes and we're going to 
spend like there's no tomorrow and you don't have to pay for it. 
Folks, we're now paying for it and it's bitter medicine....we're 
going to have to raise taxes to get some sort of fairness 
here....For ten years the great wizard sold us that idea, that we 
could grow our way out of the deficits and we bought it, and we 
didn't." -- Sam Donaldson on This Week with David Brinkley, 
October 7.
<DD> 
"The tax package hammered out last weekend continues a Washington 
policy established in the Reagan era: It takes a heavy bite out of 
the paychecks of working-class Americans." -- Beginning of front 
page story by Boston Globe reporter Charles Stein, October 2.
<P>
<H3>Bring Back the Gas Lines Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"We have allowed this country to be held hostage by an industry 
that produces a product vital to our national interests. This 
makes about as much sense as having the military services or the 
nation's water supply controlled by private corporations....In the 
long run, what would make the most sense would be to nationalize 
the oil industry to protect the economy." -- Washington Post 
columnist Judy Mann, August 8.
<P>
<H3>Runner-Up:</H3>
<P>
<P>
"The hottest new proposal was a broad-based tax on sources of 
energy -- gasoline, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power. In all, 
it would raise about $20 billion. Everybody seemed to agree it was 
a good idea except, of course, the transportation lobby." -- 
Unbylined box in Newsweek, July 16. 
<P>
<H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"If you're miffed because the Cold War's over, Ceaucescu's dead, 
the Sandinistas lost the election in Nicaragua and it seems like 
here's no one around to hate any more, then maybe The Hunt for Red 
October is just the thing....This is a Reagan youth's wet dream of 
underwater ballistics and East-West conflict." -- Washington Post 
film critic Desson Howe in the "Weekend" section, March 2.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"In a year that has had some of the dirtiest, the sleaziest, the 
most misleading ads ever, it's hard to pick the very worst, but 
here are a couple that the experts chose. North Carolina's Jesse 
Helms, who battled a black opponent, last week overtly introduced 
the most divisive issue of the contest, race....The truth is Gantt 
supported the vetoed civil rights bill which he argued 
specifically warned against quotas." -- ABC reporter Jackie Judd 
on Nightline, November 6.
<P>
"What Helms has done is taken the words 'North Carolina values' -- 
a beautiful phrase that evokes the small-town, good-hearted sense 
of place that one feels when one travels the state -- and 
redefined them as the values belonging to a certain group of North 
Carolinians, mostly white, mostly male, mostly unhappy with the 
changes of the last 30 years. To Helms and his supporters, 'North 
Carolina values' seems to translate into a status quo view of the 
world in which blacks, women, and poor people know their stations 
in society." -- Reporter Juan Williams in The Washington Post 
Magazine, October 28.
<P>
"Are you not also in danger of people looking at the Republican 
Party after this whole experience, and saying, 'Oh, now we do know 
what they stand for that's different. They stand for helping the 
rich and at the same time, the President's talking about vetoing 
the civil rights bill, so helping the rich and white guys?'" -- 
ABC and NPR reporter Cokie Roberts to Richard Darman, October 21 
This Week with David Brinkley.
<P>
<H3>Paul Ehrlich Ecological Panic Award</H3>
<P>
"If nothing is done to reverse ozone damage, scientists predict 
hundreds of millions of skin cancer cases in the U.S. alone, not 
to mention increased global warming that would turn much of the 
planet into a desert." -- Reporter Mark Phillips on the January 16 
CBS Evening News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The missteps, poor efforts and setbacks brought on by the Reagan 
years have made this a more sober Earth Day. The task seems larger 
now." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, April 20.
<P>
"Clean air and water, pure food and natural beauty, which most 
Californians were all for a few months ago, have been made to seem 
a radical and expensive idea that has to be rejected at the polls 
on Tuesday. The stakes are very high in California because 
environmentalists know that if the Big Green initiative happens to 
pass there, the idea of cleaning up the air and water could spread 
like wildfire to all the other states. The forces opposing it know 
that too." -- Charles Kuralt on America Tonight, October 31.
<P>
<H3>Good Morning Morons Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"We would like to believe the State of the Union address is a time 
when the President tells the American people the way it is. But no 
one really wants to hear that, so the President keeps reality down 
to a minimum. The President was remarkably upbeat for a man who 
runs a country with a monstrous national debt, huge balance of 
trade problems, a crumbling infrastructure, dirty air, countless 
homeless people, a coast-to-coast drug epidemic, and a faltering 
self-image." -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, February 2.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed. Just how 
much will be the primary issue on the agenda when Congressional 
leaders meet with the President later today, Wednesday, May the 
9th, 1990. And good morning, welcome to Today. It's a Wednesday 
morning, a day when the budget picture, frankly, seems gloomier 
than ever. It now seems the time has come to pay the fiddler for 
our costly dance of the Reagan years." -- Bryant Gumbel opening 
NBC's Today, May 9.
<P>
Bob Squier, Democratic Strategist: "I think that it was a game of 
chicken. I think what you had was Gingrich, who is supposed to be 
part of the leadership, leading people literally out of the deal."
Bryant Gumbel: "Acting irresponsibly."
Gumbel: "....Is this the legacy of Ronald Reagan politics, I mean, 
feel-good politics of the '80s, no-responsibility politics of the 
'80s?"
Roger Ailes, Republican Strategist: "I think that's a misnomer..."
Gumbel: "But weren't the '80s about spending what we didn't have? 
And that was Ronald Reagan." -- Exchanges on Today, October 5.
<P>
<H3>Most Honest Confession Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as objective reporting...I've become even 
more crafty about finding the voices to say the things I think are 
true. That's my subversive mission." -- Boston Globe environmental 
reporter Dianne Dumanoski at an Utne Reader symposium May 17-20. 
Quoted by Micah Morrison in the July American Spectator. 
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"I think that when abortion opponents complain about a bias in 
newsrooms against their cause, they're absolutely right."
"Opposing abortion, in the eyes of most journalists...is not a 
legitimate, civilized position in our society." --  Boston Globe 
legal reporter Ethan Bronner in Los Angeles Times reporter David 
Shaw's series on abortion coverage, July 1. 
<P>
"After seeing our footage, she told us that Frontline doesn't 
co-produce anti-communist programs." --Cinematographer Nestor 
Almendros on a Frontline producer's reaction to his anti-Castro 
documentary Nobody Listened, quoted by Don Kowet in the August 8 
Washington Times.
<P>
<H3>Gorbasm Award*</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has probably moved more quickly than any person in the 
history of the world. Moving faster than Jesus Christ did. America 
is always lagging six months behind...I think we can get by easily 
with a $75 billion military budget. Those bombers and all of this 
stuff is an absolute waste of money and a joke." -- Ted Turner, 
"TV chieftain with an outspoken conscience," celebrated in the 
January 22 Time.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The supreme leader of an atheistic state was baptized as a child. 
Now, in a sense, Gorbachev means to accomplish the salvation of an 
entire society that has gone astray...Much more than that, 
Gorbachev is a visionary enacting a range of complex and sometimes 
contradictory roles. He is simultaneously the communist Pope and 
the Soviet Martin Luther, the apparatchik as Magellan and McLuhan. 
The Man of the Decade is a global navigator." -- Time Senior 
Writer Lance Morrow, January 1.
<P>
"He has, as many great leaders have, impressive eyes...There's a 
kind of laser-beam stare, a forced quality, you get from Gorbachev 
that does not come across as something peaceful within himself. 
It's the look of a kind of human volcano, or he'd probably like to 
describe it as a human nuclear energy plant." -- Dan Rather on 
Mikhail Gorbachev, quoted in the May 10 Seattle Times.
<P>
<H3>Thurgood Marshall Judicial Reporting Award</H3>
<P>
"Supreme Court nominee David Souter wants the world to stop 
viewing him as a nerd. Senate Democrats want to know if, instead, 
Souter is a neanderthal -- a mean-spirited conservative bent on 
wrecking constitutional protections for women, minorities, and 
accused criminals." -- Beginning of September 13 USA Today cover 
story by legal reporter Tony Mauro.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Chief Justice Rehnquist had the kind of image problems that might 
be expected of a jurist who habitually rejected constitutional 
equality for women, approved the execution of allegedly insane 
prisoners without a hearing, denied constitutional equality to 
aliens and bastards, asserted that the public did not have a 
constitutional right to attend court trials, said prisoners had no 
rights to practice religious freedom, and spoke warmly of the 
legendary Isaac ('Hanging Judge') Parker, who cheerfully ordered 
eighty-five executions." -- Former CBS News law reporter Fred 
Graham in his book Happy Talk.
<P>
"Senator Simon, is there any doubt in your mind that [Souter's] 
views pretty well parallel those of John Sununu's which means he's 
anti-abortion or anti-women's rights, whichever way you want to 
put it?" -- Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News, July 23.
<P>
<H3>Jim Florio Tax Advocacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"The overall tax burden for Americans, local, state and federal, 
is actually quite low....The fact is Americans could pay more 
taxes and the country wouldn't go down the tube. Taxpayers don't 
believe this because they are being conned by the 
politicians....The truth is that the United States needs higher 
taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders are now starting 
to say that, but until more say it, the country will remain in 
trouble." -- Commentator John Chancellor on the NBC Nightly News, 
April 17.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The fact is that most government spending cannot be cut. The way 
out of the mess is for the government to raise some money through 
taxes and at last that's being done. And there's encouraging news 
in the returns from yesterday's elections. Six states from 
Massachusetts to California rejected measures designed to limit 
taxation. Can it be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is 
coming to an end? If true, maybe the country can get on with the 
business of balancing its books in a sensible and logical way." -- 
John Chancellor on NBC Nightly News, November 7.
<P>
"[Except] for capital gains, it is certain the President won't 
mention the T word, and yet taxes are very much at the heart of 
what all our potential solutions are. How long can both sides 
pretend that a hike's not needed?" -- Bryant Gumbel on Today, 
January 31.
<P>
<H3>Media Hero Award/Abroad</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Ortega's defeat is something American Presidents had sought for 
ten years. Yet Ortega's statesman-like acceptance of the voters' 
decision has prompted some in Washington to call the Sandinista 
leader a champion of democracy." -- Today co-host Deborah Norville 
before interview with Daniel Ortega, April 24.
<P>
"We talked to one observer who told us that if he were awarding 
the Nobel Prize, he would nominate Mikhail Gorbachev and Daniel 
Ortega. What do you think of that?" -- one of Norville's questions 
to Ortega.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Fidel [Castro] touched this young machine adjuster, and the man 
enjoyed a mild ecstasy. I know the feeling." -- Institute for 
Policy Studies Senior Fellow Saul Landau in his pro-Castro 
documentary The Uncompromising Revolution, aired along with Nobody 
Listened on PBS August 8.
<P>
"Mandela leaves as a principled man, with all but the dullards 
understanding why he would embrace the Palestinians, whose 
children are being killed and family homes bulldozed in Israel 
just as black families' are in Soweto....Moreover, if Mandela is a 
terrorist -- as conservatives have called him -- he would fit 
right in with U.S. patriots such as George Washington, Patrick 
Henry, Nat Turner, and Harriet Tubman. If it had not been for 
those terrorists, what would we have to wave our flags about on 
the Fourth of July?" -- USA Today Inquiry Editor Barbara Reynolds, 
June 29.
<P>
<H3>Media Hero Award/At Home</H3>
<P>
<P>
"The problem for Florio is that, as history has shown, when you 
step up and are a leader, people often don't like you. And it can 
take a long time, even centuries, for history to look back and say 
that was a good guy....I think that Florio will go down as the 
first, I hope not the last, brave man of the '80s and '90s." -- 
Washington Post "Outlook" editor Jodie Allen on N.J. Governor who 
raised income taxes, July 29 Money Politics.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Let Ronald Reagan ride off into the sunset untroubled by fleeting 
memories of astrologers, smoke-and-mirrors budget arithmetic, and 
arms-for-hostages swaps. Dwell instead on those political tall 
timbers still standing, the heirs of Jefferson, Madison, and 
Lincoln....Only Jesse Jackson, still an acquired taste for most 
white Americans, can strike the kind of inspirational pose that 
one could imagine being immortalized in granite." -- Time Senior 
Writer Walter Shapiro in the September GQ.
<P>
"[Justice William Brennan] loved the flag clearly, and the 
Constitution, too...Maybe the way to remember Brennan's years on 
the Court is with some words he spoke to another Georgetown 
University event back in 1979. 'The quest for freedom, dignity, 
and the rights of man will never end,' he said. The quest, though 
always old, is never old, like the poor old woman in Yeats' play. 
'Did you see an old woman going down the path?' asked Bridget. 'I 
did not,' replied Patrick, who had come into the house just after 
the old woman had left it. 'But I saw a young girl and she had the 
walk of a queen.' William Brennan loved and served two young girls 
who walked like queens -- his country, and its highest court." -- 
Conclusion to story by reporter Bruce Morton on the July 21 CBS 
Evening News.

"Polls won't close here for another thirty minutes, but the 
widespread belief that the Sandinistas will prevail has shifted 
thinking far beyond the ballot box. The topic of the day is: how 
will a freely elected Sandinista government be treated by the 
United States?" -- NBC's Ed Rabel in Nicaragua, Feb. 25 Nightly 
News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The election observers say the Bush Administration may have 
itself to blame for Daniel Ortega's rise in popularity among the 
voters. The reason, they say, is the U.S. military invasion in 
Panama. That was a move that was widely denounced here in 
Nicaragua. It was a close race until the U.S. invaded." -- NBC 
reporter Ed Rabel four days before Nicaragua election, February 21 
Nightly News.
<P>
"For the Bush Administration and the Reagan Administration before 
it, the [ABC News-Washington Post] poll hints at a simple truth: 
after years of trying to get rid of the Sandinistas, there is not 
much to show for their efforts." -- Peter Jennings five days 
before vote, World News Tonight, February 20.
<P>
<H3>The Real Reagan Legacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"It will take 100 years to get the government back into place 
after Reagan. He hurt people: the disabled, women, nursing 
mothers, the homeless." -- White House reporter Sarah McClendon in 
USA Today, Feb. 16.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Now the lessons of Iran-Contra are also clear. We have learned 
this: that a President who lies to Congress and to the people will 
feel free to joke about it. A Vice President who lies to Congress 
and to the people will be elected President. A White House aide 
who lies to Congress and to the people will be hailed as a hero 
until the time for a reckoning comes...An administration, in 
short, that lies to Congress and to the people is the accepted 
order of things. And a Constitution designed to prevent exactly 
that order is a mere scrap of paper." -- PBS' Bill Moyers writing 
in the January 1990 issue of the Progressive.
<P>
"Okay, Democrats are certainly not without blame. But I believe 
the S&L crisis lands right at the Republican door. It was the 
magic of the marketplace that took off the regulations...Oh, 
Ronald Reagan and the magic of the marketplace was the theme of 
the '80s. Greed in this country is associated with Ronald Reagan." 
-- Newsweek reporter Eleanor Clift on Face the Nation, July 29.

"When inflation is taken into account, it adds up to a cut in 
defense spending, and that's the first time in a long time that 
has happened." -- Bob Schieffer on the January 27 CBS Evening 
News.
vs.
"It's easily overlooked, but the fact is, that in real terms, the 
defense budget has been going down every year since 1985." -- CBS

"If there's anything that we heard out there at the polls today, 
it was the sound of Reaganomics crashing all around us. If there's 
anything left of Reagan's trickle-down theory, Dan, it seems to be 
anxiety which seems to be trickling down through just about every 
segment of our society." -- Ed Bradley during CBS News election

"But they [young people] are the healthiest and most educated 
young people in Cuba's history. For that many of them say they 
have Castro and his socialist revolution to thank....if they long 
for the sweeping changes occurring in Eastern Europe, they are not 
saying so publicly....To the extent he can, Castro has been 
rewarding young people. For example, on their return home [from 
Angola], the 300,000 Cubans sent to Africa were first in line for 
housing, jobs, and education. Such benevolence breeds dedication, 
some young people say." -- NBC reporter Ed Rabel, April 1 Nightly

"It's almost impossible for most Americans to understand a 
government organization that monitors everything, that has 
tentacles reaching into all aspects of Soviet life. But keep in 
mind the KGB is like a combination of the CIA, the FBI, of the 
National Security Agency, the Secret Service, and the Coast Guard, 
too. From Lenin to Stalin to Gorbachev, its members have been a 
proud corps of the national elite, intelligent, talented, and 
fully in control. The officers of the KGB, in fact, decided reform 
was necessary long before Gorbachev came to power." -- Diane 
Sawyer on ABC's Prime Time Live, August 2.

"But Ortega, an irritant to Carter, became an obsession to Reagan, 
who saw him as an instrument of Moscow. The Contra rebels were the 
blunt instrument in Ronald Reagan's attack on Daniel Ortega. 
Reagan's dogged support for the Contras forever marked and 
ultimately scarred his foreign policy....Many of the Contras were 
former members of the Nicaraguan National Guard, Somoza's 
enforcers. They were brutal, often inept...It has been one of the 
longest and most traumatic chapters in U.S. history in Latin 
America, and tonight it seems to be ending, and ending in a way 
Ronald Reagan never could have imagined." -- NBC reporter John

"Free at last, the temptation is to exercise all that freedom -- 
fully, quickly and sometimes unwisely. Often, it means biting the 
hand that freed and fed you. Lithuania is the latest and most 
ludicrous example....There is little more logic to Lithuania being 
permitted to unilaterally and unlawfully declare its independence 
from the USSR than there would be for Texas to secede from the 
USA. Both were grabbed during a war. But both owe much to their 
modern-day mother country. Gorby has a right to feel livid about 
Lithuania. The way you might feel about a runaway child, tempted 
to beat him within an inch of his life." -- USA Today founder Al

"Soviet people have become accustomed to security if nothing else. 
Life isn't good here, but people don't go hungry, homeless; a job

society together for 72 years no longer applies. The people seem 
baffled, disappointed, let down. Many don't like the prospect of 
their nation becoming just another capitalist machine." -- CNN

"Some of the blame for this 'have everything attitude' could 
easily be placed on the Reagan Administration and a compliant 
Congress. You remember, 'morning in America.'...Face reality, like 
Governor Jim Florio has in New Jersey and you've got a revolt on 
your hands. The recession has cut revenues there, so he's trying 
to raise taxes in order to still deliver the services the people 
in New Jersey say they want. That, of course, is political 
heresy." -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, November 2.

"We wanted everything but the pain of paying for it. It began with

Americans more while asking for less: the Reagan Revolution." -- 
Tom Brokaw on budget impasse, NBC Nightly News October 5.
<P>
"Devoting the bulk of future defense savings to erasing the 
deficit would be fitting, since much of the government's red ink 
stems from Reagan's sharp military buildup...Despite America's 
fiscal recklessness in the 1980s, the sudden end of the cold war 
has provided the nation at least a modest opportunity to improve 
its health without cutting already anemic social spending." -- 
Time Washington correspondent Michael Hornik, February 12 issue.
<P>
"Incapable of believing his country wrong, or himself wrong, 
Reagan encouraged his fellow citizens in that same belief. If he 
gave us a renewed self-respect, he led us beyond it to the 
conviction that there is a free lunch and we are entitled to it; 
the price we will end up paying for that little lesson in 
self-indulgence is only now beginning to become clear, as is the 
understanding that we will be paying it for generations, if not 
until kingdom come." -- Washington Post book critic Jonathan

"Among the rights certainly to be affected this time: abortion. 
Brennan was a forceful advocate for women's rights and civil

"Without a surplus to mask the deficit, the White House and 
Congress would have to confront it more honestly -- raise taxes or 
gouge the Pentagon." -- Reporter Dale Russakoff on the Moynihan 
Social Security tax cut plan, January 18 Washington Post. 
<P>
"But Congress is not solely -- or even primarily to blame. For a 
decade the Reagan and Bush Administrations have been submitting 
fraudulent, free-lunch budgets that promised huge tax cuts, a 
social 'safety net,' a 'kinder, gentler' nation, improved 
education, a war on drugs, the greatest military buildup in 
peacetime history, and -- most fraudulent of all -- a balanced 
budget." -- Time Washington Bureau Chief Stanley Cloud, October 15 
issue. 
<P>
"Let's go down to Texas and let me show you actual votes in and 
tabulated. This was a race considered so nasty it would gag a 
buzzard....This race is so close that everybody's having a 
4,000-calorie attack down there." -- Dan Rather during CBS News 
election night coverage, November 6.

"I wouldn't touch that line with a 12-foot pole, which as you know 
is a pole I reserve for those things that I certainly wouldn't 
touch with an 11-foot pole." -- Rather's response to whether he 
had a favorite candidate for President, election night.
<P>
"For a long time they [taxpayers] accepted the conventional wisdom 
that if you cut taxes for the rich the benefits would trickle down 
to everybody. But all the latest polls now show that most 
taxpayers have finally come to suspect otherwise....So if and when 
they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going 
to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they 
avoided in the '80s." -- Reporter Richard Threlkeld, October 16 
CBS Evening News.
<P>
"The Brennan departure has also caused concern about the 
survivability of affirmative action programs. In civil rights 
circles, there is fear that a Supreme Court, with a philosophical 
scale weighted to the right, will no longer be a force for social 
change...Also seen at risk in a court without Brennan, the limits 
of individual freedom." -- CNN reporter Candy Crowley on 
PrimeNews, July 21.
<P>
"It's hard to get the world psyched up for a summit when the 
stakes keep going down. It used to be the future of all mankind 
hung in the balance every time the Soviets and Americans talked. 
That's all changed since our respective leaders finally figured 
out the expensive and dangerous race to build more and more 
nuclear weapons was pretty much a waste of everyone's time and 
resources. There's a limit, after all, to how much of the world 
you can wreck and still feel good about yourself." -- CBS This 
Morning co-host Harry Smith in his weekly "Record of Who We Are" 
commentary, June 1.
<P>
"It took twenty years for the world to come Ronald Dellums' way. 
Widely viewed as what he calls a 'radical Commie pinko' when he 
came to Congress in 1971, the Democrat from Berkeley, Calif., has 
emerged in 1990 as a principal player on defense policy." -- USA 
Today reporter Richard Wolf, March 15.
<P>
"There seems to be a longing for something that is just more 
real...In the final analysis, we all knew the '80s society wasn't 
real. The Wall Street finances, the yuppies, the Perrier, the 
opulence, all of that was not real and after 10 years, maybe we're 
starving for a good plain meal." -- Jane Pauley describing her new 
NBC series Real Life in USA Today, July 17.
"Jane Pauley needs a reality check. Real life for her is living in 
Manhattan and a million-dollar salary. Stop trashing the '80s, 
Jane. It's the decade that made you rich and famous." -- Letter 
responding to Pauley's remarks, July 19 USA Today. 
<P>
"I do have an axe to grind...I want to be the little subversive 
person in television." -- Barbara Pyle, CNN Environmental Editor 
and Turner Broadcasting Vice President for Environmental Policy, 
quoted in the same Spectator story.

"The fact of the matter is that everybody you're looking at here 
is a reporter, and the fellow in Moscow [Dan Rather] as well, and 
we report about other people. There's not a commentator on this 
stage, and that fellow in Moscow is not a commentator. So we 
simply don't do what you're saying." -- 60 Minutes correspondent 
Mike Wallace defending a panel of CBS reporters against charges of 
liberal bias, especially on abortion coverage, on the May 18 
Donahue.
<P>
"It was an extraordinary performance, almost as sensational and 
ruinous as the acts of Buddhist monks in Saigon who once set 
themselves on fire in front of cameras in an ultimate statement of 
protest. By reaching a white-hot intensity, Silber probably 
frightened away voters who represented his last possibility to win 
new support." -- Boston Globe reporter Curtis Wilkie five days 
before Silber won primary.
<P>
"The price of gas today in the United States has gone up -- $1.40, 
$1.50, maybe even $1.60 some places, but around the world the 
price is $3 and $4 a gallon, and people pay it gladly. Senator 
Lieberman, do you think we have some God-given right to low 
prices?" -- Sam Donaldson on Nightline, October 17.
<P>
"Jimmy Carter the President wasn't particularly well liked. Carter 
the prophet was right on the money. The gas lines of the Arab oil 
embargo apparently left little lasting impression, though....Just 
this week, the Senate killed a bill that would have forced car 
makers to significantly improve gas mileage. Maybe we just don't 
care that much." -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, 
September 28.

<p>
<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,
why shouldn't that be viewed as a character flaw? Or when one
lies. For example, let me roll a clip and then we'll come back.
This one deals with Iran-Contra." -- Gumbel to Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, same show.
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused
enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"
-- Gumbel to Cannon in discussion about Ronald Reagan, same
show.
<p>
"Elections, like actions, have consequences. Sometimes it's hard
to know what they might be. Did Americans know that electing
Ronald Reagan would send the deficit through the roof? Do we
know that electing Bob Dole would lessen drug use?" -- CNN
reporter Bruce Morton on Late Edition, September 29.

personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms." -- Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, October 5 Capital Gang on CNN.

"Kenneth Starr, the supposedly non-partisan independent counsel
investigating the Clintons, was the featured speaker yesterday
at a luncheon sponsored by right wing hatemonger Pat Robertson
[who runs the] Christian Broadcasting Network and Regent Law
School. By pandering to Clinton-haters, Mr. Starr appears to be

"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he has been
a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed from North
Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children in Africa and
Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some of these efforts.
The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for years has given President
Carter the back of its hand. It can make amends next week and
give him what he deserves: the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize." -- Al

connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember
this. It is not original research, but an analysis of 23 earlier
studies. And the National Cancer Institute says those individual

other scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." --

I'm standing there with one of our younger producers at MSNBC.
She's 24 or something and I said `What do you think?' She said,
`You know, he scares me.' And I said, `What do you mean he
scares you?' She said `It doesn't matter what he's trying to

<CENTER><H3>Really Helping Dole Make It A Close Race?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Reporters want nothing more than, this year and four years ago,
to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the
fight, the close call....So it's in our best interest to make it
look close, to make Bob Dole look good." 
<DD>-- <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reporter Ellen Warren on CNN's<I> Crossfire</I>, September 20.
<P>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<P>
"The former Senator argued that voters have a choice between two
different visions of government... The ex-deficit hawk returned
to the centerpiece of his campaign, a 15 percent tax cut.
Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing President
Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason for this
attack. But between now and election day the Republican nominee
has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole plan."
<DD>-- Reporter Phil Jones, September 24 CBS <I>Evening News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
NBC reporter David Bloom: "So now Dole, who's complained about
Clinton's campaign of fear, is taking a similar tack."
Bob Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to
the White House."<BR>
Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame."<DD> -- September 24 NBC
<I>Nightly News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
"The same cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton seems to
work directly against Bob Dole, with many voters here calling his
15 percent tax cut idea a political gimmick....Many of the voters
we spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government
shutdown, for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for
attempts to trim Medicare specifically." <DD>-- ABC's Dean Reynolds
in Michigan, Sept. 23 <I>World News Tonight</I>.

<P>
"Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
<P>
"Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal, most
white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's out
walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?" 
<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran in part one of
three day interview series, September 30 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
Gumbel: "Do you think if those two victims had been, say,
Marguerite, his first wife, and Al Cowlings, his best friend,
that there would have been the same amount [of media attention]?"
Johnnie Cochran: "Absolutely not. And I think any person who
wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."
Gumbel: "Why? Because America doesn't care about black victims?"
<P>
"Most white Americans still charge that O.J.'s jurors didn't do
their job. You talk about a rush to judgment. They would claim
the same. They would claim the verdict was race-based. Do you
think their judgment of those jurors is race-based?"
<P>
"Do you think O.J. will ever get a fair shake in this country?
Will people ever let him live out his life and accept the fact
that he was acquitted?" <DD>-- Some of Gumbel's questions to Cochran,
October 2.

"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." <DD>--
<I>Chicago Tribune</I>, September 5.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Tax Cuts: Crazy Candy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Pollsters, pundits, look at these numbers and they'll say this
thing is locked....There is no way Dole can overcome this. Why
doesn't he just accept it and be himself? Try to hold the
Republican Congress and get rid of this book, and get rid of
these crazy 15 percent tax cuts and speak from the heart?" <DD> -- NBC
Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to Dole campaign manager
Scott Reed on CNBC's <I>Tim Russert</I>, September 22.
<P>
"Americans are forever grumbling about high taxes and big
government. You'd think promising a tax cut would be like giving
away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a
terrific theory! And so what if Democratic doctors say they are a
couple of quacks. Gene [Randall], have some candy!"
<DD> -- CNN analyst Bill Schneider on <I>Inside Politics</I>, September 14. 
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Welfare Reform: Hate That, Too</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the
bill is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under
the new bill a 60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy
families will end. It's been estimated as many as a million
children will go hungry. What are you going to do about that?" <DD>--
Barbara Walters to Bill Clinton, September 20 <I>20/20</I>.
<P>
"In light of the new welfare reform bill, do you think the
children need more prayers than ever before?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to
Children's Defense Fund leader Marian Wright Edelman, September
23 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Rapping the Republicans on Rape</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"I think, generally speaking, most people would agree that the
partisan, that the smear tactics -- I mean, the going after the
family, and since when has President Clinton said anything about
Elizabeth Dole? It hasn't happened, and yet you see the
Republicans attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, who I agree has
made mistakes, but they [Republicans] have no boundaries, and I
think that yes, both parties are guilty of using smear tactics --
it goes back to as I said the origin of American politics -- but
I think the Republicans are quite frankly, better at it than the
Democrats, and I think most people see that and believe
that....Why don't you recognize some of the hypocrisy on the part
of the Republicans?....Well, for starters, a rape victim up on
the podium in San Diego when the Republicans oppose abortion." <DD>--PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe responding to conservative
criticism on Westwood One's <I>Jim Bohannon Show</I>, August 30.
<P>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>I Thought White People Were the Paranoid Anti-Government Wackos</CENTER></H3>
<P>
"As Dick [Gregory] was saying, a conspiratorial thing, something
that is genocidal that many African-Americans whisper and talk
about that, or was it simply an economic situation that they
thought this was a quick way to make money to send to the
Contras?" <DD>-- MSNBC <I>InterNight</I> host Ed Gordon to activist Joe
Madison on the San Jose Mercury News report that the CIA sold
crack to fund the Contras, September 19.
<P>
"[CIA Director John] Deutch reiterated last week that he has
asked the agency's inspector general to review the Mercury's
charges. The Justice Department has also launched a probe. But if
Deutch thinks anyone in black America is going to take the wordof those two organizations, he's mistaken. Black Americans have
been the targets of so much hostility that many of them would not
put it past their own government to finance the war against
communism by addicting thousands of people."

"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his
campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement: `Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with
Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in reinvigorating his Republican base. But

"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd
[at the NAACP convention]. That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak
at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning
and the All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an
insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial
divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential
campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<DD>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 <I>Nightly

"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman? Probably so. From Primary Colors
to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in the World. Bill Clinton has
suffered when judged on the age-old standard of masculinity: military service. But female
observers, from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a catty ferocity they
would not apply to men. A man with a prim exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter
could testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a woman is an emasculating

be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private, intensely competitive Al Gore has managed
the contortionist's feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's re-election
without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both brainy, moderate Southerners with an
abiding interest in the plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each other like
competitive brothers."<DD>-- <I>Time</I> Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss does, tonight he is next door in
the Old Executive Office Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity theory,
open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific metaphors in modern society. He's writing a
speech, and the elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet Coke

"On paper it shouldn't hurt him [Clinton]. This is about one goofy guy. We don't even know if
the story is true. The picture that I saw in the New York Post looks very much like it was

<P>
"Here in Chicago, the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the speech he will be giving
to this convention and to the country tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very
upbeat convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll numbers to accompany it.
And a very important set of statistics about the economy today, which he will certainly point to
as evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along comes a nasty little scandal to
take the edge off the good news, at least for one day." <dd>--Peter Jennings opening the August 29

"Nancy pushed Ronnie into an arms treaty with the Russians because she wanted him to win a Nobel
Prize. So maybe astrology was healthier than whatever the rest of the nuke-Managua globo-cops
were smoking in the Reagan White House. That Hillary should talk to Eleanor Roosevelt bothers
some of us less than the fact that her husband obviously doesn't....Isn't it amazing that women
have invented or designed or discovered the prototype computer, nitrate fertilizer, penicillin,
integral calculus, food refrigeration, space helmets, atomic parity, automatic flight control,
pulsars and even DNA, not to mention square-bottomed bags, ice cream cones, vacuum canning and
the gardenia. And yet we're still afraid of what they'll whisper into the ears of their powerful
husbands. Might we at least concede that the people we'll marry say more about us than the
people we select for the second place on the ticket of our glory-hounding selves; nobody elects
vice presidents, either. Our pathological fear of Hillary and any other uppity woman, whatever
her politics, is a form of foot-binding as well as a species of hate radio." <dd>-- John Leonard on

Now, how do you reconcile that with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor children on the street?" <DD>--Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an interview on the August 25 <I>CBS Evening News.</I>
<P>
"But the Democratic Party for sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this is what I stand for'?" <DD>--<I>Meet the Press</I> moderator Tim Russert to James Carville, August 25.
<P>
"If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real shills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next two years?" <DD>Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala during <I>PBS-NBC Democratic convention coverage</I>, August 26.

"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet, late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other welfare experts are saying is going to throw a million children into poverty. Does that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked for over the years?....Eleaonr Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?"<DD>--Questions from CNN's Judy Woodruff to Hillary Clinton, August 26 <I>Inside Politics</I>.  
<P>
"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the way you've been
treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?"<DD>--<I> NBC's</I> Maria Shriver in an interview with Hillary Clinton after her August 27 Democratic convention speech.
<P>
"Any time the Doles play the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was 17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and staying married gets you an inquisition." <dd>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson, September 2 issue.

"Women have not responded well to a message that at times has been considered too harsh, too

<P>
"The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this

their rights." <DD>-- ABC's Peter Jennings on the Republican convention, August 13 <i> World News

"There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say.
Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it, or quite
the contrary?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, August 14
<i>Today</i>.
<P>
"You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive party, one that can
embrace the views of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out vis-a-vis
abortion, and the fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking because they
felt as if they were being censored, do you still believe you can call the Republican Party an
inclusive party?" <dd>-- One of seven abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 <i>Today</I>.

Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We
can expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."--<dd> <i>Today</i> co-host Bryant Gumbel.

"It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily designed for a broadcast image of
tolerance and diversity that's starkly at odds with reality." <dd>--ABC's Jim Wooten on Powell,
August 13 <i>World News Tonight</i>.
<P>
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that they don't think
this ticket, or perhaps this party, is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"

contributor George J. Church, August 19.
<P>
"If he signs the measure as it is, President Clinton will appear to have fulfilled his famous
pledge about ending welfare. In truth, he will have abandoned the vision that animated the

<H3>Chaplain-in-Chief?</H3>

"Mr. Clinton is clearly more and more comfortable now in the role these  
times have forced on our Presidents -- first mourner and  
chaplain-in-chief. But his moments with the families must have struck  
him as especially
poignant today, for when he left them in the hotel and entered his car,  
he buried his head on Mrs. Clinton's shoulder."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim  
Wooten on the TWA crash aftermath, July 25 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>Republicans Have Zero Tolerance?</H3>

"We begin tonight with what you could call zero tolerance....Today by  
the time Mr. Dole spoke by satellite to his party delegates, who were 20
already gathered in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject  
of abortion had disappeared from the party's platform." <BR>
<DD>-- Peter  Jennings, August 6 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
"The Republican Party platform committee has forced abortion rights  
advocates to walk the plank, the abortion plank. The committee handed  
Robert Dole a defeat, by turning down language endorsing tolerance 20
of abortion rights supporters."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas, August 6  
<I>Good Morning America</I>.
<P>
<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and  
sometimes differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source  
of strength."<BR>

<P>
<H3>On Top of the Big Stories</H3>

"Quite honestly, I haven't looked at whatever tolerance language they  
allegedly have in their platform." <BR>
<DD> -- Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman  
when asked by a caller about the Democrats' platform abortion language
on CNBC's <I>Politics</I>, August 6.
<P>
<H3>Wrestling Reaganomics to the Ground 20</H3>

"The old joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a  
ditch gets out of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there  
are a fair amount of assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan  
that are really, I think, under intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." <BR>
<DD>--U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer immediately after  
Dole's tax cut address on <I>CNN</I>, August 5.
<P>
"Americans might remember that the last time we tried to grow our way  
out of the deficit that the tax cut happened, the growth didn't happen,  
and the deficit was huge at the end of it. How are they going to explain  
this new version of supply-side?"<BR>
<DD> -- PBS<I> Washington Week in Review</I> host Ken Bode, July 26.
<P>
"Now [Dole]'s embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career -- so late in the campaign  
-- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that
the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a  
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."  
<BR>
<DD>-- <I>Newsweek </I>reporter Howard Fineman, August 12. 
<P>

<H3>Tom Brokaw: Hillary Still the Victim of Sexism</H3>
<P>
"Some of it, obviously, has to do with legal questions, as well,  
obviously. She's had to testify before a grand jury, but all that aside,  
and those are serious issues, do you think that this country is not as  
far along as we'd like to believe when it comes to dealing with gender  
equality?"<BR>
<DD> -- Tom Brokaw to Rosalynn Carter at the Olympics in Atlanta  
on MSNBC's<I> InterNight</I>, July 25.
<P>

<H3>Linda Douglass Shakes Her Pom-Poms</H3>

"The President again has had sort of an amazing week. The Democratic  
Party, which used to function like a herd of cats, has now very tamely  
crafted a very centrist Democratic platform that emphasizes crime 20
fighting. It talks about stemming the tide of violence on TV that is  
influencing our children, talks about school uniforms, talks about the  
death penalty, talks about tolerance for people who oppose abortion, for  
example. So, the President who was being abandoned by 20
his party just two years ago now has managed to oversee a party that has  
crafted this platform very much in his centrist image. Even though the  
background noise of what is loosely being called Whitewater continues, 20
none of it seems to stick to the President."<BR>
<DD> -- CBS reporter Linda Douglass, July 14 <I>Sunday Morning</I>.

<H3>We Lied: We Really Hate New Democrats</H3>

Sam Donaldson: "Congress had suddenly realized there's an election  
coming up, so all right, they're going to pass a bunch of legislation--"
Cokie Roberts: "Concentrates the mind."
Donaldson: "Like hanging, and in Congress's case, in my view of what  
they did, perhaps hanging would have been better. Because the welfare  
bill, we're going to regret as a country. It's not just anyone in  
poverty, it's the children. Throwing women and the children off the  
rolls. Everyone's for workfare, everyone's for changing the welfare system. Bill Clinton promised it. He said, however,  it would take $10 billion more to ease people down the ramp off this train. Instead, we just throw 'em off now and said [sic] `Good luck'!"  
<BR>
<DD>-- Exchange on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I>,  
August 4.
<P>
"[Clinton] knows that he is consigning helpless people to terrible  
hardship, and some to premature burials. He called the press conference  
to announce that he will sign the bill anyway....
Mr. Shumyatsky is in the U.S. legally, but is not a citizen. Thus his  
SSI checks will cease when the welfare bill becomes law. He will have no  
money at all. Perhaps he will set up light housekeeping in a park. Maybe  
he'll curl up on a grate. Maybe he'll do the
politicians a favor and just die."<BR>
<DD> -- Former NBC News reporter Bob  
Herbert in his <I>New York Times</I> column, August 2.
<P>
"Secretary, you find yourself now in the position of being praised by  
Newt Gingrich, at the same time that Senator Pat Moynihan calls this the  
most brutal piece of social policy since the Reconstruction. Doesn't  
that make you the slightest bit nervous?
"...You know far better than I do that you are rewriting the social  
policy of this country that has stood for the last 61 years, albeit with  
a lot of problems. Do you worry at all about the consequences? Do you  
worry at all that with a change this enormous,
people are going to get hurt?"<BR>
<DD> -- Two of substitute host Chris Wallace's  
six liberal questions to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, July 31 <I>Nightline</I>.
<P>
"The new landmark welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign  
won't be law for a while yet, but there is already a great deal of fear  
and anxiety all over the country about the impact it will have."<BR>
 <DD>-- <I>CBS Evening News</I> substitute anchor Paula Zahn, August 1.
<P>

<H3>Speaking of Formulaic Hagiography of S&L Cheats...
</H3>
"And don't labor to make heroes of the nonheroic. Air-brushing swimmer  
Gary Hall Jr., the spoiled grandson of savings and loan cheat Charles  
Keating Jr., by not mentioning that he was a major goof-off, 
blowing up mailboxes and tearing up golf courses, is formulaic  
hagiography." <BR>
<DD>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson complaining NBC's  
Olympic coverage was featuring too many personal stories, August 5. 
<P>
"Friends of Hillary Clinton would have you believe she's an amalgam of  
Betty Crocker, Mother Teresa, and Oliver Wendell Holmes...The former  
Hillary Rodham grew up in Park Ridge, a Chicago suburb, where her father  
owned a textile company. She earned every Girl 
Scout badge, pulled a wagonful of sports equipment to her job at the  
park every summer, was elected president of her high school class and  
earned so many honors that her parents recall `being slightly  
uncomfortable at her graduation.' She organized circuses and amateur  
sports tournaments to raise money for migrant workers."<BR>

<H3>Donaldson's Dole Strategy: Go Left</H3>

"I want the Bob Dole who saved affirmative action in the Nixon  
administration. I want the Bob Dole whose civil rights record is  
excellent when it comes to his voting record in the Senate. I want the  
Bob Dole who is moderate, who wants the big tent idea, who doesn't want  
to punish all those people who don't believe abortion is like a certain  
wing of his party does [sic]. And I want the Bob Dole who wants to  
balance the federal budget rather than give huge tax cuts in a  
pie-in-the-sky, let's follow this supply side mumbo-jumbo. But that Bob  
Dole can't seem to get out. And if it doesn't get out, I would agree,  
that's it."<BR>

<H3>MSNBC: Not Much of an Alternative</H3>

"I was just looking at draft platforms, Republican platforms, from South  
Carolina, Kansas, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Michigan, Kentucky, Texas, and  
Mississippi, and all of them are uncompromising, all of them written by  
the religious right, all of them uncompromising on this [abortion] and  
other issues. Are you really comfortable in a party where there are a  
lot of theological imperatives being imposed upon a political platform?"  
<P>

"If Republicans are the party of opportunity for most Americans, the  
fact of the matter is that you Republicans have occupied the White House  
for 20 out of the last 24 years and the economic inequalities in this  
country have grown. There seems to be a failure of correspondence  
there."<BR>
<DD> -- Questions from Bill Moyers to Steve Forbes on MSNBC's  
<I>InterNight</I>, July 19.
<P>
"But if that platform in San Diego contains the very strong  
anti-abortion plank that it presently contains, aren't women still going  
to feel, despite all you've just said, that there's a not for welcome  
sign out?"<BR>
<DD> -- Moyers to Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, same  
show. 
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Keep Moms on Welfare: That'll Help the Kids a Lot</H3>

"Mr. President, before we get back to the Internet questions, I wanted  
to follow up just for a moment on welfare if I can. If in fact you sign  
the Republican bill that's likely to come down from the Hill, all the  
projections show that that will push, at least short term, more than a  
million youngsters in this country below the poverty line. That's a high  
risk for youngsters in this country who are already in peril." <BR>
<DD>-- Tom Brokaw to President Bill Clinton, July 15 <I>InterNight </I>on MSNBC.
<P>
"There is something very creepy about the welfare debate....The  
politicians have gotten together and decided it's a good idea to throw a  
million or so children into poverty. But they can't say that. The  
proponents of this so-called `reform' effort have gone out of their way  
to avoid being seen for what they are -- men and women of extreme  
privilege who are taking food out of the mouths of infants and children,  
the poverty-stricken elderly, the disabled....Old women, small children,  
the disabled. A country that would single out such individuals for

<H3>The More You Know, the More You Believe in Nothing</H3>

"One reason the disaffection of moderate women has looked like such a  
sore thumb this summer, experts say, is that the moderates make up a  
disproportionate share of the party's highly visible elite. Many were  
activists who built the party before forces on the right took it over in  
the 1980s. Most are better educated than average Republicans, and higher  
levels of education tend to go hand in hand with more flexible stances  
on issues like abortion."<BR>

<P>
<H3>The Religious Right Ruins Another Country</H3>

"Bar-Ilan Street has become a symbol of the religious right's power in  
the new government of Prime Minister Netanyahu....Added to the fears  
that the ultra-religious minority will be freer under the Netanyahu  
government to try to impose its views on the majority of Israelis are  
the fears of the Palestinians. They see the struggle for Bar-Ilan Street  
in a wider context. They fear the religious right will doom any  
meaningful negotiations over the future of Jerusalem."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Bob Jamieson on protests by Orthodox Jews over a major Jerusalem road not being closed for the Sabbath, July 13 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>We Should All Be Paid the Same</H3>

"Governor, a recent study of household income by the Census Bureau  
confirms that there has been, the gap between rich and poor in America  
is wider than it has ever been and it is continuing to grow. You are a  
great believer in the benefit of the free market economy, but doesn't  
something have to be done to change this picture? And what specific  
steps would you take as Senator to make sure the nation's poor and  
wealthy are more equitable?" <BR>
<DD>-- Question from <I>Boston Globe</I> reporter  
Adrian Walker to Republican Senate candidate Bill Weld during the July 2  
Senate debate in Massachusetts with Senator John Kerry (D).
<P>
<H3>Gun Control Would Really Stop Violence: Look at D.C.</H3>

"The first requirement for being nice is to refrain from killing  
someone, and there we have a problem. But isn't it possible that  
Americans murder each other at much higher rates than most other  
nationalities not because we are meaner but because we make it easier,  
through lax gun control?" <BR>
<DD>--<I> Newsweek</I> Senior Editor Jonathan Alter in a  
July 15 issue story on how the U.S. "is not as mean as people think."

<P>
<H3>Far-Right Supreme Court</H3>

Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal: "Linda, you say this has been the  
Rehnquist Court, but what effect have the Clinton appointees had on the  
Court's decisions? How have they pushed the Court?"
New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "Well, I'm not  
sure they've pushed the Court, in so far as there's any, quote,  
`liberal' outcomes at the Court these days, it's kind of a holding  
action. These two, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, are liberals  
within the current spectrum of the Court, but it's important to realize  
how far to the right the spectrum has shifted in the last couple of  
years."<BR>
<DD> -- Exchange on <I>Washington Week in Review</I>, July 12.
<P>
<H3>No Truth in Talk Radio</H3>

"Let me talk about something that has always troubled me everytime I  
listen to talk radio as I travel. Democratic or Republican talker, it  
doesn't seem to matter, there just doesn't seem to be a standard of  
truth. I mean, it's like you're not really news media. You're media, but  
not news."<BR>

<P>
<H3>Oh Sure, Reporters Wanted to Vote for a Republican...</H3>

Margaret Carlson, Time: "This study is bandied about so much it should  
just be kind of stamped on your forehead, John. It is stamped on your  
forehead, I can read it there. The two candidates, remember, Bill  
Clinton was a New Democrat. George Bush now looks like the most moderate  
of Republicans. It wasn't even a liberal-conservative thing."
John Sununu: "And he still couldn't get more than seven percent of your  
vote!"<BR>
Carlson: "Well, I mean look at the two candidates. It could have been  
your candidate, John, and not a liberal bias. Bill Clinton was a better  
candidate. Someone suggested to me `What if the candidate had been Jesse  
Jackson and George Bush?' George Bush would've probably won. What if it  
were Jesse Jackson and Christie Whitman? William Weld? A Republican  
would win. A Republican would win!"<BR>
<DD> -- July 3 exchange on CNN's  
Crossfire about Freedom Forum poll showing 89 percent of Washington  
reporters voted for Clinton.

"Dole had been invited speak to the [NAACP] convention yesterday, but  
declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the  
All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention, this was quite a  
stretch and an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up  
here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and  
fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential  
campaign, Bob Dole might not be up to the challenge." <BR>

<H3>Margaret's Gossip Hypocrisy</H3>

"The press has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for  
the truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it. No one was  
surprised when The New York Post and The Washington Times reported wild  
allegations from a slapped-together and unsubstantiated book about the  
Clintons. But when a formerly immune host such as ABC's David Brinkley  
succumbed to the infection and gave airtime to the screed's author,  
retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich, the sickness had reached epidemic

<P>
"Leon Panetta's explanation is plausible to me only because back
then, in 1993, there was mistake after mistake like this. And the
reasons usually were incompetence rather than venality."
<DD> -- NPR White House reporter Mara Liasson discussing Filegate on
CNN's Late Edition, June 9.
<P>
"They are the White House and there was a legitimate reason for them
to try to get their files in order. They made a mistake, or this guy
who was a military attache whose job it was to try to put this in
order made a mistake. When it was found out that he made a mistake,
apologies were made."
<DD> -- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang,
June 9.
<P>
"I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt right now...I
really believe this was a case of general incompetence....Does this
matter? I guess the real question is, beyond an opportunity for the
Republicans to have hearings and to sort of drag out a Whitewater-
type escapade once again, does this really matter?"
<DD> -- Los Angeles Times Washington reporter Sam Fulwood, June 15 Inside
Washington.
<P>
"I think this is one especially that's going to backfire. There were
not files turned over; there were summary reports of background
checks. These were not files of top Republican operatives, the way
the stories first suggested, but alphabetical lists of people who had
access to the White House. If they look at what actually happened,
they'll find out there's nothing there."
<DD> -- New York Daily News columnist (and former Washington Bureau
Chief) Lars-Erik Nelson in The Hill newspaper, June 19.
<P>
"Hate radio and innuendo is going to put Mrs. Clinton at the center
of this, and for a party like the Republican Party that has this huge
gender gap, targeting the First Lady on every one of these issues is
not going to be effective politics."
<DD> -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on the June 22 McLaughlin Group,
reacting to the charge that Hillary Clinton protected Craig
Livingstone.
<p>
"The administration has adopted an it-was-an-innocent-
blunder defense on Filegate, and it makes sense: This White House
inspires a presumption of incompetence."

July 1 issue.

<CENTER><H3>Filegate? How Dare Republicans Mention It</H3></CENTER>

"The politics of Campaign '96 are getting very ugly, very early.
Today Bob Dole accused the White House of using the FBI to wage war
against its political enemies, and if that sounds like another
political scandal, that's the point."
<DD> -- NBC anchor Brian Williams on the FBI files, June 8 Nightly News.
<P>
"For a year and a half, the Republican-controlled Congress has been
bent on holding one hearing after another, investigating the Clinton
White House. This provides them fodder for yet another."

"These two dueling reports, the Democrats are real hear no evil, see

almost just an assumption of guilt."

<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Hillary's Psychic Friends Network, Media Division</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Inevitably, Hillary's solarium seances will be mockingly compared to
Nancy Reagan's astrology...Still, the joking is bound to exaggerate
the depths of the First Lady's psychic revelation. As [book author
Bob] Woodward's account makes clear, Mrs. Clinton was only imagining
what it would be like to talk with Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi, not
literally trying to `channel' the spirits of the dead. A long-time
searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. Clinton had conjured
conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt before she met Dr. Houston. Mrs.
Clinton is not even the first First Lady to dabble with psychics or
mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant,
John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding all tried, in one
way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike Nancy Reagan,
Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her
husband.... "And to many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed
conspirator but a martyr. Last week, 1,200 professional women
clambered into a $250,000 fundraiser for the Democratic Party in
Boston to see Hillary speak. Women teetered on high heels standing on
precarious plastic folding chairs to catch a glimpse of the First
Lady as she worked the crowd. Is there anything to Whitewater?
`Noooo, she's just being bashed by the press,' said Joan McGrath, a
retired telephone worker. Why? `A lot of people don't like a strong
woman.' To voters like McGrath, Hillary looks just the way she does
to her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure,
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<DD> -- Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, July 1 issue.
<P>
"Such role-playing conversations are traditional counseling
techniques, and Ms. Houston describes Mrs. Clinton as beleaguered, in
pain, and seeking help...The unwritten subtext here, of course, is
that even here at the end of the 20th century there is a political
price to be paid for those in public life who seek help for their
private problems."
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim Wooten, June 24 World News Tonight.
<P>
"Though somewhat of an embarrassment, some believe this psychic cloud
may have a silver lining. It could soften Hillary Rodham Clinton's
image as a behind-the-scenes power player by revealing a
vulnerability few ever see."
<DD> -- CNN reporter Kathleen Koch concluding a June 23 The World Today
story.

<CENTER><H3>Two Roberts Family Tributes to Clinton</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"That's what the Republicans did when they had the White House. They
misused the FBI. The same way the Democrats to some extent misused
the power on the Hill when they had it when they investigated all of
those Reagan appointees and it was the Republicans who were screaming
`No guilt by association! No guilt by association!' Now the
Republicans are misusing their power. That report this week,
Whitewater report, was so filled with `might have beens' and `could
have beens' and `should have beens.' They weren't able to connect the
dots except with these long loops. But that's what you do when you
have the control of these institutions. Both sides do it and both
sides do it. Both sides do it!"
<DD> -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on the Fox
Morning News, June 20.
<P>
"This has been a very clever thing that the Clinton campaign has done
on everything from '92, which is to say A, it's old news, and B, it's
politically motivated. And to be very aggressive -- and you've got to
give them credit -- to be very aggressive in going after the people
who are reporting it or the people who are leaking it, so there's a
backing off."
<DD> -- ABC's Cokie Roberts on Whitewater, June 18 Charlie Rose on PBS.

"Why are there so many church burnings in South Carolina? Some people

"Most reporters who covered Bill Clinton were of his generation,
identified with him, had a lot of the same experiences, were about
his age, and they were harder on him. It's the coach's son. You're
just so worried that you're going to give him favorable treatment
that it goes the other way."

Joan Lunden: "But it seems like there's more money being spent for the  
environment, or for the gun lobby, there are a lot of different groups  
together, not always in agreement. The federal government's talking  
about turning over a lot of the social programs to the states. What kind

Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund and  
organizer of the Stand for Children march: "Well the first thing is  
we've got to make a commitment and that's why...<BR>
Lunden, simultaneously: "Yeah, yeah."<BR>
Edelman: "...I've never seen 3500 groups come together across race and

net. We will not permit it...."<BR>

"There was a `Stand for Children' march in Washington today, joining  
people from all over the country who care about kids. But politically  
inspired right-wingers have assailed this gathering as a radical group,  
intent on expanding the role of government. In fact, the group includes  
the Girl Scouts, the American Academy of Pediatricians, and the Junior

"At his final campaign appearance tonight, Prime Minister Shimon Peres  
was every inch the elder statesman, 72 years of experience. `Trust me.'  
That's his message to Israelis. While across town today, his 46-year-old  
opponent, young and handsome, has American politician written all over  
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has  
advised conservatives like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The

had a situation where the peace process seemed to be going along well in  
Israel. Then an assassin kills Prime Minister Rabin. Then there are bus

<H3>That Old Cliche: Bias Is in the Copy of the Anchor</H3>

"You know the old cliche that we've all used over the years is that  
bias, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and we're out there on  
the cutting edge of change on a daily basis. That's what news is all  
about. That's the essence of news....The people, by and large, who are  
the recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most  
part. They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they  
don't want to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame  
someone in some regard and they think therefore since we brought them  
the news of the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change  
or biased in favor of what it is that we're reporting....I think the  
fact that we're still standing, this day, 35 years after we...entered  
this business, is some, immodestly, some small tribute the fact that  
we've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."<BR>
<DD> -- Tom Brokaw at the National Press Club, June 11.

<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"Today, GOP congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and  
given a battle plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it  
is long on promises and short on sound premises."<BR>

<P>
"When NBC Nightly News continues: in Washington, if they cut food  
stamps, who doesn't eat?"<BR>

<H3>If Only We Had Made Government Even Bigger</H3>

"Tim, curious. Would we still be having this discussion if everyone  
hadn't attacked the President's health care reform plan for political  
expediency about two years ago?" <BR>

report showing Medicare will go broke a year earlier than expected, June  
5 Today.

<H3>Tacking Against Tax Cuts</H3>

"Often, his [Dole's] condemnation of supply-side tax cuts has reflected  
the austerity of his Dust Bowl origins. Dole dutifully helped steer  
President Reagan's tax cuts through Congress in 1981, but he spent the  
next several years trying to dam up the river of federal red ink that  
was largely created by that deal."<BR>
<DD> -- May 28<I> Washington Post</I> news story  
by Clay Chandler.
<P>
"Ross Perot has said that, repeatedly, that giving a tax cut now is like  
giving candy to the electorate right before the election. Senator, you  
were in the Senate, and Mr. Forbes, you were watching it very closely  
when Ronald Reagan was President for eight years. Cut taxes, 25 percent.  
The deficit, with a Democratic Congress I should add, went from 60  
billion dollars when he took office to 200 billion dollars when he left  
office. So we can cut taxes, but it seems to drive up the deficit as  
well."<BR>
<DD> -- Tim Russert to Steve Forbes and Senator Bill Bradley, May 26  
<I>Meet the Press.</I> Fiscal year 1989 deficit: $152.5 billion.
<P>
<H3>Cue The Battle Hymn of the Republic...</H3>

"How can anyone argue that Bill Clinton has not been a good President?  
Business should love him. The country has been in a controlled boom  
since he bludgeoned through by one vote his first economic  
package....Workers should love him. There are more jobs than  
ever....Minorities should love him. He has a terrific record of  
appointing women and minorities to judgeships and high federal posts. He  
has put civil rights back on the table after 12 years of Republican  
neglect....
"No, it makes you wonder what the President and his wife could have  
accomplished these four years if they had not been consumed by these  
scandals, these lawsuits and these clippings. By almost any measure, the  
past four years have been spectacular for many Americans. Still, if Bill  
Clinton had been a full-time President, if Hillary Clinton had been a  
full-time First Lady...
"Would the poor be a little richer? Would the old be a little healthier?  
Would the young be a little smarter? Would the nation be a little more  
prosperous? Would the world be a little less troubled? You wonder. And  
you wonder if he wonders."<BR>

June 11 USA Today.

<FONT SIZE=2>Wishing Away Whitewater<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of
fading away, it's kind of a shadowy thing now, it's going away.&quot;
-- PBS Washington Week in Review&lt;M&gt; moderator Ken Bode on
May 24, four days before the convictions of Clinton's business
partners.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;After all the right wing's huffing and puffing,
the Whitewater `scandal' is dying out in wisps of smoke. President
Clinton's main accuser, David Hale, is currently tangled up in
his own lies at a Whitewater trial in Little Rock. Hale has had
two years in the witness protection program to practice his story,
and it didn't survive two days of cross-examination.&quot; --
Former New York Daily News Washington Bureau Chief Lars-Erik Nelson
in an April 11 Los Angeles Times op-ed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Anybody, it seems to me, who gives a fair reading,
Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three
years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton.
The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over
again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one
example, and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate
and should be there.&quot; -- U.S. News Senior Writer Steven Roberts

&amp; NBC, Feb. 29-May 20.)<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Welfare -- $53 billion instead of the $100
billion in last year's Republican budget. Medicaid -- $72 billion
instead of last year's Republican figure of $182 billion. And
Medicare -- $158 billion instead of the $270 billion Republicans
wanted to save last year. A major goal of Republicans in this
election year will be to repeat over and over that they are not
cutting funds from Medicare. Republicans would increase Medicare
spending but at a slower rate then President Clinton wants, so
it infuriates Republicans when the President says they're cutting
Medicare.&quot; -- ABC reporter John Cochran on the GOP budget
proposal, May 8 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>vs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The GOP proposal would balance the budget in
six years by cutting Medicare by $158 billion, Medicaid by $72
billion, and welfare by $53 billion. Republicans also are proposing
$122 billion in tax cuts, targeted to a $500 per child tax credit.
These cuts are less severe than those proposed by Republicans
in their budget last year....And moderate Republicans believe
they have abandoned the drastic budget and tax cuts of last year's
budget that contributed to two government shutdowns.&quot; --

loved a good joke, the dirtier, I'm afraid the more ethnic, the

except charisma and success.&quot; -- Walter Cronkite on Cronkite

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Moderates&quot; for Carter, Mondale, Dukakis
and Clinton<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think what you have now in the mainstream
media is a bias against power almost. It's a sense of anti-incumbency
that we in the media always zero in on people who have power and
try to hold them up to scrutiny and I think many times we focus
on only the negative and I think that's what the politicians object
to. In a book I've just written about the presidency and the press
I talk about this. And I do criticize the media for being too
cynical in dealing with politics and public life but I don't think
it's so much a liberal bias I think it's more just an engine of
anti-incumbency....I did a survey of the White House press corps.
And I found that the overwhelming number of reporters in that
press corps identify themselves as moderates.&quot; -- Kenneth
Walsh, U.S. News &amp; World Report White House reporter, on the
May 10 Fox Morning News.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton,
two for George Bush, and one for independent Ross Perot....In
1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael Dukakis, only one for
Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In
1984, ten voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting
for Ronald Reagan, and four said they had not voted for a presidential
candidate. In 1980, eight voted for Democratic incumbent Jimmy
Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven
voted for Carter and two for Republican incumbent Gerald Ford.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Dole has certainly shown understanding for
the handicapped, sponsoring legislation like 1990's Americans
with Disabilities Act....But how far does Dole's empathy extend?
He's helped the disabled but fought family and medical leave that
would guarantee employees the right to care for a disabled loved
one. He's been soft on the workplace and highway safety regulations
and gun-control measures that would prevent many disabling accidents.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like many people here in Stark County [Ohio],
a strong political bellwether for national politics, Mrs. [Judith]
Snow has been shaken enough by the Republican-led Congress to
move to President Clinton for now. In her case, it was Congress's
effort to scale back Medicare benefits. Three-quarters of all
voters questioned here in a new poll think that cutting Medicare
was wrong, including nearly two-thirds of all Republicans.&quot;

section.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;...at least the Republicans have made an effort
to position front and center this per child tax credit...as the
centerpiece of their tax proposals to kind of moderate the rhetoric
of last year which suggested that they wanted a huge tax cut for

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The savagery is actually a throwback to an

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Just as the U.S. economy looked like it might

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The country, it now appears, may be pulling
out of the recession. If so, it is doing so very slowly. The Commerce
Department says the economy grew in the first quarter of this
year at an annual rate of two percent. That's the strongest growth
in three years, but private economists say it is hardly enough
to create many jobs.&quot; -- Rather on the April 28, 1992 CBS

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You Mean the Camera Was On When I Admitted

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There is a liberal bias. It's demonstrable.
You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long
time. There is a, particularly at the networks, at the lower levels,
among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine
I work for -- most of the people who work at Newsweek live on
the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias....[ABC
White House reporter] Brit Hume's bosses are liberal and they're
always quietly denouncing him as being a right-wing nut.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw: &quot;I think Gorbachev
is a great man in the 20th century because he forced his country
to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of communism and
to begin slowly to make a turn away from it....He can still light
up any room that he walks into. The eyes are flashy, you know,
and the great command of the language and the feel that he has,
the very physical presence of him. It's still fun to be around
him.&quot; -- From the PBS talk show Charlie Rose, May 2.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Tom Brokaw: &quot;People will still be looking at
Ronald Reagan I think, too, fifty years from now.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Charlie Rose: &quot;A great man?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Brokaw: &quot;I think that history will have to be
the judge of that. I think that he was the right man at the time.
I think the country was adrift and he came along with his simple,
in the best sense of the word, philosophy about what was required
to get the country back on track, to kind of give the country
a sense of itself again. You can look at the economics of Reaganism,
for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy and
look at Iran-Contra and find all manner of flaws in there. But
what he did was give this sense that this is a great nation and
we're a great people and that we've got to get on with being that
once again. So I don't think he'll be a complicated Roosevelt-like
figure.&quot; -- Exchange later on the same show.<BR>

direction, and everybody seems to be already writing the stories

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think that there is cause for paying attention,

It's another thing though, and I'm not saying that Bill did this,
but some of his party colleagues certainly seem to be doing this.
There's a difference between getting Dole energized and writing

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The legacy of the Reagan administration will

a trillion dollars. Someday we're going to have to pay those bills.
As officials look to cut spending and taxes at the same time,
we can't afford another round of voodoo economics....I remember
that campaign slogan one year `It's morning again in America.'
Well, it may have been morning for some, but for a lot of people

<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton is much craftier than George Bush in
avoiding the kind of `Read My Lips' vow that allows no maneuvering
room. He can rewrite his promises to adjust to reality. That opens
him up to `Slick Willie' catcalls. It also leaves him the option
to do the right thing.&quot; -- Clift in February 8, 1993 Newsweek
story.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton's giving the best evidence yet of his
approach to leadership. It's about understanding, not threats;
accommodation, not confrontation; about getting people (or at
least Democrats) to sing the same song. The style is reminiscent
of another patient, nonjudgmental figure given to hugging in public:
Barney the Dinosaur.&quot; -- Clift in August 9, 1993 Newsweek
story.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The public might even be tickled to learn that
the prim and preachy First Lady has a gambler's streak. Hillary's
brief fling in commodities was possibly reckless, but it shows

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;But the Speaker is nothing if not a man of

his gender theories. You'll remember that Newt said, and I quote,
`If combat means living in a ditch, females have biological problems
staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get infections.' Now
I read this and the image that immediately came to mind was that

<FONT SIZE=2>The Sinister Gas Price Conspiracy...<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Good evening. It's the question every American
driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price
of gasoline going up and up and up. Is it the free market at work,
the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even
something more sinister?&quot; -- Dan Rather, April 30.<BR>

today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their
lowest level in ten years.&quot; -- Rather, same show, same night.

Jack Nelson in the weekly Washington newspaper The Hill, April
3.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Yes, it is time to increase the minimum wage....considering
the plight of the working poor, and the annual increase in the
cost of living, a minimum of five dollars an hour or so is hardly
outlandish.&quot; -- Time contributor and former Deputy Washington
Bureau Chief Laurence Barrett, same issue.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is a moral issue. I wouldn't pay anybody
less than five dollars and twenty-five cents an hour or fifteen

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You know President Clinton said, I think it
was in the State of the Union, Alan [Murray], that the average
Congressman, in Washington, made more money during the period

worker makes in a year. Now that's a pretty compelling political
case to make.&quot; -- PBS Washington Week in Review host Ken

gentle, warm, wry, wise -- and florid. But this is not a volume
without virtue, just as Mr. Wright was not, as Mr. Gingrich portrayed
him, a man without virtue....his role in winning peace in Central
America is beyond debate....There are also some striking asides
about politics, and about the personal price of politics. More
than anything, Mr. Wright is an expert in that. He, after all,
was the man who gave back to the House, as `a propitiation for
this season of ill will,' the job he sought so lustily, enjoyed
so thoroughly, departed so tragically -- and, this book shows
us, misses so desperately.&quot; -- Boston Globe Wash. Bureau

<FONT SIZE=2>Saving the World<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I wanted to be a journalist because I wanted
to change the world. Yes, I came of age in the '60s. All of the
people I knew had a social conscience, and wanted to make a difference,
no matter what profession they aspired to. It was hell in the
'60s; between the civil rights demonstrations, the anti-war protests,
the assassinations, the divisions between black and white, rich
and poor, young and old, it seemed sometimes the country would
be torn asunder. And it was my belief that as a journalist, and
especially as a minority journalist, I could communicate what
the problems were to the American people in a compelling fashion
and I felt that once they were aware of why people were protesting,
why they were angry, they could understand the problems and we
could begin to solve them. All I dreamed of, as corny as it sounds,
was Superman's logo: `truth, justice, and the American way,' for
all people in this country.&quot; -- ABC's Carole Simpson accepting

<FONT SIZE=2>True Confessions About the Republican Primaries<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;For a really good time, take the Candidate
Rate-O-Matic quiz, which asks a series of multiple choice questions
about where you stand on the issues...When you're done AllPolitics
sorts the candidates according to how well they match your views,
giving each a score. The closer to zero, the closer the match.
I took the test and couldn't get a candidate within 3,000, which
isn't surprising, I guess, since (full disclosure) I'm a Democrat
just like everyone else I know in the mainstream media.&quot;

candidates on the Time-CNN web site, March 18 Los Angeles Times.

<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote.
His manifesto, and there are a lot of things in it that I would
agree with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization
and pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an
extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond
any political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any
plumbing, he didn't have any electricity.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt;
Washington reporter Elaine Shannon on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal&lt;M&gt;,
April 7.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber.
Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting. The
original Unabomber -- the anonymous, hooded fellow, hiding behind
aviator glasses -- was uninteresting, a freak, a nobody. But Theodore
Kaczynski is someone very interesting indeed...I envy his disobedience....the
[manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can
be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force....If
Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly
not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have
many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our
front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic and manacled
before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber
set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society
that drove him to madness.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Boston Globe &lt;M&gt;columnist

<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: He's No Leftist...<BR>

is harshly critical of leftism.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Newsweek&lt;M&gt;
Senior Writer Tom Morganthau, April 15 issue.&lt;D&gt;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Yet no one, either at Michigan or Berkeley,
remembers Ted having any contact with the leftists he would later
excoriate in his manifesto.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt; Senior

&quot;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been
a disaster for the human race.&quot;&lt;D&gt;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>....But the Right Wing's Still to Blame for Oklahoma
City<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bill Moyers, promoting April 12 Dateline NBC on Oklahoma
City victims: &quot;They're angry now that, most of the people
who were killed were connected, in one way or the other, to the
federal government. They thought of themselves as public servants.
Then politicians and talk radio turned them into faceless bureaucrats,
and finally the terrorists turned them into victims, and they're
angry.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bryant Gumbel: &quot;You mention talk radio. They
have some very hard feelings about talk radio and the hate being
spewed by some of those on the far end of the spectrum.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moyers: &quot;If anything, talk radio in that part
of the world is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves
are saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the government
makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances against government.
But this is, this goes beyond that, it's excessive. And these
people take it like salt in the wound. They drive around, they
turn on their radio, they hear some vicious attack on government,
and they think, `You know, if you strike the government, you kill
my daughter.'&quot; -- Exchange on Today, April 12.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Brown's Death: Great PR! <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There has been a huge push to get rid of the
Commerce Department and this has been, I don't want to sound too
cynical, but this has been a great PR experience, in a way, for
the Clinton administration's view of how to use the Commerce Department
to promote American business. I think it will be very difficult
now to kill the Commerce Department.&quot; -- National Public

<FONT SIZE=2>Gumbel: Decency Over Politics<BR>

I understand that no Republicans have yet expressed condolences
to the Brown family. Is that politics as usual, or is that just
plain bad manners?&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Rep. Charles Rangel,
April 10 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Out of respect for the memory of Ron Brown
and his grieving family, I am not anxious to prolong this story.
Like most people, I hoped that decency would prevail over politics.
Those involved will have to live with the truth.&quot; -- Gumbel's

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Though Republican leaders did not attend the
memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to

<FONT SIZE=2>If Only Conservatives Would Let Liberals Solve Problems
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Let me go to the minimum wage though for a
minute...Ten million people would be affected by it. Most of them
live at or below the poverty level. And this Congress which is
trying to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit, which conservatives
used to tell us was the alternative, and refuses to do anything
about the minimum wage makes Marie Antoinette look like Mother
Teresa. It is just an outrage!&quot; Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, March 30 edition of CNN's Capital Gang.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If high crimes and misdemeanors have occurred,
by all means, the Clintons must be held accountable. But my head
spins to think of the time and energy the White House, Congress,
special prosecutors and legions of lawyers have spent digging
up and rehashing eye-glazing Whitewater details when they could
have been solving the country's problems.&quot; -- USA Today reporter
Leslie Phillips reviewing James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Policing Police Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I hope I'm not the only one to notice that
Nash Bridges, Max Swift, and The Sentinel are all indifferent
to the rules against breaking and entering, search and seizure,
and even kidnapping. Warrants are an inconvenient waste of time
and the Miranda warning is never uttered except contemptuously.
This same contempt for pious legalities, this coarsening of our
thin blue line has also shown up recently on Law &amp; Order,
NYPD Blue, and even Homicide. It used to be that we could count
on TV to oppose the death penalty as we could rely on it to favor
integration. But you can't watch any cop show these days without
hearing an angry centurion gloat about the options of lethal injections
and electric chairs. Imagine that: Society has reduced television
to the lowest common denominator, which is a lynch mob.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>The McVeigh Update: Conservatives Still Incite Violence
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The torching of black churches throughout the
South punctuates the ugly rhetoric of the Buchanan campaign....In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to
Pete Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting
white resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of
the New Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder
if their coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past
18 months, while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative
action, more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern
and Border states have been torched....there is already enough
evidence to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames.&quot; -- Time
national correspondent Jack E. White, March 18 issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Republicans captured Congress by insisting
that the government itself was the problem....But the Republicans
played Robin Hood in reverse: taking from Medicare to finance
reductions in capital gains. But no one keeps up with Buchanan,
who, drunk on his early success, turns to medieval war cries.
`The peasants are coming with pitchforks!' he bellows at every
stop. It's comic, captivating, viscerally appealing -- and scary.
Those black-leather bikers and gun nuts turning up at his rallies
may not have mastered the concept of metaphor. Urging them to
`lock and load' -- and take aim at `Jose' -- is virtually a request
for violence.&quot; -- Reporter Jason DeParle in a March 17 New

<FONT SIZE=2>   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like a stain suddenly ruining the new carpet,
the success of Pat Buchanan and his alarming snarl -- xenophobic,
anti-Semitic, misogynistic, homophobic and racist -- has sent
the smug Republican family into a dither of accountability. `Who
let that pit bull into the house and why wasn't he housebroken?'
they must be asking, as if Buchanan is someone else's dog....This
is not some mongrel outsider but rather a purebred from the kennels
of Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan....Buchanan
speaks for a good chunk of the party faithful who have been lured
into the fold with a message of fear and hate and now demand to
be heard. These are the folks who take seriously the charge that
immigrants and uppity minorities are the source of all our problems.&quot;-- Former L.A. Times reporter Robert Scheer, Feb. 27 column.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In the end, Pat Buchanan is a hater not a healer,
a guerrilla not a statesman. For all his flaws, Republicans would
be better off with Bob Dole, a man who thinks of his opponents
as `distinguished gentlemen,' not instruments of the devil.&quot;

think the fact that if someone survives for four or five years

they are pretty good at keeping independence in their reporting.

`They are more meticulous, more organized. More multidimensional,'

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist,
embarrassed Pat Buchanan today by embracing him as an ideological
soulmate. `Today,' said Zhirinovsky, `there is a presidential
candidate in America who is not afraid to speak the truth, that
truly the Congress of the United States is an occupied territory
of Israel. Your press,' Zhirinovsky went on, `is occupied, and
all of your finances. Americans don't manage those. Israel does,
through American Jews or Negroes.' The Buchanan campaign immediately
issued a message of rejection to Zhirinovsky. It's not that Buchanan
hasn't expressed some of the views that Zhirinovsky echoed, but
perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they sounded until he heard
them in the mouth of a genuine bigot.&quot; -- Ted Koppel concluding
a February 23 Nightline profile of Buchanan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;But he is worse than oblivious to the political
sewage. It is the medium he has chosen to swim in. Sometimes this
evil nonsense takes the form of language....In waging the culture
wars, he introduces a hateful ethnic dimension. Almost all the
20th century's horrors (the slaughter of the Armenians, Stalin's
starvation of the Ukrainian kulaks, the Hitler Holocaust) have
begun with a demonization of others. Buchanan has a genius for
techniques that bundle his enemies together and subtly satanize
them.&quot; -- Time essayist Lance Morrow on Buchanan, March 4.

trying to force you to report the news the way they want you to
report it. I am not going to do it. I will put up billboard space

I don't agree with Bernie on that. I don't think that people are
by-and-large conservative or liberal. I mean he was making the
point that they tend to be more liberal. I think that we are anti-establishment.
I think that journalists, you know, can make their bread and butter
going after the establishment, whoever the establishment happens
to be. And whether that establishment is conservative or whether
that establishment is liberal makes very little difference to
most of my colleagues.&quot; -- Ted Koppel on Goldberg's charge,

<FONT SIZE=2>Cronkite: Capitalism Ruins the Media<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Journalists....are fully capable, willing and
anxious to do a superior job of reporting the difficult stories.
The problem is with their employers who have chosen to abandon
their public responsibility in favor of stockholders' demands
for maximization of profit. Adequate profits clearly are necessary
for survival -- but stockholder greed demands superprofits. The
investment in a public service essential to the successful working
of our democracy is required to pay off like an investment in
the rest of the stock market. To play the downsizing game, the
boards and their executives deny to their news managers enough
funding to pay for the minimum coverage necessary to serve their
consumers well....A more responsible press depends not upon individual
journalists but upon more responsible owners. That is the bottom
line.&quot; -- Letter to Newsweek from Walter Cronkite which appeared
in the February 26 issue. (Italics his.)</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Eric Engberg's Story<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CBS reporter Eric Engberg: &quot;Steve Forbes pitches
his flat tax scheme as an economic elixir good for everything
that ails us....It's the kind of optimistic message people want
to believe. But experts have trouble with many of Forbes' specific
promises, like how the flat tax would boost economic growth.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Steve Forbes: &quot;By removing obstacles, starting
with the tax code, we are capable of growing at twice that rate.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;Time out! Economists say nothing like
that has ever actually happened...Forbes claims taxes can be lowered
without adding to the deficit....That was called supply-side economics
under President Reagan, less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't
work out that way. Is it fair to say the last time we tried something
like this we ended up with these hideous deficits?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>William Gale, Brookings Institution: &quot;It's perfectly
fair to say that, yes.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;And that if we try it again, your
fear is?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gale: &quot;That we end up with the same problem
again.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;....Okay, how about Forbes' number
one wackiest flat tax promise?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes: &quot;Parents would have more time to spend
with their children, and with each other.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Former IRS commissioner Donald Alexander: &quot;That's
right. The sky would be blue all the time.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;The fact is, the flat tax is one giant
untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting
it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania. Eric
Engberg, CBS News, Washington.&quot; -- February 8 CBS Evening
News.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Goldberg Reacts<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There are lots of reasons fewer people are
watching network news, and one of them, I'm more convinced than
ever, is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good
reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth
discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and
plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't
have to. It comes naturally to most reporters.....Mr. Engberg's
report set new standards for bias....Can you imagine, in your
wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's
health care plan `wacky?'..</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`Reality Check' suggests the viewers are going
to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr.
Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of
getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania.&quot; -- CBS
reporter Bernard Goldberg in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, February
13.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Circle the Wagons! We're Blind to Bias!
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I've never regarded myself as an ideological
warrior of any kind. It's too hard to get the facts straight and
also have an agenda on my plate.&quot; -- Engberg quoted in USA
Today, February 14.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>His [Engberg's] hallmarks have always been fairness
and accuracy.&quot; -- Dan Rather, quoted in the February 14 New
York Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;People are just stunned. It's such a wacky
charge, and a weird way to go about it....I don't know what Bernie
was driving at. It just sounds bizarre.&quot; -- CBS News Chief
Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer quoted by Howard Kurtz
in the February 15 Washington Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd.&quot;
-- CBS News President Andrew Heyward, quoted by Gail Shister in
the February 15 Philadelphia Inquirer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;What is liberal bias? See again, when you use
this blunderbuss criticism, I back off. If you want to be specific
and say Brokaw did a piece that was obviously biased and not balanced,
fine. Or I did a piece, or you did a piece, or you wrote a piece.
But just to spray everybody, I disagree with that. Be specific.&quot;

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! He's Never Complained Before</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There's no suggestion here that this man went
to CBS over a period of time and said, `Our stuff is all one sided,
we've got to do something about this'....There's no suggestion
that he has done that. He has simply stabbed this guy in the back.&quot;
-- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple on CNN's
Reliable Sources, February 18.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Goldberg has told friends he feels badly about
hurting Engberg, but that he has complained to CBS management
about a liberal tilt for several years and been consistently ignored.&quot;

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! CBS Expert Corrects Engberg<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well, and the fact of the matter is yes, we
did balloon the deficit with the Reagan tax cuts, not because
of the tax cuts -- we doubled revenue....Congress went along and
said, `Yeah, let's spend it all, and let's spend more than what
we're taking in.'  If we do the same thing under a flat tax scenario,
yes, we're gonna have a huge deficit. But if we rein in the spending,
we won't.&quot; -- CBS This Morning financial expert Daria Dolan,
February 13.<BR>

never run before. But a McDonald's visit trying to show he is

spent more on dirty-tricks negative ads than any other politician

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Bill Clinton has not done everything right,
but at least he cares for the common man. And tries to help everyone,
not just the chosen rich and big business who support the conservative
point of view. Anyone who would use a sticker `Hail to Rush Limbaugh'
shows me an incredible lack of intelligence and understanding
of what needs to be done.&quot; -- NBC Sports anchor Greg Gumbel

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Gwen, those in the media and his opponents

marvelous middle ground between capitalism and communism,' he
says....`While each nation has distinctive problems, for the United
States the first priority of the new order must be a revision
of the educational system to...guarantee that each of our citizens
will have equal resources to share in the decisions of the democracy,
and a fair share of the economic pie.'&quot; -- Former CBS anchorman

<FONT SIZE=2>The Media's New Campaign: Stop the Flat Tax<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The heart of his fiscal crusade is his flat
tax, a plan derided as `deja voodoo' by economists who blame Reagan's
supply-side tax cuts for the explosion of the national debt. He
has captured perfectly the fury Americans feel for a system they
think treats them like suckers while the rich enjoy a secret tax
code written just for them -- not withstanding his flat tax could
favor the rich even more effectively.&quot; -- Time Senior Editor
 Nancy Gibbs, January 29.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] is changing the debate in a really
sorry way. This was the week that we left an honest attempt to
do something about entitlements and we traveled into cloud cuckoo
land, which is where the flat tax is.&quot; -- Newsweek Washington
Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, January 20 Inside Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You know when George Bush called Ronald Reagan's
plan voodoo economics, he was right, and the people who are calling
Steve Forbes' plan voodoo economics are also right.&quot; -- U.S.

Late Edition, January 21.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] is a modern-day robber baron. He just
wants to legitimize an idea that will benefit him and his income
tax bracket.&quot; -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on The McLaughlin

<FONT SIZE=2>No One Left But A Couple of Thousand Reporters<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Despite what the Republicans may say, there's
no left in this country, L-E-F-T. Liberalism has largely been
pilloried, and successfully so, by Newt Gingrich and others who
preceded him...Imagine, here we have the freest nation on Earth
and our political dialogue is impoverished. You can't even acknowledge
being a liberal. This is not to say that liberals have all the
answers. This is to say, rather, that liberals have been excluded
from the table that might allow them to make a contribution.&quot;
-- Retiring TV talk show host Phil Donahue on ABC's Nightline,
January 26.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;They are still among the few people in this
country who spend a lot of time talking to other people -- and
actually trying to understand people -- who are different from
themselves. At a time when so many on the right and what remains
of the left actually brag about refusing to socialize with, publish
alongside or even speak to those who do not already agree with
them, the responsible news media provide the few vehicles by which
we encounter and try to communicate with each other.&quot; --
ABC reporter Michel McQueen in a Newsweek forum on the news media,
January 29 issue.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why Republicans Will Regret Saving PBS<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In working recently on a documentary about
Andrew Carnegie and 19th century industrialism, I explored a period
of greed, of rapidly growing wealth inequality, of painful structural
changes in the economy, or a frustrated labor movement, and of
unethical business dealings born from an absence of regulation.
I found it surprisingly good preparation for my next project,
a documentary about the Reagan years.&quot; -- Josh Clark, associate
producer for documentaries, WGBH-TV in Boston, in the January/February
1996 Mother Jones.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Newsweek's Idea of an Investigative Reporter<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`She's [Sarah McClendon] a real treasure for
journalism in this city,' says investigative reporter Robert Parry,
a former staffer with the Associated Press and Newsweek, now freelance.
`There was a time in journalism when journalists took pride in
being individuals instead of being members of the pack.' A disgruntled
loner, Parry is a perfect speaker for tonight's meeting. His topic
is the `October Surprise,' a much probed but never proved tangle
of allegations involving top CIA officials and monied Republicans
who supposedly schemed to sabotage an October 1980 release of
the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran, thereby putting the kibosh on President
Carter's re-election. Parry talks spellbindingly for two hours
about a House committee's classified `X-files,' which he stumbled
upon in `a converted ladies' room, with the tampon dispenser still
on the wall': the Hashemi brothers...BCCI links...a $20 million
deposit...David Rockefeller...the Shah's twin sister...a Marcos
bagman. McClendon appears to doze off during parts of the presentation,
then pipes up with such on-point questions as: `Was there any
sort of French intelligence input in those [classified] papers?'&quot;
-- Washington Post reporter Richard Leiby on gatherings held by
McClendon, Jan. 24.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You also quote a letter in [It Takes a Village]
that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was
in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there
is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You think government should do a lot more than
it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things
for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government.
How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's
kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government
needs to be more involved?&quot; -- Questions to Hillary Rodham
Clinton from Today substitute co-host Maria Shriver (who called
the book &quot;really terrific&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;),
January 16.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think it's been a pretty good week for Mrs.
Clinton. I think that a lot of people even listening to the program
so much today keep saying `What's the crime? What did she do so
wrong?' It's a little bit like the budget. Mr. Clinton's protecting
us and everybody is against him. I think there is beginning to
be the feeling of she's being harassed too much.&quot; -- Barbara

<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes Annoys the Media<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well it helps to know this about a flat tax.
It's a very radical notion and it's not nearly so simple as it
sounds and politicians are very careful not to put all the ramifications
on the table. But here are some of the basics....It is supposed
to encourage savings and investment because profits would be tax
free. But will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats?....Certainly
the rich would do better than the middle class....Here is something
else that worries almost everyone. You see no Western country
has ever tried to make such a seismic shift. How big will a flat
tax need to be to raise the money which the government needs to
run the country?&quot; -- ABC News anchor Peter Jennings on the
January 15 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Steve, isn't this a souped-up version of the
same kind of trickle-down Reaganomics that we saw through already?
Lower taxes were supposed to spur growth. Instead we got record
deficits.&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Republican presidential candidate
Steve Forbes, January 18 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] paints a vision of wealthy investors
shifting their money out of T-bills and into new factories and
investments. It may not have worked that way in the 1980s, when
top tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's
the reason supply-siders are often described as optimists.&quot;

<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You may recall that Ronald Reagan, on whom
Forbes models himself, said his tax cuts would balance the budget.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ABC reporter Dr. Timothy Johnson: &quot;Morally,
it is outrageous that the wealthiest country in the world cannot
provide at least basic care for all of its citizens, when so many
other industrialized countries have accomplished just that. Economically,
it's outrageous, because in fact we still do take care of people
outside the insurance or managed-care systems; but because we
take care of them at a later state, when they're sicker, we pay
more, and it's more difficult to effectively treat them. There
is no argument for anything but universal health care.&quot; --
January 14 Boston Globe Magazine interview.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Should Control America's Thinking<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Time magazine, to use that lingo, can be your
intelligent agent. It can also help set the agenda, so that we,
in a time when everything is fractured, 500 channels, you know,
hundreds of thousands of places to go on the World Wide Web, what
we do need in this country, and maybe in this world, is common
ground.... What I think Time magazine should be looking for is
the right tone, a set of core beliefs, and set of core values,
and I think that those are based on sort of a sensible American
common ground; an approach where we ask certain basic values we
all share like what's good for the kids? You know, clean up after
ourselves, certain faith in free minds and free markets and a
certain sense that, whatever the proposal is, the most basic question
we should ask is: yes, but does it work?&quot; -- New Time Managing

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He talks `devolution' to the point of distraction,

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Limbaugh's draft-avoiding, non-churchgoing,
non-voting, non-fact-checking, painfully insecure triple-wife
lifestyle all are topics delicately touched upon by Franken. Where
I think he really hits the jackpot, though, is when he actually
quotes Limbaugh directly as in: ...`I'm sick and tired of playing
the one phony game I've had to play and that is this so-called
compassion for the poor. I don't have compassion for the poor.'
He may not have cancer, either, and I would pray that he never
have to walk that particular path of pain: Yet who am I to say,
or how can any of us know, the ways of God in unlocking a heart
grown hard? It could happen more gently; I notice a couple of
weeks ago, for instance, they shut down that `Rush Room' at Blackie's
House of Beef. Limbaugh `is fading right now' in popularity among
the restaurant's patrons, according to catering manager Paul DeKoning.
Is this a great country, or what?&quot; -- Washington Post reporter
Phil McCombs (whom Limbaugh ridiculed in 1994) on Saturday Night

`to dump Newt you have to dump Blute.' That reference is to the

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Globe's Nov. 30 chart explaining where

the word `cuts' buys into Democratic budget propaganda. They've

sent out a memo endorsing the phrase `slow the rate of growth'

in a strong defense, clean water, and tight money. Now whatever
that makes me politically, that's what I am. What I don't like,
and if you want to see my neck swell or the hair begin to rise
on the back of my neck, is to be tagged by someone else's label.

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We're all deficit hawks here. Let's scrap the

we have to take so much more spinach in as a result of these tax
cuts. I thought one of Clinton's worst moments was proposing his
tax cut back in December. It was a weak one, and it didn't really
get him</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>anything and it looked like a copycat crime more
or less.&quot; -- Time columnist Margaret Carlson on CNBC's Tim
Russert, December 5.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If there is going to be a deal since both sides
have tax cuts on the table, I'm afraid we'll end up with some
tax cut, even though that's the last thing we need when we're
trying to fix the deficit.&quot; -- Time contributing writer Matt
Miller on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, December 10.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Is it too much to ask this: That both sides
spare us those declarations about how the government must start
operating like a family with a financial problem. Because what
family, with more bills to pay than money to pay them...would
say, `Even though we have to cut back, let's take what money we
can scrape together now and give ourselves a big gift.' But that's
exactly what both sides are saying when they propose a major tax

responsibility, as well as family values, and attacked her opponent
-- a very vicious campaign. All of those chickens are coming home
to roost, and I don't know whether she was blinded by love or
by ambition, she saw that money coming and she said `Come right

don't want their Congressperson to be either one.&quot; -- Time

into legal problems in terms of lawsuits, but I think all of us
may have done that at one time or another. You can't be responsible

which is a really bad end of the world. If you find yourself in
this situation, there isn't much you can do except one, starve

<center><h2> December 4, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 25)</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Gergen: Working Both Sides</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Congress now seems intent on imposing new burdens upon the poor, the elderly, and vulnerable children while, incredibly, delivering a windfall for the wealthy....This assault doesn't even count the $270 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare that is frightening senior citizens and could further squeeze public hospitals." -- U.S. News Editor-at-Large David Gergen, November 13 back page column.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"The Democrats were soon up to old tricks, splattering the GOP plan with charges of gutting Medicare, student loans and environmental protections -- charges wildly overstating the facts -- and public opposition rapidly mounted." -- Gergen's next U.S. News & World Report column, two weeks later.
<p>
No, There Are Simply Too Many TV Reporters with Bizarre Theories
<p>
<dd>"This year there's a Grinch: more layoffs in recent weeks by large corporations...And that fear could keep many from spending this year. Worse, there simply are too many stores and, says one expert, this season's holiday spending may not bail out the losers." -- Reporter Ray Brady, November 24 CBS Evening News.
<p>
<dd>"Though some VA and Social Security workers will return next week, the backlog of cases will be tremendous, and in the rest of government, problems are worsening. Imported Christmas toys, which could be unsafe, are not being examined by safety inspectors." -- Reporter Linda Douglass on the federal shutdown, November 16 CBS Evening News. 
<p>
Heard of Bob Dole? Lamar Alexander?
<p>
<dd>"Republican moderates may have reason to feel more threatened than turkeys on this Thanksgiving. With Arlen Specter's out-of-money exit from the '96 White House race, they have no presidential candidate to call their own." -- Judy Woodruff on CNN's Inside Politics, November 23. 
<p>
Bias, on CBS? You Can't Be Serious
<p>
<dd>David Gold, Dallas radio talk show host: "It's you folks in the media. Your bias toward the President and towards the liberals has been palpable, and it's understandable."<br>
CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn: "I don't know where you see that manifested. Certainly not on the CBS network news. I don't think you can indict us all on several bad reports..."<br>
Gold: "I'll give you an example. If you tell people, as Paula did, that Republicans are in quotes, `slashing' $270 billion dollars from Medicare."<br>
Zahn: "Did I just say that?" -- Exchange on CBS This Morning<M>, November 17.<br>
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- Zahn, September 28 CBS This Morning.
<p>
Eleanor "Squeaky Fromme" Clift
<p>
Michael Duffy, Time: "I think Dole will probably be more moderate."<br>
Mara Liasson, NPR: "Especially now that Newt Gingrich has become the poster child for Republican extremism." -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, November 12.
<p>
<dd>"Newt Gingrich teaching manners is like Charles Manson teaching nonviolence." -- Newsweek contributor Eleanor Clift, November 18 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
President Energizer Bunny
<p>
<dd>"As far as I'll go describing Bill Clinton is he's perhaps the most intellectually and physically active person to have held the job in decades. I've also said that if Americans were paying Presidents by the thought, we're getting a bargain in this guy because, my God, he's just always moving, his brain's moving, he hardly sleeps." -- NBC White House reporter Brian Williams, November 17 CBS Late Late Show with Tom Snyder.
<p>
Please Name One Actual Cut
<p>
"With the Republican Congress moving to slash many federal social programs, an odd hush has fallen over Washington: the sound of liberal advocacy groups that have been unable to create much of a clamor against the most drastic cuts in decades." -- Lead of November 24 page 1 New York Times story by Tamar Lewin.
<p>
"The real problem: Many GOP conservatives are determined to slash federal spending to the bone, even if those cuts aren't needed to balance he budget." -- USA Today reporter Bill Montague, November 17 news story.
<p>
<dd>"Republican policies in the age of Gingrich are not just mean, they are vicious. With its unconscionable welfare, Medicare and Medicaid policies, the Grand Old Party is gleefully shredding the income and health safety nets for the young, the poor, the elderly and the disabled." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, in his November 10 New York Times column.
<p>
Unbalanced Views of a Balanced Budget
<p>
<dd>"Let me make just one point. I'm for a balanced budget, too, but in American history, every time we've had a major, real drive to balance the budget it has been followed by a huge depression, economic depression." -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, November 18.
<p>
<dd>"The evidence is quite clear that the 1994 vote was more a negative verdict on the Democrats' failures than the result of some sharp ideological turn in the public. It's true, of course, that the Bolsheviks were willing to launch a revolution without even having a majority. But whatever one thought was wrong with the Republicans, nobody lost sleep at night worrying that they were Leninists. Maybe that was a mistake. As soon as he won his historic but far from overwhelming majority, Newt Gingrich began talking `revolution' and never stopped. His biggest revolutionary move was the balanced budget, which was built on ideas that were not discussed at all in 1994." -- Former New York Times and Washington Post reporter E.J. Dionne, November 14 Washington Post column.
<p>
Will Colin Save That Harsh Fringe Party?
<p>
<dd>"How hard a blow is this to the Republican Party? Has it, as Stephen Ambrose has suggested, left the party to those on the fringe right who all the hopefuls seem anxious to dance to?" -- Bryant Gumbel to reporter Gwen Ifill on Powell's decision not to run for President, November 9 Today.
<p>
<dd>"I think whoever the Republican nominee is will have to work very hard to have Colin Powell actively campaigning for him. And I think also Colin Powell will exact a price for that -- in terms of language, efforts to reach out to minorities, and an effort to make the Republican agenda appear a little less harsh to those who are poor and the working poor." -- NBC News reporter Lisa Myers, same segment.
<p>
Sam's Late Night Dreams of Powell 
<p>
<dd>Sam Donaldson: "I think he's still in it. Let me tell you the plan. It's next summer. Bob Dole looks like the nominee, but people are still grumbling and he's ten points behind in the polls. One morning at dawn we rush in the house, we kidnap Alma, we tie her up, we put tape over her mouth so she can't shout no, and we call him up. We say, `General, your wife is being held in a cavernous auditorium in San Diego.' He rushes there like a good husband. He runs through the curtains -- it's the Republican convention. They see him. They unanimously nominate him. Now he can't refuse, and so he's the nominee. You like that story?"
David Letterman: "Apparently, the sodium pentothal has not worn off, Sam." -- Late Show with David Letterman, November. 28.

<p>
<h3>Pouting Over Powell</h3>
<p>
<dd>"But what might have been is what is so intriguing: shrink the safety net, he was saying, but look out for the children. Cut the programs, but don't shut out the people at the bottom.... Abortion, no. But protect the bearer of the child and allow that person to decide. It was the glimpse of these views from someone speaking from inside the Republican Party that might have made for change in American politics. For the last generation, the Republicans have moved even further to the right. Here with candor and some skill, it was a political figure willing to move it back toward the center. That is what made today's announcement so bittersweet." -- ABC reporter John Martin on Colin Powell's decision, Nov. 8 Peter Jennings' Journal on radio.
<p>
<dd>"Most of them [Washington reporters] are centrists. They're not liberals, they're sane centrists, and Powell appealed to the image of why they think they got into politics -- journalism, to begin with....a lot of my colleagues are trying to accept the fact that the Republican Party has the upper hand, and they want a Republican Party they can live with, and Powell is a guy they could live with." <M>-- Newsweek<M> Washington reporter Howard Fineman on CNBC's Equal Time<M>, November 8.<D>
<p>
<dd>"Republicans...are, with calculation, risking blame for shutting down the government next week, or for the United States' defaulting on its debt soon after. In the process they may project an extreme, uncompromising image, the sort that contributed heavily to this week's election setbacks. Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a presidential campaign by Gen. Colin L. Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won." <br>
-- New York Times Washington reporter Adam Clymer, November 11 "news analysis." 
<p>
<dd>"I feel as if this is The Bridges of Fairfax County, and I'm Francesca. The graceful, hard male animal who did nothing overtly to dominate us yet dominated us completely, in the exact way we wanted that to happen at this moment, like a fine leopard on the veld, was gone....`Don't leave, Colin Powell,' I could hear myself crying from somewhere inside....Bummer. We were this close to something interesting and real, and it slipped away." <br>
-- Former New York Times White House reporter Maureen Dowd, November 9 column.
<p>
<h3>Klein, Heal Thyself</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Colin's crusade should be to rescue America from its poisoned political atmosphere....You have a great opportunity to recivilize the public square. Your mission should be to alleviate this awful screeching." <br>-- Newsweek Senior Writer Joe Klein on what he'd tell Colin Powell, November 13 issue. 
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"If he decided to run as a Republican, we'd all have to prepare for the unavoidable, stomach-turning moment when the general made himself available for a photo op with the oleaginous tele-quack Pat Robertson....[Gingrich] misread the public disgust with the tired, corrupt Democratic Congress as support for a `revolution' that abandons the poor while protecting gun nuts and polluters." <br>
-- Klein, same article.
<p>
<h3>Setting Up the Answer</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Do you agree or disagree that the Republicans in Congress are going too far in cutting back government programs?" <br>
-- Question in a Time/CNN poll, November 20 Time.
<p>
<dd>"First, the budget, passed by the Republican Congress, the biggest cuts in the shortest time in memory. According to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out today, almost three-quarters of those asked prefer a budget balancing plan that takes longer, but cuts less from Medicare and education. That's what the President wants. Sixty-one percent think that the President should veto this Republican budget as it now stands." <br>
-- Tom Brokaw, Nov. 1 Nightly News. Spending overall and on Medicare will rise faster than inflation.
<p>
<h3>Brutal and Deep Six Percent Annual Hikes</h3>
<p>
<dd>"White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said Clinton would veto the GOP Medicare proposals. That tough talk suggests the battle for Medicare may be the one that casts Clinton in the role his pollsters ache to see -- as the hero in the way of a brutal Republican juggernaut." <br>
-- Time Senior Writer John Greenwald, Oct. 16.
<p>
<dd>"The most important issue in the fight, which is sometimes lost amid all the talk of train wrecks and debt ceilings, is whether the Republican budget cuts will needlessly hurt the poor and the working class and thereby deepen divisions in an already polarized economy." <br>
-- Greenwald, October 30.
<p>
<h3>Conservatives to Blacks: Drop Dead</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think they're hearing the worst possible message out of Washington right now. I think they're hearing a message of harshness far beyond any rationality that they can see in the figures and the numbers that are coming out of there and the intentions that are coming out of there." 
<br>-- Former CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite on the message blacks are getting from the GOP Congress. CNBC's Tim Russert, Nov. 13.
<p>
<h3>Today's Top News: A Democratic Press Release</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Half of the program reductions included in the budget packages would fall on the poorest fifth of American families, according to projections by the Democratic staff of Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Another 25 percent of the changes would be felt by the next poorest fifth of the population. At the same time, the richest 5 percent of the population would benefit from tax breaks that, on average, are almost as large as the reductions in income and health benefits facing families with children, according to a separate analysis by the Office of Management and Budget....The immediate result, however, is likely to be an increase in the average rate of poverty nationwide and harder times for many families and individuals. Clinton Administration officials and independent budget analysts contend." <br>
-- Front page story by Los Angeles Times reporter Elizabeth Shogren, October 29.
<p>
<h3>Communists and Liberal Republicans: The Same </h3>
<p>
<dd>"The book is, however, a testament to the deep affinity between the two dominant conservative leaders of their time: Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev. At the height of Watergate, Dobrynin delivered a secret message from Brezhnev, urging Nixon to tough it out. When Nixon resigned one step ahead of the law, Brezhnev sent a generous, secret tribute. Brezhnev later demonstrated his conservative consistency by urging Gerald Ford to run for a full term as President." <br>
-- Boston Globe reporter and former Moscow Bureau Chief Paul Quinn-Judge reviewing Anatoly Dobrynin's memoir In Confidence, October 19 Globe.
<p>
<h3>So Much for Unique Political Analysis on PBS</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Well, will they get the blame for killing programs that help people? I mean, we've been talking about politics a lot, we're talking about size and shape and politics, but how about the issues that are involved? Won't Democrats get any credit for trying to save Medicare and other policies that help people?" <br>
-- Associated Press reporter Barry Schweid on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 27.
<p>
"The flat tax is a great one-liner but when you get behind the one line and look at it, it has some problems, the biggest of which is that it amounts to a huge tax cut for people with high incomes...and amounts to a tax increase for a lot of people who are in the middle, middle-income types." <br>
-- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray on the new PBS series Challengers '96, same night.
<p>
<h3>Abortion: Just as Bad as Eating Meat</h3>
<p>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?" <br>-- PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe discussing partial-birth abortions, November 3. 
<p>
-- L. Brent Bozell III, Publisher; Brent H. Baker, Tim Graham; Editors<br>
-- Geoffrey Dickens, James Forbes, Steve Kaminski, Gesele Rey, Clay Waters; Media Analysts<br>
-- Kathleen Ruff, Circulation Manager; Gene Eliasen, Intern<br>
<p>
<p>
<dd>"The assault on Medicare and Medicaid is, purely and simply, a naked grab for hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for the care of people unfortunate enough to have fallen ill....As the dollars begin to disappear, various money-losing services will go with them. Clinics will close. Research and teaching will be cut back. Access to physician care in general will be reduced. Growth is anticipated only in the areas of suffering and mortality." <br>
-- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, October 27 New York Times column.
<p>
<dd>"Republicans have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution, killing regulations simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson in an essay titled "Back to the Dark Ages," October 30.
<p>
<dd>"With Rockefeller Republicans like Powell on one side and the far right on the other, the GOP is wondering: whose party is it, anyway?" <br>
--  Newsweek headline, November 13.
<p>
<dd>"In the 1980s President Reagan made the same mistake. He promised that huge tax cuts would accelerate business activity and eliminate the budget deficit. Instead the economy stumbled, and the deficit rose to its highest level in history. Lucas' recommendation to policymakers: stop trying to fine-tune the economy." -- Unbylined story in Time, October 23. 
<p>

<dd>"Carver, who carries his Constitution in his shirt pocket even while baling hay, is a product of the same antifederalist ferment that produced such widely divergent events as the Oklahoma City bombing and Ross Perot's recent proposal to launch a new political party." <br>
-- Time  Erik Larson, October 23 issue.
<p>


<dd>"Republicans may have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, October 30 issue.
<p>
<dd>"For instance, projected Medicare costs will rise over the next seven years by ten point five percent a year if left alone...the Republicans would reduce that increase to six point four percent a year. But that's still an increase, says Gingrich, not a cut.
<p>
<dd>Well, I got to thinking about that and I must tell you I think Gingrich is wrong. Take a family of four. Suppose that family earns enough to buy a loaf of bread each day and everyone gets a fourth of the loaf. That loaf costs a dollar. Now, I know it really costs more, but let's just keep this simple.
<p>
<dd>Suddenly, mama gives birth to another child. It is now a family of five and the head of the house comes to Mr. Gingrich and says, "I'll need another quarter please to buy another quarter loaf of bread."
<p>
<dd>And Mr. Gingrich says, "No, sorry. I'll give you another twelve and a half cents. But not a penny more. I suspect that family will think it's just suffered a cut. No longer can everyone have a quarter loaf of bread a day...now everyone has to have less. Even though Mr. Gingrich will say, "Why, that family got an increase in its budget."
<p>
<dd>Now, any way you slice it, the Republicans are cutting the budget. Perhaps a good thing. Who needs a quarter loaf of bread a day anyway?" -- ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, October 31 Peter Jennings' Journal.
<p>

<dd> Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a Presidential campaign by Gen. Colin Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won. But the retired Army general announced on Wednesday that he would not run next year." <br>

<p>

<dd>"Let me hog the lectern for the moment and say that you expect the three far-right justices, Scalia, Rehnquist, and Thomas, to vote to uphold this constitutional amendment.

-- Mutual/NBC radio reporter Bonnie Erbe hosting the PBS show To the Contray, October 13.

<p>
<h3>Will the Lies Ever Stop?</h3>
<p>
"And on a busy Saturday this morning, Jack, we're going to get to the very latest on Republicans' plan to slash the Medicare budget." -- Today co-host Giselle Fernandez to co-host Jack Ford, October 14.
<p>
"Republicans are predicting victory today when their plan to overhaul Medicare is put to a vote in the House. Last night, Democrats were still attacking the bill, which slashes $270 billion in Medicare spending." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 19.
<p>
"Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?" -- Tom Brokaw to Tim Russert, October 19 NBC Nightly News.
<p>
"The House and Senate begin debate today on the Republican plan to balance the budget. It would slash spending by a quarter-trillion dollars, which Democrats claim would fund a tax cut for the rich." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 25.
<p>
"If enacted it would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor....It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government." -- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray, October 26 NBC News at Sunrise.
<p>
"Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and too extreme." -- Dan Rather, October 25 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor...For
weeks, Democrats have hammered Republicans for seeking large cuts in Medicare and other social programs to help offset the cost of their tax cut for middle- and upper-income Americans." -- Washington Post reporters John E. Yang and Eric Pianin, October 27 front page story.
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"An illuminating way to look at this budget is to take what the government actually spent and raised over the past seven years and compare it to what Republicans propose to spend and raise over the next seven years. The results: Spending will increase by $2.6 trillion. Revenues will increase by $3.3 trillion....Spending will rise by 27 percent and tax revenues by 41 percent....Consider Medicare. Politicians talk about $271 billion in cuts, but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than in 1995, an increase of more than 6 percent annually." -- Washington Post <M>columnist James K. Glassman, October 17.
<p>
<h3>Weren't Southern Segregationists All Democrats?</h3>
<p>
"Mr. Clinton has sought to keep blacks involved by standing up for at least some affirmative action programs, which is highly unpopular with many white voters. But he must also respond, to some degree, to the national passion for shrinking government, which will inevitably involve reductions in federal programs that poor blacks regard as lifelines, like Medicaid and urban subsidies. Mr. Clinton can only hope that his party is not punished further for its longstanding commitment to (and identification with) the blacks of America." -- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple, October 17 "news analysis."
<p>
"They were there to remind Americans that even in a time of conservatism and backlash, the business of racism and inequality will not be ignored." -- Time's Richard Lacayo on the Million Man March, Oct. 30.
<p>
<h3>I Won't Condemn Louis Farrakhan, But Bob Dole Is Sickening</h3>
<p>
"I think he [Farrakhan] has begun to rehabilitate himself. I don't know that it will ever be complete. I think he said so many vile things. I don't think we can ever erase that. But if somebody is going to do something decent and encourage the kind of expression of solidarity we saw today, I'm not going to condemn it. I think it was a positive march." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, CBS's Late Late Show with Tom Snyder, Oct. 17.
<p>
"He's [Dole's] a raging moderate in his heart. But the things he's doing now to pander to the right wing of the party are sickening." -- Clift, minutes later.
<p>
<h3>Is There Any Doubt?</h3>
<p>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is still being treated as if he were guilty." -- Bryant Gumbel, October 16 Today.
<p>
<h3>Reporters Aren't Liberal, They're Just Compassionate</h3>
<p>
Cokie Roberts: "I don't think the coverage of Gingrich and the GOP Congress has been liberally biased..."
Lisa Myers: "I also think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal vs. conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending money to try to solve problems. And it's compassionate to spend money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation." -- The ABC and NBC reporter on CNBC's Meet the Media, Oct. 23.
<p>
<h3>From the Conservatives You've Ignored</h3>
<p>
"This is a pretty big complicated idea and you're looking at a real bedrock program [Medicare] here. How come we haven't heard about this before? Where did this Medical Savings Account come from?" -- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus, October 20 Washington Week in Review.
<p>
<h3>Helping Clinton's Triangulation</h3>
<p>
"How do you view the GOP's courtship of the extreme and religious right?" -- Bryant Gumbel to former Democratic Senator Gary Hart, October 17 Today.
<p>
"There's a hollowness to the U.S. economy and -- as the President explained aboard Air Force One -- to the American spirit in this post-Cold War era. Doubt and fear leave people vulnerable to the seductive voice of extremists, he said, drawing votes from centrists like himself." -- Boston Globe reporter John Aloysius Farrell, September 22.
<p>
<h3>Bill the Terrific and the Fabulous Democrats</h3>
<p>
"It's nice, of course, if we have a President we like. But there's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, October 17.
<p>
"With eight retiring Senators, Sam Nunn being the latest, I think there's a lot of concern that this party is looking very hard to find its voice and find a clear vision for the fabulous record of things that it's done for this country, and hopefully that will come up in your next segment with Gary Hart." -- U.S. News Director of Editorial Administration (and 1984 Hart press secretary) Kathryn Bushkin, C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, Oct. 15.
<p>
<h3>Saw Off That Tongue</h3>
<p>
Tim Russert: "You're encouraging the President today in saying `Let the Democrats in Congress negotiate.' Are you not concerned that if you cut a deal with Republicans, President Clinton will saw your limb off?"
Sen. Bob Kerrey: "That's a terrible metaphor, since someone's already sawed one of them off." -- Exchange from the October 29 Meet the Press. (Kerrey lost a leg in the Vietnam War).

<p>
<h3>Let's Leave Out the Inconvenient Speeches</h3>
<p>
"Though not without controversy, it's expected to be the biggest rally ever in the nation's capital. Organizers are viewing the march as a peaceful time of atonement for African-American men, a time of reconciliation, a time of personal responsibility, and a time of healing today." -- Bryant Gumbel opening the October 16 Today, the morning of the Million Man March.
<p>
"Responding to a common problem, hundreds of thousands of black men gathered in a peaceful rally of prayer and atonement and were encouraged to go home and make a difference...very peaceful, it was a day of prayer, of song, of atonement, and one hopes of considerable action." -- Gumbel, next morning. 
<p>
"It would be astonishing if this public performance of Farrakhan were to end or even minimize the controversy which he inspires in the country as a whole, but it would be a terrible mistake not to
recognize that here today, he inspired many people, and in a broader sense, as one participant after another has reaffirmed, this day, at this time and this place, really did mean unity over division." -- Peter Jennings ending World News Tonight, October 16.
<p>
"Were you struck by the fact that these hundreds of thousands of men...did not come to the seat of power to ask their government for anything?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Penn.)
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"Blacks should atone not for our anger, but for not being angry enough at the growing racism and incipient fascism of white America. We should atone for not developing more political independence, more cultural identity, and more control of our economy, in defiance of white power, in defiance of Jewish
influence....White dreams have crippled many black children and white values have maimed many black families....In the military, we died to save European Jews in the 1940s and South Koreans in the '50s and Vietnamese in the '60s. Yet, since then, all three have taken from our community to enrich their own....We
are an oppressed colony in the most imperialist nation the world has ever known." -- Former U.S. Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) addressing the march, as shown on C-SPAN.
<p>
"When I grow up, and find a man of my choice, I'll produce like Mary, a man of God's divine race." -- Tiffany Jamille Mayo reading a Maya Angelou poem adapted by Louis Farrakhan, on C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Did Minister Farrakhan organize the march? No, Clarence Thomas and Gingrich organized the march just like Bull Connor organized the march in 1963." -- Jesse Jackson, shown by C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Whereas African black people have been forced to invest vast amounts of labor in the development of U.S. capitalism, but have never received due compensation for slavery....the Virgin Islands shall seriously explore the political status of foreign relations, reparations/repatriation issue within six months of the enactment of the resolution." -- March speaker Adelbert Bryan, shown by C-SPAN.
<p>
"In the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555 feet high. But if we put a one in front of that 555 feet we get 1555, the year that our first fathers landed on the shores of Jamestown Virginia as slaves. In the background, is the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial. Each of these monuments is 19 feet high. Abraham Lincoln is the 16th President, Thomas Jefferson the 3rd President, and 16 and 3 makes 19 again." -- Louis Farrakhan in a portion of his speech shown live by CNN and C-SPAN but not on network news shows.
<p>
<h3>Where's My Hanky?</h3>
<p>
"Before I leave you, a very personal question. How many times have you felt like crying today?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Maryland), during October 16 live march coverage.
<p>
<h3>Someone Got Released Too Early</h3>
<p>
"Black men's tension is compounded when we see how many, but by  no means all, white Americans respond with apathy and outright hostility to our distress. The fashionable formula offered by white demagogues for addressing black men's monumental woes -- three-strikes-and-you're-out, mandatory sentencing, and the abolition of parole -- is especially vicious and destructive. As an African-American who's gone the prison route, these sinister measures make me so furious sometimes my vision gets blurred. They make me want to lash out at whites in the basest way." -- Convicted armed robber turned Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, October 15 Outlook section article on why he would join the march.
<p>
<h3>Another Day, Another Round of Media Lies</h3>
<p>
"Republicans began pushing the last and perhaps most controversial elements of their ambitious legislative agenda yesterday, seeking to scale back medical aid for the poor and the elderly."<M> -- Reporter Peter Gosselin in a Boston Globe story headlined "GOP Pushes Health Cuts for the Poor," September 27.
<p>
"[Clinton's] focus on GOP Medicaid cuts followed similar attacks the day before on GOP Medicare cuts in talks to senior citizens in southern Florida." -- Associated Press dispatch in the September 21 Los Angeles Times, headlined "Clinton Sounds Warning on Medicaid Cuts by GOP."
<p>
E.J. Dionne, Washington Post columnist: "No one has talked about the Medicaid cuts, which are if anything much deeper and much more significant...I think that with those kind of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do, as Steve says, a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people." 
Mara Liasson, NPR: "....But you know, the cuts they proposed in Medicaid are huge!" -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, October 1. <br>
Reality Check:<br>
"Far from being a `cut,' MediGrant funding represents nearly a 50 percent increase in federal assistance to help the states pay health care costs for the needy over the next seven years....On a per-person basis, MediGrants will increase the average federal grant for each person in poverty from $2,188 in 1994 to $3,263 per person in 2002 -- hardly a `slimmed down grant,' as suggested in Post articles." -- House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley (R-Va.) in an October 11 Washington Post op-ed.
<p>
<h3>Pope's a Cuomo Kind of Guy</h3>
<p>
"Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of proposed laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's
programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of President Clinton's warnings." -- New York Times reporter Robert McFadden, October 5.
<p>
"At times, the Pope even sounded like a Democrat. His heart is clearly with the have-nots. And for that, at least, liberals appreciate his views on peace and social justice and the responsibility of rich nations to the poor....For sure, on sexual morality he is predictably conservative, and he often repeats his boilerplate message against abortion." -- Chicago Tribune reporter Timothy McNulty, October 8. 
<p>
<h3>Very Unifying</h3>
<p>
"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there [marching]." -- Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page on the October 15 McLaughlin Group. 
<p>
<h3>Yes, She Said "Popularity Control"</h3>
<p>
"The Pope's stands on issues such as, for instance, abortion, popularity control, birth control -- is he aware that American Catholic women, the majority, have different views than he does on these matters?" -- Giselle Fernandez to papal envoy Mary Ann Glendon, October 8 Today.

<h3>No, Ito Didn't Underestimate the White Jurors Either</h3>
<p>
"In his written ruling, Ito said, I'm quoting here, `The court finds the probative value of the remaining examples,' those not allowed, `substantially and overwhelmingly outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.' Do you think Ito has underestimated the intellectual capacity of this jury because it is black-majority?" -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Alan Dershowitz on Judge Ito's ruling that admitted only two of Mark Fuhrman's racial slurs, September 1.
<p>
<h3>Lying More Than Johnnie Cochran</h3>
<p>
"On Close Up this morning, Medicare. Republicans in Congress are beginning to detail how they intend to cut $270 billion from the Medicare budget." -- Bryant Gumbel, September 15 Today.
<p>
"The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital bell ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, September 16 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
"Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut. The question is how much and
for how many." -- Dan Rather, September 20 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Congressional Republicans are trying to squeeze $270 billion out of the program during the next seven years. The Democrats say the proposed cuts are too deep." -- CNN's Bernard Shaw, Sept. 20 Inside Politics.
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn, September 28.
<p>
"Just after midnight the [Senate Finance] committee voted 11 to 9 along party lines to approve an 
anti-deficit plan mandating massive cuts and changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal
welfare program." -- Washington Post reporters Eric Pianin and Judith Havemann, September 30.
<p>
"Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said today Democrats have a plan to save Medicare without raising
premiums or deductibles. He said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of
what the Republicans have proposed to slash." -- PBS anchor Robert MacNeil on The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour, October 2.
<p>

<h3>Cronkite Tries Spin Control</h3>
<p>
Caller: "You've been quoted as saying that you felt that most journalists were liberal, in fact that a good journalist was by nature a liberal."
Walter Cronkite: "I define liberal as a person who is not doctrinaire. That is a dictionary definition of liberal. That's opposed to `liberal' as part of the political spectrum....open to change, constantly, not committed to any particular creed or doctrine, or whatnot, and in that respect I think that news people should be liberal." -- Exchange on CNN's Larry King Live, September 11.
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"I know liberalism isn't dead in this country. It simply has, temporarily we hope, lost its voice....We know that Star Wars means uncontrollable escalation of the arms race. We know that the real threat to democracy is the half of the nation in poverty....We know that no one should tell a woman she has to bear an unwanted child....Gawd Almighty, we've got to shout these truths in which we believe from the housetops. Like that scene in the movie Network, we've got to throw open our windows and shout these truths to the streets and the heavens." -- Cronkite addressing a November 17, 1988 People for the American Way dinner as quoted in the December 5, 1988 Newsweek.
<p>
<h3>No, Colin, Not the Genocidal Republicans!</h3>
<p>
"For urban dwellers, and especially the poor, the Republican Party as currently constituted is the enemy -- the source of endless destructive, mean-spirited and racist initiatives....The unspoken question on Kelly Street [in the Bronx] was how, in good conscience, General Powell could serve as the standard-bearer of a party that is waging all-out war against the poor and racial and ethnic minorities (and which is hostile to the interests of the middle class as well)....For years, the insidious and blatantly racist strategy of the Republican Party has been to pit the middle classes against the lower classes, while sucking money from both groups up the economic pyramid to the smiling faces at the top." -- Former NBC reporter Bob Herbert in his New York Times column, September 22.
<p>
<h3>The Pope's a Crank</h3>
<p>
"There are 60 million Catholics in America, and for many of them he also speaks with the voice of a conservative crank when he stonewalls on abortion, birth control, married priests, women priests and so on." -- Washington Post reporter Henry Allen in an October 2 Style section story.
<p>

<h3>Nothing Dangerous About Abortion</h3>
<p>
"The picture, fed by conservative critics, of a festival of radical feminism where ideas germinated in the West were spread aggressively among wide-eyed disciples from the rest of the world, didn't match the conference that I covered....to those who argue there was a dangerous political agenda at work, that is true only if you believe there is something dangerous about helping 70 percent of the world's poor, who happen to be women." -- CNN anchor Judy Woodruff in a Washington Post op-ed, October 1.
<p>
<h3>Sounds Like Mario Cuomo</h3>
<p>
"Our viewers remember from '80, from 1980 to 1988, Ronald Reagan said he could cut taxes, increase defense, and still balance the budget. The deficit under Ronald Reagan doubled. The debt tripled, and home mortgage rates were 12 percent. It didn't work then. Why would it work now?" -- Meet the Press host Tim Russert to GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, September 24.
<p>
<h3>For Once We Agree</h3>
<p>
"The Standard is part of the process, whereas George is part of the problem. Why should politics need more packaging when The New Yorker has gone Hollywood, Vanity Fair psycho-babbles, and we've
already got too many television yak shows where Ross Perot flies in one of Larry King's ears and out the other like a maddened fruit bat." -- CBS Sunday Morning television critic John Leonard, September 24.

<h3>Someday, Hawaii Might Become the 50th State</h3>
<p>
"President Clinton will be attending more ceremonies in Hawaii marking V-J Day, Victory over Japan. Saturday, Mr. Clinton went to a ceremony on a hill high above Honolulu. He praised those who served in the military 50 years ago, saying they saved the world. After today's ceremonies marking the end of World War II, President Clinton will head back to the United States." -- NBC anchor Giselle Fernandez, September 3 Today.
<p>
<h3>More Insight From Miss Hawaii</h3>
<p>
"Let's touch on your hard stands against affirmative action. You were Governor during the Los Angeles riots. Many of the people there believed those happen not just because of Rodney King, but because affirmative action didn't trickle down far enough. How do you propose to cure urban problems without bringing some kind of economic equality?" -- NBC anchor Giselle Fernandez to California Governor Pete Wilson, August 27 Today.
<p>
<h3>Meet Clinton's '96 Press Secretary</h3>
<p>
"So perhaps the weekend of World War II commemoration was  somewhat of an epiphany for Clinton, and for the nation. Maybe the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II was a time when he came to the realization that his reluctance to answer his country's call was a mistake, and those who answered without
a second thought forgave him. How else do we explain aging World War II veterans, as giddy as children, jockeying to get their pictures taken with the President, and camouflaged young soldiers with shaven heads shouting out `Four more years!'" -- USA Today reporter Richard Benedetto in Honolulu, September 5.
<p>
<h3>Senator Bill Bradley's A "Moderate"...</h3>
<p>
"Bradley is one of an endangered species in American politics, a true moderate." -- CNN political analyst William Schneider, August 19 Inside Politics, after the New Jersey Democrat said he wouldn't seek re-election.
<p>
"Bradley...he's got the right profile, he's sort of in the middle and he's got integrity." -- Time reporter Laurence Barrett on CNBC's Cal Thomas, August 23.
<p>
"Echoing growing disillusionment in Washington by moderates of both parties -- including Bradley -- [former New Jersey Gov. Thomas] Kean criticized a `lack of civility' and `meanness' in national politics..." -- Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, September 1. (Bradley's 1994 Americans for Democratic Action liberal rating: 85. His 1994 American Conservative Union rating: 4.)
<p>

<h3>...But More Moderate Senator Judd Gregg's A "Radical"?</h3>
<p>
"Gregg-ism (the supine adoption of Gingrich's far-out agenda and Bob Dole's kissin' cousin facsimile) would literally involve the transfer of income and wealth to the occupants of plush homes along the quiet streets of Amherst and Peterborough, straight from the pockets of working and retired families from Salem in the south all the way north to Berlin. From his perch on the budget and human resources committees, Gregg has been a  down-the-line rubber stamp for radicalism; fortunately, serious Republican leaders to his north in Maine, west in Vermont and south in Rhode Island are picking up his slack. The good news is that Gingrich, Gregg, and the radicals are going to lose their fight to transfer income and wealth on this extreme scale." -- Boston Globe Washington columnist and former reporter Tom Oliphant on Gregg (R-NH), August 20. (Gregg's 1994 ADA liberal rating: 15. Gregg's 1994 ACU conservative score: 79.)
<p>
<h3>At Least His Victims Are Alive to Complain</h3>
<p>
"Good evening. Senator Bob Packwood has been one of the Senate's enduring embarrassments since it was disclosed that he had a long history of explicit sexual harassment and fondling, and now his career, his time as a U.S. Senator, apparently is very near an end." -- NBC's Tom Brokaw, September 6 Nightly News.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
Anchor Mary Alice Williams: "It was 20 years ago tonight that a car swerved off a small bridge on Chappadquiddick Island off Massachusetts' coast...NBC's Andrea Mitchell tonight on how Ted Kennedy is winning respect 20 years later."
<p>
Mitchell: "In reforming the immigration law last week, Ted Kennedy was updating the rules he first legislated in 1965. It's that kind of nuts-and-bolts work that has earned the respect of colleagues -- even conservatives." -- NBC Nightly News, July 18, 1989.
<p>
<h3>Harmless Communism and Its Harmful Overthrow</h3>
<p>
"But Vietnam's government is worried about the ugly side of the free market system: crime, unemployment, pollution, and most of all, political dissent." -- NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, August 4 Nightly News.
<p>
"This is how Arbat Street looked then, 150 years ago. None of the buildings still stand -- too much trauma. The end of the czars, a revolution, two World Wars, the fall of communism -- it's all taken a heavy toll on this tired nation." -- NBC reporter Martin Fletcher in Russia, August 27 Today.
<p>
<h3>The "Nonpartisan" Group Seeking to Destroy the Religious Right</h3>
<p>
"Norman Lear, veteran TV and film producer and co-founder of the nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization People for the American Way, has doubts about the merger of Capital Cities/ABC with the Walt Disney Co." -- Unbylined item in Los Angeles Times, August 1.
<p>
<h3>Pat Makes Them Shiver</h3>
<p>
"Pat Buchanan is seen by many in the party as extreme. That's not my word. That's not the Democrats' words. That's the Republicans' words. I was on the floor of the convention in 1992 when Pat Buchanan delivered that speech in which he talked about taking back the country street by street. That sent shivers down the backs of many Republicans at that convention." -- CNN's Frank Sesno on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, August 20.
<p>

<h3>Deficit of Consistency</h3>
<p>
"Apparently, the Republicans, who tend to govern by slogan, think the meaningless balanced budget and its accompanying tax cuts for the rich are more important than school lunches for the poor. That, of course, is absurd. The administration has proposed a humane bu dget that calls for no new debt by 2004, but the CBO, using less rosy projections, says the deficit would be about $200 billion then. So what? That would be just 1.7 percent of the projected gross domestic product." -- Former NBC News President
Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, September 5.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
"Before you listen to them trash Bill Clinton, before you put a new bumper sticker on your car, look at what happened between 1981 and 1992, the 12 years the White House was controlled by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. The budget deficit in 1980, the year before the Republicans took over, was about $73 billion. By 1992, their last year in office, it has soared to $340 billion (or, if you want to toss in the Social Security surplus, $290 billion). Responsible management? Hardly." -- Gartner in USA Today, April 18.

<p>
<h3>Failing to Help CBS Democrats</h3>
<p>
"So why not stay in the Senate with your party and restore -- if it's all broken, have you no responsibility to even your Democratic constituents from New Jersey who work right within this building?" -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith to Senator Bill Bradley who announced he will not seek re-election, August 17.
<p>
<h3>Gephardt and Daschle: The Media's Middle</h3>
<p>
"The Democrats can offer only a cacophony of views, ranging from the leftist tract of [Jesse] Jackson to the more centrist perspectives of House minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate minority leader Tom Daschle." -- Time Washington reporter Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, in an August 14 story on what the parties can offer Perot voters. Gephardt's 1992 American Conservative Union (ACU) rating: 0. Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) rating in 1992: 85 percent. Daschle's 1992 ACU: 22 percent; 1992 ADA: 95.
<p>
<h3>A Massive Six Tenths of One Percent Slash from the Federal Budget</h3>
<p>
"A bitter battle on Capitol Hill has ended with a deep slash in federal spending. The House made more than $9 billion in cuts, hitting education and employment programs especially hard. NBC's Joe Johns has more." -- NBC Today anchor Matt Lauer, August 4.
<p>
<h3>More Concerned About Investigators Than Investigated</h3>
<p>
"The Whitewater scandal occupied key committees in both the House and Senate last week -- a two-ring circus whose single goal seemed to be causing maximum embarrassment to Bill and Hillary Clinton and their friends." -- Opening sentence of August 21 Newsweek story headlined "An End in Sight (Maybe), Whitewater: Trying to finish the investigations." Story written by Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff.
<p>
"But these won't be the last ones. The Republicans plan several more rounds, and these hearings left us with more questions than answers about the tangled Whitewater mess and Republicans' motives." -- CNN's Bob Franken concluding an August 11 World News story.
<p>
<h3>White Men Ruin Everything</h3>
<p>
"Why don't we adequately fund urban education at the preschool and elementary level to eliminate the need for race-based admission standards later on?....The uncomfortable truth is that the tension about raceand gender in this country is not about facts; it is about fear. In the '60s and '70s, we settled all this on paper. We desegregated the schools. We admitted women to the Ivy League. We granted women control of their reproductive lives. And in response? White, middle class families abandoned our cities and schools to poor minorities. Universities educated the women they had admitted, then denied them tenure....We thought we had granted women the right to abortion in 1973. But barely a year goes by that the U.S. Supreme Court calendar does not include a case attempting to limit the right to abortion outlined in Roe v. Wade." -- Boston Globe<M> reporter Eileen McNamara in an August 16 front page "commentary." 
<p>
<h3>Internment Camps, Proposition 187: Same Thing</h3>
<p>
"Is it really a comfort to know that Canadians were as disdainful of civil liberties and common sense as the rest of us in our yellow fever?...In California, where I grew up, they're doing it all over again, punishing brown-skinned berry-pickers for the collapse of the aerospace industry and the savings-and-loan
scandals." -- CBS Sunday Morning TV critic John Leonard on a movie about Japanese relocation camps in Canada during World War II, July 30.
<p>
<h3>Abandoned to Crazed Uncles and Big Business</h3>
<p>
"The Republicans say they are for the poor as well as the rich. So how come they want to offer no aid and comfort -- and care -- when the poor are put upon? How come they want to eliminate  federal welfare programs and leave the poor and the sick and the unlucky at the mercy of the states -- some of which don't have a great record of caring for people who don't make political contributions. Why do they want to let states take away aid to provide for abortions in case of rape and incest? So only the rich won't have to bear children of violent strangers or crazed uncles? Do the Republicans perhaps have a double standard
-- not of men and women, but of rich and poor?" -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, August 15. 
<p>
"The sordid, cynical effort to pass regulatory `reform' is all about money. The legislation is designed to enhance the profits of big business by tying the regulatory process in knots. Government officials will be virtually neutralized as they are forced to make endless cost-benefit analyses before determining whether to protect Americans from unsafe food or drugs, from dangers in the workplace, from a tainted blood supply, from pollutants in the environment, and on and on." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, August 7 New York Times column.
<p>
"You're probably wondering how I'm going to make this segue from Gingrich to Galapagos but the point I was trying to make was that, in the 19th century, after Darwin, you had a movement called, that you know all about, called Social Darwinism, where people applied Darwin's rules of nature to society: survival of the fittest, the strong prosper, the weak don't. I'm wondering, do you, some people think we actually are headed back into Social Darwinism now, a new way of looking at society's responsibilities." -- Question from Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter to ABC's Forrest Sawyer, August 12 CNBC Talk
Live.
<p>
<h3>Never Mind Current Events, Media Can't Get History Straight </h3>
<p>
"The Russians attacked on August 9th; on the 11th the U.S. assured the Japanese that they could keep their Emperor. [Historian Gar] Alperovitz says this assurance could have produced a surrender without the atomic bombs. That is now the prevailing view among U.S. historians." -- NBC reporter Gary Matsumoto, August 6 Today.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
"Japanese students were still being drafted to prepare for the expected U.S. invasion; boys as young as 12 were being trained to fly Kamikaze suicide missions....Japan's Emperor and civilian leaders had wanted to end the war weeks earlier but feared a military revolt. Then came the atomic bombings. On August 9th
Emperor Hirohito summoned top government officials to the Imperial Palace where he told them the end had come; it was time to accept the unthinkable. Kasotoshi Hondo wrote Japan's definitive history on the last hours of the war. Through a film based on his book many Japanese learned...how the military
attempted a coup d'etat on the 14th of August. Several hundred troops stormed the palace trying to find the recording of the Emperor's surrender announcement." -- ABC's Mark Litke on World News Tonight, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Lionizing Politically Correct Cop Killers</h3>
<p>
"Sympathizers around the globe from Dublin to Soweto hail him as a political prisoner punished for taking journalistic aim at politicians, police and the prison system (most recently in a book entitled Live from Death Row). If he is put to death, they argue, he will be the first American since Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg to be executed for his political beliefs." -- Time Senior Writer Jill Smolowe in August 7 story on battle to save Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer.

<h3>Republicans Will Kill You</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Safe food, safe water, safe air, safe transportation. You have this protection now, but you might be about to lose it. Why? Watch a special In Depth report on NBC Nightly News tomorrow." -- Promo at the end of NBC Nightly News,<M> July 17.<D>
<p>
<dd>"There will be change, but most hope the original intent of the law will not be lost. Because if the plants and animals can't survive, what future is there for the human species?"<M> -- NBC reporter Roger O'Neil concluding a story on proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, July 28 Nightly News.
<p>
<dd>"This is deregulation madness! We're gonna have dirty water, dirty air. OSHA regulations are being rolled back. There's gonna be no competition in the telecommunications industry. And between local cable and local phone, there's not gonna be competition at the present time. It's gonna take awhile and there's gonna be no regulation in the meantime. And so no, he [Clinton] can't go along with this. And the people, the public isn't going to go along with this. They don't want E. coli bacteria in their drinking water." <M>-- Time<M> columnist Margaret Carlson, August 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
<dd>"The onslaught of political and legislative attacks on programs for the poor and for the young is about to create even bigger problems for America's troubled inner cities. Just yesterday, Congress killed nearly $900 million in funding for summer youth jobs programs, a major blow to disadvantaged inner-city youth and to cities trying to keep young people occupied and out of trouble." <M>-- ABC World News Saturday <M>anchor John Cochran, July 22.
<p>
<h3>Artful Thoughts About Lobotomized Conservatives</h3>
<p>
<dd>"The conservatives' agenda, if it goes through, is going to depress the quality of cultural and educational life for everyone in America, young and old, black, brown, male or female. This is one of the most ill-conceived, profoundly anti-democratic ideas ever to get loose in Congress. Private philanthropy will never be able to restore what seems about to be taken away. Some will not notice it; others won't care; given the shortness of American social memory, perhaps the next generation won't know what happened. Partial lobotomies work that way. They favor Beavis and Butt-head. Is that the business of American government?" <M>-- Time <M>art critic Robert Hughes, concluding August 7 cover story on plans to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.
<p>
<dd>"Welcome to the Hall of Shame, Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio. Chabot this week called the National Endowment for the Humanities a `boondoggle' while leading the House to cut the NEH budget by 40 percent. The House also cut funding for the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. These are the prize jewels of our national culture. As Arthur Miller writes in The Nation, America's arts are getting far less government support than any other advanced society." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang Sunday<M>, July 23. 
<p>
<h3>A Man of Peace</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Yes Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, you are the enemy. Yes Clarence Thomas, you poor confused fellow, you are the enemy, and we are determined to turn you around, and if we don't, you are leading our country to a racial confrontation that we will all be the poorer for." <M>-- Harlem's Reverend Calvin Butts, in July 25 NBC News at Sunrise <M>profile by anchor Ann Curry of the Abyssinian Baptist "whose life's work has focused on fighting racial divisions." 
"The words of a peacemaker, Calvin Butts." <M>-- Curry, immediately after the story.
<p>
<h3>Atoning for Prosperity</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole has deftly shifted far to the right on the tax issue....Dole shepherded President Ronald Reagan's supply-side tax-cut proposals through Congress in 1981, and then, as an act of contrition, spent years trying to reverse the steady rise of red ink fueled by a recession, Reagan's peacetime defense buildup, and the impact of the tax cuts." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Eric Pianin, August 6.
<p>
<h3>The Objective Eleanor Clift</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I'm a journalist, and I look at things objectively, and I think anybody looking at the Bosnia situation will agree that there are no good answers; and I don't really think this is something we want to play politics about." <M>-- Newsweek<M> reporter Eleanor Clift on CNN's Crossfire, <M>July 21<D>.
<p>
<dd>"That's right. It's not to anyone's advantage to have sleaze on television, and that's exactly what those hearings are. The Republicans do not have a single shred of new evidence." <M>-- Clift on Whitewater hearings, later in same show.
<p>
<h3>Know-Nothing Newt</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Great rhetoric, but Gingrich has trouble on the specifics. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, it's not what he doesn't know about the economy that's dangerous; it's what he does know that just ain't so....
<dd>"What's mostly missing from Gingrich's book is an analysis of what `winning' would really mean for millions of Americans. There is no mention of declining real wages or the growing gap in incomes and wealth, possibly for fear that raising the subject could fan some Democrats' demands for redistribution. And while he stresses the importance of lifelong learning, he doesn't reconcile this with proposed GOP cuts in federal student loan programs. These are strange deficits from a man who would clearly love to be President someday. Fortunately for the economy, Gingrich probably has time to do more reading and thinking before he ever sweeps into the Oval Office."  <M>-- U.S. News & World Report<M> Senior Writer Susan Dentzer reviewing Newt Gingrich's book To Renew America<M>, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Denying Liberal Bias is Nuts</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think this is another reflection of the overwhelming journalistic tilt towards liberalism and those programs. Now the question is whether that's bad or not, and that's another debate. But the idea that many of us, and my colleagues deny that there is this kind of bias is nuts, because there is in our world. I forget what the surveys show but most of us are Democratic and probably most of us line up in the fairly liberal world." <M>-- Time<M> Washington contributing editor Hugh Sidey responding to a caller who asked if journalists are in favor of affirmative action, July 21 C-SPAN Washington Journal.
<p>
<h3>It's Good to See Athletes Speak Out -- Unless They're Conservative</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Whatever one thinks of Winslow's positions, it's encouraging to see a Stateside athlete -- particularly one who rose from the squalor of East St. Louis, Ill., to earn a law degree -- engaging himself in the world of which sports is only a small part." <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>'s 'Scorecard' feature on Kellen Winslow's Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech supporting affirmative action and racial quotas, August 7 issue.<D>
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"Champions for Life, a 10-minute-long piece of antiabortion propaganda that first appeared 14 months ago, became the subject of controversy last week when the New York Giants made it to the Super Bowl...No matter how one feels about abortion, it's hard not to be repulsed by the video's inflammatory language....Jimmy Burt, Jr., the nine-year-old son of Jim Burt, a former Giant now with the 49ers, looks into the camera from atop his father's shoulders and says `It's great to be alive.'" <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>, Feb. 4, 1991.

<center><H3>Peter Jennings: You Voters Need A Diaper</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any 
two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: 
the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming. It's clear 
that the anger controls the child and not the other way around. 
It's the job of the parent to teach the child to control the anger 
and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of 
uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum 
last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: 
the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." -- Peter 
Jennings in his daily ABC Radio commentary, November 14.
<P>
"We say we are tired of politics because we are afraid of being 
fed simplistic lies. Yet voters are notorious for demanding that 
politicians commit themselves to cutting taxes while maintaining 
or increasing benefits for their constituents. There is no way 
those promises can be kept. Nevertheless we believe them, and 
express outrage when they cannot be kept. Believing invalid 
promises, hearing the siren song of term limits, listening to 
negative advertising -- all parts of the same dismal picture. 
Ultimately, many of the problems with politics may rest with the 
voters themselves." -- Jennings' commentary, November 3.

"The public seemed more intolerant than involved, uninterested in 
what the candidates have had to say, blindly voting against....The 
President might argue, with some justification, that it's the 
media's fault: we're allergic to good news." -- Newsweek Senior 
Editor Joe Klein, November 14.
<P>
<center><H3>Newt Gingrich, The Conservative Che Guevara </H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's 
gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the 
Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism....It's a record filled 
with contradictions: the family-values candidate who divorced his 
ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 
22 checks at the House Bank, and runs a big-dollar political 
action committee that won't disclose its contributors....Gingrich 
himself, bombastic and ruthless, would be the most dramatic change 
imaginable, a change the administration can only dread." -- CBS 
reporter Eric Engberg, November  2 Evening News.
<P>
CBS News consultant Joe Klein: "Last weekend, he seemed to blame 
the murder of two small children in South Carolina on the 
Democrats. He said that if you want to end that sort of moral 
decay, vote Republican. And so political insiders were wondering 
this week, would Newt's new responsibilities make him more 
statesmanlike, more responsible, less flagrant? Naah!"
Gingrich: "It is impossible to take the Great Society structure of 
bureaucracy, the redistributionist model of how wealth is 
acquired, and the counterculture value system that now permeates 
the way we deal with the poor, and have any hope of fixing it. 
They are a disaster." -- CBS Evening News, November 13.

<P>
"It would strike some of us that the campaigns have all been so 
down and dirty and nasty and personal, there's no overarching 
mandate that the GOP can read into this...My memory after that '92 
convention the Republicans held in Texas, is that a lot of people, 
even Republicans, said `Good Lord, what have we done?' Because the 
party seemed to have skewed so to the right. Well, the whole 
country gets to see that now. It's at least conceivable they set 
up their own defeat in '96, isn't it?" -- CNN's Mary Tillotson,

"You're aligned to a party which owes many of its victories to the

are historically insensitive to minority concerns. That doesn't 
bother you?" -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel to black Republican U. 
S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts, November 9.
<P>
"The so-called Christian Coalition, as you know, is claiming a 
great deal of credit for GOP victories across the board. Are you 
not at all concerned about where their brand of, some would say, 
extremism or intolerance, may yet try to take your party?" -- 
Gumbel to Jack Kemp, November 10.
<P>
"You said the American people gave very clear orders. I read the 
transcript of your press conference yesterday and you talked at 
length of a Republican mandate. But in an off-year election where 
Republicans won the majority of only a 37 percent turnout, how 
broad a mandate can you rightfully claim?" -- Gumbel to Senator

"Let me ask you about tax cuts. If you're going to cut taxes and 
make government smaller, what happens to entitlements? Are wealthy 
people going to have to give up the idea of Medicare or pay a lot 
more for it?....Last time that happened, in 1980, we ran up the 
deficit and also the federal debt to trillions of dollars." -- Tom 
Brokaw to Republican Senator-elect Bill Frist, November 9 NBC 
Nightly News.
<P>
"The fiscal centerpieces of the GOP program have surface appeal 
but do not appear to meet the traditional math test: They don't 
add up. President Ronald Reagan tried cutting taxes and increasing 
defense spending on the theory that growth would increase, which 
eventually would bring in more tax revenue. Then-Senate Majority 
Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) called it a `riverboat gamble.' And 
it was a gamble that lost: The federal budget deficit ballooned."

Tom Brokaw: "During the course of the last two years, they have 
passed the crime bill. They have made progress on the deficit. 
They have done things like the national volunteer service. Do you 
think the press has been too fascinated with other ancillary 
issues like the feud between the President and some more

"They are not voting Republican tonight, Mary. They are voting 
against a lot of unhappiness in their own lives....I think that 
it's very easy for the Republicans to make the same mistake that 
the Democrats made in thinking that somehow we've been given this 
great mandate....They have got to be practical. They have got to 
compromise. They have got to meet the real needs of people. This 
is not an anti-government vote tonight." -- U.S. News & World 
Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on CNBC's Equal Time, election 
night.
<P>
"The cynics would say this was a vote for gridlock, but I think 
it's easier to say, and the data points to the conclusion, that it 
was a vote for bipartisanship, for centrism." -- CNN's William 
Schneider, election night.
<P>
"If Bill Clinton and the Democrats were given a blow on Tuesday 
because they moved to the left, if the Republicans govern only 
from the right and abandon the center, my guess is the public will 
pay them back in the very near future....The American people 
aren't ideological. They don't want a liberal government, a 
conservative government. They want a centrist, moderate 
government, maybe tilt a bit right of center. They don't want 
extremes." -- Tim Russert, NBC News Washington Bureau Chief, 
November 13 Today.

"Both parties were sounding very conciliatory the morning after 
these midterm elections. But now it appears the gloves are 
starting to come out [sic]. We just heard Newt Gingrich make some

this as a major redirection for America?" -- Today co-host Katie

"I want you to think about this question not as a partisan

Two years ago the American voters gave Bill Clinton a mandate for 
change. He went to Washington, sought to create change. He had 
internal problems with his staff, he had external problems. There 
were questions about his personality, his character, et cetera. 
But I don't think anyone can question that this man and his staff 
sought what was best for the United States. Tonight, it is clear 
voters coast to coast in this country have said `We want a 
change.' Now Republicans had voted this Democrat to be virtually, 
or described him as a monster. My question is essentially this: 
Where did he go wrong? What did he do so wrong that was against 
the American body politic, considering that he loves this country 
as much as you and I do?" -- CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Pat

<img src ="/mrc/images/famsmall.gif" align="right">Parents have every reason to be frustrated with the lack of quality television programming.

"The <I>Family Guide</I> provides parents with the critical information needed to make intelligent viewing choices about their children's television viewing.

<title>Rating System</title>
<center><h2><I>How Does the Rating System Rate?</i></h2></center>
<p>
As had long been expected, the television industry plans to rate its programming using an age-based system similar to the movie rating system implemented in the 1960s. The TV version reportedly will include the categories TV-K7 (given to shows suitable for children over seven years of age) and TV-14, which would apply to adult-oriented fare like "The X-Files." <br>
<p>

The industry acted in the face of overwhelming public support for a system that would rate shows according to types of content, notably sex, vulgar language, and violence. A recent poll of PTA members indicated that 80 percent favor such a system. So does the Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors, members of which include Norman Lear and Aaron Spelling.<br>
<p>

Of course, no rating system addresses prime time TV's biggest problem - its plethora of raunchy, tasteless  shows. Furthermore, this system doesn't do enough to help parents determine what their children should and shouldn't watch. A mother is likelier to allow her fourteen-year-old to view Fox's horrific "Millennium" if it's rated TV-14 than she is if it's rated more specifically --  say, V+ for frequent, graphic violence. <br>
<p>
A vague age-based system presumably is better for the networks' bottom lines, however. Fredric Biddle of the Boston Globe has pointed out that "ABC learned the hard way after the debut of 'NYPD Blue' that a disclaimer can frighten advertisers." (In the case of that drama, the disclaimer, which appears just before each episode, is content-specific, stating that the show contains "adult language" and, sometimes, "partial nudity.") Biddle continued, "Though advertisers now love ['NYPD Blue'], networks simply don't want to endure that sort of trauma again."<br>
<p>
Networks unwilling to eschew envelope-pushing programs at least can (and should) air them late in the evening. ABC has moved "Ellen" from 8 to 9:30, but many inappropriate shows remain in early prime time, including NBC's "Friends" and Fox's "Melrose Place."<br>

<center><h2>Special Project & Report:<br>Bringing Back the Family Hour</h2></center>
	The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved national attention and impressive results. 
<P>
	At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the television networks to bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over <a href="/mrc/ptc/famhrad.html">70 members of Congress signed on to a letter </a> urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety.</i> Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah,</i> which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
	The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results.
<P>
	On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
	Bozell's "eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on the decision-making process at the network," echoed Jacqueline Lovejoy, the show's publicist. "[His] voice was powerful, and it was heard."
<P>
	Brandon Tartikoff, former chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah's</i> production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told <i><a href="/mrc/flash/flash.html"> Flash </a> </i> that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<a name="Summary"<a/>
<center><h3>Executive Summary</h3><P>
</center>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p>

<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>

   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.<p>

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.
<p>
  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
<p> 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>

  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
  <p> 
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  <p>
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  
<p>

   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   

<p>
  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   <p>
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
  <p> 
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
  <p> 
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
 <p> 
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
  <p> 
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
  <p> 
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
 <p> 

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
 <p> 
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
 <p> 
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
  <p> 
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
<p> 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 

<hr>
<a name="Three"</a>
<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>
   
<hr>
<a name="quan"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<hr>
<a name="rec"</a>
<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

<center><h2>Top 10 Best and Worst Primetime TV Shows</h2></center>
<P>
 MRC research has shown that while the number of prime time series
containing gratuitous sex and obscene language has increased,
wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment
Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the
least family-friendly prime time shows, but also named several
programs which respect family values and are appropriate for audiences
of all ages. 
<P>

<P>
 This report, which has been distributed to thousands of journalists
-- including television critics from print publications and television,
and radio talk show hosts, is the culmination of thousands of
hours of television analysis. As of press time, this annual season-end
tally has received widespread coverage in several major media
outlets, including <I>USA Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>,
<I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and was even included in Jay Leno's<I>
Tonight Show</I> monologue. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><h3>The Top Ten Least Family Friendly shows, in ranking
order:
</h3></CENTER>
<P>
1.<I><B>Married...With Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 9:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 The crudest comedy on prime time television, <I>Married</I> routinely
ridicules the family. Every week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot;
trade insults, celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom humor;
this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with lewd punch lines about
sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle, and the lead character's
fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs.
<P>
2. <I><B>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content despite the
show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. Virtually every episode
revolves around sexual themes and contains inappropriate language,
and each of the six central characters, all single twentysomethings,
is sexually active. Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting
and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>
3. <I><B>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 pm time slot
has done little to mitigate the show's content. The series' central
characters are openly derisive of their parents; religion and
the religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; premarital
sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>
4. <I><B>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly in and out of
one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex.
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with
one gay character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>
5. <I><B>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) Miniseries
<P>
 Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members
of a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in
public while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital
andextramarital affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up
schemes. 
<P>
6. <I><B>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, <I>CPW</I>
condoned premarital sex and adultery, and aired scenes containing
foul language and explicitly sexual content. Fortunately, the
acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in
to its sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>
7. <I><B>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) Thursday 9:30 EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with obscenity-laden
skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers withdrew
their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off
the air.
<P>
8. <I><B>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits. Dialogue
is littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive
scenarios. The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution
of marriage. Casual sex -- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>
9. <I><B>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) Wednesday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity,
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been
more than happy to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and
completely inconsequential --  fact of college life. The teen-targeted
soap sends mixed messages on drugs: positive characters deride
substance abuse, but rarely address the illegality of drug use.
<P>
10.<I><B> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom.
Most of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with
sexual references and obscene language.
<P>
<BR>

<center><h3>The Most Family Friendly Shows</h3></center>
<P>
 The Most Family-friendly shows on prime time contain wholesome
subject matter for viewing by all ages. These prime time offerings
include:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Touched By an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 One of CBS' few success stories of the season, <I>Touched By
An Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of traditional values
on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama showcases God's
message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of prayer,
and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties.
<P>
<I><B>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's
most pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental
authority as the key to a strong family unit, and advocate premarital
chastity, individual responsibility, and faith.
<P>
<I><B>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title
character, a young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of
his three younger siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices
to ensure that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing.
The show imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and
taking responsibility for one's actions.
<P>
<I><B>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
<I> Dr. Quinn's</I> promotion of traditional values has endeared
it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and family are staunchly
promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and respect for parental
authority. The drama boasts one of prime time's most positive
clerics -- &quot;the Reverend,&quot; a series regular, is depicted
as an intelligent, caring, and very dedicated member of the community.
<P>
<I><B>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife,
and their children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable
lessons about teenage drinking, honesty, respect and the importance
of education. One of prime time's foremost advocates of the institution
of marriage, the show frequently addresses the challenges faced
by the husband and wife and the steps they take toward strengthening
their relationship. 
<P>
<I><B>Lois &amp; Clark: the New Adventures of Superman</B></I>
(ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive dialogue and
sexual references of its 1993-94 inaugural season, and, in the
words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove
that television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator
to provide quality entertainment: dialogue and fast-paced action
sequences are free of offensive language and sexual innuendo,
and the newly-engaged protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P>
<I><B>The Parent 'Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 'Hood'</I>s central
characters provide positive role models for viewers of all ages.
The happily-married African-American couple, both successful professionals,
teach their children that education, self-discipline and integrity
are keys to success. The positive impact of a father in the household,
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage is also underscored.

<h2><center>
ABOUT THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL
</center></h2><br><p><b>
"Bringing responsibility to television programming"</b>
<P>
The Parents Television Council (PTC) was established in 1995 as a special project of the 
Media Research Center to bring America's demand for values-driven television programming to 
the entertainment industry.
<P>
The PTC offers private sector solutions to restore television to its roots as an independent 
and socially responsible entertainment medium. Much of the PTC's success stems from urging 
the public to voice its support of family-friendly programming to network executives, 
advertisers, and public policy leaders. The PTC has employed these efforts to help save values- 
driven shows such as ABC's <i>Second Noah</i> and CBS's <i>Touched By An Angel</i>.
<P>
Along with empowering the public to voice their concerns, the PTC organized a star-
studded group of industry leaders to become members of  the Parents Televisions Council's  
Advisory Board. These spokespersons address issues relating to television entertainment and its 
impact on families across America.
<P>
More information on the PTC can be found in its flagship publication, the <a href="/mrc/entertainment/95famgui.html">1995-`96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Programming</a>, the only comprehensive study of prime time's 
content available in America. Profiling every sitcom and drama on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN 
and WB, the <i>Family Guide</i> provides viewers with information on subject matter that is 
inappropriate for children while also identifying shows which promote family-friendly themes.
<P>
For more information on the Parents Television Council, or to simply give us your 
feedback on today's prime time programming, please <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">e-mail</a> us.

<p>
Dear Mr. Harbert, Mr. Moonves, Mr. Matoian, Mr. Littlefield, Ms. Salhany, and Mr. Kellner:
<p>
     Until recently, the major networks set aside the first hour 
of prime time for family programming. This timeslot featured such 
wholesome series as <i>Happy Days</i>, <i>Little House on 
the Prairie</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>; adult-oriented fare was relegated to the late evening hours.
<p>     
This voluntary covenant with the viewing public has disintegrated to the point where the former Family Hour now features sitcoms and dramas promoting promiscuity and obscene language.
<p>     
We, the Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, urge you, the leaders of the 
major commercial broadcast networks, to recognize the pernicious effects of this programming on our children and voluntarily 
return to the spirit of the Family Hour. By creating a safe haven for the family viewing audience, and resolving to dedicate one 
hour of prime time programming to the promotion of positive values, the entertainment industry would not only endear itself to 
parents, but also immeasurably benefit American society.

<TITLE> Restoring Family Hour </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Restoring the Spirit of The Family Hour</h2></center>
<P>
The Media Research Center's campaign to restore the spirit of the "Family Hour" has had impressive results. 
<P>
In April, the MRC organized a bi-partisan coalition of United States Senators and Representatives who challenged the television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full-page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<p> 
MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah</i>, which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results: On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, then the chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah</i>'s production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told Flash, the MRC's monthly membership newsletter, that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<P>
<I>Dear Friend,<BR>
<P>							

After spending weeks predicting the Republicans' chances of holding on to their majorities in Congress were shaky at best, the media completely ignored their stunning comeback on Election Day. <BR>
<P>

Think about it. Big Labor, according to <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, spent nearly $500 million in a savage, year-long campaign of distortions and outright lies, to defeat the Republicans. Their primary targets were the conservative freshmen in the House; the unions were out to destroy them. <BR>
<P>

Other left-wing special interests, from Hollywood to wacky environmentalists, spent millions more. Topping it off Bill Clinton and Al Gore lied in the national debates, in nationwide advertisements, and in hundreds of speeches, constantly endorsing conservative issues they'd actually vetoed! <BR>
<P>

It was, to my thinking, the most dishonest campaign I've ever seen. <BR>
<P>

So, where was the national press holding the Clinton campaign accountable for all the distortions and lies? Why didn't the national media expose the fact that 35% of union members voted Republican - yet union bosses forced them to pay for the anti-GOP ads? Where were the investigative reports on Clinton scandals by the television networks? Nowhere. The left wing so-called "objective" media did nothing to expose this fraud. <BR>
<P>

Why? Maybe because the media themselves have been promoting the very same anti-GOP distortions while actively pushing for Clinton's re-election. <BR>
<P>

This election not only proved to be an egg-on-your-face embarrassment for the unions and bureaucrat-hugging environmentalists, it was an embarrassment for the media.  Conservatives survived in the House, even increased their numbers in the Senate. <BR>
<P>

This past year we've updated you on our <a href="/mrc/reality/"> Media Reality Check '96 </a> campaign to hold the media accountable for their lies and distortions. Thanks to all your support, our campaign reached millions of Americans daily through newspapers, magazines, and talk radio. Because of our campaign, some reporters are now -- finally! --  admitting there is a liberal bias in the media. Even Walter Cronkite is admitting what he denied for 30 years. "Everyone knows that there is a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." <BR>
<P>

It took Walter Cronkite 30 years to figure out what we've known for 30 years. <BR>
<P>

Over the next few months, you can bet the networks will continue to ignore the many Clinton scandals that are currently under investigation. And the MRC will continue to expose the media's lies and distortions, throughout Clinton's second term. <BR>
<P>

For the past several weeks our <a href="/mrc/news/"> News Division </a> has been aggressively reviewing four years' worth of media reports on Clinton scandals, and the stories the networks have never bothered to air. There have been countless investigative stories in <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, <b>The Washington Times</b>, even the liberal <b>Washington Post</b> and <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. And still there's been silence from the networks. When the study is done, and I give you the results, you are going to be amazed by the media cover-up, I promise. <BR>
<P>

A study like this is a huge undertaking - nothing like this has ever been done. We are going to prove once and for all the media helped deliver Clinton to the White House - not once, but twice - by refusing to report the truth. <BR>
<P>

I invite you join us by becoming an <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">MRC Member </a>.  Help stop the media's lies and distortions. <BR>
<P>

By becoming a <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Member</a>  you'll receive MRC's monthly membership newsletter <a href="/mrc/membership/flash.html">Flash</a> , which details our studies, research, and projects. Other  <a href="/mrc/membership/benefits.html">Membership Benefits </a> include updates from me, discounts on all our books and publications - up to 50% off, and much more. <BR>
<P>

Through our web site we are offering <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Free Membership</a> for six-months! <BR>
<P> 

The work of the Media Research Center is more important than ever. Become a member today, and join us in our efforts to neutralize and expose the media's leftist attacks on conservatives. <BR>
<P>

Sincerely, <BR>
<P>

<html><head><title>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><blockquote><center><h2>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</h2><p><h3>Revolving Door Spins More for Clinton Administration than Bush's</h3></center>A Very Comfortable Relationship<p><dd>As Bill Clinton's nomination became secure in 1992, former Newsweek reporter Mickey Kaus predicted reporters would be rewarded. In the May 11 New Republic he wrote: "Many pro-Clinton journalists can reasonably hope for something more than glamorous candlelight dinners in the Clinton White House. They can hope for jobs in the Clinton White House."<p><dd>A MediaWatch study of this "revolving door" has proven Kaus prophetic. In just two years, more than twice as many members of the media have joined the Clinton administration (33) as jumped to the Bush team in four years (15). The study counted those with influence over news coverage at a national media outlet who left to take a politically appointed slot with the administrations.  Those who decided to join Clinton's team held higher profile or more influential media slots than did those whom Bush attracted: <p><dd>While no on-air network TV reporter joined the Bush team, so far six have taken Clinton jobs. <p><dd>Ten network producers, executives, and researchers have made the jump to Clinton's staff, compared to just three during the Bush years.<p><dd>Another 13 major newspaper and magazine reporters hopped aboard the Clinton team while just eight put in a stint for Bush.    In alphabetical order, here are the revolvers listed with their administration title and dates of service, followed by their media position. <p>Clinton Administration:<p><ol><li>Kevin Anderson: Health care spokes-man, White House public affairs office, 1993USA Today Money section reporter<li>Kenneth Bacon: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, 1994-Wall Street Journal Washington bureau reporter, 1969-1994<li>Donald Baer: Director of White House speechwriting and research, 1994- U.S. News & World Report Asst.

<CENTER><H2>The Free Market Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Free Market Project is the business and economics arm of the Media Research Center. The Project 
analyzes both the entertainment and news media to determine how they portray the free enterprise system. 
The Project engages in three main activities: 
<p> 
<ol> 
<li> <a href="/mrc/medianomics/"> MediaNomics </a>, a monthly four-page supplement to<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/"> MediaWatch </a>. MediaNomics reports on how the 
national media cover business and economics. Each issue includes an in-depth study of media coverage of 
a particular economic issue, such as the flat tax, minimum wage proposals, or Medicare reform. Every 
month MediaNomics commissions a prominent free-market economist to write an essay about how the 
media could improve their coverage of a particular economic issue. 
<p> 
<li> Quarterly Breakfast Forums. Every few months, the MRC's Free Market Project hosts a breakfast 
forum at the National Press Club for reporters. Each forum features a prominent conservative economist 
and policymaker, who give the media their side of the story on an issue in the news. In March, for instance, 
presidential candidate Steve Forbes talked about the flat tax and how reporters ought to cover it. 
<p>
<li> Joint Projects. The MRC's Free Market Project is also a vehicle for other conservative organizations or 
industry groups to analyze and criticize the press. Currently, the MRC is involved in a joint project with 
Consumer Alert, which will determine whether there is an anti-free market bias in large-circulation 
consumer publications. 
</ol> 
<p> 
The work of the MRC's Free Market Project has had a wide influence, being quoted in the Harvard 
Business Review, Inc., Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today's "Money" 
section, among many, many other publications. It is the only organization devoted solely to analyzing 
media coverage of business and the economy. 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
Each month MediaNomics points out such glaring omissions in the news. To subscribe to MediaNomics 
and MediaWatch, visit the <a href="/mrc/bookstore/bookstore.html">MRC Bookstore </a>.

<I>a joint study from Consumer Alert and the Media Research Center</I></center>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
November 21, 1996<br>
<P>
<center><h1> Women's Magazines: A Liberal Pipeline to Soccer Moms </h1></center><br>
<P>
<P>
<P>
	High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and personal care, and dieting.  Surprisingly, many also deal with public policy issues relating to government activism and women's and families' health and safety.<BR>
<P>
	A joint <a href=" http://www.his.com/~calert"> Consumer Alert </a> / <a href="/mrc/about/ "> Media Research Center </a> study of 13 women's and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage.  Part I of the study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was depicted positively or negatively.  Part II looked at the magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues relating to health and safety.  The study found: <BR>
<P>

<LI>In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more.  There were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less. <BR>


<LI>Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government -- they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. <BR>


<LI>In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against mainstream science. <BR>

<LI>According to women's magazines, recycling is always good.  Out of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. <BR>

<LI>Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. <BR>
<P>

	Recommendations:  Look for balance in coverage of public policy issues.  Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of view.  Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or gals) and bad guys?  Be skeptical of articles that provide only anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence. <BR>

 "Soccer Moms." This term struck as much fear into the hearts of conservatives during the 1996 election campaign as "Angry White Men" did in liberals in 1994. Conventional wisdom has it that the limited-government policies of the GOP just did not resonate with these suburban housewives, creating a gender gap that cost Bob Dole dearly at the polls.<BR>
<P>
Why the apparent skepticism among women towards smaller government, especially since in some polls they strongly favor reducing taxes and cutting wasteful spending? Perhaps at least part of the reason can be found in a joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of the publications that Soccer Moms read. Each month, as they perused the pages of their favorite magazines, women were not merely learning new recipes, the latest diet ideas, and how to have better relationships with their husbands or boyfriends; they were also often being told that government was the solution to most of society's problems, and they were being urged to lobby for its expansion. <BR>
<p>
For the study, Consumer Alert and the Media Research Center analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues of thirteen family and women's publications -- <i>Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Woman's Day, and Working Woman</i>.<BR>
<p>
Overall, there were 115 positive portrayals of government intervention in the market and/or calls for such intervention during the study period. There were only 18 negative portrayals of government intervention and/or calls for cutbacks in government spending or regulation. There were five balanced portrayals of policy issues. <BR>
<p>
Working Woman</i> and <i>Glamour</i> were the most biased in favor of expanding government. Each had 24 positive portrayals of government activism compared to four negative portrayals. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> was next with 15 stories promoting bigger government and only three stories promoting smaller government.<p>
Ladies' Home Journal</i> was the most politically balanced magazine in the study. Although the monthly ran ten stories promoting bigger government, it also ran six promoting limited government and ran four balanced stories. Two of the magazines, <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i> and <i>Prevention</i>, almost completely avoided public policy issues during the study period. <BR>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</B> Health-related issues brought forth the most calls for government intervention. There were 28 such stories. Seven focused on "drive-through deliveries," in which insurance companies didn't pay for women to stay in the hospital for longer than one day after giving birth. <i>Good Housekeeping </i>warned that "tiny lives are at risk" and advised readers on "how you can help stop this shocking practice." The magazine provided a form readers could send to Congress to demand regulations extending hospital stays. <BR>
<p>
Seventeen stories demanded increased federal funding for medical research into everything from AIDS to obesity to breast cancer, with no mention of how this new spending would be paid for. It didn't seem to matter because, according to <i>Woman's Day</i>, women had a "right" to quality health care. Liberal journalist Margaret Carlson, writing for <i>Glamour</i>, argued that families did too. Republican Medicare reform efforts, she wrote, would hurt the party with women: "If Granny gets booted out of the nursing home for lack of Medicare funds, it will be the woman of the house who picks her up." <BR>
<p>
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and managed care in general, took a beating in family publications. There were nine stories about the horrors people had faced at the hands of heartless health care bureaucracies. None of these stories discussed the health care reform option many market-oriented reformers promote -- Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). MSA advocates argue that such accounts would put health care dollars in the hands of consumers, giving them an incentive to find bargains and employ preventive medicine. A search of the EBSCO Publishing database found that there were no mentions of MSAs in these magazines during the study period; other magazines mentioned MSAs in 121 articles. <BR>
<p> 
Instead of discussing the problems of systems relying on third-party payers, women's and family magazines often proposed expanding such systems. In the September <i>Glamour</i> freelance writer Tessa DeCarlo urged readers not to "give up on universal coverage...No reform of managed care can be completely successful as long as more than 40 million Americans don't have any health coverage at all." She also wrote that laws should be changed to encourage more medical lawsuits. <BR>
<p>
<B>Urging Readers to Lobby.</b> Twenty- three stories went beyond merely promoting bigger government as the solution to problems; they also asked readers to contact Congressmen or other government officials to lobby on behalf of bigger government. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided form letters ("Join the <i>Good Housekeeping</i> Lobby") that merely needed a signature. After a June, 1996 story about Christopher Reeve and his life since his equestrian accident, for instance, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided a letter to Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. The letter told Sen. Specter: "Please add my name to the list of supporters of increased funding for spinal cord injury (SCI) research during fiscal year 1997." <BR>
<p>
Other publications, while not going to such elaborate lengths, nonetheless prodded readers into lobbying for bigger government. Three stories highlighted the "These Children Have Faces" campaign. Under the headline "Has Congress Put Children in Danger?" the May <i>Glamour</i> told readers that the group's founders "devised a plan to let politicians know that children's allies are watching: They're collecting photos of young people, with notes about their parents' fears and hopes, and will deliver the pictures to Congress next month." <i>Glamour</i> advised its readers on how to participate. <BR>
<p>
In a November 1, 1995 <i>Woman's Day </i>story about osteoporosis, <i>Woman's Day </i>told readers to "urge your members of Congress to work for more women's health research funding."<i> Woman's Day's </i>Dr. Loraine Stern, who writes the "Your Child's Health" column, wrote: "If you agree that immunizations should be fully covered for all children in need, tell your insurance company and<F255D> your representatives in Washington." In March, Weight Watchers alerted readers to a new advocacy group, the American Obesity Association, whose "first priority is to lobby the federal government to spend more money on obesity research." The magazine then told readers how to get in touch with the group to help. <BR>
<p>
The September <i>Mademoiselle</i> explained the nuts and bolts of writing a letter to Congress, using the example of a group called 20/20 Vision, which claims to have halted an "environmentally disastrous" plutonium-processing plant through a letter-writing campaign. The October, 1995 <i>Mademoiselle</i> urged 20-somethings to vote, strongly implying that they should support a liberal agenda. "The Contract with America, tax breaks for the rich, the end of public TV -- was this what my fellow Gen-Xers wanted? It's impossible to know, because most of us didn't vote," wrote freelance writer Esther Gabara. <BR>
<p>
<B>Promoting Liberal Activists.</b> Well-known liberal activists and political figures were profiled or prominently mentioned 18 times by these magazines. Marian Wright Edelman was the clear favorite, being promoted in<i> Family Circle, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle Parents</i>, and <i>Working Woman</i>.<i> Family Circle</i> seemed particularly enamored with the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) founder, mentioning her on four different occasions. The November 1, 1995 "From the Editor" section featured a prayer drawn from Edelman's latest book; the May 14 issue gave Edelman the magazine's "Lifetime Achievement Award" for such accomplishments as increasing Head Start funding; the June 4 issue promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march in Washington. And when the editors of <i>Family Circle</i> picked the 25 best-selling books "that can change your life," a recent Edelman book made the list. <BR>
<p>
<i>Good Housekeeping</i> also promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march on Washington; <i>Parents</i> editor Ann Pleshette Murphy pointed out with pride that Edelman won that magazine's first "As They Grow Award," and <i>Mademoiselle</i>, in a sidebar to a September article about poverty, urged readers to send a check to the CDF and provided the group's address. At no point did any of these publications question Edelman's policy prescriptions. They could have pointed out, for example, that Census Bureau statistics show that child poverty went down every year between 1983 and 1989, when Ronald Reagan's policies, which Edelman opposed, were in effect. But no critic or criticism of Edelman was mentioned. <BR>
<p>
Some magazines had regular features to highlight liberals. <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women in Washington" column, for instance, reported on the work of female representatives and senators -- but usually only the ones who were working to expand the role of government. One month, the column praised a host of female legislators for increasing funding for child care "during last year's bitter welfare debate." Another column expressed relief that "while members of Congress were slashing funding for almost all federally funded programs last fall and winter, Congresswomen from both parties managed to engineer a triumph for breast-cancer programs." In July, 1996, the column praised Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and Rep. Louise Slaughter for expanding regulation in health care. <BR>
<p>
The magazines also promoted the liberal agenda by quoting "authorities" from liberal activist groups. <i>Weight Watchers</I> for instance, promoted the views of the Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen Health Research Group in a May story warning about databases of medical records maintained by insurance companies to evaluate risk. No other counter-source was quoted. <i>Woman's Day</i> gave kudos to the World Wildlife Fund for protecting rhinos from poachers in Nepal, yet didn't mention private property approaches to wildlife preservation that, for instance, have increased elephant herds dramatically in Zimbabwe, where hunting is permitted as a property right and villagers have incentives to protect their property. <BR>
<p>
Liberal activists themselves often wrote stories for these magazines. Edelman wrote an essay for <i>Parents</i> to promote her Stand for Children march. Representative Pat Schroeder explained to <i>Glamour</i> readers why she was leaving Congress, even though she was "proud to be the sponsor of many bills that helped women and children, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Women's Health Equity Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Women's Economic Equity Act." <BR>
<p>
<I>Prevention</i>, which usually shied away from outright political stances, nonetheless allowed space in its October, 1995 issue for Hillary Clinton to tout government-run health care. "Taking steps to protect our children's health is one of the soundest investments our nation can make," the first lady opined. "President Clinton has initiated a campaign to improve immunization services, lower costs, reach out to families and ensure that all young children receive the vaccinations they need. In addition, Medicaid has provided millions of young children with important preventive health services." <BR>
<p>
Two staffers at the magazines even became liberal activists for a time, attending the United Nations' World Conference on Women in Beijing. "What hit me...was the passionate belief shared by women everywhere that we have a <i>right</i> to good health care," wrote Dr. Marie Savard, who penned the "Your Health" section of <i>Woman's Day, Ladies' Home Journal</i> editor-in-chief Myrna Blyth also attended, writing that the evening after Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech, the American delegation "got into a large circle, held hands and sang some sixties-style folk songs." <BR>
<p>
There were some conservative and/or Republican women profiled by these magazines, but their political views were often challenged instead of celebrated. Liberal journalist Eleanor Clift, for instance, profiled New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman for the November, 1995 <i>Working Woman</i>. While the story was generally upbeat, Clift took a shot at Whitman's tax-cutting policies: "In order to cut income taxes by 30 percent, she has increased long-term borrowing, reduced payments to public pension funds and cut state aid to local governments. The ripple effect of those steps is yet to be fully realized." <BR>
<p>
Republican women would often be praised...when they worked to expand the role of government. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, for example, was chosen as one of <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women of the Year" for working to ban assault weapons, for expanding regulation of health care, and for, in general, not being "extreme." <BR>
<p>
On a more balanced note, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> devoted the back page of each issue to an essay by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan. But Noonan rarely mentioned public policy issues in her essays. <BR>
<p>
<B>Lost Opportunities.</b> There were numerous stories in which the case that big-government policies hurt consumers, families, and women could have been made, but wasn't. Many articles eagerly announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just approved a new drug or medical device. The November 1, 1995 <i>Family Circle </i>reported that "the FDA has approved the drug Caverject, which treats impotence, a condition affecting as many as 20 million men." This, the headline declared, was "good news for couples." While it may indeed have been good news for couples at the time, <i>Family Circle</i> didn't mention those who had been suffering before the FDA had gotten around to approving the treatment. <BR>
<p>
Only <i>Good Housekeeping </I> condemned FDA policy. The magazine's February, 1996 issue took the agency to task for not allowing the breast cancer Sensor Pad onto the market. "Women are not stupid," writer Laura Muha declared. "They ought to be able to decide whether this is something they want." But <i>Good Housekeeping</i> didn't ask if other life-saving products were being held up by the FDA. <BR>
<p>
Another lost opportunity: taxes. There were nine major stories about financially strapped families and the stress this caused family members. <i>Parents</i>, for instance, labeled the dilemma: "Mommy guilt vs. economic reality." Only one of these stories mentioned the rising tax burden on families. Even that one didn't point out what the Tax Foundation found: that taxes take more from a family than food, clothing, and housing costs combined. No story urged readers to lobby Congress for tax cuts, as these magazines had done for more liberal policies which allegedly would help families. <BR>
<p>
These magazines also ignored the regulatory burden on women. Only one article, in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, pointed out that regulations hurt small business owners, many of whom are women. The September issue of that magazine profiled a woman who had owned a garbage-hauling and recycling business, but was forced out of business because of the high costs of government regulation. No story all year pointed out that, according to the Small Business Administration, government regulations cost almost $7,000 per American household, or how such regulations raise the prices of the products women and families buy. <BR>
<p>
And stories about safety didn't point out that often government policies undermine the safety of consumers. The April, 1996 <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i>, for instance, reported that "the larger your car, the less likely you are to be hurt if involved in an accident. That's the not-so-shocking conclusion of an insurance claim analysis for 1992-1994 models." But the magazine didn't then point out that federal fuel economy regulations encourage smaller, and therefore more dangerous, cars. <BR>
<p>
<B>"<i>Redbook</i> Strategy."</b> The Clinton campaign understood what an asset it had in family and women's magazines. It pursued, according to <i>U.S News & World Report</i>, a "<i>Redbook</i> strategy" aimed at courting the demographic group to which most of the readers of women's and family magazines belong. <i>Redbook</i> editor Kate White, in an article about "Why you're the White House's secret weapon," wrote that she was "flattered." But the magazines themselves, by promoting big government, had laid the groundwork for such a strategy to be successful. In doing so, they often misled their readers -- or didn't give them the whole story -- about the downside of government activism for women and families.<BR>
<p>
<P>
<b><h2>Part II: Scaring Women to Death</b></h2>
"Gender plays ... a powerful role in perception of hazards." That was the conclusion of Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis after the center polled more than 1,000 Americans to find out whether they believe in widely reported, but unproven, "hazards." Graham found that women were more likely to believe such scares were true by margins of 10 points or more, but he couldn't figure out why. "Some suggest that because women give birth, protect, and care for their children, they may naturally tend to be more nurturing than men, therefore they may be more concerned about hazards that may harm their families," Graham speculated. "Another possible explanation is that women are less familiar with science and technology than men, and are generally more fearful of it, especially in relation to nuclear power and chemicals." But Graham ended up concluding that "the role of gender in risk is more profound than can be explained by either the 'nurturing' or 'worldview' hypothesis" and that "more research is needed to understand why gender plays such a powerful role in perception of hazards." <BR>
<p>

One explanation Graham did not explore is that the reporting about risks in women's magazines may play a role in how women perceive those risks. After all, many women read these magazines not just for recipes and marriage advice but to receive important information about their own and their families' health. In a 1995 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, 80 percent of the female respondents said that women's magazines were a valuable source of information for them about nutrition. Overall, women's magazines ranked above TV news, newspaper articles, and even nurses as valuable sources of nutrition information. <BR>
<p>
 
Some advocacy groups already recognize that women's magazines can be a valuable ally in promoting their ideological agenda. In <I>Science Under Siege</i>, Michael Fumento reported that public relations agent David Fenton arranged interviews months in advance with magazines such as <I>Woman's Day</i> and <I>Redbook</i> to hype the scare he was orchestrating about the pesticide Alar that has now been widely discredited by respected scientists. The magazines readily complied with Fenton in 1989 with headlines such as "The Foods that Are Poisoning Your Child" (<I>Redbook</i>) and "Are Pesticides Poisoning  Our Children?" (<I>Woman's Day</i>)<BR>
<p>

Mainstream media outlets are not above running alarming stories about unproven risks either, but they usually give at least some space or air time to the other side. Articles in women's magazines, by contrast, frequently don't even acknowledge that there is another side. Many of the stories appear to be spoon-fed to the magazines by activists and go against mainstream science. Yet as the ADA survey suggests, women tend to trust these magazines more than any other type of media. The following examination of how these magazines -- <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I>, <I>Faily Circle</I>, <I>Glamour</I>, <I>Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Redbook, Weight Watchers and Woman's Day</I>  --  treat certain risk issues indicates that much of this trust is misplaced. (Two of the magazines surveyed, <I>Prevention</I> and <I>Working Woman</I>, did not report on the risk issues studied here.) <BR>
<p>

<B>Chemicals and Health Effects.</b> "One of the most overblown risks is that minute quantities of pesticide residues on food are related to human cancer," Harvard's Graham told <I>Weight Watchers</I> </I>(December 1995)  in one of the only articles to put this risk in perspective. Other articles, including one in <I>Weight Watchers</I> itself, indicate that these magazines seem to have learned very little in the seven years since the Alar scare. The National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific body in the U.S., recently concluded that most "synthetic chemicals appear to be present at levels below which any significant biologic effect is likely, and so low that they are unlikely  to pose an appreciable cancer risk." The NAS also pointed out that man-made pesticides are greatly outnumbered by natural pesticides plants make themselves, and that many of these natural chemicals have been found to be just as potent as the synthetic ones. <BR>
<p>

Nevertheless, according to Graham's poll, around 70 percent of women believe pesticides pose a hazard (compared with less than 60 percent of men), and an examination of this issue's coverage in women's magazines helps explain why. Of the 15 stories on claims of serious health effects from chemicals, eight of the stories were completely one-sided and mentioned no skeptical arguments against the claims. Three of the stories mentioned opposing arguments, but did so in a superficial manner. Only 4 out of the 15 articles were balanced in that they explored skeptical arguments in detail and tried to get to the scientific truth. <BR>
<p>

In an August 6 <I>Faily Circle</I> article entitled "Danger in the House," the author warns of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides that "pose potential health risks ranging from allergic reactions to cancer." The article mentions no scientists who question these risks nor does it mention what level of exposure is needed before these ill health effects occur (just about all substances, natural and artificial, are harmful at some level). And the author uses the flimsy anecdotal case of a mother who blamed garden pesticides sprayed in her neighborhood for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting (which could have had any number of causes), even though she didn't know what pesticides were being sprayed. The April <I>McCall's</I> ran a slightly less hysterical article on garden pesticides, but urged readers to contact the National Coalition Against the Issue of Pesticides, a radical environmental group that wants to ban pesticides even if they pose a very small risk. <BR>
<p>

<I>McCall's</I> (February 1996) and <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> (March 1996) warned of pesticide residues in baby food, and these articles also contained no arguments casting doubt on pesticides dangers, although <I>McCall's</I> did quote a doctor saying that "the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables are far, far greater than the risks." The article pointed out that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults, but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. The articles also recommend that parents buy more expensive organic baby food, without mentioning the natural pesticide residues that may be contained in these foods and pose the same (small) risk. <BR>
<p>

Three stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996), <I>Glamour</I> (April 1996), and <I>Weight Watchers</II> </I>(June 1996) that reported on the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer never mentioned that the largest study ever conducted found no correlation between that disease and synthetic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs. <I>Weight Watchers</I>  even condemned scientific studies that pointed to other possible causes such as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." <BR>
 <p>

The magazines that covered the newer chemical scare about "environmental estrogens" that allegedly affect reproductive health didn't fare much better. The two  stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996) and <I>Glamour </I>(April 1996) at least aired skeptical viewpoints but gave those opinions only a fraction of the space devoted to arguments for the scare. And both stories ignored important counter-arguments to some of the "facts" asserted by environmentalists. <I>Glamour</I>, for instance, did not report that the study that found declining sperm counts, a supposed effect of synthetic chemicals, had been severely criticized by many respected scientists and in an editorial in the very scientific journal that originally published it. <I>Mademoiselle</I> did mention in parentheses a new conflicting study that found that sperm counts have actually increased in the U.S. But the article did not mention how the new study casts doubts on the old study's finding of declining sperm counts by highlighting the geographic variation in sperm counts that the old study did not account for. Neither article mentioned that humans are exposed to far more natural estrogens from plants than to synthetic estrogen-licking chemicals. <BR>
<p>

The only story to mention pesticides' benefits in producing an affordable, abundant supply of fruits and vegetables was a July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that quoted an industry spokesman saying that he'd "rather take a chance on one ppb [parts per billion] in the food than on having no food at all." Unfortunately, the article then undercuts balance and accuracy by stating, without any evidence, that "concern about pesticide residue ... will become a moot point as the quality of organic produce continues to improve." This is wishful thinking. Agricultural experts such as the Hudson Institute's Dennis Avery, the former senior agricultural analyst for the U.S. Department of State, point out that crop yields from organic farms are typically less than half of those from conventional, high-yield farms, and that organic farms show no signs of catching up anytime soon. <BR>
<p>

The only two articles that critically examined chemical scares were stories in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (September) and <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I> (March) that pointed out the lack of scientific evidence behind claims that artificial sweeteners were harmful. An article in the January</II> <I>Glamour </I>that has dentists rate natural toothpastes also deserves kudos because it points out that natural isn't always good and artificial isn't always bad. The dentists note that many of the natural toothpastes lack fluoride, which provides the most vital protection against decay, and that  many of the toothpastes' natural ingredients such as baking soda and sea salt may wear down tooth enamel. <BR>
 <p>

On the bright side, the magazines proved very capable of putting minor health effects from food ingredients in perspective. Most of the nine articles on the fat substitute olestra were just as good, if not better, than those published in the mainstream media. Six stories were careful to mention that only some people get side effects such as diarrhea, and that olestra snacks are fortified with vitamins to make up for the nutrients that olestra inhibits the body from receiving from other foods. Two articles in <I>Weight Watchers </I>(March and June) went over the arguments of olestra's defenders superficially, and only one article was completely one-sided against olestra and this was clearly marked in <I>Woman's Day</I> (July 16) as an opinion piece. <I>McCall's</I> gave the most balanced coverage of all by noting  that the percentage of olestra snackers suffering side effects in studies was virtually the same as that of the non-olestra snackers suffering side effects. All three stories on the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate reported that most people don't suffer allergic reactions to it. <BR>
<p>

<B>Drinking Water/ Chlorine.</b> Women's magazines also featured many warnings about unsafe drinking water. Unless she were to read one balanced article about risks in the April 23 <I>Woman's Day</I>, a subscriber to these magazines would likely never know that "the American water supply is one of the safest in the world, and outbreaks of contamination ... are very rare." This was the only balanced article of the six articles that dealt with water. The other five were scare-mongering stories that did not even present another side to their points of view. <BR>
 <p>

With titles like "What's in your water?" and "Troubled waters," these articles usually couldn't see the algae for the lake. They vastly overstated drinking water's risks and failed to distinguish the real risks in water systems. For instance, articles in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(November 1995), <I>Parents</I> (March), and <I>Mademoiselle</I> (September) uncritically reported an alarmist study by the Environmental Working Group about agricultural pesticide runoff in water and treated pesticides as if they were as serious a problem as cryptosporidium and other waterborne bacteria. But as agricultural expert Avery has written, "The fact is that field application of pesticides is not contaminating drinking water. The only pesticide residues exceeding good health standards in recent EPA and state surveys have been from known pollution sites." <BR>
<p>

One of the most ironic aspects of the water stories is that they routinely bash chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine is the chemical that provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. Bizarre as it may seem, while the World Health Organization pursues chlorination of the world's drinking water systems as one of its top priorities, the July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> suggests that Americans stop putting chlorine in their pools! A subheading in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> asked, "Is chlorine bad for you?" <I>Mademoiselle</I> charged that "chlorine, normally a water safety hero because it kills most bacteria, produces cancer-causing by-products." <I>Good Housekeeping </I>did at least quote a scientist who says, "The risk of microbial contamination far outweighs the smaller increased risk of cancer." Yet none of the stories illustrated the risk of not using chlorine by informing readers what happened after Peru stopped chlorinating its water in the early '80s: a cholera epidemic that so far has killed 10,000 people. <BR>
<p>

As for the possible cancer risks of chlorine by-products, the award-winning cancer researcher Bruce Ames of the University of California-Berkeley (who, incidentally, was not quoted in any of the articles) points out that at the levels humans are exposed to, chlorine by-products in tap and swimming pool water are less carcinogenic than peanut butter, which contains the mold aflatoxin. <BR>
<p>

The story that the magazines all issued is that because the federal government issues top-down regulations that cost municipalities up to $37 billion a year (according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute) in chasing small risks such as pesticides and chlorine by-products, the municipalities often don't have the resources or the flexibility to fully pursue larger local risks like cryptosporidium. <BR>
<p>

<B>Passive Smoke.</b> In Graham's survey, almost 80 percent of women believed that environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoke was a serious health hazard, compared with slightly over 60 percent of men who believed this was so. Judging from the coverage of this issue in women's magazines, this may be another case where women's perceptions may be shaped or reinforced by the periodicals they read. Of five articles that covered the alleged health risk of passive smoke, only one featured any skeptical arguments. A December, 1995 <I>Weight Watchers</I> article proclaimed, "Mindful of secondhand-smoke risks, many cities are banning smoking in public places," without ever questioning if the risks were real. An April 23 <I>Woman's Day </I>article entitled "Health Scares: Real or Not" that did a good job of deflating other scares such as dirty water, uncritically accepts the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) estimate that passive smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. It is only in a four-page <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that a skeptical view is even presented, and this article spends just two paragraphs quoting a Tobacco Institute spokesman who criticized the EPA and said passive smoke risks are "not even slight." <BR>
<p>

However, none of these articles gave readers a clue that it is not just tobacco industry spokesmen who question the EPA's findings on passive smoke. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service, for one, has concluded that "the statistical record does not appear to support a conclusion that there are substantial health effects of passive smoking." The CRS noted that under circumstances of conventional studies, the EPA's finding "is not statistically significant."  Steve Milloy, president of the Environmental Policy Analysis Network, have noted that even the risk the EPA did find (1.19) is so tiny that some experts don't even consider it a real risk. He notes that there are higher correlations between yogurt and ovarian cancer (2), whole ilk and lung cancer (2.14), and abortion and breast cancer (1.5), than there is between passive smoke and lung cancer. <BR>
<p>

The September <I>Parents</I> ran a one-sided article entitled "Smoking is Child Abuse" that blames passive smoke for a number of childhood illnesses. It quotes Dr. Joseph DiFranza as saying, "A judge should know whether an adult seeking custody of a youngster smokes, so the child isn't placed in an unhealthy environment." However, the article does not note that even DiFranza has acknowledged in a medical journal article that not all studies show these effects. Some researchers also question the notion that passive smoke could cause an illness such as middle ear disease when smoking itself has never been found to cause this illness. An article presenting both sides suggesting caution when smoking around children would have been appropriate, but this article is too one-sided and alarmist in the face of uncertain scientific research. <BR>
<p>

<b>Recycling.</b> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out of 15 articles that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. A statement typical of the philosophy of these articles came from an article in the June <I>Better Homes & Gardens</II> </I>that showcased products such as a yardbird made from old garden tools. The article said, "For recycling to be successful, consumers must make the process profitable for manufacturers by purchasing products made from recycled materials." But should manufacturers make recycled products if they're not profitable? Some reporters in the mainstream media are now breaking a taboo and asking this question. An article in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> said that recycling not only is more costly than landfilling, it also is sometimes "a messy way to try to help the environment" and has environmental costs associated with it, citing examples of energy wasted by additional garbage trucks that have to pick up recycled materials. <BR>

<b>Alcohol.</b> One area where women's magazines have a better record at reporting on  comparative risks is in articles weighing the health benefits of moderate drinking against the hazards of excess drinking. An article in <I>McCall's </I>(May) and two in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(May and September) reported on the announcement in Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines that moderate consumption of alcohol can lower the risk of heart disease. The articles note, however, that drinking can be hazardous with medications, during pregnancy, or in excess. Unfortunately, another article in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (August 1996) focuses on the "overlooked dangers" alcohol poses to women without mentioning its health benefits. And a "To Do" article in the January <I>Weight Watchers</I> on hangovers ended by saying, "And remember: Alcohol is a drug, so it's best not to drink in the first place." <BR>

<b>Nannyism.</b> The biggest risk issues women's magazine take on have to do with household products. Frequently, there are articles that give good advice about how to select the safest products for children and how to monitor children using these products. However, there is a disturbing tendency in seven articles for the authors to act as a national nanny and preach to readers what they should and shouldn't buy. Articles in <I>Woman's Day</I> (June 4 and Aug. 6) tell mothers not to allow guns to be kept in the house. <I>Woman's Day</I> (Feb. 1) and <I>Parents</I> (March) tell moms not to let kids play with BB guns. In these cases, the authors are not serving their readers by informing of risks, they are crossing the line into substituting their value judgments for those of their readers. Many of these articles also fail to point out that the product isn't as much of a danger as is the lack of parental supervision. For instance, a June 4 <I>Woman's Day</I> article recommended that parents not buy baby walkers because they injured 25,000 children each year. But the article failed to note that according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, over 20,000 children who are not in baby walkers also are injured falling down the stairs each year. A much better article on how to manage risks comes from August <I>Parents</I>. The article describes a possible hazard that may occur when lead in imported miniblinds  breaks down into dust particles and children lick the blinds. But it quotes someone who points out that this can be taken care of by washing the blinds yearly. <BR>

<B><I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>'s Valuable Advice.</B> This study reviewed 56 mentions of science and risk issues. Of those, 35 -- more than half -- were completely one-sided and did not even acknowledge a skeptical view. Six include an opposing view but gave it much less ink and discussed it superficially. Only 15 were balanced articles that put risks in perspective by reference to scientific findings.  Clearly, women and families have enough to worry about and don't need new, baseless fears added to their burden. Indeed, many women would be interested in articles that report how much government regulations for tiny risks cost them and their families. The Small Business Administration places the costs of regulation at almost $7000 per household. This cost is passed on to women and families in terms of higher prices and less competition and product innovation. <BR>

The article that, by far, provided the best overall coverage of health and science issues appeared in the March issue of <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>. In that article, Alfred Sommer, dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at  Johns Hopkins University, gave some guidelines to help readers evaluate health claims. Judging from the quality of their articles on risk issues, women's magazine writers should learn some of Sommer's tips as well: <BR>
<P>
"Keep in mind that each study is a piece of a bigger puzzle. View each new finding as an update rather than the final word." <BR>
<P>
"Remember that most studies highlight an association between a behavior characteristic and a health outcome, not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship." <BR>
<P>
"Even when an association between a particular behavior and a health risk is found it doesn't mean one leads to the other." <BR>
<P>
"Finally, consider the size and duration of the study (the larger it is and the longer it ran, the more dependable its findings) and the source of the report." <BR>
