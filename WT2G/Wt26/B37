Telephone conversation 09:12 hrs:

VPOTUS: Rusty? Are you there?
(INAUDIBLE)
VPOTUS: Can you hear me? I had the Navy set up this AirLink. Rusty?
(INAUDIBLE)
VPOTUS: Rusty?

Telephone conversation 09:17 hrs:

(RINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Good morning, American Broadcasting 
Company.
VPOTUS: Robert Iger, please.
UFM: Certainly. 
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
UFM #2: Robert Iger's office.
VPOTUS: Is Mr. Iger in?
UFM #2: Whom shall I say is calling?
VPOTUS: Al Gore.
UFM #2: And you're with . . . ?
VPOTUS: Um . . . the executive branch.
UFM #2: Of . . . ?
VPOTUS: The federal government.
UFM #2: Please hold the line.
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
(ELAPSED TIME: 11 MINUTES, 23 SECONDS)
UFM #2: Go ahead, Mr. Iger.
ROBERT IGER, CEO -- ABC TELEVISION NETWORK: Newt?
VPOTUS: No, it's Al Gore.
RI: Al Gore? Al Gore? Oh! THAT Al Gore! Well, Mr. Vice President, this 
is indeed an honor. Hey, if you're calling about the nudity and 
violence on NYPD Blue you're too late -- Bob Dole already called! Ha 
ha! I'm kidding, of course. We here at the American Broadcasting 
Company -- and by extension our corporate parents at Capital Cities -- 
hold the nation's airwaves as a kind of a sacred trust. There's 
nothing more dear to use than the VHF band, as a viewing of, say, 
Family Matters or America's Goofiest Cops will attest to. And how may 
I help you, sir? 
VPOTUS: Well, I'm calling at the behest of the president. We're 
requesting thirty minutes of network airtime to present our budget 
plan.
RI: How many minutes?
VPOTUS: Thirty.
RI: Ouch. Mr. Veep, you're killing me! Thirty minutes which day?
VPOTUS: Tuesday.
RI: Tuesday? As in Roseanne? As in 33 share? 
VPOTUS: Wednesday, then?
RI: Oooh. Double ouch. Ellen. Grace Under Fire. 37 share. C'mon. Work 
with me, here. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Thursday.
VPOTUS: Well, we tried that. NBC refused. 
RI: They did? Where's their sense of civic duty?
VPOTUS: Apparently, Seinfeld and Friends are pretty popular.
RI: I know, but by God! We're all Americans, after all. Hmmmm. I'm 
thinking here. I'm thinking here. 
VPOTUS: You know, in the past, it's been traditional for the networks 
to grant time to the president as a matter of course, without 
hesitation.
RI: Yeah, and with all due respect: A), in the past, the networks 
haven't had any competition; and 2) let's be totally honest, you're 
asking for thirty minutes now, but I remember a time when you folks 
down there told me to my face that the State of the Union wouldn't go 
past forty-five minutes, and I'm watching the thing go to an hour, 
then an hour and a half, eating up all of prime time on the east 
coast, taking a big chunk out of the west, and you guys are saying to 
me ``he's wrapping up, he's wrapping up,'' but hell, I KNOW when a 
guy's wrapping up and he wasn't even close -- and that's dollars down 
the drain, and don't quote me on this, but you didn't get the health 
care thing anyway, did you? 
VPOTUS: I hate to bring up the FCC here, but -- 
RI: Can I offer you a piece of advice? In my business, when a show 
isn't going as well as it should, or it's getting overlooked, or it 
needs re-tooling, we put it on something called ``hiatus.'' You guys 
should look into that option.
VPOTUS: You want us to put the executive branch of the federal 
government of the Unites States of America on ``hiatus?''
RI: Um . . . .yeah. Why? Is that bad?
VPOTUS: You know, CBS gave us the time with no argument.
RI: Of course they did! They're in fourth place! Their ratings are in 
the toilet! You offered them thirty minutes of free programming. What 
are they going to say? No? C'mon! They've got Murder, She Wrote, which 
skews way, way, way old, one of those really bad Linda Bloodworth-
Thomason shows -- hey, no offense -- and you! If I were them I'd offer 
you guys a whole series!
VPOTUS: This is unbelievable.
RI: Hey, if your guy just skewed a little younger. Not boomer, really, 
but younger. Somewhere between boomer and Gen-X. I can sell time for 
thirty minutes of that. 
VPOTUS: Sell time?
RI: Yeah, you know. Commercials? Pay the rent?
VPOTUS: The President of the United States doesn't ``break for a 
commercial.''
RI: Yeah yeah yeah. When he needs votes, he'll play the sax and talk 
about his underwear on MTV, but then suddenly it's all ``Mr. 
President'' this and ``Dignity of the Office'' that. I got news for 
you: you can't unscramble an egg, you know?
VPOTUS: Look, CBS and CNN and NBC said that they would give us the 
time. 
RI: Okay, okay. You twisted my arm. You win, okay! You win! We'll give 
you the time.
VPOTUS: Commercial free?
RI: You're killing me, here! Killing me! But, okay, commercial free.
VPOTUS: Thanks, Mr. Iger. Bill and I really appreciate it.
RI: Now there's something that you can do for me.
VPOTUS: What's that?
RI: You wanted thirty minutes, right?
VPOTUS: Right?
RI: Can you get it down to five? I've got a Circus of the Daytime 
Drama Stars special I just can't move.
VPOTUS: I'll see what I can do.

<H2><I>ON THE SCENE</I></H2>
<H3>Saving Gramm's Campaign</H3>

RICHARD BROOKHISER<P>

<I>Mr. Brookhiser is an NR senior editor.</I><P>
<BR>
NEW YORK<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE ="+2>P</FONT>HIL Gramm's film career bloomed and faded in Texas, 
and its dried petals were exhibited by The New
Republic in Washington, D.C., but the story found its home in Gotham. A PORN-AGAIN 
PREZ
HOPEFUL, shouted the Daily News. PORNO-GRAMM, squawked the Post. All that was 
missing was
TOPLESS BODIES FILMED BY BRAINLESS GRAMM.
<P>
The hinterlands made less of the tale. ``Not many people down here are interested 
in what The New
Republic has to say about Phil Gramm,'' said Bill Murchison of the Dallas Morning 
News.
Representative J. D. Hayworth (R., Ariz.), a strong Gramm supporter in the 
class of '94, compared the
impact of the flap in his district to a ``whoopee cushion -- it made a lot 
of noise, but the wind went out of
it quickly.'' In a few days, even the national-media pinball machine was flipping 
other news-bits.
<P>
The Gramm story shows yet again that while dirt is fun, presidential elections 
are serious affairs. The
weaknesses of the Gramm campaign are structural and intellectual. There is 
a limit to what he can do to
remedy them, but he can do quite a lot.
<P>
Phil Gramm came into 1995 trailing clouds of glory from last year's health- 
care wars. He raised more
money in one night in Dallas than most candidates see in a lifetime. He wins 
straw polls with dull
regularity. But the mountainous effort has so far produced mousey results in 
the polls. In a Zogby - New
York Post poll in late April, Gramm trailed Bob Dole by 47 points, and Pat 
Buchanan by 7.
<P>
Gramm's slow start is the result of difficulties with three Republican grouplets. 
The smallest, and
peskiest, is the guardians of New Hampshire's divine right to the first primary. 
Gramm encouraged
efforts by Arizona and Louisiana to jump to the head of the queue, and he attended 
a May convention in
Delaware despite stern warnings from New Hampshire Republicans that it was 
anathema. So, although
Gramm can show a New Hampshire senator in his corner (Bob Smith), the Manchester 
Union Leader has
sniped at him, and Stephen Merrill, the conservative governor, sits on the 
fence.
<P>
Gramm's night at the movies came in the midst of a push to shore up his standing 
with social
conservatives and the religious Right. Abortion was a symbol of his difficulties. 
Gramm has a pro-life
voting record, but he was reluctant to stress the issue in his campaign. ``Short 
of a moral reawakening in
the land, we are not going to have anything like unanimity'' on the issue, 
he had told the Washington
Times in 1993. ``I'm pro-life. I can't reach another conclusion in my heart,'' 
he told Human Events early
this March, but added that under Reagan the GOP ``attracted people who had 
many different views on
issues like abortion.'' When Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council complained 
that the ``in my
heart'' talk reminded him of the evasions of Mario Cuomo, Gramm met with him 
and James Dobson of
Focus on the Family. The meeting was frosty. ``At first there was a little 
filibuster'' from Gramm, Bauer
recalls. ``Then things went downhill.'' ``I'm not a preacher,'' Gramm told 
Dobson. ``That's your job.''
<P>
Early in May, Gramm went to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to give the 
commencement address and
mend fences. He said that America was in the midst of an economic and a moral 
crisis, both having
``their roots in the explosion of a government'' that ``squanders the fruits 
of our labor'' and ``corrupt[s]
our values.'' The blue-movie episode that followed soon after was what they 
call ``off message,'' but
Bauer believes that it caused as little a stir as it did among social conservatives 
because Gramm had
already been out there, trying to address them.
<P>
Gramm's third problem is with a tendency rather than an organized lobby: the 
supply-side faith left over
from the Eighties. ``If we want to let people keep more of what they earn, 
we've got to not spend it,''
Gramm says. With a Republican Congress, that is now a possibility for the first 
time in decades. Would a
Republican President keep hammering the anti-tax, pro-growth message? Fear 
that neither Gramm nor
any of his current opponents would briefly encouraged supply-side publisher 
Malcolm Forbes Jr. to flirt
with running himself -- the most quixotic venture in a year that has produced 
Arlen Specter and Alan
Keyes. Forbes stayed on the sidelines, but supply-side doubts about the GOP 
field, including Gramm,
linger.
<P>
Gramm's strength is also his problem: he has a philosophy. ``He has been rock-solidly 
consistent,'' says
Jim Miller, former Reagan budget director, who went to college with Gramm at 
the University of
Georgia and taught economics with him at Texas A&M. ``When he first got into 
politics and started
calling up chambers of commerce, he gave a speech he called his 'government 
is the enemy' speech.''
He's been giving it ever since he arrived in Washington as a congressman in 
1979. You disarm the enemy
by cutting programs and cutting funding. Along the way, Gramm has made his 
share of compromises for
Texas pork -- the mohair program, the supercollider -- and in Bush-era debacles 
such as the 1990
budget deal and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. But this is where his music comes 
from. He is not going to
change it because some Beltway operatives ask him to. He is not going to change 
it because someone
shows him a better way. No one will, because Gramm's way is right. Gramm's 
knobbly personal
qualities -- abrasiveness, lecturing would-be advisors -- are not ``merely'' 
personal. They grow out of
his convictions and the pride with which, as a self-made academic, he holds 
them.
<P>
Social conservatives are looking for a soulmate. ``Something's wrong with the 
core of the country,'' says
Bauer, ``and it's not just the size of government. The size of government didn't 
make Mrs. Smith put her
kids in the lake. There is a coarseness, a depravity, a decay.'' Bauer's people 
want a leader who connects
with ``what they see in the headlines.'' Gramm won't be that leader. But he 
can show that he and they
have the same enemy in the explosion of government. Professor Gramm may think 
the connection is
obvious, but nothing is too obvious to be said one thousand times, especially 
in a presidential campaign.
<P>
Some staffers attuned to these things might help. Gramm has been dealing with 
the Bauers and the
Dobsons himself in part because he doesn't seem to have anyone around him who 
knows them.
(Compare Bob Dole, whose deputy political director is Judy Haynes, former deputy 
executive director
of the Christian Coalition.) New staff would offset some of the staff Gramm 
already has. Linda Dival, his
pro-choice pollster, will be reading the numbers through a socially liberal 
prism. She will also rub the
religious Right the wrong way every time she shows up on the box to spin for 
her man. Gramm needs
help fending off Buchanan. The Gramm campaign would prefer to ignore him, focusing 
on a battle of the
titans with Dole. But Gramm has temporarily lost titan status: his enemy of 
the moment is the man who
edged him in the Zogby poll. The shots are there to be taken -- on the Gulf 
War, on trade -- but Gramm
must understand that he needs to take them. In the meantime, the Liberty speech 
was a step in the right
direction.
<P>
Opposing Dr. Henry Foster for surgeon general will be another, if Gramm criticizes 
Foster on
philosophical grounds, namely that Foster is a bad nominee because of his record 
as a sex educator and a
supporter and provider of abortions, not because he told fibs about that record.
The supply-siders will have to grin and bear it. Phil Gramm is not Ronald Reagan. 
Gramm will not
promise morning in America. He wants high noon in Washington.

<H2>THE MISANTHROPE'S CORNER</H2>

<H3>Honey, I Shrunk the Attention Span</H3>
<P>

St. Martin's has just published The Florence King Reader, an anthology.
<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>HE American attention span always has gotten a lot 
of attention. The
first to note our easy distractibility was Alexis de Tocqueville. His findings 
were echoed by Frederick
Jackson Turner, but being an American, Turner used the more tactful and romantic 
``restlessness.''
Other commentators were people with a stake in concentration, such as teachers, 
inventors, bridge
players, and Jobean old salts who made boats-in-bottles. These earlier critics, 
who tended to use words
like ``stick-to-itiveness,'' held that Americans could not concentrate because 
we could not sit still. This
opinion prevailed until the television age, when a new kind of critic announced 
that sitting still was
destroying our ability to concentrate.
<P>
Sociologists of the Fifties warned that TV viewers were falling into the habit 
of thinking in clumps of ten
or fifteen minutes, until a commercial came on and temporarily shut down the 
cognitive process.
Actually this was the Golden Age of the American attention span. Early TV had 
some meaty shows such
as Hallmark Hall of Fame and Playhouse 90 that were presented live within the 
traditional boundaries of
the drama, so the resultant thought-clumping was not very different from what 
playwrights had been
doing for thousands of years.
<P>
The logic-friendly format of the theatrical act went out of style around the 
same time that more artistry
went into commercials. Our attention span consequently shrank to about five 
minutes, according to the
sociologists. It went on like this, with a new official attention span announced 
every few years, until it
was down to thirty seconds. It stayed at that for a while, long enough to begin 
acquiring the cachet that
attaches to permanence, but then the soundbite came along and turned thirty 
seconds into an eon.
<P>
No one has announced our new attention span yet, but there are hints. Bill 
Clinton promised to ``focus
like a laser beam'' on the economy. A current bumper sticker, ``Practice Random, 
Senseless Acts of
Kindness,'' effectively says that if you help more than one old lady across 
the street, instead of leaving
the second one standing there while you rush off to hug the squeegee man, you 
are in a rut. Computers are
getting faster and faster, with each new speed advertised as ``blazing,'' and 
Internet messages of ``snail
f---!'' greet those who still use a 386.
<P>
Movies are becoming increasingly incoherent as scriptwriters strive for new 
ways to keep the restless
interested. Gone is the orderly approach that Old Hollywood called ``backstory'' 
-- filling us in on the
action up to the point where the movie begins. It's a technique as old as storytelling. 
Hamlet: the king has
died; Rebecca: the first wife has died; The Odyssey: the hero is setting off 
for home after a long absence.
This is all we need to know to follow the plot, but we need to know it right 
away.
<P>
Apparently feeling that logical narration is for snail fanciers, today's movie 
makers eschew both
backstory and the traditional flashback in favor of the staccato technique 
known as ``cutting in and out.''
<P>
The movie opens with a scene of bankers in conference. We barely know who everyone 
is, when
suddenly the dreary discussion of loans is interrupted by a split-second shot 
of a naked smooth leg
draped over a naked hairy leg. This means that an affair was had, but we have 
as yet no idea who had it.
Back to the bankers for a few minutes, then another split-second shot of a 
knife on a kitchen counter.
When the bankers adjourn for lunch we see the entwined legs again. This time 
the hairy leg fades out and
immediately fades in again, covered now in prison orange. The orange-leg shot 
is mixed with a shot of a
boys' baseball team in orange socks; back and forth, faster and faster, man's 
leg, boy's leg, bad orange,
good orange, while the soundtrack emits whirring, clicking noises to suggest 
someone snapping still
photos as fast as humanly possible.
<P>
Never mind the popcorn, the best accompaniment for today's movies is a surge 
protector. Other
cinematic devices designed to nail our elusive attention are the split-screen 
telephone conversation and
the zoom shot that pulls a human dot on the horizon into an extreme close-up 
so fast that our stomachs
turn over. But of all the techniques for concentrating the mind, the most ironic 
is the freeze frame. A
character who stops dead in his tracks and assumes a basilisk stare is probably 
supposed to remind the
audience to focus like a laser beam, but in fact it resembles nothing so much 
as that menopausal dilemma
of standing motionless in the middle of a room, trying to remember what it 
was you came in to get.
<P>
<FONT SIZE = "+2">M</FONT>UCH of our flagging attention is a natural reaction 
against the unnecessary tedium we create for
ourselves. As the country that enshrined the clarion call of ``quick 'n' easy'' 
and still believes ads
promising mastery of a foreign language in only ``ten minutes a day,'' wouldn't 
it make sense for us to be
on the parliamentary system? We could have got rid of Bill Clinton long ago, 
but no, we wait out the
whole grinding, nerdy, petulant four years, and then wonder why we can't keep 
our minds on anything.
<P>
Our distractibility is also the inevitable residue of our undisciplined feelings. 
The American proclivity
for leaving our emotional lights on has drained the battery of our attention 
span dry. The human spirit can
take only so much of 24-hour coverage, memorial services, ribbons, teddy bears, 
crisis counseling, and
moments of silence. We pay such obsessive attention to disasters and tragedies 
that we end up seeking
respite in forgetfulness. (Quick, name one Teheran hostage.)
<P>
Welcome to America the Flea Circus. We now have a new disease, Attention Deficit 
Disorder, and like
all democratic diseases, it does not discriminate. The good news is that by 
the time we run the gauntlet of
ADD resources, clinics, programs, workshops, seminars, CBS Specials, and Sally 
Struthers promos, no
one will remember what it is. J

<head><title>THE WEEK -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2>THE WEEK</H2>
<P>

President Clinton is reported to be contemplating a notion to develop an initiative 
to consider the
possibility of formulating an intention to assemble a framework which could, 
under certain
circumstances, be used to develop the foundation for a possible plan to devise 
a tentative policy on
Bosnia.
<P>

You don't have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing -- 
you just need to look at Pete
Wilson. The California governor's executive order ending racial preferences 
not mandated by state or
federal law is reassuring: if Pete Wilson is out in front on affirmative action, 
there's no place safer to be.
Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) will soon join him there when he introduces 
his ``Civil Rights
Act of 1995,'' a measure (inspired by the California Civil Rights Initiative) 
that would wipe out
preferences at the federal level. Bob Dole will likely be close behind with 
his own version in the Senate.
It bears repeating that, in taking on affirmative action, jittery Republicans 
only have to cut through a thin
layer of media and establishment flak before meeting the broad sense of fairness 
of the American
people. Fortune, in this case, is forgiving; she doesn't favor the brave so 
much as those, like Wilson, with
elementary political smarts.
<P>

After watching House Republicans march with the precision of an honor guard 
through the first hundred
days, new-generation senators have rebelled at the stumbling on their side 
of the Capitol -- Mark
Hatfield's dissent on the Balanced Budget Amendment being the foremost example. 
So Connie Mack
(Fla.) has proposed a serious overhaul of the Senate Republican Conference. 
After each election Senate
Republicans would get together to set a policy agenda for the next Congress, 
a mini Contract with
America. Then, before electing their committee chairmen, senators could find 
out if a would-be
chairman disagreed with any of the items of this common-denominator, got-to-have-it 
agenda. If so,
would-bes might become also-rans. Moderates are screaming that this reform 
assails the ``diversity'' of
the party. But Mark Hatfield and his Old Guard soulmates would provide the 
same ``diversity'' as
ranking majority members of their committees that they now do as chairmen. 
They just wouldn't give as
much aid and comfort to the Democrats.
<P>

Telecommunications is the most thoroughly regulated industry in America, and 
it just might stay that
way. The telecommunications bill crafted by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman 
Larry Pressler
(R., S.D.) contains some ninety new rule-making functions for the Federal Communications
Commission, retains elements of the disastrous Cable Act of 1992, and raises 
the specter of new
telecommunications entitlements by possibly extending ``universal service'' 
requirements (which now
apply to phone service) to new technologies. Pressler has apparently been rolled 
by Senator Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.), who has pulled the Senate bill ever closer to the two-hundred-page 
regulatory
monster he proposed last year. The House telecom bill is better, but it still 
suffers from timidity and the
close relationship of Representative Jack Fields (R., Tex.), chairman of the 
relevant subcommittee, to
liberal Democrat Edward Markey (Mass.). Bolder stuff comes by way of a new 
report from the Progress
and Freedom Foundation which calls for abolishing the FCC, slicing away huge 
swaths of regulation,
and privatizing the electromagnetic spectrum. It's time the Third Wave met 
the free market -- and
Republican committee chairmen met both.
<P>

Everywhere he goes, he says, people ask Colin Powell what he believes. We can 
tell you exactly what he
believes: that, ``You're not going to hear it today.''
<P>

Aliens who are convicted of felonies after coming to America are ``deportable'' 
under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They are rarely deported, however, because they are able 
to seek endless judicial
review of the order of deportation. According to a 1995 Senate Report on Criminal 
Aliens in the United
States, a conservative estimate of the total number of deportable aliens in 
the country is 450,000. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot house this many, so most of them 
are released onto the
streets, with instructions to report several months later for an INS hearing. 
Needless to say, most of them
miss their hearings. They do not vanish for good, however. A recent study by 
the General Accounting
Office found that 77 per cent of non-citizens convicted of felonies are arrested 
at least one more time. In
Los Angeles County alone, more than half of incarcerated illegal aliens are 
re-arrested within one year
of their release. Under provisions of the Senate Republican anti-terrorism 
bill sponsored by Spencer
Abraham (Mich.), aliens would still have all the due-process protections afforded 
American citizens on
the underlying offense. There would still be a hearing before an immigration 
judge, which could still be
appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. All the Abraham provisions remove 
is the much-abused
process of judicial review of the order of deportation. But this is too much 
for Senator Edward Kennedy,
who has offered amendments to keep the status quo. If he succeeds, alien felons 
will continue to be
deported at the current pace -- about 4 per cent a year. Assuming no alien 
is ever convicted of another
felony, it would take 23 years to deport the current backlog. The first step

<head><title>LETTER FROM AL -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2><I>LETTER FROM AL</I></H2>June 5, 1995
<P>Dear Rusty:
<P>

It's been pretty crazy around the Gore household these days -- the kids are 
out of school, Newt Gingrich
is dismantling the Clean Water Act, the rain gutters need to be cleaned out 
. . . it's a busy time.
<P>
Sarah and Kristin are actively seeking summer jobs. You were kind to offer 
to have them spend the
summer with you down on the Orinoco, classifying carrier ants, but after a 
long discussion, Tipper and I
decided that it would be best if they both spent the summer closer to home. 

<P>
The problem is that Little Al wants a summer job too -- he's bored mowing the 
lawn and selling
lemonade to his Secret Service detail -- but he's too young for most jobs. 
The girls couldn't be less
helpful. At every turn, they've accused Little Al of being part of the ``oppressive 
male patriarchy'' that
has kept women out of all of the ``really cool summer jobs.''
<P>
I'm starting to wonder about the National Cathedral School, Rusty. At dinner 
tonight, when I told the
girls that they couldn't spend the summer with you in Brazil, Kristin responded 
by going limp in protest
(splashing sorrel soup on Tipper's grandmother's tablecloth) and Sarah began 
scribbling furious notes in
her diary (which she has entitled: ``Sarah: A Slave Narrative''). Tipper reprimanded 
Kristin, who replied
that hand-rolled linen symbolizes an oppressive society that ``infantilizes 
women.'' And when Little Al
told Sarah that it's rude to write at the table, she shouted ``You will not 
censor me!'' and dashed out of the
room. 
<P>
I cleared the plates, made a pot of chamomile tea, and settled down to write 
you a letter. I had barely
finished writing ``Dear Rusty'' when the phone rang. An emergency National 
Security meeting at the
White House. Subject: Bosnia. 
<P>
When I arrived, the Situation Room was crowded: Bill, Tony Lake, ``Chris'' 
Christopher, Strobe Talbott,
and General Shalikashvili were missing, but Paul Begala, Ron Brown, Ron Brown's 
personal attorney
(who, it turns out, is Johnnie Cochran -- small world, no?), Stan Greenberg 
(the President's pollster),
and a lot of interns were there.
<P>
``It's grim, isn't it?'' I said.
<P>
``I'll say,'' Stan answered. ``The carnage, the loss of life, the breakdown 
of civilized norms, and worse
-- the inaction from the government. We keep saying we're going to do something, 
but we never do.''
<P>
Paul piped up. ``Let's do something,'' he said. ``Let's take off the gloves 
and get into the fight!''
<P>
``I agree,'' said Ron Brown. Cochran pulled him close and whispered in his 
ear for a moment or two.
Then Ron cleared his throat and spoke again. ``I refuse to either 'agree' or 
'disagree' or comment further
on these proceedings until the Special Prosecutor issues his report in full, 
at which time I will respond
and in detailed terms.''
<P>
``We have to do something,'' Stan said. ``The situation is starting to look 
like Bosnia.''
<P>
``Wait a minute,'' I said. ``Aren't we talking about Bosnia?''
<P>
``No. We're talking about the Republican budget,'' Begala said.
<P>
``And its 57% approval rate,'' Stan added.
<P>
``The Bosnia thing is down the hall.''
<P>
I ducked out of the room and headed down the hall. The minute I saw Strobe 
Talbott talking to Wolf
Blitzer, Michael Kramer, R. W. Apple, Brit Hume, Lesley Stahl, Joe Klein, Morton 
Kondracke, Sidney
Blumenthal, and Leon Wieseltier, I knew I was in the right place. I made my 
way through the throng of
people. ``I predicted this, you know,'' was all I heard Strobe say before I 
entered the room. 
<P>
``Hi, Al,'' Bill said.
<P>
``Sorry I'm late,'' I said as I took my seat.
<P>
``That's okay,'' Bill shrugged. ``We just decided to commit ground troops.'
<P>'
``We did?'' Leon Panetta asked.
<P>
``We did?'' General Shalikashvili asked.
<P>
``Didn't we?'' asked Bill.
<P>
``If I may, Mr. President,'' began ``Chris'' Christopher, ``I'd like to clarify 
and perhaps summarize the
sense of today's meeting by clasping my hands like so -- '' Chris folded his 
hands into a little steeple ``
-- and by looking very concerned indeed.''
<P>
As usual, we were all impressed by Chris's ability to get to the heart of the 
matter. The ground-troops
option was tabled for the moment, and in its place, finger-steepling and concerned-looking. 
I think
we've finally licked this thing!
<P>
At that moment, Strobe Talbott poked his head into the room and asked us politely 
if we'd mind moving
-- apparently, he had the room booked for a meeting with his biographers. So 
we hustled out.
This is all Top Secret -- I know I can trust you to be discreet. Plus, by the 
time you read this, I have a
feeling we'll have a new Bosnia policy. Or two.
<P>

<P>
The Business Leadership Council (BLC) is dedicated to free market principles, economic opportunity, private property rights, and individual liberty.  It represents businesses that are entrepreneurial, growth-oriented, and supporters of free enterprise, as



 opposed to those which want to protect the status quo or are seeking special government privileges.  Its members are business leaders who are willing to take bold, principled positions in support of issues such as limiting the size of government and expa



nding global economic freedom.
<P>
The Business Leadership Council has formed the Tax Alternatives Working Group (TAWG) in order to analyze each of the major competing tax alternative proposals currently under consideration and to provide input from a business point of view to the leading 



proponents of these reforms, to others in the Congress and to the general public.  The objective is to make a positive contribution to improving all of the alternative tax proposals; and to ensure that the various tax plans will be better able to meet the



 goals of promoting economic growth in a way that takes into account the practical concerns of the business community.

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

On most of our campuses you don’t always have the opportunity to have conservative speakers as readily as people representing other points of view.  What the Foundation does to balance that out, even it up, is certainly a very important thing.”</p>

<h2>Regional Confrence Galvanizes Activists</h2>
<h4>Over 400 Eager Students Hear North, Evans, Robinson</h4>

<img alt="Students.gif" src="students.gif">
<hr><i>Egar Texas students turn out in force for Young America's Foundation regional confrence in Dallas.  Over 400 students came to hear from <b>Ollie North, Michael Williams, Stan Evans, Ron Robinson, Senator Steve Symms, Floyd Brown</b> and others during the two-day event.</i>
<hr>

Taking its campus road trip to the heart of Texas, <b>Young America's Foundation</b> headed to Dallas for a conference with over 400 college students in attendance on February 17 and 18.<p>

<b>Colonel Oliver North</b> kicked off the event Friday night with a rousing speech to students about the future of the conservative movement. He said that while conservatives had a great victory in Novernber, they need to stay true to their principles and keep their word to the American people. He called the Contract with America "something unique in American political experience." This is the first time government has established a "set of parameters" on which to govern and by which individuslc will be judged. Colonel North encouraged his primarily student audience to get involved in public policy
and make a difference.<p>

<img alt="Ollie North" src="north.gif"><br>
<hr>
<i><b>Ollie North</b> joins students during the cofrence, urging them to be active on their campuses and to make a difference.</i><hr>

Saturday began with a lecture by former <b>Senator Steve Symms</b>, president of Freedom Alliance, on the ability of young people to have a voice in policy making. He cited his career in politics which began at
age 34, when as a virtual unknown in the political world, he ran for and won a seat in the United States
House of Representatives.<p>

<b>Michael Williams</b>, assistant secretary for civil rights for the Department of Education during the Bush Administration, followed with a lively discussion on political correctness and racial issues on campuses. He encouraged students to seek support in the black student community. He said, "You will put out your hand and they will slap it; that will happen again and again. But if you persist, you will reach them."<p>

<img alt="Michael Williams" src="mwill.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michael Williams</b> talks with a student following his remarks on political correctness and racial issues on campus.</i><hr>

Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> and Director of Program Development <b>Kate Obenshain Griffin</b> talked to students about the urgency and opportunities of campus activism, saying now that conservatives have taken over Congress, liberals are turning their attention to the campuses and the next generation with renewed vigor. In order to challenge their leftist professors, Mr. Robinson urged students to take the initiative in educating themselves about conservative ideals by reading conservative journals and books. He told student activists to surround themselves with supportive people who would work with them in promoting conservatism on campus. And he encouraged students to "be enthusiastic about your ideas and convictions. Only then will you capture the interest and imagination of your fellow students whom you are trying to reach."<p>

Mr. Robinson warned students to remember as they seek to reach other students that a perfect audience is never assembled and that they need to reach out to a broad audience. And finally, citing the examples of <b>William Buckley</b> and <b>Rush Limbaugh</b>, Mr. Robinson told students, "Start your own organization if your conservative voice is not being heard through existing ones." Instead of working for the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Mr. Buckley started up his own publication, <i>National Review</i>. Similarly, instead of working his way up with ABC and CBS news Limbaugh started his own radio show.<p>

Following an introduction by Foundation board member and Texas native <b>Wayne Thorburn</b>, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> delivered the luncheon address, discussing his book, <b>The Theme Is Freedom</b>. He chroIlicled and corrected the fallacies of the liberal history lesson students are taught regarding the development of our nation and the roots of the freedom we enjoy.<p>

<b>Floyd Brown</b>, president of Citizens United, spoke on the Clinton presidency, detailing the Whitewater controversy and providing insights on the Mexican bailout. He chided Mr. Clinton for misleading the American people and disgracing the office of the president.<p>

<b>Tom Pauken</b>, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, closed the conference discussine the continuation of the Reagan Revolution. He also talked about his book <b>The Thirty Years War</b>.<p>

<img alt="Michelle Sharp" src="sharp.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michelle Sharp,</b> Young America's Foundation's program officer for lectures, speaks to students about bringing prominent conservative speakers to their campuses.</i><hr>

University of Dallas student and Young America's Foundation activist <b>Tom Lagarde</b> said, "We need more events like this one. Conservative students from across the region have the chance to get together with one another and find out how students are coping with different situations. And we get to hear from more great conservative speakers in one day than most would hear from in four years at school."<p>

Each year, Young America's Foundation hosts regional student conferences in several states around the country.<p><p>

<title>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</title>

<h2>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</h2>
<h4>Salvatori Speaker Urges Understanding of Our Founding</h4>

Before a packed house of 400 college students from across the country, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> urged students to remember the religious roots of our liberty as understood by America's Founding Fathers. The student event was sponsored by Young America's Foundation and the Fund for American Studies at  the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C on February 18. Mr. Evans is the Henry  Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer for 1994-1995, and will be sponsored by Young America's Foundation to  speak before twelve college audiences during the current academic year.<p>

Refuting what he calls "the liberal history lesson, " Mr. Evans said his latest book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, deals with the origins of freedom in the United States and the role faith and religion played in establishing that freedom.<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans1.gif"><hr>
<i>Mr. Evans signs his book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, for students following his speech.</i>
<hr>

Specifically, he dealt with three interrelated issues: first, where our freedom comes from; second, why we have freedom in America; and finally, how we sustain freedom.<p>

The issue of the role of faith in our founding has implications for modern political dilemmas such as prayer in school, abortion, and the so-called Religious Right.<p>

Liberals argue that faith and freedom are in conflict and that if we want freedom, we must keep religion out  of the public sphere. That line of reasoning, Mr. Evans said, is the premise for recent court decisions  banning prayer in school and forbidding any form of religious observance from public settings.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, such rulings, as well as the theory that faith and freedom are at odds, "are products of the way we are taught political and intellectual history-that is, through what I call the liberal 
history lesson."<p>

The liberal history lesson posits that freedom, philosophy, drama and other worthy practices existed in the ancient world, prior to Christianity. Mr. Evans said we are taught that in the early 5th century, the fall of classical antiquity "was followed by 1000 years of nothingness.... The Christian church ruled in an era of oppression and dictatorship."<p>

During the Renaissance, the liberals teach, classical antiquity was rediscovered, the institution of the 
church was rejected and there emerged what became the modern era's secular, rational basis for democracy,  freedom and the nation-state. Our Constitution, and the resulting rationalistic free system, is a product of the Enlightenment, according to the Left.<p>

"This is the framework," said Mr. Evans, "in which most of us, for decades, have learned our intellectual history." American history is being taught, for the most part, as a "subset" of the larger world history lesson.<p>

That lesson, according to Mr. Evans, is a "complete misstatement of the facts and of the record. It is an effort to impose secular liberal concepts on our system."<p>

There is no validity to the argument that faith and freedom are in conflict, and in reality, "They must go together, both conceptually and as a matter of history."<p>

Conceptually, Mr. Evans said, liberals argue that relativism, or the belief that there are no absolute standards, is necessary for a tolerant and just society-that a society can only be free when judgment is suspended. If that were the case, according to Mr. Evans, and there were no moral absolutes, no right or wrong, then a society could not pass judgment on Adolph Hitler. "How does one condemn any atrocity?" he asked. "All totalitarian regimes were relativist."<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans.gif"><hr>
<i>As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> speaks during a student luncheon, hosted by Young America's Foundation, at the Conservative Political Action Confrence.  Mr. Evans said the modern interpretation that prayer has no place in the public sphere is a travesty.  "it is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."</i><hr>

Faith and freedom must go together according to historical fact as well. In the Declaration of Independence, for instance, Thomas Jefferson wrote that it is  "self evident" that human beings are created equal. But Mr. Evans said, "If it was so evident to Jefferson, and to us, why wasn't it self evident to Aristotle, arguably the smartest man who ever lived? " Aristotle believed that some are born to be slaves and that all citizens belong to the state.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, the notion of limits on governmental power that stems from the Bible did not exist in Aristotle's time. Our Founding Fathers derived the notion that people should seek freedom rather than the bondage of a king from the Book of Samuel.<p>

Mr. Evans notes that both the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact are religious documents which were fundamental in the formation of our free form of government. Revisionists often say that the pilgrims who wrote the Mayflower Compact in 1620 found their inspiration for the document in John Lockerather than the Bible. Locke, however, was not born until 1632. The document is based purely on covenental theology, and subsequently, had a major impact on all of our governmental institutions with which we are familiar today.<p>

The First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, has suffered most grossly the inaccuracies of liberal revisionism. Modern history lessons, and in turn, the Supreme Court, now declare that the First Amendment was intended "to banish relizion from the public order."

According to Mr. Evans, that notion is "Orwellian and a complete inversion and falsification of our history."<p>

At the time the First Amendment was written, states established churches and even imposed religious requirements for holding pub- | lic office. We are told that Congress adopted the First Amendment in order to prohibit tax-supported prayer. Yet on September 25, 1789, one day after Congress passed the First Amendment, it passed a resolution calling on the president to declare a day of prayer and thanksgiving, which President Washington did.<p>

The modern interpretation of the Constitution, which states that prayer has no place in the public sphere, is a "travesty," according to Mr. Evans. "It is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."<p>

Mr. Evans said it is up to conservatives to recover the true history of our nation. While liberals have embraced revisionist history, conservatives must "get the basics right about the principles from which our freedoms developed."<p>

As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, Mr. Evans' campus appearances have included, among others, <b>Canisius College</b> in New York on February 23, <b>Regent College</b> in Virginia on March 23, <b>Fordham University</b> in New York on April 5, and <b>Princeton University</b> on April 18.<p><p>

<h2>On the Home Front</h2>

<img src="cartoon.gif"><hr>
<i>In February, Young America's Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> called on Rutgers University President <b>Francis Lawrence</b> to resign.  After enacting a speech code which threatened students with expulsion or suspension if they made a statement likely "to cause annoymance ... even if communicative in nature," Mr. Lawrence violated it.  Students were outraged when he stated that minorities don't "have the genetic, hereditary background to have a higher [SAT] average."  While Young America's Foundation is unalterably opposed to speech codes designed to restrict the free flow of ideas, Mr. Robinson said that college administrators who impose these regulations should abide by them.</i><hr>

<title>Campus Crisis</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Campus Crisis</h2>

<h4>Deceiving Donors</h4>

Having misled alumnus <b>Lee M. Bass</b> on its plans to develop a program on Western Civilization, Yale University has agreed to return Mr. Bass' $20 million gift to the school. While the program was scheduled to begin in the fall of 1993, it was not until the spring of 1995 that Yale informed Mr. Bass that they were prepared to go ahead with the program. In the intervening years, however, Yale had scrapped the original implementation plan for the Western Civ program and appointed a new advisory committee to develop a scheme more acceptable to leftist critics. This shift occurred unbeknownst to Mr. Bass, who had been assured by Yale President <b>Richard Levin</b> that he would be kept abreast of the program's development. A skeptical Mr. Bass, aware of Yale's move toward a more multicultural approach to teaching history, asked to approve the professors scheduled to teach the course. Yale refused and has agreed to return the gift. Student <b>Pat Collins</b> said, "I'm disappointed that the university wasn't able to conduct itself in a  trustworthy way to allay the concerns of the donor."<p>

<h4>PC Strikes Again</h4>

Ironically, one week before the Supreme Court was set to hear the case of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a University of Virginia publication denied funding due to its Christian perspective, UVa struck again. This time the Student Council defunded the conservative student magazine, the <i>Virginia Advocate</i>. According to Student Council, the <i>Advocate</i> represented a "political activity." Student Council appropriates funds to leftist political organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Gay and Straight for Equality, and the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Student Union. UVa also funds decidedly liberal student newspapers such as the <i>University Journal</i> the <i>Declaration and Pride</i>. Student editors of the Virginia Advocate are appealing the decision to defund the paper and plan to take their case to court if necessary.<p>

<h4>Objections Raised To Communist Chair</h4>

<b>Angela Davis</b>, tenured professor of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been named to the prestigious Presidential Chair by Jack W. Peltason, president of the university system. Her appointment has raised objections by California state senators who are concerned about Ms. Davis' "reputation for racism, violence and Communism."  As chair, Ms. Davis will have an additional $30,000 a year at her disposal, which she plans to use to develop an ethnic studies program.<p>

<h4>Strange Course Requirements</h4>

At Virginia's Tidewater Community College students taking a course in human sexuality have the option of reading five books other than their textbook or they may undertake one of the following: watch an X-rated movie, visit an adult bookstore, go to a gay bar, visit a family-planning center or an STD clinic, or speak to a member of the clergy concerning the church's philosophy regarding sexuality issues.  When a student objected to the activities the course was encouraging, the state's associate director of the State Council for Higher Education said the course sounded "perfectly legitimate" and said, "I can't imagine any student has the right to complain."<p><p>

<title>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</h2>

<h4>Foundation Program Countering Black Racist Speakers on Campus</h4>

In response to the overwhelmingly leftist bent of Black History Month on campuses, Young America's 
Foundation initiated the Alternative Black Speakers Program. The program enables Young America's Foundation to send conservative black speakers to college campuses across the country, giving students an alternative to the often radical and irresponsible message of black lecturers appearing on campuses as part of official university programs.<p>

Young America's Foundation is offering the Alternative Black Speakers Program to students who are 
disappointed in the liberal, divisive message being promoted by their schools during Black History Month. Radicals such as <b>Joycelyn Elders</b>, former surgeon general under <b>President Clinton</b>, who recently stated that students should be taught about masturbation at an early age, and <b>Anita Hill</b> are frequent speakers on college campuses. Rap musician, <b>Ice T</b>, who sings about killing police, brought his message to Radford University in Virginia. During a lecture at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, <b>Khalid Muhammad</b> told students, "Now is the time to stand up and fight back.... There are no good crackers [white people], and if you find one, kill him before he changes. " At the University of Pennsylvania, <b>Louis Farrakhan</b> accused Jews of -"using God as a shield for [their] dirty religion.<p>

<img alt="William Allen" src="allen.gif"><hr>
<i><b>William Allen</b> talks candidly with students at Young America's Foundation's 1994 Summer Confrence.</i><hr>

<b>Stokely Carmichael</b> called for a complete revolution during a speech at the University of California at Irvine. He urged African Americans to overthrow the American capitalist society. Mr. Carmichael said, "No human advances are possible without the shedding of blood.... Student movements must have a strong wational base," he said. "They must be clear and precise. One must be willing to kill and die for it."<p>

The Foundation's experience with the Alternative Black Speakers Program has shown that there is great demand for conservative black speakers, and, while the project is entering its second year, that demand continues unabated. Young America's Foundation receives calls daily requesting information on this program.<p>

Young America's Foundation has sponsored twentyfour speeches by black conservative :-speakers. Speakers include <b>Walter Williams</b>, an economics professor at George Mason University, who speaks on free market issues; <b>Star Parker</b>, a former welfare recipient who broke free of dependency and became highly successful in business; and <b>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas</b>, who will speak at two schools in the fall.<p>

<img alt="Star Parker" src="parker.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Star Parker</b> talks with a student at Florida State University following her remarks during Black History Month.</i><hr>

Young America's Foundation's Alternative Black Speakers Program has provided thousands of students with an opportunity to hear conservative speakers during Black History Month and throughout the year. Star Parker's appearance at Swarthmore College in December was highly successful. and
students were able to obtain cosponsorship with the "Women of Color" organization on their campus. During the speech, Ms. Parker said, "Capitalism is opportunity, it gives people vision, structure,
absolutes and order.... The American dream does not involve socialism, it involves capitalism." She 
explored the pitfalls and disincentives of the welfare state, saying, "Where else can you go that you get 
$500 a month for getting pregnant? "<p>

Florida State University conservative student activists also hosted Ms. Parker during Black History
Month. Young America's Foundation activist and FSU student, <b>Stephen Slivinski</b> said, "Star Parker was bright and articulate -- a glittering personality. She spoke with the conviction and compassion that liberals claim conservatives don't have. The audience was diverse in ideology as well as race-something that would make the affirmative action proponents proud, save for the fact that the audience showed up to be enlightened and challenged, not by dint of some governmental program."<p>

Walter Williams spoke to 650  students at Texas A&~~M University during the College Republican "Rush Week." He addressed the role of government in a free society, saying, "Expanding government is not the answer; the free market should determine where the dollars go." His address was featured an the front page of the school newspaper.<p>

Over 350 students turned out at the University of Arkansas to hear Dr. Williams, who said that the nation is headed toward more totalitarianism and governmental control. Our problems as a nation, according to Dr. Williams, are caused by "a significant departure from the principles of individual freedom that made us a rich nation to begin with Dr. Williams said that this diagnosis could carry us part of the way toward solving our national problems. "One good thing about Americans is that they never do the wrong thing for a long time." He said he is expecting the American people to change their present economic course.
At what students called the best attended lecture in years, over 400 students at Penn State University heard Dr. Williams speak. He has also spoken at Iowa State University and the University of 
Wisconsin - Milwaukee.<p>

Through the Alternative Black Speakers Program, Young America's Foundation has identified dynamic black speakers who are eager to bring a conservative message to the campuses for years to come. While 
colleges and universities instinctively bring liberal speakers to their school, Young America's Foundation is 
working daily with students to offer an alternative, conservative message from black speakers.<p><p>

<p>

<center><h2><u>COURT WATCHERS:</u><br>
REMEMBER HOW <i>ROE V. WADE</i> CHANGED AMERICA?<br>
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing
to hear two cases in January -- one today -- that could change
the face of the life debate. <B>The courts, having decided that
human life did not have intrinsic value at its conception, now
will decide what value it holds at its conclusion.</B>

<p>

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT A NATION HAS STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD.
In a brief to the Supreme Court filed by the Family Research
Council, attorney of record Cathy Cleaver describes the circumstances
in pre-Nazi Germany's medical community that led to euthanasia
and of fateful decisions about &quot;good death&quot; and the
end of human life. Once a nation decides that there is such a
thing as a &quot;life not worth living&quot;, history has shown
that decisions to terminate such lives infect the corridors of
power.

<p>

Neither Germany nor Holland made it legal, per se, to kill through
euthanasia during World War II. The policies were subtly adopted,
and the results are easy to read. What would happen in America
if our courts actually give a legal foundation to wide-spread
&quot;good death&quot;?

<p>

THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL CAN HELP.  We have experts in the
areas of law and disability who understand the slippery slope
on which the high court is poised by these cases. The implications
of a hasty ruling could change America's health care system and
lead all of us to wonder &quot;who can be trusted&quot; when faced
with a personal medical crisis.

<center><h2>HOLLYWOOD TV RATINGS TURN PARENTS<br>
INTO &quot;GARBAGE GOALIES&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>BAUER BLASTS VALENTI FOR &quot;MORAL POSTURING&quot; 
SAYS NEW SYSTEM WILL ENSURE THAT TV WILL &quot;PUMP MORE 
TRASH INTO AMERICA'S LIVING ROOM&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The parental TV ratings system unveiled
Thursday by Motion Picture Association of America's President Jack Valenti
is &quot;an insult to parents everywhere, and a clear sign that
Hollywood has no intention of curbing sex, violence and foul language
on television,&quot; Gary Bauer, President of Family Research
Council said.  &quot;At best, this moral posturing promises no
changes in programming and turns parents into garbage goalies.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti said that content-based ratings are impossible
because no one could distinguish hugs and kisses on <I>Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman</I> from Sharon Stone's sexual explicitness in
<I>Basic Instinct</I>.  And these are the people who will rate
the shows?  Somehow I have trouble working up a lot of faith in
this system.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti offers lots of flowery rhetoric about parents'
concerns, but he never once has suggested that Hollywood should
curb the production of sex, violence and swearing that are common
during prime-time, even in the 'family hour,'&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;The net effect of this system will be to pump more smut
into America's family rooms.

<p>

&quot;I personally find the TV-14 rating the most revealing category.
Mr. Valenti said, 'We're ratcheting up now.'  I think he should
have said, 'We are ratcheting down -- toward the gutter.'  TV-14
says that programs suitable for 14-year-olds contain 'sophisticated
themes, sexual content, strong language and more intense violence.'
In their manufactured polls, I bet they didn't ask parents whether
they thought 14-year-olds ought to get a TV diet of sexual content,
foul language and 'more intense violence,'&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Even the TV-PG category shows Hollywood's true intent.
'Infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive
sexual dialogue and situations' are supposed to be suitable for
more children.  What planet is Mr. Valenti living on?  I'll tell
you -- Planet Hollywood.&quot;

<p>

Bauer called on Hollywood to &quot;quit hiding behind this phony
ratings ploy and pledge to clean up your act.  Be the good citizens
that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't
just rate it.&quot;

<center><h2>PENTAGON DRAGS ITS FEET TO KEEP PORN<br>
IN MILITARY STORES</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Military must show that it's serious
about sexual harassment and obey the new law banning porn sales,&quot;
Maginnis said</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Military Readiness
Project Director Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis criticized the Pentagon
Wednesday for not following the law signed by President Clinton
three months ago banning &quot;the sale or rental of sexually
explicit written or videotaped material on property under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.&quot;  Although the
law is scheduled to go into effect December 22, Maginnis said
&quot;the smut will likely remain on the shelves for now because
the Pentagon is more afraid of pornographers than Congress.&quot;

<p>

Claiming the ban will hurt porn sales, Bob Guccione, publisher
of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, filed suit in New York asking for
an injunction to stop the Pentagon from removing his magazines
from military bookshelves.  Military lawyers' main objection to
the law is that it raises &quot;serious constitutional and administrative
problems,&quot; however Maginnis said the issue is not about constitutional
rights but about money.  Although customers pay less than the
market price for pornography in military stores, the Pentagon
earns over $4 million in annual sales.

<p>

&quot;The major constitutional obligation in this area is for
Congress to protect the military's combat fitness,&quot; Maginnis
said.  &quot;Congress has declared that selling pornography is
bad for readiness, and the military should obey.&quot;

<p>

Research shows that there is a direct association between exposure
to pornography and sexual misconduct.  The 1986 Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography cites studies which show that over half
of rapists say they were &quot;incited to commit an offense&quot;
by pornography and that 42 percent of child molesters &quot;implicated
pornography&quot; in their crimes.

<p>

&quot;The Pentagon must show that it is serious about sexual harassment
and military readiness,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;While Aberdeen
Proving Ground's sexual harassment hotline continues to ring off
the hook, pornography will remain on its shelves.  If the Pentagon
won't read the research, they must listen to female U.S. Army
officers based in Bosnia who complain about the 'rampant presence
of pornography, which is offensive to women, degrading to the
command atmosphere and encourages misconduct.'&quot;

<h3><i>Hollywood Looking for &quot;Excuse to Pollute,&quot; 
Bauer says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The TV industry's proposed age-based rating
system is &quot;an excuse to pollute the airwaves,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council on Wednesday,
one day before the industry prepares to release its ratings system.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement: &quot;Parents ought to be
able to tell whether a television program contains explicit sexual
scenes, vulgar language, violence and graphic murder portrayals,
or homosexual themes and references. What parent, in their right
mind, would accept a package at the front door labeled simply;
'Suitable for your 10-year-old,' and hand that package to their
child without checking further?  Parents need to know the contents
of the programming that Hollywood wants to give to our children.

<p>

&quot;What Hollywood thinks is acceptable is not the issue. The
entertainment industry should help parents make intelligent decisions
for their children with content-based ratings. Any claims that
more informative labels are not possible ring false when you consider
that many cable stations already provide information on program
content before a movie or show.

<p>

&quot;The age-based ratings constitute an end-run around parents,
who will be told that it is up to them to be monitors at all times
and in all places their child might be affected.  A similar system
was unveiled in 1965 for the movie industry, and it freed film
makers from any sense of responsibility.

<p>

&quot;You be the judge:  In 1965, <I>The Sound of Music</I> was
awarded the Oscar for Best Picture.  Four years later, the X-rated
<I>Midnight Cowboy</I>, about a bisexual hustler, won for Best
Picture.  Hollywood's attitude seems to be, as long as we rate
it, we can make anything we want and parents should shut up.

<p>

&quot;The new ratings system will perpetuate, not clean up, a
culture already soaked with sex, violence and foul language,&quot;
Bauer continued.  &quot;It's like setting a bunch of drunk drivers
loose on the streets while telling motorists that, in return,
they'll get upgraded bumpers and seat belts.  The industry needs
to clean up its act, period.  And content-based ratings could
help in that effort.&quot;

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW COMPUTER PORN RULING</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court announced Friday
that it will review the <i>Reno v. ACLU</i> decision to enjoin
the Communications Decency Act made earlier this year by a three-judge
panel in Philadelphia.

<p>

Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver
said that the Department of Justice's appeal of the Philadelphia
ruling is the right thing to do, and that now the Supreme Court
has the opportunity to &quot;reverse the radical ruling which
gave Bob Guccione the right to give his <I>Penthouse</I> magazine
to our children on the Internet.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Laws against selling porn magazines to
kids are not unconstitutional.  Why should we have to tolerate
the same degrading images of women being given to those same kids
on-line?&quot;

<p>

Family Research Council presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief with the Philadelphia judges in <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> defending
the cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  Cleaver
said the Philadelphia decision contradicts previous Supreme Court
decisions on the distribution of indecent material through the
media.

<p>

The Communications Decency Act:

<p><ul>

<li>Prohibits adults from using a computer to send indecent pornography 
directly to a known child

<p>

<li>Prohibits adults from knowingly displaying indecent pornography to 
children

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;indecent material&quot; as material, which in context, 
depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently 
offensive manner

<p>

<li>Imposes fines, prison sentences (up to 2 years), or both on violators

<p>

<li>Exempts those who merely provide access to a network or system over 
which they have no control

<p>

<li>Provides limited defenses for employers and those who make a reasonable 
and effective effort to restrict children's access to pornography

<p>

<li>Expands telephone harassment prohibitions to include harassment by 
computer

</ul><p>

Arguments will likely be heard in early spring.  Family Research
Council and other pro-family and anti-pornography groups will
be filing briefs in support of the Justice Department's defense
of the law.

<center><h2>Judge Chang Has &quot;Ravished the Rule of Law<br>
in Hawaii,&quot; FRC's Knight Says

<p>

Calls Marriage Ruling a &quot;slap in the face of Hawaiians<br>
-- and Americans everywhere,&quot; and Asks for Judge's<br>
Removal from Office</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;In striking down Hawaii's state
law that preserves marriage as the union of one man and one woman,
Judge Kevin Chang has ignored the wisdom of the ages, the will
of the Hawaiian people, and ample evidence of the state's compelling
interest in preserving this vital institution&quot; said Robert
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;His ruling legalizing the fiction of homosexual 'marriage'
essentially destroys the rule of law in Hawaii, and is a slap
in the face of  the Hawaiian people, who have made abundantly
clear their wish to resist judicial tampering with society's foundational
institution,&quot; Knight continued.  &quot;It is also a slap
in the face of the American people, who overwhelmingly support
marriage as a union reserved to one man and one woman.&quot;

<p>

Knight asserted that the Hawaiian Attorney General's office deliberately
underargued the case by &quot;ignoring a  mountain of evidence
that homosexuality is destructive to individuals, families and
society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.

<p>

&quot;The state hung its case on a single factor -- the possible
effects on children -- which Judge Chang apparently has ignored,&quot;
Knight continued.  &quot;Concern for children, all by itself,
should have been enough reason for a sitting judge to uphold the
rule of law, of nature and of nature's God,&quot; Knight said.
&quot;No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate.
This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people
of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue,
would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from
the bench.

<p>

&quot;This decision underscores Congress' wisdom in enacting the
Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other states from the
Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.

<p>

&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways
to nullify the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no
small legal matter but an assault on morality and the rule of
law itself.  Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending
the judicial arrogance that has precipitated this national threat
to marriage.&quot;

<center><h2>POLL FINDINGS ARGUE AGAINST NEW<br>
WELFARE ROLE FOR HILLARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</B> First Lady Hillary Clinton recently
touched off a firestorm (even within her own party) when she revealed
that she intends to take on a &quot;formal&quot; role on welfare
issues in the coming months.  Apparently, Mrs. Clinton envisions
leading an effort to reverse some of the key features of the welfare
reform legislation passed last year by the Congress and signed
by the President.

<p>

<b>But a new poll commissioned by the Family Research Council
finds that most Americans strongly support the new welfare bill
and do not want to see it reversed</b>. The survey, which was
conducted in November, 1996 by the Voter/Consumer Research polling
firm, found that only 12 percent of the 1,000 registered voters
surveyed felt that welfare reform &quot;has already gone too far.&quot;
Another 11 percent said that President Clinton and the Congress
&quot;have done enough&quot; to reform welfare, and a whopping
<b>72 percent said that the President and the Congress &quot;should
do more to reform welfare.&quot;</b>

<p>

In addition, another question in the FRC survey found Americans
quite unwilling to return to &quot;the era of big government.&quot;
When asked whether &quot;President Clinton and the Congress should
return to a greater role for the federal government in addressing
the country's domestic problems or should they continue cutting
back the size of the federal government,&quot; 62 percent called
for further cuts in government spending.  Only 26 percent supported
an increased federal role.

<p>

&quot;These poll findings make it clear that Hillary Clinton's
objectives on welfare are at odds with the will of most Americans,&quot;
FRC President Gary L. Bauer said today.  &quot;If the First Lady
wants to carry out the people's wishes on welfare reform, she
should be shouting, 'Charge!,' rather than 'Retreat.'&quot;

<center><h2>CENSUS STUDY PRESENTS MIXED PICTURE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Sr. Writer
for Cultural Renewal William Mattox on Tuesday called the results
of a new Census Bureau report on household and family characteristics
a &quot;mixed picture.&quot;  He said the new Census numbers show
that:

<p>

<li><b>Reports of the traditional family's death are greatly exaggerated.</b>
The report begins by asking, &quot;Are 'traditional' households
dead?;&quot; and then gives great attention to the fact that &quot;married,
with children&quot; families  now comprise only 25 percent of
all households.

<p>

But buried within the report is an acknowledgment that more than
half of all households are headed by a married-couple (some of
whom have yet to have children while others have already raised
children) and an acknowledgment that much of the growth of non-family
households is due to the rise in the number of elderly people
living alone after the death of their spouse.

<p>

Moreover, when one looks only at the universe of <I>families</I>
-- rather than all households -- more than three-fourths (77 percent)
of all families are headed by a married couple, and seven in ten
families with children are headed by a married couple.  Thus,
to a certain degree, the more things change, the more they remain
the same.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in single-parent households continues to be a cause
for concern.</b> While we should not overlook the prevalence
of married-couple families, neither should we ignore the significant
rise in single-parent households.  Clearly, the dramatic rise
in the number of single-parent households is the most disturbing
demographic change of the last 25 years.   While it is reassuring
to know that most families are still headed by a married couple,
the fact that single-parent households have nearly doubled in
number over the last quarter-century is a clear sign that all
is not well on the home front.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in unmarried households should not be a cause for
celebration.</b> Unlike the spin doctors in the Census Bureau's
public relations department, many Americans are troubled by the
rise in unmarried households.  Among those most likely to view
recent trends as a cause for concern are children being raised
without the benefit of two parents (a group we know to be growing
in size) and single women who would like to be married (a group
that appears to be growing in size -- if the fact that <I>The
Rules</I> stands atop the current best-seller list is any indication).

<center><h2>FRC TALKS TURKEY</h2>
<h3><i>OFFERS RESULTS OF RECENT POLL<br>
OUTLINING MENU FOR ACTION IN 105th CONGRESS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Just as the Pilgrims and the
Native Americans learned to live harmoniously together, the American
people definitely want Congressional Republican leaders and the
Democratic President to work together in the coming year,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer on Tuesday as Family Research Council released
its 1996 post-election poll.

<p>

But after being served bland mashed potatoes day after day for
most of the 1996 presidential campaign, Americans responding to
a recent Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family
Research Council want to make sure the menu for action in the
105th Congress includes:

<p>

<h4>1. THE MAIN COURSE:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>A Pro-Family Tax Cut Big Enough to Put a Turkey in Every
Pot.</b> Seventy-two percent of the 1,000 Americans responding
to the FRC survey say they favor a cut in federal income taxes.
In the 104th Congress, the House and Senate passed (but President
Clinton vetoed) a tax cut bill which included a $500 per-child
tax credit.  When the 105th Congress convenes in January, this
pro-family tax measure should be at the top of the economic agenda.

<p>

<h4>2. THE TRIMMINGS:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>More Carrots for the States to Continue Welfare Reform.</b>
One of the major achievements of the 104th Congress was the passage
of a welfare reform bill which, among other things, offers states financial
incentives for lowering their out-of-wedlock birth rate.  When
asked about the welfare reform issue, 72 percent say President
Clinton and the Congress &quot;should do more to reform welfare,&quot;
11 percent say their elected officials in Washington &quot;have
done enough to reform welfare,&quot; and only 12 percent say that
&quot;welfare reform has already gone too far.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Balanced-Budget Peas that Must Be Eaten.</b> Seventy-one
percent of Americans responding to the FRC poll say they &quot;strongly
favor&quot; balancing the budget.  Another 22 percent say they
&quot;somewhat favor&quot; this policy objective.

<p>

<li><b>Sweet Potatoes -- with No Artificial Sweeteners Added (Not
Even for Medicinal Purposes).</b> Seventy-one percent of the
public say they &quot;strongly favor&quot; increased federal efforts
to fight drug trafficking. Another 15 percent &quot;somewhat
favor&quot; this objective. Moreover, 71 percent say President
Clinton and his top officials have failed to pull their weight
in America's war on drugs. Only 24 percent say the Clinton adminstration
has &quot;been doing what could be expected.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Educational Choice of Whole Apples, Cut Apples, Cooked Apples,
Applesauce, Apple Pie, Etc.</b> Seventy-one percent of the public
say they support education vouchers that would give &quot;parents
the ability to choose the private or public school their children
attend.&quot;  Apparently, this support is not only broad, but
is also quite deep -- two-thirds of those who favor school choice
say they do so &quot;strongly.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Fat-Free Desserts (since the Era of Big Government Is Over).</b>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents say they believe
the President and the Congress should &quot;continue cutting back
the size of government.&quot;  Only 26 percent say they want their
elected officials to &quot;increase the federal government's role&quot;
in addressing American's domestic problems.

<p>

<h4>3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (Table Rules, Manners, etc.)</h4>

<p>

<li><b>Extra Seats at the Table for Babies Saved by Abortion Restrictions.</b>
Seventy-three percent of the respondents say they favor efforts
to require &quot;the consent of parents before a teenager is given
abortion counseling or referrals.&quot;  A similar majority (60
percent) express support for parental consent &quot;before teens
are given condoms, pills, or other forms of birth control.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>No Seconds (or Other Special Privileges) Until Everyone Is
Served.</b> More than four out of five Americans (83 percent)
say that gays and lesbians in the workplace should <i>not</i>
&quot;be given special protections, like those given to minorities
or the disabled.&quot;  Only 13 percent say they support measures
to extend job protections to gays and lesbians (like the legislation
Senator Ted Kennedy championed in the 104th Congress).  Moreover,
64 percent say they think the news and entertainment media devote
&quot;too much attention to homosexuality.&quot;  Only eight percent
say there is &quot;not enough&quot; coverage of these issues.

<p>

<li><b>A Prayer of Thanksgiving Acknowledging God's Providence.</b>
Nearly half of all Americans (44 percent) say the news and
entertainment media devote too little attention to the role of
religion in American life.  Thirty-seven percent say the amount
of media attention given religion is &quot;about right.&quot;
Only 14 percent say &quot;too much&quot; attention is devoted
to religion by the news media.

<p>

The Voter/Consumer Research survey for the Family Research Council
was conducted by telephone from November 6 through November 10,
1996, under the direction of FRC policy analyst Bill Mattox.
The sample of 1,000 registered voters was selected by using random-digit
dialing procedures.  The margin of error was roughly plus or minus
three percentage points.

<center><h2>BAUER ISSUES CHALLENGE TO GOP</h2></center>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council and a 
Republican strategist challenged the Republican Party today to 
find its voice on values and to redirect its economic policy toward 
working class and middle class families. Here are some exerpts from 
his speech at the Heritage Foundation</i>.

<p>

"The great danger facing America is not from barbarians at the gates, 
but the sickness of our own hearts. What is at stake is whether this 
great experiment in ordered liberty under God can survive. That was 
the great issue that should have been central to the presidential 
election. Instead, in some bizarre role reversal, the party most 
associated with the permissiveness of the last thirty years constantly 
talked about values, while the party, <b>my</b> party, that counts on 
the votes of millions of Americans worried about our virtue deficit, 
instead seems obsessed with our wallets ...

<p>

"The warning signs of the failure of the 1996 campaign were these 
from the beginning. Our unelected party leadership was obsessed for 
the last four years with the mantra of 'big tent'. A big tent for 
what? To what end? To change America how? To improve the prospects 
for our families and children in what way? We can mock Bill Clinton's 
bridge to the 21st century, but it at least signals ideas. Big tent 
signals that when it comes to ideas we don't care enough to make a 
case for what we believe ...

<p>

"The key fact of the American economy is this: It is getting harder, 
not easier, for working families to make ends meet. Yet the elite of 
my party often seem not to recognize the problem. It isn't just a 
problem of slow economic growth. The real problem is that the take-home 
pay of workers has fallen behind the growth of the economy. They get to 
keep less and less of what they earn. Here's a stunning fact. We have 
created 10 million-plus new jobs, but only eight million more workers 
are now employed. Every three workers are holding down four jobs. One 
income used to provide for a family. Then it took two. Now, increasingly, 
it takes three! ...

<p>

"The days are over when a few Washington think tanks can be allowed 
to make elite economic policy for a party that is increasingly the 
party of small businesses, entrepreneurship, and Main Street. There 
is much to be done, from pro-family tax reform to placing entitlements 
on a sound footing. But the goals of these efforts can be summarized 
in a single phrase: we must be, we <b>will</b> be, for working families. 
We must support families that 'work' in that they are able to support 
themselves with the fruits of their labor ...

<p>

For way too long now both political parties have been guided by 
political consultants, pollsters and focus group gurus who substitute 
media manipulation for a governing philosophy. We need to look no further 
for the growing cynicism of the American people. I have little influence 
on the Democratic Party, so this advice will be to my fellow Republicans. 
Save your donors a lot of money by jettisoning the whole political clique 
of Washington manipulators. You don't need them to tell you what to 
believe. This is the party of Lincoln. Appeal to the better angels of 
the American people and trust them to respond as they always have when 
they hear the truth."

<p>

<center><h2>'A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE':<br>
MILITARY'S POLICY ON WOMEN IN COMBAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> &quot;Sexual harassment and criminal
misconduct should be strongly condemned and the guilty must be
prosecuted.  But anyone who has worked with mixed gender settings
in a 24-hour per day, high stress and away-from-home environment
knows such settings are ripe for sexual improprieties even under
the best leaders,&quot; said Robert Maginnis, Director of Family
Research Council's Military Readiness Project, and retired military
on Thursday. &quot;But the result is a two-fold problem.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The first issue, and most important, is a moral one. The
incidence of outright coercion by officers against the women in
their command shows that character does matter. The breakdown
of values and lack of moral character are creating a debt that
men and women are paying and will pay well into the future. The
vulnerable become victims of the ruthless.

<p>

&quot;The Armed forces must make sure that those responsible for
misconduct receive swift and sure punishment. American parents
must be assured that their daughters who serve their country will
not be raped or forced into harmful, sexual situations.

<p>

&quot;The second issue is a different kind of problem -- that
of consensual sex within the military ranks. Because of the pressure
to ignore the differences between men and women in the name of
political correctness, we are creating a recipe for national disaster.
Our attempts to incorporate women are nothing like the successful
polices that integrated the races because the two issues are completely
different. With gender policies, problems will continue as long
as men and women are sexually attracted.

<p>

&quot;These radical changes came without Congress answering the
question, 'Does removing most exemptions for women promote military
readiness?' The answer for many commanders is no! We have created
sexually tense situations.

<p>

&quot;Consider this sad situation: Calls to Aberdeen's sexual
harassment center have exceeded 3,100 and involve all services
reaching back to World War II. So far, 341 cases are under
criminal investigation.

<p>

&quot;As planes begin to lift-off for Zaire for yet another deployment
of soldiers to primitive and wrenching places, <B>it's time to
rethink why we have saddled the military with a mission impossible</B>.
Sex happens when men and women stay long enough in forced intimate
situations. It happened in Haiti and Somalia, aboard dual gender
ships and in Bosnia. It will happen in Zaire, too. Sexual relationships
in units hurts effectiveness.

<p>

&quot;The goal of the military is to protect and defend the Unites
States of America. But social experiments are weakening the men
and women on whom we all depend. Those guilty of sexual impropriety
must be punished, and the status of  women in the Armed Services
must be reviewed to protect those who serve.&quot;

<center><h2>'96 ELECTION A WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES --<br>
REAL AND PRETEND, SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Bill Clinton's
victory began when he recast himself as a pro-family conservative
and modeled Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign,&quot; Family
Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said Wednesday about
the election. &quot;As the President moved to the right, many
people were led to believe that his pro-family speeches meant
he had abandoned his liberal agenda. What we're more likely to
see is the same Bill Clinton of the last four years who will appoint
liberal judges, advance gay rights and insist on abortions even
in the ninth month of pregnancy.&quot;

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;Once again, we see the winning formula.
Those candidates that support lower taxes, smaller government,
family values and respect for life get elected. Those who focus
on economics alone lose. Our hope is that the Republican leadership
finally understands this.

<p>

&quot;Throughout the campaign the true heart of the Republican
resurgence was evident in the conservative tone of the issues
supported and the race for the right. 'Liberal' was a dirty word
... even Bill Clinton took time on the stump to help redefine
Paul Wellstone as a conservative.

<p>

&quot;The big mistake the media and pundits make now is to ignore
the mandate the newly elected congress has to pursue principled
economic and family policy. Despite millions of dollars spent
by the labor unions and the Democratic Party, the vast majority
of the freshman House members survived -- strengthened by their
values.

<p>

&quot;This Congress has a mandate to act on behalf of the family
-- to support genuine family tax relief, to reenact the Partial
Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a critical issue that helped to bring
Ann Northup to the House -- and to act aggressively on the drug
problem that threatens our children. And since <I>everyone</I>
now claims to be a pro-family conservative, perhaps some of these
things can be achieved.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;PORNOGRAPHY AWARENESS WEEK&quot;...<br>
BATTLING PORNOGRAPHY IN THE<br>
INFORMATION AGE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;From protecting minors from on-line
pornography to eliminating the government's role as pornography
salesman, the 104th Congress took significant steps in waging
the ongoing war against pornography in the changing environment
of the Information Age,&quot; Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Thursday.  &quot;Celebrate
these victories during this year's <B>'Pornography Awareness Week'
(Oct. 27 - Nov. 1)</B>, but keep in mind that the cable and cyberporn
battle is far from over.&quot;

<p>

<h4>PROGRESS MADE....</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family support made passage of the Communications Decency
Act (CDA) possible. With a strong provision to combat cyberporn,
the CDA prohibits adults from knowingly sending or displaying
indecent material to minors on the Internet.

<p>

<li>Additional protection for children came in the Child Pornography
Prevention Act of 1996.  It extends existing child pornography
restrictions to include any visual depiction that <I>appears to
be</I> a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.  In other
words, it prohibits &quot;simulated&quot; pictures created by
computer programs, &quot;morphing&quot; images together, artistic
renderings which look like real children, and pictures of young
adults who are made to look like and are advertised as children.

<p>

<li>Congress also passed an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization
Act that prohibits the sale or rental of pornography by the government
anywhere on U.S. military property.

</ul><p>

<h4>THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CYBERPORN...</h4>

<p>

The Department of Justice
this month appealed to the Supreme Court a Philadelphia federal
court's ruling against the CDA. (<I>ACLU v. Reno</I>)  The court's
decision allows adults to knowingly send and display pornography
to minors on the Internet and maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. FRC filed a brief
defending the cyberporn provisions in the CDA and will continue
at the Supreme Court level to support ways to protect children
from on-line pornographers.

<p>

Cleaver said, <b>&quot;Cyberspace is our children's new playground,
and it is a world where pornography knows no bounds.  Failure
to defend strong laws would be like leaving a loaded gun in that
playground.  Families report that this is a serious problem, and
the burden of protecting children from exploitation should not
rest solely on them.&quot;</b>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT &quot;KNOWS A SOLID RULING<br>
WHEN IT SEES ONE,&quot; FRC SAYS

<p>

FRC COMMENDS COURT'S DECISION TO<br>
UPHOLD LAW EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS<br>
FROM MILITARY SERVICE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended the
Supreme Court's decision Monday to turn down a challenge to the
law excluding homosexuals from military service in <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  &quot;The Court knows a solid ruling when it sees
one,&quot; FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Monday. &quot;Military
people support the ban and so do the American people.&quot;

<p>

FRC was given the rare opportunity to present oral arguments in
this case before the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Wells-Petry,
a former Army lawyer who has defended the military's ban on homosexuals
for years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect
that the dismissal from the Navy of Lt. Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.

<p>

&quot;The Fourth Circuit not only upheld the law excluding homosexuals
from military service,&quot; Wells-Petry continued, &quot;it also
made hash of the Administration's regulations implemented to enact
the law.&quot;

<p>

Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department were on the
same side of this case, however their arguments differed greatly.
The Justice Department opposed FRC's arguments, which were based
on the intent of the law passed by Congress rather than on the
often contradictory directives prepared by the Administration
to implement the law.  The Justice Department also submitted a
brief opposing FRC's participation.  The Justice Department rested
their case, as their brief stated, on the &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.

<p>

&quot;Friends of the armed forces are pleased the Court let this
excellent ruling stand,&quot; Wells-Petry said.

<center><h2>&quot;ONCE GAY, ALWAYS GAY&quot; NOT TRUE,<br>
LOVE OFFERS REAL HOPE, KNIGHT SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For too long, many people have
come to believe that people with homosexual desires cannot change. <b>The
'once gay, always gay' fiction has persuaded more than a few Americans
to support so-called 'gay rights' out of a misdirected sense of
compassion.</b> But it is anything but compassionate to tell
someone they have no hope of change and that they might as well
indulge in sexual behavior that is unhealthy, immoral and in many
cases, even fatal,&quot; Bob Knight said Thursday during a ground
breaking news conference.

<p>

Knight, Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies,
participated in a 9:30 a.m. news event to unveil PFOX -- Parents
and Friends of Ex-Gays (Contact: Anthony Falzarano) -- a new,
national parents group that will counter the pro-homosexual PFLAG. The
news event, which included former homosexuals and lesbians, also
highlighted the Second Annual National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality
Day. (Contact: Michael Johnston)

<p>

Knight made the following comments during the news event at the
<b>National Press Club</b>:

<p>

&quot;Over on the mall this week, the AIDS quilt is a silent and
wrenching testimony to the hundreds of thousands of people struck
down with premature death.  The quilt also symbolizes tragic choices
made by many people who were misled into believing they had no
other option.  How many of these sons, daughters, fathers, brothers
or sisters would be alive today if they had had access to compassionate
people like these around me who have been caught up in sexual
or drug addiction but have broken the deadly pattern?

<p>

&quot;Today's message is very simple:  No one has to be 'gay.'
No one should reject a family member because that family member
is 'gay.' But love does not require accepting behavior that is
harmful. In fact, real love in action is a conscious effort to
steer someone away from behavior that can hurt or even kill. 
It isn't always easy, but it can be done, as evidenced by the
many who have.

<p>

&quot;Parents, Family and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX), which is
being introduced today, has been formed to aid people who have
family members struggling with homosexuality.  PFOX is dedicated
to correcting the many distortions and increasingly abusive assertions
made by homosexual activist groups against those with whom they
disagree. The homosexual activist movement despises and attacks
the ex-gay movement out of fear that these people are exactly
who they say they are: people once in bondage to homosexuality
but now freed to pursue a fuller life. But their lives are evidence
of options rarely discussed but very real.&quot;

<p>

<i><b>NOTE: From 10-11 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 11, former homosexuals
and lesbians will join together for a time of testimonials, sharing
and outreach on the West Front of the Capitol. Their efforts are
timed to coincide with the AIDS Quilt.  All are welcome.</b></i>

<center><h2>ASSISTED SUICIDE CASES DRAW<br>
ATTENTION OF PRO-FAMILY GROUPS</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Stop the &quot;cheapening of human life,&quot; Cleaver 
says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court Tuesday announced
its decision to review two recent U.S. federal court cases on
assisted suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> 
struck down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from
prescribing lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the
Constitution's liberty interest, using reasoning identical to
the Supreme Court abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from
the Second Circuit concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide
violated the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that there
is no difference between &quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot;
and intentionally causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing
<I>amicus</I> briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court, urging
the Court to reverse the decisions from Washington and New York.

<p>

Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said, <b>&quot;It is a
tragic irony that our country is moving to a place where we prohibit
only the killing of the healthy and strong, while we sanction
the killing of the frailest members of our own families: our
unborn children and elderly parents and grandparents.&quot;</b>

<p>

Cleaver cited a recent report produced at the request of Congressman
Charles Canady on euthanasia in the Netherlands:  &quot;The <B>Netherlands
Report</B> presents some alarming facts,&quot; Cleaver said. 
&quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors
in its euthanasia program.  While this is certainly tragic, what
is more shocking is that, in the same year, more than 1,000 people
were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>; 140 of these cases
involved a fully competent person who was never given a choice.&quot;
<B>Euthanasia perverts and demeans the health profession by not
giving doctors the tools of life but rather putting in their hands
the instruments of death.</B>

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DON'T FUND DR. DEATH, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended Friday
the efforts of Rep. Charles Canady in the production of the Congressional
Report on Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands.  FRC Director of
Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Friday she believes the report
is an important contribution to the debate concerning physician
assisted suicide and euthanasia in America.

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;It is a tragic irony that our country is
moving to a place where we prohibit only the killing of the healthy
and strong, while we sanction the killing of the frailest members
of our own families:  our unborn children and elderly parents
and grandparents. Euthanasia perverts and demeans the
health profession by not giving doctors the tools of life but
rather putting in their hands the instruments of death.&quot;</b>

<p>

FRC also praised the efforts of Senators John Ashcroft and Byron
Dorgan to prohibit federal funding for assisted suicide.  Already
in Oregon, the director of Medicaid has announced his intention
to use federal funds for assisted suicide.

<p>

&quot;The <b>Netherlands Report</b> presents some alarming facts,&quot;
Cleaver said.  &quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by
Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program.  While this is
certainly tragic, what is more shocking is that, in the same year,
more than 1,000 people were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>;
140 of these cases involved a fully competent person who was never
given a choice.&quot;

<p>

This October, the Supreme Court is likely to announce its decisions
regarding review of two recent U.S. federal court cases on assisted
suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> struck
down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from prescribing
lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the Constitution's
liberty interest, using reasoning identical to the Supreme Court
abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from the Second Circuit
concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide violated the Equal
Protection Clause on the ground that there is no difference between
&quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot; and intentionally
causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing <I>amicus</I> 
briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court.

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who

<center><h2>DEATH SENTENCE FOR UNBORN IS STAIN ON<br>
THE LAND OF THE FREE, HOME OF THE BRAVE</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GO AWAY, BAUER SAYS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;This tragic vote, condemning
the lives of thousands of our children, will not be the end of
debate over Partial Birth Abortion. The President and those who
stood with him should be ashamed for blinding themselves to tragic
deaths in an attempt to win political points,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer said Thursday after the Senate
voted 57 to 41 -- 8 votes short of those needed to overturn Bill
Clinton's veto.

<p>

&quot;The only pain Bill Clinton seems to feel is his own. This
vote is about the kind of 'choice' people make when they see others
dying on a roadside. Some stop to help. Others keep walking. It
is inhumane to know how children are being killed as they pass
through the birth canal -- and do nothing.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996. It
is a measure of the kind of people we are.

<p>

&quot;This vote will not rest easy on the conscience of the American
people. This is a nation built on the idea that all people are
created equal. This will stick in their throats. We are a better
country than one that takes the lives of defenseless children
in this way.&quot;

<p>

Earlier today Gary Bauer stood with many distinguished senators
and a dozen of pro-family, pro-life, and religious leaders, including
Dr. James Dobson, in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to denounce partial-birth abortion and to call on the Senate
to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.

<center><h2>ENOUGH BLAME, TIME FOR ACTION IN<br>
WAR ON DRUGS,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> &quot;It's time to wake up and admit that
we have a major crisis on our hands,&quot; FRC Senior Policy Analyst
Bob Maginnis said Thursday. &quot;For the second time in a month,
new statistics have been released showing a dramatic increase
in the number of teens who use drugs.&quot;

<p>

According to a study released Wednesday by the National Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), the number of teens
in grades six through twelve using illicit drugs on a daily basis
increased 147 percent in the past decade.

<p>

These latest findings, along with the results of the Columbia
University study released in August, are a cause of great concern
to parents, teachers and politicians alike.  A joint Congressional
hearing Thursday will look into the causes of the recent jump
in teenage drug use.

<p>

&quot;The current Administration has virtually ignored the fact
that anti-drug abuse campaigns like former First Lady Nancy Reagan's
'Just Say No' program work,&quot; Maginnis said, &quot;There is
a definite correlation between the absence of such high-profile
nationalized efforts and the recent rise in drug use among teens.&quot;

<p>

&quot;It's time to stop complaining and get to work,&quot; Maginnis
explained. &quot;We've dropped the ball on the drug issue.  All
the evidence says the same thing, 'Talk to your kids about drugs.
Make them aware of the real dangers surrounding drug abuse, and
they will be less likely to experience firsthand the pain of addiction.'
We also need to reconsider a balanced interdiction and demand
reduction policy.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis returned last week from Zurich, Switzerland where he
addressed the Association for the Advancement of Psychological
Understanding of Human Nature and several other international
organizations on the topic of teen drug abuse in the U.S.

<center><h2>SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996 WAKING UP<br>
PRO-FAMILY MAJORITY, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Americans of many faiths stand
here today in unity because of the horrifying reality of Partial
Birth Abortion,&quot; <b>Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer</b> said Thursday morning, before the anticipated Senate
veto override vote. &quot;In recent days, liberals and conservatives,
Democrats and Republicans and those who worship in many ways have
joined their voices to speak for those children killed as they
pass through the birth canal.&quot;

<p>

Bauer made the following statement from the U.S. Capitol with
leaders from the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish communities.
The news conference followed an ecumenical prayer breakfast for
our nation's children and the partial birth abortion vote.

<p>

<b>&quot;However this vote goes, this will not rest easy on the
conscience of the American people. This is a nation built on the
idea that all  people are created equal. This will stick in their
throats. We are a better country than one that takes the lives
of defenseless children in this way. The President should be ashamed.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996</b>.
It has proved a powerful rallying cry for many Americans. And
as it is described, more and more people recoil in horror from
what really happens to thousands of our children.

<p>

&quot;It is an issue that is waking up a pro-family majority.
And it is an issue that illustrates just how radical Bill Clinton's
abortion position is. <b>Apparently, he does not feel the pain
of healthy children</b> killed moments from birth. <b>Apparently
he does not feel the pain of children who may have handicaps to
overcome</b>, but have a world of love to offer.

<p>

&quot;We Americans have to choose what kind of people we will
be. This 'choice' screams of injustice.&quot;

<p>

<center><h4>AFTER THE VOTE, BAUER AND FAITH LEADERS WILL BE AVAILABLE 
FOR COMMENT. CALL (202)-393-2100 OR 1-800-236-8538.</h4></center>

<center><h2>REAGAN-PROCLAIMED &quot;RELIGIOUS<br>
FREEDOM WEEK&quot; SIGNIFIES BATTLE FAR<br>
FROM OVER FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council announced this
week its support for &quot;Religious Freedom Week,&quot; beginning
Sept. 23.  Proclaimed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, Religious
Freedom Week began because &quot;(t)he American people have long
recognized that the liberty we cherish must include the freedom
to worship God as each of us pleases.&quot;

<p>

In celebrating Religious Freedom Week, FRC, whose motto is &quot;Defending
Family, Faith, and Freedom,&quot; joins hundreds of pro-family
organizations and religious institutions to acknowledge the importance
of faith and religious freedom in our country.

<p>

In believing that our Founding Fathers did not intend to establish
the principle of &quot;freedom <I>from</I> religion&quot; but
rather &quot;freedom <I>of</I> religion, &quot; FRC policy and
legal analysts have worked for years on ways to promote and protect
the freedoms people of faith enjoy in this country.

<p>

FRC President Gary Bauer has taken the issue of religious freedom
to Capitol Hill on numerous occasions testifying before Congress
on a proposed Religious Liberty Amendment and on the world-wide
persecution of Christians.

<p>

The rising occurrence of church burnings and of religious persecution
both in schools and in the workplace reveals the need for continued
efforts to restore the original intent of our Founding Fathers
in the Constitution.  As President Reagan noted, the First Amendment
&quot;is the protection of religion and conscience from government
interference.  It creates neither hostility between government
and religion nor a civil religion of secularism.&quot;

<p>

Plans have already begun to build greater awareness for Religious
Freedom Week in 1997. FRC policy analysts and government affairs
office have also begun developing policy initiatives and legislative
strategies to protect religious liberty in the 105th Congress.

<center><h2>PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION:<br>
'THE SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996'</h2>

<p>

<h3>Bauer commends House;<br>
calls on Senate to overturn Clinton veto</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Partial birth abortion is the
sleeper issue of 1996,&quot; Family Research Council President
Gary L. Bauer said Thursday. As the House voted 285 to 137 to
overturn President Bill Clinton's veto of legislation to ban a
horrific procedure used in the late stages of pregnancy, Bauer
made the following comments.

<p>

&quot;The fact that the late-term abortion technique called Partial
Birth Abortion even exists shows just how terrible is the slippery
slope message that children should be 'planned and wanted' before
having value. Americans on both sides of the life debate have
joined together to say that this cruel procedure goes too far.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton administration has presented us with tremendous
irony this week in their defense of Partial Birth Abortions and
their aggressive support of abortion-causing drugs, called RU-486,
and then their surprise at the increase in child abuse. When the
political elite use the bully pulpit to argue that life has no
value unless it's healthy, planned and desired, society's weakest
members become vulnerable.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council commends the House for their courage
in highlighting a procedure so terrible, it could not be used
on animals ... and should not be used for our unborn. And we call
on the Senate to join their collegues from both sides of the aisle
to overturn Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>

<p>

<h2>HOUSE TO VOTE ON PARTIAL-BIRTH<br>
ABORTION OVERRIDE THURSDAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On the day of the vote to override
President Clinton's veto on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
(H.R.1833) in the U.S. House of Representatives, Family Research
Council Director of Communications Kristi Hamrick said, &quot;By
telling people that only 'planned and wanted' children have value,
we have opened a deadly Pandora's box for our most helpless members
of society.

<p>

&quot;This week in the news, we see the Clinton administration
pushing chemical abortions, talking about partial-birth abortions
and then commenting on an increase in child abuse. But it is no
surprise to pro-family Americans that children are being injured
as we communicate the message that children are not a blessing,
but an option or a problem.  We must talk about all children --
born and unborn -- as valuable and worthy of our sacrifices for
them. Pro-family America calls on all members of Congress to override
the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act veto. We must act today to
support all our children.&quot;

<p>

The House will begin one hour of debate at 10:30 a.m. Thursday
morning followed by a vote.

<p>

<center><h4>What Experts are Saying About Partial-Birth 
Abortions</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisors
on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term
abortions.  Because in no way can I twist my mind to see that
the late-term abortions as described -- you know, partial-birth,
and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born
-- is a medical necessity for the mother.  It certainly can't
be a necessity for the baby.  So I am opposed to ... partial birth
abortions.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>World-renowned pediatric surgeon and former Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop, in an August 19, 1996 interview with <U>American
Medical News</U>, &quot;The view from Mount Koop,&quot; p.3.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500
of the 1.5 million abortions performed each year in this country
involve the partial-birth method, in which a live fetus is pulled
part way into the birth canal before it is aborted ... But interviews
with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone,
at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year
-- three times the supposed national rate.  Moreover, doctors
say only a 'minuscule amount' are for medical reasons.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>&quot;The facts on partial-birth abortion,&quot; by Ruth
Padawer, <U>The Sunday Record</U> (Bergen County, NJ), September
15, 1996.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Congress, the public -- but most importantly women -- need
to know that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated
to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.  On the
contrary, this procedure -- which has never been evaluated in
mainstream, peer reviewed literature -- can pose a significant
threat to both her immediate health and future fertility...  We,
and many other doctors across the United States, regularly treat
women whose unborn children suffer these and other serious conditions.
Never is the partial-birth procedure medically indicated.  Rather,
such infants are regularly and safely delivered live, vaginally,
with no threat to the mother's health or fertility.  Sometimes,
as with hydrocephalus, it is first necessary to drain some of
the fluid from the baby's head.  And in some cases, a cesarean
section is indicated.  In no case is it medically necessary to
partly deliver the child vaginally, and then terminate his or
her life before completing the delivery.&quot;

<center><h2>RU-486: IT'S NO MIRACLE CURE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHERE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH?&quot; HSU 
ASKS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The Food and Drug Administration
has a responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
any drug that would be marketed for U.S. consumption. <b>But
with this rushed acceptance of RU-486, the FDA has clearly shown
that those safeguards can be ignored for political purposes</b>,&quot;
Family Research Council analyst Gracie Hsu said Wednesday as the
news broke of the conditional approval of the abortion-causing
drug regimen.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton Administration threw its political weight behind
pushing this abortion-causing drug past the safeguards that protect
American women. But this interference was not to save women's
lives. It wasn't for a breast cancer treatment or even for experimental
drugs for life-threatening diseases like AIDS.  It was simply
to approve a drug whose sole purpose is to end the life of a child,&quot;
Hsu said.

<p>

<center><h3><u>QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED:</u></h3>

<p>

<h4>HOW WILL RU-486 AFFECT WOMEN'S HEALTH?</h4></center>

<p>

During the U.S. clinical trials earlier this year, four women
required blood transfusions because they lost so much blood, 15
women required surgery, 21 required hospitalization, 13 percent
required treatment for bleeding, and five percent of all the women
in the study required narcotics for the pain.  All of these side
effects happened in spite of the fact that the women who participated
in the clinical trials were highly motivated, closely monitored,
and underwent follow-up.  We can expect that women will suffer
results far worse than these when RU-486 becomes available to
all U.S. women without the ideal conditions associated with clinical
trials.

<p>

Furthermore, the FDA has still failed to answer pressing questions
regarding how RU-486 will affect women's health.  For example,
if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- whether due
to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply with protocol -- the
medical complications could be severe, i.e., infection,
sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There is also
a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects of RU-486
on women, including the future fertility of women, the possible
link with breast cancer, and the medical complications resulting
from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

Beyond these issues of physical health, RU-486 will also negatively
impact women's emotional and psychological health.  The numbers
of women suffering from post-abortion trauma are already reaching
a critical mass, and we can expect these numbers to dramatically
increase with the introduction of RU-486.  This is because RU-486
requires women not only to take the abortion drug with their own
hand, but also to bear the psychological trauma of viewing their
unborn children after the &quot;products of conception&quot; are
passed.

<p>

<center><h4>WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IF WOMEN BLEED TO DEATH?</h4></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration partnered with an abortion advocacy
organization, the Population Council, to bring RU-486 to the United
States. The drug manufacturers did not advocate or advance this.
Therefore, who will be legally responsible for what happens to
women?  Will women who are harmed by the drug have recourse to
sue?  Will the American taxpayers foot the bill for any problems
since this administration pushed the drugs even without the corroboration
of a drug manufacturer?

<p>

<center><h4>*Most asked media question*<br>
WHERE WILL THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT GO IF THERE ARE NO
PRAYERFUL PROTEST SPOTS?</h4></center>

<p>

The pro-life community is hardly confined to abortion clinics.
Rather, the pro-life movement is composed of concerned citizens
all across the United States who believe that human life is valuable
at all stages of life, from the moment of conception to the time
of natural death.  While some in the pro-life community choose
to peacefully protest abortion by praying in front of abortion
clinics, the pro-life community is widely represented by its compassion
for women in crisis pregnancies.  Crisis pregnancy centers provide
pregnant women with hope in the form of financial, material, and
emotional support.  These pregnancy care centers also provide
loving counsel for those women who suffer from post-abortion trauma.
Furthermore, adoption agencies provide women with a way to give
their children the gift of a family.  These ministries to women
will not change, but the pro-life community is saddened that the
approval of RU-486 will only cause more women to seek their services
as more women face the tragedy of post-abortion trauma.

<center><h2>FRC EQUIPS <i>MOMS AND DADS</i> WITH<br>
<i>SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE</i>, A TOOL FOR<br>
KEEPING PARENTS AWARE AND<br>
INVOLVED</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHAT A DIFFERENCE A PARENT MAKES,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council released Tuesday
the 1996 <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I>, a 64-page
resource to help parents stay informed and involved in their children's
educational process.

<p>

&quot;Parents today are spending too much time combating condoms,
offensive curriculum, and failed federal programs,&quot; FRC President
Gary Bauer said upon the release of the <I>Survival Guide</I>.
&quot;While test scores plummet, horror stories about flagrant
breaches of parental rights are coming to us from around the country.&quot;
Here are some of the stories:

<p><ul>

<li>On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls in East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania, were required to submit to a genital examination
as part of a &quot;routine&quot; physical.  Without parental consent,
the school conducted the exams blocking the exit door and refusing
to allow the crying and pleading young girls to call their parents.

<p>

<li>Psychological testing under the guise of standardized testing
includes intrusive questions about the child's emotional state
and his relationship with his parents.  For example, a 149-question
survey used in Minnesota public schools without parental approval
contains questions such as:  Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
How often have you run away from home?  Have you felt so discouraged
or hopeless that you wondered if anything was worthwhile?

<p>

<li>In Stephens County, Georgia, parents were shocked to discover
that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had been driven to a
birth control clinic by a public school staffer without their
knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control pills and
condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and AIDS tests.
The parents were then denied access to the test results by the
school, which defended its actions on the grounds that the counselor
believed she was doing what was best for the girls.

</ul><p>

Author and FRC Education Policy Analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said
the <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I> was designed to
help parents not only know their rights in these situations but
also how to prevent them from happening in the future.

<p>

&quot;Families need not simply survive school,&quot; Marshall
said. &quot;They should be free to thrive and excel in any environment
- public, private, or home-based education.  Parents playing an
active role makes all the difference in children's educational
attainment.  They are the key to everyday school survival, and
we need to equip them to do the job they do best.&quot;

<p>

The <I>Survival Guide</I> is a detailed look at educational issues
facing all parents, whether they help with homework or homeschool.
The guide defines education jargon, like &quot;outcome-based
education,&quot; &quot;one-stop shopping center,&quot; and &quot;vouchers&quot;;
it explains students' religious liberties in the public school;
and it details what parental rights are and how parents can defend
them.  The <I>Guide</I> also introduces parents to the variety
of educational options available to them, including classical
and parent-based education.  Extensive reference lists place key
resources, from newsletters to on-line information, at parents
fingertips.

<p>

&quot;Parents are looking for alternatives and answers every day,&quot;
Marshall said. &quot;By getting information into the hands of
each parent, this guide is a simple, yet powerful way to restore
parents to their proper place at the helm of their child's educational
journey.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS BILL TO ELIMINATE<br>
GOALS 2000</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;This long overdue legislation will send federal
tax dollars back where they are needed the most -- in the hands
of the parents and teachers who can best decide how to use them,&quot;
Marshall says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Family Research Council supported the
&quot;Goals 2000 Elimination Act&quot; introduced by Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-SC) at a news conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

<p>

&quot;This legislation repeals the federal Goals 2000 program
and sends its funding back where it belongs,&quot; FRC policy
analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said, &quot;to the local school boards,
elected by parents and community members, who have the authority
to make decisions for their own schools.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Goals 2000 snatched local authority and put it in the federal
government's hands.  Under Goals 2000, state and local school
districts must spend their money according to Washington's bureaucratic
priorities, not their local needs,&quot; Marshall said.

<p>

&quot;Take a closer look at Goals 2000 and you'll see that it's
not about the 3 R's.  Read the eight national education goals
and objectives, and you'll find Goals 2000 talking about enhanced
prenatal health care, comprehensive sex education and requirements
for American businesses with regard to education.  The program
isn't about education -- it's about using our schools to forward
a broad, liberal social agenda,&quot; Marshall explained.

<p>

&quot;We all know that education in America is suffering,&quot;
Marshall says, &quot;but Goals 2000 is not the solution.  Enhanced
social services -- including school-based health care and sex
education beginning as early as kindergarten -- can't solve the
fundamental crisis our schools.  A return to what schools <I>ought</I>
to do best -- teaching the academic basics like reading, writing
and arithmetic -- is the right answer.

<p>

&quot;FRC applauds Rep. Graham's commitment to the family and
to education as demonstrated by the Goals 2000 Elimination Act.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;AMERICA DODGES THE BULLET,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS OF ENDA DEFEAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;America has dodged the bullet,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said of the Senate's
narrow (49-50) defeat of the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination
Act (ENDA).

<p>

&quot;For the U.S. Senate to come within one vote of enshrining
homosexuality along with race, sex and ethnicity in our nation's
civil rights laws represents a disconnect from reality.

<p>

&quot;Many ENDA supporters equated homosexuality with being black
or Hispanic. But minority groups that enjoy special protections
do so because of group histories of political powerlessness, economic
deprivation and unchangeable characteristics.  Homosexuals do
not qualify in any of these categories.

<p>

&quot;This was a homosexual jobs bill, pure and simple. It would
have forced employers to keep detailed records of the private
sexual preferences of their employees. How bizarre that the defenders
of <I>the constitutional right of privacy</I> were prepared to
annihilate privacy in the service of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

&quot;ENDA would have led, inexorably, to quotas and set-asides.
All the most divisive social conflicts in America today would
have been inflamed by the passage of this ill-advised legislation.
Can nearly half of our senators really want that?  Supporters
of  ENDA shrewdly used paper exemptions for churches and synagogues
to create a facade of deference to the religious community.  But,
make no mistake, this bill would have been used as a sledgehammer
to smash faith-based, for-profit institutions -- like religious
broadcasters, like religious publishing houses and bookstores,
like summer camps for religious youth.

<p>

&quot;Passage of ENDA would have signaled the contempt of Senate
liberals for the legitimate rights of the states, one-third of
which still list sodomy as a crime. Worst of all, ENDA would have
encouraged more young people to enter an immoral and unhealthy
lifestyle. Society cannot be indifferent to the signals -- subtle
and not-so-subtle -- that it sends its youth. ENDA would have meant
that the U.S. government doesn't care whether young people who
are struggling with their sexual identity resolve to live normal,
heterosexual lives or not.

<p>

&quot;But this <I>is</I> a day to savor victory. It is sweet because
it was so hard won. The overwhelming vote of the Senate (85-14)
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
sends a clear message that this basic institution is valued and
will be fought for. No one can take seriously the argument that
it is beneath the dignity of the Senate to debate the survival
of marriage. Failure to pass DOMA would have exposed the entire
federal union -- <I>all</I> the states, <I>all</I> branches of the
federal government -- to the dangers of an imperial judiciary. With
this stunning vote, the Supreme Court of Hawaii has all the justification
it needs to <I>reject</I> gay marriage. Let's put this bad idea
to rest now -- and forever. President Clinton should now eat his
spinach and sign DOMA immediately.&quot;

<center><h2>SENATE'S PASSAGE OF DOMA IS<br>
&quot;A VOTE FOR COMMON SENSE,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>Calls on President to &quot;eat your spinach<br>
and sign the Defense of Marriage Act&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
hailed the overwhelming vote of 85 to 14 by the U.S. Senate to
pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which puts the bill on President
Clinton's desk.

<p>

&quot;Now that Congress has done its job and passed this wise
and needed legislation, we are saying to the President, 'eat your
spinach and sign the Defense of Marriage Act as you promised.'&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Given the gravity of the judicial challenge
in Hawaii, it is imperative that DOMA become the law of the land
as soon as possible so that the states won't be forced to accept
counterfeit 'marriage' should the Hawaiian courts take the radical
step of destroying the traditional definition.

<p>

&quot;It is amazing that we even had to fight a battle to ensure
that marriage remained the legal union of a man and a woman,&quot;
Bauer continued. &quot;But it was also heartening that so many
people around the nation rallied to defend this irreplaceable
institution.  The huge margin of victory was won by millions of
people who let their representatives know how they felt.&quot;

<p>

&quot;We commend Sen. Nickles and Reps. Bob Barr and Steve Largent
for their leadership in bringing the Defense of Marriage Act to
passage.

<p>

&quot;Failure to pass DOMA would have jeopardized the moral foundation
upon which the rest of society is built,&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Marriage has already suffered a loss of respect thanks
to the sexual revolution.  Many people are struggling with broken
families and are trying to put their lives back together.  Many
have prevailed over difficult circumstances and sought a better
life for their own families.  But society must never deliberately
raise the bar higher for the next generation of children. They
deserve the marriage-based blessings that previous generations
have enjoyed.

<p>

&quot;America's commitment to marriage has been strengthened by
this Act.&quot;

<center><h2>ENDA WOULD USHER IN NATIONAL<br>
HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA, KNIGHT SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&QUOT;'GAY JOBS BILL' THREATENS FREEDOMS OF RELIGION,<br>
CONSCIENCE, ASSOCIATION AND SPEECH&QUOT;</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (HR 1863; S972) is
a radical change in workplace discrimination law,&quot; said Robert
Knight, Family Research Council's Director of Cultural Studies.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), is
currently under consideration in the Senate and could be voted
on at any time.

<p>

&quot;What is being described as a harmless gesture of 'tolerance'
toward homosexuals in the workplace is actually a mighty weapon
to be used against both employers and employees who believe that
homosexuality is wrong.  This 'gay jobs bill' threatens the freedoms
of religion, conscience, association and speech,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;ENDA puts children's camps, Christian- and Jewish-owned
businesses, and many other institutions in the crosshairs of homosexual
activist lawyers.  At its root,&quot; Knight noted, &quot;ENDA
would distort the concept of civil rights by creating an unprecedented
behavioral component whose outer limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

&quot;The so-called 'religious exemption' in Kennedy's amendment
is so narrow that it will leave millions of devoutly religious
Americans exposed to the heavy hand of big government.  ENDA's
sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; eliminates
any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual behavior,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;ENDA guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation
which could hurt small businesses most of all.

<p>

&quot;ENDA paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference,
regardless of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed;
(remember Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights
Act would never lead to quotas?); prohibits employers from disciplining
or taking into account in any way sexual activity <b>on or off
the job</b> by an employee (the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is infinitely expandable); defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
so broadly that all sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality,
are given special protection and therefore moral status on a par
with sex within marriage; and suggests the federal government
is officially supportive of sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals
by definition have sex with more than one person.

<p>

&quot;People want homosexuals to have the same rights -- not more
rights -- in the workplace as anyone else,&quot; Knight said.  &quot;The
federal government has no business ordering millions of Americans
to accommodate behavior that they believe is wrong and destructive.&quot;

<i>&quot;ON DRUGS<br>
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS<br>
SURRENDER&quot;</i></h2>

<p>

<h4>Available NOW along with other policy works
on the growing drug problem in America.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The policy debate over the drug
problem has radically changed from one that tried to find effective
ways of keeping our children from drugs to 'harm reduction' strategies
which facilitate 'safer' drug use ... and you can see the result
of that seriously flawed switch,&quot; said Robert L. Maginnis,
drug policy analyst for the Family Research Council. The policy
expert made his comments as more evidence was unveiled this week
on the growing drug crisis in America.

<p>

&quot;Illicit drugs kill 20,000 Americans every year,&quot; Maginnis
noted. &quot;We must get serious about the life and death struggle
that casual attitudes toward drug use ignore.&quot;

WEEK:</h4>

<p>
<li>Pro-life candidates win all three primaries -- Georgia, Kansas

<p>

<li>These included:

<p><ul>

-- the fight for Dole's senate seat<br>
-- the Speaker's home state<br>
-- the state of a governor who has been on the short list of
Vice Presidential candidates

</ul><p>

<li><I>New York Times'</I> polling shows what Gary Bauer has said
all along, the people making up the GOP delegation are primarily
pro-life.

<p>

<li>To the contrary of what pro-abortion Republicans have said,
the platform remains a document that reflects the majority view
of the GOP -- that life is an important issue.

<p>

<li>Gary Bauer continues to be a champion in the fight for life,
meeting with the majority of the delegation repeatedly during
these days to find reasonable ground.

<center><h2>DO YOUR KIDS INFLUENCE YOUR VOTE?<br>
FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SAYS<br>
TRACK THE &quot;PARENT GAP&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON --</b> In the last presidential election, the &quot;Parent
Gap&quot; proved to be far bigger than the &quot;Gender Gap,&quot;
as voters with children in the home showed less support for Clinton
than childless voters or empty nesters.  In fact, &quot;the demographic
peers of George Bush and Ross Perot were more responsible for
the election of Bill Clinton and Albert Gore than any other age
group,&quot; noted Family Research Council Vice President for
Policy Bill Mattox.

<p>

Mattox made his observations in &quot;The Silent Minority -- The
Hidden Electoral Impact of Children&quot; based on original, scientific
polling FRC commissioned after the last presidential election.

<p>

On Wednesday, Mattox noted that the research tracks with current
polling which underscores that <i>marriage and property ownership
are good indicators</i> of whether someone votes conservatively.

<p>

&quot;<i>But tracking marriage alone is not enough</i>. The presence
of children in the home is sometimes even more important than
marital status,&quot; Mattox said.

<p>

<b>In the last election, &quot;none of the standard demographic
variables -- gender, income, ethnicity, religion, age, marital
status, or education -- was as reliable in predicting whether
or not someone voted for Clinton as the presence of children in
the home,&quot; Mattox reported.</b>

<p>

In fact, the presence of children in the home is a good indicator
of conservative leanings as a whole and a heightened interest
in &quot;values&quot; issues specifically, Mattox said.

<center><h2>FDA SHOULD NOT APPROVE RU-486 DUE TO<br>
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, FRC SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;The federal government should not promote a drug whose 
sole purpose is to destroy human life,&quot; Policy Analyst Gracie 
Hsu says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Indeed, we would all be outraged 
if the federal government ever issued an approval of Dr. Kevorkian's 
killing machine simply because he claims there are 'therapeutic' 
effects for his patient,&quot; Family Research Council Policy Analyst 
Gracie Hsu said Thursday.  &quot;We know otherwise.  In the same way, 
the federal government should not give its imprimatur to RU-486 
because no government should ever be responsible for the killing 
of innocent human beings or an accomplice to the mothers who would 
take the lives of their own children.&quot;

<p>

Hsu made her statement as Family Research Council and the National 
Right to Life Committee co-sponsored a news conference on the 
medical risks and legal implications of RU-486.   The news conference 
was held one day before a hearing by the Reproductive Health Drugs 
Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
consider whether the abortion drug RU-486 should be recommended for 
use in the United States. Hsu is scheduled to testify before the 
Advisory Committee Friday.

<p>

&quot;It is unacceptable for the federal government, through the 
vehicle of the FDA, to promote a drug whose sole purpose is to 
destroy the life of another human being.  There are no therapeutic 
effects of RU-486,&quot; Hsu said.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, the FDA has an ethical duty not to approve a 
drug that would be harmful to the mothers taking the drug.  We 
already know that at least one woman in Iowa lost so much blood 
as a result of taking RU-486 that she almost died.  And there are 
other issues regarding the abortion drug's safety and efficacy.  
For example, if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- 
whether due to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply to 
protocol -- the medical complications could be severe, i.e., 
infection, sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There 
is also a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects 
of RU-486 on women, including the future fertility of the women, 
the possible link with breast cancer, and the medical complications 
resulting from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

&quot;The FDA has heretofore compromised its objectivity and ethical 
standards because FDA Commissioner David Kessler promised that he 
would place RU-486 on a fast track and approve the drug within six 
months.  FRC calls on the FDA to halt its attempt to circumvent its 
own approval statutes to ensure safe and effective drugs for the 
sake of the lives and safety of both women and children.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL PULLS OUT<br>
OF &quot;STACKED&quot; HEARING UNDER STRONG<br>
PROTEST</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Ordinarily, we are honored to
be invited to testify at a congressional hearing, but we won't
allow ourselves to be used as a fig leaf for a propaganda party
on a homosexual 'civil rights' bill,&quot; said  Robert H. Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.
&quot;It is obvious that they are staging this stacked hearing
now to try to cripple final passage of the Defense of Marriage
Act.&quot;

<p>

Knight had been slated to testify on July 17, 1996 before the
Government Programs Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee,
chaired by Rep. Peter Torkildsen (R-MA).  The topic was to be
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) (HR 1863) which would
give homosexuals special rights in the workplace that other employees
do not enjoy.

<p>

Knight, who had testified in 1994 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
Committee on an earlier version of the bill, canceled after learning
the lineup of witnesses.  The July 17 hearing lineup consisted
of three panels, with 10 of 12 people speaking for ENDA.

<p>

The first panel was slated to be of five businesspeople, all of
whom were supporters of ENDA.  The second panel was to consist
entirely of purported &quot;victims&quot; of discrimination because
of their sexual orientation.  No speakers were invited who had
suffered at the hands of homosexual activists wielding 
&quot;anti-discrimination&quot; charges. No former homosexuals were 
invited to counter the faulty research that has been publicized on 
causes of homosexuality.

<p>

The final panel was to have included Family Research Council and
a spokeswoman from the Small Business Survival Committee, along
with two pro-homosexual witnesses.

<p>

Both Family Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee
pulled out of the hearing, citing similar reasons:  the hearing
was a stacked showcase for ENDA, and not enough notice was given
to attain more witnesses to provide balance.  The Small Business
Survival Committee representative also said she had a prior commitment.

<p>

&quot;Torkildsen's Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Ted Kennedy,
has announced his intention to attach ENDA to DOMA when the bill
is considered in the Senate.  Since this addition would be unacceptable,
it is clearly an attempt to kill DOMA,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

&quot;ENDA is being raised at this time not on its own merits
but as a vehicle that they hope will derail the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA) which passed the House on a vote of 342-67,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;Why would anyone who supports DOMA want to be a party
to this charade?&quot;

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has said he <I>would sign it in its current
form</I>. Any effort to tamper with the language might jeopardize
final passage of the bill,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

Family Research Council had urged the Chairman's staff to contact
several other potential witnesses, including Anthony Falzarano,
Director of Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries in Washington, D.C.;
Seattle businessman Bryan Griggs, who was forced to defend himself
against a false charge of discrimination by a homosexual employee,
and Joseph Broadus, a George Mason University law professor and
expert in civil rights law.  Falzarano was never contacted; Broadus
was unable to be reached, and Griggs received a call at about
3:30 p.m. Washington time the day before the hearing, after Family
Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee had pulled
out under protest.  Statements from Broadus, Falzarano and Griggs
are available from Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The timing of the hearing and the lack of balance constitute
a naked attempt to use ENDA as a way to harm passage of DOMA,
and Family Research Council will not be used as a pawn in this
cynical game,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>RU 486: SUNNY RHETORIC OR BLOODY REALITY?</h2></center>

<p>

On <b>Thursday, July 18</b>, one day before the FDA Advisory Board
hearing to review the application to market the RU 486 abortion
technique in the United States, Family Research Council and a
number of national pro-life groups will hold a news briefing to
highlight the viewpoints of medical and legal experts on the dangerous
aspects of RU 486.

<p>

<center>The news conference will be held:<br>
<b>Thursday, July 18, 1996<br>
10:00 a.m.<br>
First Amendment Room, National Press Club</b></center>

<p>

This highly controversial drug has been put on the fast track.
Reports claim that the American trials have had no serious problems,
however there are many crucial questions that remain unanswered.
In fact, one doctor's patient was close to death after having
an RU 486 abortion.  Dr. Mark Louviere, an Iowa physician who
supports legalized abortion, will speak Thursday about his experience
administering the drug to a patient who lost more than half of
her blood volume after taking RU 486.

<p>

Other doctors and an attorney will address the many risks and
complications of RU 486, including: the psychological trauma,
safety and liability issues, and the problems with the approval
process.  For example, five Committee members and the executive
secretary of the Advisory Committee may have a conflict of interest
and bias in favor of abortion.

<p>

Family Research Council Policy Analyst <b>Gracie Hsu</b> will
testify Friday before the Advisory Committee for Reproductive
Health Drugs and will be present at the news conference for interviews.

<center><h2>FAMILIES SALUTE CONGRESS ON DEFENSE<br>
OF MARRIAGE VOTE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It is not intolerance to believe in traditional morality,&quot; 
Bauer says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;<b>Defending normalcy is not
an intolerant act.</b> It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality. The vast majority of Americans, from Hawaii -- where
this attack on marriage originates -- to the other 49 states,
all agree that marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes.
Family Research Council applauds this historic affirmation of
marriage,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer
said Friday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after the House voted 342 to
67 to pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which would define marriage
as the union of a man and woman in federal law and would allow
states to refuse to recognize same sex unions as marriage.

<p>

Bauer said: &quot;<b>We commend those pro-family champions who
voted today to protect marriage</b> from the aggressive legal
actions of homosexual activists and the ambitions of liberal judges.
The House made an important first step in defending marriage from
its attackers. <b>Family Research Council calls on the Senate
to also support the foundational, fundamental union of marriage
when the bill reaches it shortly. And FRC calls on the Senate
to reject diversionary efforts -- as the House did -- to alter
the bill.

<p>

&quot;Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two
women down the street want to call what they have 'marriage'?
Why does it hurt you or your marriage? Well it doesn't -- unless
they bring the law into it.</b> Then the fiction is imposed on
everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that genuine institution has earned. The force of law would
come against businesses, school and all institutions -- such as
the Boy Scouts -- that do not embrace homosexuality as a good
and normal behavior.

<p>

&quot;There are many relationships in which love is involved.
But marriage is a unique bonding of the two sexes, with the probable
expectation of procreation of children. It is the core of civilization
and is universally honored.

<p>

&quot;Good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse for simply saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm. <b>It is not hatred
to prefer normalcy</b>.&quot;

<h2>FRC TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL...</h2></center>

<p>

<li><h4>GARY BAUER ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4>

<p>

On <B>Thursday, July 11</B> at <B>10:00 AM</B>, Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer will testify before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the Defense of Marriage
Act (S. 1740). The hearing will take place in the <B>Senate Dirksen
Building, Room 226</B>.

<p>

&quot;This is by far one of the most crucial pieces
of legislation ever to be voted on in Congress,&quot; Bauer said
Wednesday. &quot;This bill was not invented to oppress a segment
of our society, but rather to defend the institution of marriage
- the core of our civilization - from being redefined into oblivion.&quot;

<p>

The House of Representatives is tentatively scheduled
to vote on DOMA (H.R. 3396) on Friday, July 12.

<p>

<li><h4>GRACIE HSU ON ABSTINENCE</h4>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DECISION FREES CABLE<br>
OPERATORS TO REFUSE PORNOGRAPHIC<br>
PROGRAMS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Major Court victory will allow local cable companies
to protect our children from pornography,&quot; Cleaver
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> American families fighting to shelter
young children from cable television pornography won a major battle
today as the Supreme Court upheld the right of private cable operators
to screen pornographic programs from their leased access channels
in its <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium,
Inc. v. FCC</I> decision. &quot;This is a major victory for parents,
children and the First Amendment alike,&quot; says Cathy Cleaver,
Director of Legal Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The Court's reaffirmation of the indecency standard as a
check to determine which material is suitable for children is
significant,&quot; Cleaver continued. A June 12th federal district
court decision in Philadelphia ruled that the definition of indecency
as &quot;patently offensive communication, taken in context, which
describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs,
as measured by contemporary community standards&quot; is too vague
as it applies to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) which sought
to protect children from indecent material on the Internet.  According
to Cleaver, &quot;This latest decision greatly increases the likelihood
of a reversal of the Philadelphia decision when it is heard by
the Supreme Court.&quot;

<p>

In today's decision, the Court upheld the First Amendment rights
of cable operators by giving back to them the editorial power
to decide what programming they <I>do not</I> want to transmit.
However, the Court struck down provisions that <I>required</I>
cable operators to &quot;segregate and to block&quot; transmission
of sexual programs which they <I>choose</I> to show.  The Court
did not free cable operators to refuse pornographic programs on
public, educational or governmental channels because &quot;cable
operators have not historically exercised editorial control&quot;
over such channels.

<p>

&quot;The Court has done its part by giving cable operators the
ability to refuse pornographic programming,&quot; Cleaver said.
&quot;Now it is time for citizens to hold cable operators accountable
to the community.  Anyone who is concerned with this issue should
contact their local cable company and let them know, in no uncertain
terms, that pornography -- on any channel -- is simply unacceptable.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TREADS<br>
ON RELIGIOUS, CIVIL RIGHTS<br>
OF CATHOLICS IN THE MILITARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;President Bill Clinton's administration
has gagged Catholic chaplains in the military,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer noted on Friday.

<p>

In response to a massive post card mailing from the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops calling upon the Congress to ensure the acceptance
of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, HR 1833, Clinton's appointees
in the Pentagon moved to silence Catholic chaplains. An order
was sent from the Pentagon to the military chaplains not to participate
in the post card mailing.

<p>

&quot;Catholic service members and their families will thus be
denied the guidance of their priests and their bishops. They will
also be prevented from participating in an effort to communicate
to the Congress their own strongly held beliefs on one of the
premier moral issues of our day,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

Bauer said he deplored the Clinton administration action. &quot;This
is denial of the religious and civil rights of Catholic Americans
serving in the military. Every day, these loyal Americans put
their lives on the line to defend our liberties. They deserve
respect, not abuse.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted Clinton administration claims that the pro-life post
card campaign constitutes &quot;partisan political activity.&quot;
But this claim is belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban was passed by overwhelmingly bi-partisan majorities in both
houses. Among the supporters in the House were such leading Democrats
as Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.), Minority Whip David Bonior
(Mich.) and freshman Patrick Kennedy (R.I.).  In the Senate, respected
senior Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan (N.Y.) vowed to support
the override of Clinton's April 10 veto.  &quot;It's just too
close to infanticide,&quot;  Moynihan said.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council endorses the efforts of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops to communicate with their co-religionists
in the armed forces,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;We will stand beside
our friends in defense of children threatened by this hideous
and painful method of abortion.&quot;

<title>June 28, 1996 Press Release</title>

<body>

<font size=-1>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
June 28, 1996<br>
CONTACT: Kristi S. Hamrick -- (202) 393-2100. For Radio: Kristin Hansen.

<p>

<center><h2>ON THE &quot;MORNING-AFTER PILL&quot;:<br>
FRC TO FDA: VOTE NO ON RELABELING,<br>
IT'S NEITHER &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; NOR<br>
&quot;CONTRACEPTION&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick on Friday urged the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to reject relabeling of oral contraceptives
to include abortion-causing uses.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick said: &quot;Although proponents of the 'morning-after
pill' like to call it 'emergency contraception,' the effect of
relabeling oral birth control pills for post-coital use would
make the pills neither 'emergency' nor 'contraception.'  Indeed,
we can expect that, if relabeling occurs, girls and women may
forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume
larger dosages of the pill after sex.  And, the major function
of the pill when used after sex, if conception has occurred, would
not be 'contraception' (preventing fertilization) but 'abortion'
(preventing implantation of a living human being).

<p>

&quot;On the societal level, the 'morning-after pill' further
distances the act of sex from the physical consequence of pregnancy
and especially from its proper context within marriage.  Therefore,
it would be much harder to send a message of responsible sexual
behavior, especially to young men and women, when the immediate
potential effect of pregnancy is removed.  But even without pregnancy,
sex has consequences -- both physical and emotional.  Without
the fear of pregnancy, some might mistakenly presume that it is
'safe' to engage in sex, and therefore, initiate sex earlier or
engage in sex more frequently with multiple partners.  However,
these behaviors significantly increase the risk of sexually-transmitted
diseases and infertility.  On the emotional level, more often
than not, it is the woman who gets hurt by these noncommittal
liaisons.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, a 'morning-after' remedy would give men 'a
way out' from assuming responsibility for their sexual behavior,
shifting the power balance even more in favor of men.  The real
result of this overdose of birth control pills would be to cut
more of the moral ground out from under women who are trying to
make good choices for their lives.

<p>

&quot;Why should the FDA be so interested in relabeling oral contraceptives
when the drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change?
Currently, consumers can hold their physician liable if a drug
used for off-label purposes results in adverse health consequences.
Relabeling may protect physicians from liabilitiy, but it hardly
helps their patients, especially when long-term physical and social
consequences have not been carefully examined.&quot;

<p>

<i>Mrs. Hamrick made her statements on the eve of the FDA Reproductive
Health Drugs Advisory Committee hearing set for Friday</i> in
Maryland.  The continued push for relabeling comes from liberal
feminist and pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood, the
Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy and the American Medical
Women's Association which filed a citizen's petition to force
the issue.

<p>

<b>An FDA decision to relabel oral contraceptives for use as a
&quot;morning-after pill&quot; would be troubling for several
reasons:</b>

<p>

(1) If the girl/woman did indeed become pregnant (post-fertilization),
the morning-after pill <i>would work, except in rare cases, as
an <b>abortifacient</b></i>, thickening the uterine lining to
prevent implantation.  The embryonic human being has already been
alive and growing for about a week, and since human life begins
at the moment of conception, preventing implantation is not 
&quot;contraception,&quot; it is &quot;abortion&quot; and should be 
treated as such.

<p>

(2) Furthermore, there are <i><b>serious potential risks</b></i>
to the women taking the &quot;morning-after pills.&quot;  For
example, it is quite likely that FDA approval of post-coital use
would cause women to change their behavior and use &quot;contraception&quot;
only after sex rather than the currently specified daily dosage
at a particular time.  The effect of consuming larger dosages
of birth control pills frequently is not known. <i>There are
apt to be <b>side effects</b></i>, potentially on future fertility,
possibly producing birth defects in surviving children, certainly
on the woman's immediate health, for it would compound the discomfort
of the regular-dosage &quot;pill&quot; -- nausea, bleeding, etc.

<p>

(3) These &quot;morning-after pills&quot; also <i>give men an
upper hand in <b>highly pressured sex situations</b>, and tilt
the power relationship in favor of the man</i>.  Recent research
reveals that many girls feel pressured to have sex by their boyfriends.
With the availability of these FDA-approved post-coital pills,
no longer can these girls appeal to the fact that they are not
&quot;on the pill&quot; or that they fear pregnancy; indeed, this
removes one of the most effective reasons which these girls may
use to defend themselves.  This could have the societal effect
of cheapening women, and sexual abuse may occur more often.

<p>

(4) One societal consequence of relabeling oral contraceptives
would be to <i>falsely create an equivalency between abortion
and contraception</i>.  It trivializes human life even more to
say that the pills' abortifacient nature in this context is no
more significant than simply using contraception.  It also helps
foster an attitude of irresponsibility with regards to sex, <i>placing
a misguided emphasis on <b>short-term rather than long-term thinking</b>
and consequences</i>.

<p>

(5) Drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change. <i>Relabeling
shifts the burden from physicians protecting patients, to patients
protecting themselves</i>.  If patients suffer from adverse consequences
associated with taking the &quot;morning-after pill,&quot; relabeling
may protect physicians from liability, but it doesn't help the
patients who have less recourse against such harm.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DOOMS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court today struck down
the Virginia Military Institute's 157-year-old tradition of providing
single-sex education in <I>U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>.
The Family Research Council had filed a friend of the court
brief in this case favoring single-sex public colleges.  FRC Senior
Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that the decision &quot;limits
the diversity of education alternatives and obstructs a state's
traditional duty to provide education.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Through eliminating publicly funded single-sex
education, the Supreme Court effectually instituted the Equal
Rights Amendment which failed to muster support from a majority
of the American people.  The ERA sought to equate gender with
race for discrimination laws despite the obvious differences between
men and women which do not exist among different races.  Nevertheless,
the Supreme Court by-passed the Constitution attempting to equate
race with gender by judicial fiat.&quot;

<p>

While this particular case appears to empower a woman's ability
to select the university of her choice, the shift in equal protection
jurisprudence may invalidate all 87 single-sex education facilities,
82 of which exist for females.  This shift precludes both men
and women from choosing to receive the benefits of single-sex
education.

<p>

Maginnis noted that &quot;research shows single-sex education
enables students to achieve higher educational performance and
encourages women to pursue majors such as science, math, and management.
Recognizing differences between the sexes and preparing educational
curriculum accordingly is rational; ignoring obvious differences
between the sexes in hopes they will disappear is nonsensical.&quot;

<p>

Although single-sex education may still exist in private schools,
the Supreme Court decision eliminates the possibility of single-sex
education for a large segment of the population who cannot afford
the cost of attending a private institution. Maginnis said that
&quot;the options available to individuals seeking an education
most appropriate for their specific needs is eliminated.&quot;

<center><h2><u>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</u><br>
REDEFINING MARRIAGE WITHOUT<br>
DESTROYING AMERICAN SOCIETY

<p>

HOW DO WE KNOW?<br>
ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AT A MEDIA<br>
&amp; HILL STAFF BRIEFING ON JULY 2</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a special briefing for media and
Capitol Hill staffers, national leaders in the fields of law,
medicine, education and culture will outline the societal implications
of redefining marriage.

<p>

<b>Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer will host
this historic briefing from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in the U.S.
Capitol, room HC-5, on July 2. Speakers list TBA.</b>

<p>

&quot;Marriage was not invented to oppress homosexuals,&quot;
Bauer noted. &quot;But most of the conversation on the Defense
of Marriage Act has centered around people's perceptions of the
homosexual experience, rather than on the consequences of  a tremendous
cultural change. The purpose of this event is to present intellectual
answers to the toughest questions. And to introduce national leaders
to the media on a revolutionary topic.

<p>

&quot;We have not begun to discuss, as a nation, the implications
of same sex 'marriage' on the law, our school, or our community.
We have barely acknowledged the many benefits of marriage between
a committed man and woman. We owe it to ourselves to understand
the possible outcomes of this unprecedented change.&quot;

<center><h2>GARY BAUER AND GRASSROOTS LEADERS ON<br>
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT ...

<p>

HOW DOES AMERICA VIEW AN END TO<br>
MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> For a discussion of the grassroots
implications of redefining marriage, reporters, columnists and
editors should plan to attend a <B>9:30 A.M. MONDAY, JUNE 24</B>
news conference in the <B>MAIN LOUNGE</B> of the <B>NATIONAL PRESS
CLUB</B>. Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer and
grassroots leaders will detail the need for the Defense of Marriage
Act along with the implications of destroying this pivotal union.

<p>

&quot;Nothing is as foundational for a culture as family. And
with poll after poll showing that American's number one concern
is family breakdown, this effort to cause the family death by
political correctness is even more out of place,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

To discuss the grassroots reaction and strategy of DOMA, pro-family
leaders from the following states will attend: MICHIGAN, OHIO,
CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA, IDAHO,
MAINE and VIRGINIA.

<p>

Many of the men and women who will be represented have already
won battles to protect marriage. Others are in the legislative
process in the states, and all will be calling for Washington
to respect the right of citizens to set the laws for their individual
states.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act both defines marriage for the federal
codes and establishes the right of states to make laws governing
marriage for their citizens.

<center><h3>DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PREPARE TO RELEASE<br>
&quot;FAMILIES FIRST&quot; AGENDA SUNDAY...</h3>

<p>

<h2>BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR COPY TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b>What is a pro-family agenda? What would
America look like if family policy was more than just political
rhetoric? For answers to those questions, reporters and editors
do not have to wait for the Democratic event scheduled for Sunday.
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has spent
more than 20 years answering those questions and has written a
concise book detailing what a pro-family America would look like.

<p>

For any reporter wondering how a prominent pro-family conservative
evaluates family issues, the book is a great reference and easy-to-use
guide. In fact, at the end of every chapter, yes-or-no questions
make it simple to analyze the kinds of policy initiatives making
daily news.

<p>

Already, Gary Bauer's book has sold more than 300,000 copies.
In fact, it is the number one best-selling paperback on the Christian
book sellers list.

<p>

Some people think it takes a village to figure out what's best
for children. For millions of Americans, parents decide one on
one every day.

<p>

<b>If you're looking for a pro-family American agenda, call Family
Research Council at 1-800-225-4008 or 202-393-2100.</b>

<h4>&quot;It's time to put teeth to our convictions<br>
and stop rewarding barbarity&quot; FRC says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For 15 years, the United States
has extended 'most favored nation' trade status to China.  Originally,
it had been argued that an economic 'open door' might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase,&quot; Family Research
Council Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu said Tuesday.

<p>

Hsu made her comments as Rep. Chris Smith's International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee began its hearing on &quot;China
MFN:  Human Rights Consequences.&quot;  FRC urged Congress to
pass legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.
The House of Representatives is expected to take up legislation
regarding China's MFN status next week.

<p>

&quot;It was seven years ago when Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square;&quot; Hsu continued,
&quot;it was only last year when Hong Kong newspapers reported
that aborted human fetuses were being cannibalized in China, sold
as health food. Last September, directly before the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the Chinese
government executed nine prisoners to 'send a message' to their
own people that they should not attempt to demonstrate against
the Chinese government.

<p>

&quot;In addition to these 'newer' human rights violations, other
abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN status
continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as 'laogai,' as Harry Wu has demonstrated.  Furthermore,
Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted or sterilized, state-run
orphanages continue to starve female children to death, and Christians
continue to be systematically tortured and imprisoned.

<p>

&quot;The failure of the United States to hold China accountable
for its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Instead, the
U.S. has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care
more about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

&quot;It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's 'most favored nation' trade privileges.&quot;

<center><h2>WHO CARES ABOUT MARRIAGE ...<br>
AND WHY OFFICIAL WASHINGTON<br>
SHOULD CARE</h2>

<p>

<h4>GRASSROOTS LEADERS TO STAND WITH FAMILY RESEARCH<br>
COUNCIL ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The grassroots implications of the
Defense of Marriage Act will be the topic of a <B>Monday, June
24, news conference</B> called by the Family Research Council
and Family Policy Councils from across the nation. The event will
take place in the <B>National Press Club Main Lounge at 9:30
a.m.</B>

<p>

&quot;One of the hottest issues in the public debate today is
same sex marriage. And there is every reason to believe that it
will be hotly debated by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council president. &quot;FRC will
stand with state leaders who have already earned their stripes
on this issue at the local level in defense of marriage.&quot;

<p>

&quot;For anyone wondering whether the defense of home, family
and marriage is a winning issue, the grassroots victories and
support for the Defense of Marriage Act should make it clear.
Every major religion and every successful society has understood
the importance of marriage as the bringing together of the sexes.
And families across America also know just how important this
foundational institution is.&quot;

<p>

Many of the state leaders who will be in attendance have already
won battles in defense of marriage in their legislatures and will
be calling for the federal government to respect the views of
their state citizens. Others are in the middle of legislative
action on state marriage initiatives.

<p>

Family policy councils are state-based organizations that monitor
and advocate at the state level as FRC operates at the federal
level. Leaders from <b>Michigan, Ohio, California, Idaho and Missouri</b>
will be attending. Other state leaders, such as from <b>Pennsylvania,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Dakota,</b> will participate
either by statement or in person. Updated state information on
other participants will be available throughout the week.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT EXTENDS<br>
JUDICIAL TYRANNY TO CITY LEVEL</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Court has quit being a constitutional umpire</br>
and now bats clean-up for homosexual activism,&quot; Knight
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b> In throwing out a lower court's ruling
that upheld Cincinnati's Issue 3 amendment to the city charter,
the U.S. Supreme Court went beyond its ill-reasoned decision last
month in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, said Family Research Council Director
of  Cultural Studies Robert Knight on Monday.

<p>

In <I>Romer</I>,  the court had ruled that Colorado (or any state)
could not pass a law barring homosexuals from receiving special
civil rights protections at the state or local levels.  The law,
Colorado's Amendment Two, was designed to afford statewide protection
of speech, assembly and religion from coercive homosexual activism.

<p>

&quot;In today's Cincinnati case, the court says that voters can't
even amend their own city charters to preclude the enactment of
laws giving homosexuals more rights than other citizens,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;In remanding the case with instructions to
look at <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the court is extending its illogic
to a new level.&quot;  As Justice Scalia said in today's dissent,
&quot;the consequence of holding this provision unconstitutional
would be that nowhere in the country may the people decide, in
democratic fashion, not to accord special protection to homosexuals.&quot;


<p>

&quot;As the sexual revolution keeps grinding, new litigants seeking
rights for pedophilia, polygamy and other sexual 'lifestyles'
will soon surface,&quot; Knight said. &quot;The people of Cincinnati
were right to try to keep 'sexual orientation' from being awarded
special protection.

<p>

&quot;The Supreme Court is stacking the deck against parents,
clergy, the Boy Scouts and businessmen who are being targeted
by coercive 'gay rights' laws.  In so doing, the court has quit
its role as constitutional umpire and is now batting clean-up
for the homosexual rights movement,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Let's
hope and pray that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals won't be
cowed into creating more bad law.&quot;

<center><h2>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR<br>
CASES ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO<br> 
MINORS, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on
the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from
an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing
adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on
the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said
Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat
for American families and children.  No matter where this case
goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme
Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity
to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday
on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography
distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council
presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the
cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,
written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme
Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through
the media.

<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the
Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have
long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material
have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside
cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit
images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.
So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation
should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;

<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver
said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness
to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'
There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn
but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or
the adults.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We
should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate
a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong
laws is a concession that the information superhighway should
belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun
in a playground.&quot;

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MARK UP<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE<br>
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BILLS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The House Judiciary Committee begins
mark up today of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (H.R. 3396)
and the Church Arson Prevention Act (H.R. 3525). 

<p>

Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said that &quot;Congress
and the President should do everything they can to extinguish
the fires that are causing the religious liberty of thousands
Americans to turn to nothing but embers.&quot; On the DOMA bill
Bauer added that &quot;the stability of this country rests on
our faith and our families. Without defending our nation against
the current threat of a redefinition of marriage, the traditional
family unit will never be the same.&quot; 

<p>

Both bills are on the fast track due to current events in Hawaii
and in the southern states.  As the date for the Hawaiian Supreme
Court case on &quot;gay marriage&quot; rapidly approaches, the
full House Judiciary Committee presses forward on DOMA today.
In the next few weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans a
hearing at which Gary Bauer will testify on DOMA.

<p>

As the number of reported church fires in the southeast nears
60 since January 1995, the House Judiciary Committee begins mark
up of the Church Arson Prevention Act.  Co-sponsored by Chairman
Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and ranking Democrat John Conyers (D-MI),
this bill enables Federal authorities to more quickly and efficiently
investigate and prosecute these cases and also protects the freedom
of religious expression.

<center><h2>WILL THERE BE ANY PRO-LIFERS IN THE BIG TENT?

<p>

GARY BAUER COMMENTS:</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The following is a statement from Gary
L. Bauer following up on Senator Dole's comments on CNN <i>Inside
Politics</i> regarding the pro-life plank in the platform:

<p>

&quot;Senator Dole had, this past weekend, navigated some tough
shoals.  Today the ship has been run a ground again. I hope sometime
soon the senator will stop debating fellow Republicans on abortion
and start debating the most pro-abortion President in American
history.  If this keeps up, the so-called big tent won't have
any pro-lifers in it.&quot;

<center><h2>BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T STAND FOR CHILDREN<br>
BUT IT COULD STEP ASIDE FOR PARENTS,<br>
FRC STANDS WITH MOMS AND DADS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;If the tobacco lobby tried to rally
for smokers' rights, most people would mock their efforts</b>,
but when more than a 100 organizations that lobby for and receive
federal grant monies get together to pressure for more welfare
spending, they're treated as though the name of the event equals
reality. But to stand for children, you need to stand for families,
not big government,&quot; said Kristi S. Hamrick, Family Research
Council Director of Communications on Friday.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made her comments on the eve of the liberal Children's
Defense Fund &quot;Stand for Children&quot; rally set for June
1. She and other pro-family leaders stood together with families
who have had struggles in areas of taxes, adoption and education.
The news conference highlighted the many issues and organizations
pointedly unnoticed in the so-called &quot;non-partisan&quot;
event.

<p>

She said: <b>&quot;Big government doesn't best stand for children,
parents do</b>. And in the last 30 years, through excessive taxes,
failed welfare programs and overbearing federal control of education,
<b>parents have been squeezed out of the driver's seat of their
family cars, to be replaced by Big Brother. It's too bad he's
been headed in the wrong direction</b>.

<p>

&quot;During the last 40 years, the tax burden on the American
family has gone from one dollar in 50 to one dollar in four. It's
a reverse Robin Hood situation, taking from the poor to give to
bloated government programs and bureaucrats who act as though
they know what's best for other people's money and children.

<p>

&quot;<b>We need the $500 per child tax credit</b>. We need a
balanced budget. We need adoption tax credits. And we need them
now. We applaud the fact that Congress kept its promises and passed
this long overdue tax relief for families and began to address
the burden of debt that will be left to our children. Unfortunately,
liberal activists -- like the Children's Defense Fund -- prevailed
upon President Bill Clinton to veto this necessary tax relief
and balanced budget legislation.

<p>

<b>&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude
that liberal elites know better</b> than parents. The goals of
federal policy should not be to replace the family or parents,
but to affirm them. In particular, we need to help those children
most in need get into stable families.

<p>

&quot;It is shameful that foster care, 'a temporary' program,
becomes a quasi-parent for more than 600,000 abused and neglected
children. Ten percent wait more than 7 years for the system to
give them legal, loving parents. These languishing children deserve
better. We can help them by freeing them for adoption after a
set period of time, and supporting adoption tax credits.

<p>

<b>&quot;It shouldn't surprise anyone</b> that the groups invited
to attend the rally -- groups like The Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, National Organization
for Women -- support government as surrogate parent. But men and
women nationwide understand that it's parents who best know and
best love their children. And for radical activists to claim that
they are advocates for children is so lacking in credibility,
it doesn't pass the straight face test.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>TO THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND:<br>
THE <i>REAL</i> QUESTION IS WHO BEST STANDS FOR<br>
CHILDREN ... AND THE ANSWER IS PARENTS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;The best advocates of children today
-- and the most unappreciated -- are mothers and fathers, working
together to stand for children,&quot;</b> said Gary L. Bauer,
president of Family Research Council on Wednesday, May 29. &quot;The
best thing we could do as a society to stand for children is affirm
and support parents.&quot;

<p>

<b>Bauer made his comments on the eve of the Stand for Children
Rally</b> scheduled to take place on June 1 in Washington, D.C.
The rally was organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund
known for supporting big government intervention in the family.

<p>

<b>&quot;For Children's Defense Fund</b>, the organizer of the
impressively-named 'Stand for Children' event, the best advocate
a child has is a government official or bureaucrat. But government
is often part of the problem, both by implementing family un-friendly
policies and diminishing the importance of the people who best
love children -- parents,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude of
parents as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  But healthy societies
have understood that parents are almost always those who best
defend children. And only when the home has broken down should
the state intervene to save the child and assist in getting that
child permanently into a loving family.

<p>

<b>&quot;Family is key</b>. Children from broken families should
not be captives of temporary government solutions. It is shameful
that foster care, a 'temporary' program, becomes a quasi-parent
for more than 600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent
wait more than seven years for the system to give them legal,
loving parents.  These languishing children deserve more than
'bought' foster care.  As one system child of 10 years said, 'I'm
all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom and a dad.'

<p>

&quot;Not surprisingly, the groups invited by CDF to attend the
rally were primarily those who believe that government should
be a child's best friend. In fact, despite well-spoken words about
faith in child rearing, an anti-faith attitude has marked CDF's
policies. Children's Defense Fund has been hostile to the role
religious organizations can play as advocates for children and
families in place of government.

<p>

<b>&quot;CDF has taken the attitude that experts know best</b>
--  rarely parents -- and have consistently fought against school
choice for parents and day care vouchers for poor parents who
want their children instructed in a values setting.

<p>

&quot;But most significantly, time and time again, the Children's
Defense Fund has missed the mark on <b>the greatest crisis facing
our children -- family breakdown</b>. For them, every problem
is an economic one, explained not in the loss of values or loving
homes, but in dollars and cents. The last 30 years has shown clearly
the failure of these approaches. Unless we all stand together
for the family, our society will fall.&quot;

<center><h2>BAUER CALLS<br>
AMENDMENT TWO DECISION<br>
'DISASTER FOR SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE'</h2>

<p>

<h4>'THE COURT IS TAKING AWAY AMERICANS'<br>
FREEDOM TO DISAGREE ON HOMOSEXUALITY'</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Today's 6-3 Supreme Court decision
in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a disaster,&quot; said Gary L. Bauer,
President of the Family Research Council.  &quot;The legal details
will be debated, but the ruling's immediate impact is clear enough:
No state in the country may amend its constitution to bar the
granting of special rights for homosexuals.

<p>

&quot;No one -- including the people of Colorado -- is suggesting
that homosexuals should lose any rights; but nobody has the right
to 'win' at the ballot box even when losing.  Homosexual activists
lost at the ballot box, but now they will see their will imposed
on the people of Colorado -- and the rest of the nation -- by an 
out-of-control, unelected judiciary.

<p>

&quot;Now, with state laws being struck down, it is clear that
the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is urgently needed.
Otherwise, marriage itself will be redefined radically by unrestrained
judges. DOMA may just be the antidote to the judicial lunacy.

<p>

&quot;As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a stinging dissent, 'Today's
opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and
barely pretends to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals
in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential
treatment . . . Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment,
but of political will.'

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;On yet another question of profound public
concern, the legislative voice of the American people has been
silenced.  Even the illusion of a level playing field evaporates
before our eyes.

<p>

&quot;Here's how it works:  Homosexuals may win laws providing
themselves with special rights, and Americans who disagree may
not pass any laws to the contrary. No other group has that kind
of power to impose its agenda on the rest of the people.  This
decision, apart from its policy consequences, should send chills
down the back of anyone who cares whether the people of this nation
any longer have the power of self-rule.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED<br>
TO FUND CONDUCT UNBECOMING<br>
TO OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE</h2>

<p>

<h4>MEDIA INVITED TO VIEW VIDEOTAPED ACCOUNT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Everyone -- the media and public
-- is invited to view a 6-minute videotape detailing some of the
events that transpired during the homosexual 'Cherry Jubilee'
parties held in taxpayer-funded government buildings in April,&quot;
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
said Wednesday.  &quot;Rep. Steve Gunderson has said the events
at two parties have been misconstrued in a written eye-witness
account -- but a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The Family Research Council became concerned about a possible
misuse of family tax dollars after reading lewd advertisements
for the events in homosexual publications and other media outlets.
The gay-friendly, Washington, D.C. libertarian newspaper <I>City
Paper</I> described the Cherry Jubilee Main Event Party as a &quot;gay
'circuit' party....Circuit parties are all-night -- and usually
drug-infested -- gay dances.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Video footage taken at the Main Event clearly shows half-naked
men dancing to a disco beat in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium,
a hall that has been used for presidential ceremonies,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;And earlier footage shows the same auditorium hosting
the indescribably vulgar Sado-Masochistic Leather Fetish event
during the 1993 Homosexual March on Washington.  It is inappropriate
in the city of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for vulgar parties
thrown by anyone for any reason to be staged in our taxpayer-funded
facilities built to accomplish the noble goals of democracy. 
Hardworking American families should not be forced to facilitate
conduct unbecoming to our national heritage.  And the Rayburn
House Office Building should not be used for Sunday disco parties.

<p>

&quot;The offensive use of taxpayer-funded buildings set aside
for federal agencies and the business of the House shows that
the issue here is not 'tolerance.'  Unfortunately, that word has
been abused to force Americans to endorse, support and facilitate
offensive behavior.  And when people object to this abuse, they
are assailed as 'bigots' or 'haters.'&quot;

<p>

&quot;Despite Rep. Gunderson's words on the House floor that
nothing inappropriate took place, <b>here are four accounts to
note:</b>

<p><ul>

<li><i>&quot;...the dancing became increasingly lewd and
suggestive.  As the night wore on, the dancers began simulated
sex gyrations.  There was intense groping and stroking of each
other.  Some couples dancing on table tops, mimicked anal sex
through their clothing, while others pantomimed oral sex.....At
about 4 a.m., two men proceeded to engage in illicit sexual behavior
in the main auditorium.....oral intercourse....The restroom stalls
at the Mellon auditorium were constantly being occupied by two
men at a time....evidence of illegal drug use was present.  Audible
snorting could be heard throughout the evening in the bathroom
stalls.&quot;  -- free-lance video journalist Marc Morano in an
eye-witness account published in the Congressional Record.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;Jim Jennings of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a sponsor
of the event, said he didn't witness drug use but added, 'I would
not be surprised, though, that in any group of 20-to-30-year-olds...[that]
there would be some who had done drugs...If it became clear that
[drug use] was a serious element of this event we'd stop it.'
Instead, he said he simply witnessed 'very provocative dancing.'&quot;
-- Paul Bedard, &quot;Gay GOP lawmaker defends 'Jubilee,'&quot;
The Washington Times, May 15, 1996, p. A-1.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;I saw a couple of instances of people in a
corner using drugs...a fair number of people using drugs.&quot;
-- City Paper homosexual reporter John Cloud, as quoted in The
Washington Times.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;The stately place was incredible -- we felt like
we were in a hallowed hall. We spent much of our time out on the
dance floor trying to cop a feel, or back in the sponsors' lounge
trying to cop a feel, or outside in the designated smoking area
trying to cop a feel and a smoke.&quot; -- columnist in the homosexual
Metro Weekly, as quoted in The Washington Times.</i>

</ul><p>

&quot;Pro-family Americans are tired of having their values disparaged
and their tax dollars wasted on undignified personal agendas,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;These charges are serious enough that they
should be investigated by Congress, by the Metro Police and by
the General Services Administration, which is responsible for
events at the Mellon Auditorium.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS &quot;IN<br>
CIVILIZATION'S BEST INTEREST,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC URGES HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT H.R. 3396</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (H.R. 3396)
&quot;is one of the most urgent and essential pieces of legislation
to be considered in this century.  The institution of marriage
must not be taken lightly,&quot; said Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer. &quot;Clearly, those who care deeply about
children, about morality, about the well being of the larger society,
must resist the attempts by a tiny segment of the population to
diminish the foundation on which society stands.&quot;   Bauer
made these comments as the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee
held a hearing on the legislation that would preserve marriage
from being redefined by state courts.

<p>

Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Bob Barr
(R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles
(R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would protect the traditional
definition of marriage as a legal union between one man and one
woman in the U.S. Code, and also protect states from any redefinitions
imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage has been quickly raised
to the federal level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian
courts will soon take the radical step of striking down that state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

&quot;Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;Marriage
is a societal good even without children, as husbands and wives
serve as role models for children in their neighborhoods. Marriage
between one man and one woman gives children the best economic,
emotional, and psychological environment in which to grow up.

<p>

&quot;We must step up our efforts to defend marriage now.  Instead
of submitting to radical demands that would destroy marriage,
we need to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and
the culture.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC LABELS NEEDLE EXCHANGE<br>
PROGRAMS BAD MEDICINE FOR<br>
FIGHTING AIDS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The fight to establish federally-funded
needle exchange programs is being urged as a wedge issue to gain
drug legalization,&quot; Family Research Council's policy analyst
Robert Maginnis said today.  &quot;Linking drug addiction with
the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic under the pro-drug umbrella
called 'harm reduction' may be good political strategy, but it's
an awful idea that is gathering momentum, and it must be countered.
Needle exchange programs are simply bad medicine.&quot; 

<p>

Maginnis spoke today at the National Conference of State Legislatures
on the topic, &quot;Getting to the Point: The Role of Sterile
Syringes in HIV Prevention.&quot;

<p>

Needle exchange programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among injecting drug users to reduce the risk
of transmitting the AIDS virus.  Exchange advocates claim that
the science conclusively supports these programs, however on close
examination the science is seriously flawed.

<p>

&quot;The science downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts,&quot;
Maginnis said.  &quot;Some resort to prostitution to fund their
addiction.  After all, non-needle-using crack addicts have a high
incidence of HIV. Most of the needle studies fail to interview
neighborhood residents to see whether they approve of the effect
of these programs.  They also tend to trivialize the drug problem
and offer no alternative solutions.

<p>

&quot;Needle exchanges promote a breakdown in law and order. They
are poor medicine and poor public health practice. Our goal should
be to eliminate drug abuse, not find a safer way to do it.  The
best way to curb the spread of HIV among injecting drug users
is to get them off drugs.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE IS &quot;CULTURAL<br>
WATERSHED,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
&quot;is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered
in this or any year. This is a cultural watershed,&quot; said
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer. &quot;Will America
move to protect marriage -- the foundation of civilization --
or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage? At
stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well
being of our children.&quot;

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act was announced today in the House and
the Senate, and Family Research Council gave its full support
to the legislation that would protect marriage against current
attempts to redefine it.  Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent
(R-OK) and Bob Barr (R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced
by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would
protect the traditional definition of marriage as a legal union
between one man and one woman in the U.S. Code, and thus protect
states from any redefinitions imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage was raised to the federal
level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian Supreme
Court will soon take the radical step of striking down the state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

Bauer noted that more than 30 states have legislative activities
underway to address this threat and 9 have already enacted such
laws. But because marriage is referenced in the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and in Social Security regulations,
federal law is necessary to ensure that no state would be forced
to submit to a redefinition of marriage should another state's
court system take that step.

<p>

&quot;The heart of family life is marriage,&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social,
economic and spiritual union -- no other relationship provides
society with the benefits that marriage does. As we have drifted
from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social
and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never
before. If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken,
there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault
on marriage. No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit
definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family
to be weakened have not survived.&quot;

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DISQUALIFY<br>
CHINA FROM RECEIVING<br>
&quot;MOST FAVORED NATION&quot; STATUS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council on Tuesday
urged the Clinton Administration to revoke China's &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status because of China's myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu released the following statement prior
to the press conference held by the Coalition to Stop MFN for
China: 

<p>

&quot;China's horrific record on human rights is undisputable.
Its blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life has led
to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers at Tiannanmen
Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers, women
being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide, and
the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of Christians.

<p>

&quot;In the 15 years since the United States has granted China
'most favored nation' trade status, our economic 'open door' policy
has not resulted in even one of these human rights abuses being
halted or abated.  Even if there was, at one point, justification
for extending MFN status to China, arguing that economic trade
might lead to greater influence in the human rights realm, China's
record of continued human rights abuses should completely dispel
that notion.

<p>

&quot;Up to now, the Clinton Administration has only paid lip
service to human rights.  For even while Hillary Clinton was verbally
condemning coercive abortion policies last September in Beijing,
President Clinton was refusing to grant asylum to several Chinese
women who fled their homeland to escape their country's forced
abortion policies.  It is time for President Clinton to put actions
to his words.

<p>

&quot;The oppressive nature of this Chinese government regime
is well-known.  And if the United States does not use the carrot
of its economic markets to encourage China to a humane standard,
then the stick should be the closing of our economic doors.

<p>

&quot;Those obsessed with the idea that there is money to be made
in China seem to forget that the United States is the richest
market in the world and has a lot to offer or withhold. If all
that we communicate to the world is that money making is our only
value, then we cannot be surprised when dictators rise to power,
promising only economic concessions while people die.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BILL<br>
CUTTING GOVERMENT'S ROLE AS<br>
PORNOGRAPHY SALESMAN</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. House of Representative's
National Defense Committee passed by voice vote an amendment today
to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the
sale or rental of pornography anywhere on U.S. military property.

<p>

Robert Maginnis, FRC's director for the Military Readiness Project
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said &quot;This legislation
will aid in strengthening the moral character of our military
personnel, as well as protect the military family. Sexually explicit
material intended to appeal to prurient interests should not be
sold in government stores.&quot;

<p>

But in 1995, the Army Air Force Exchange Service sold more than
$5 million of pornographic materials and today the Pentagon's
bookstore sells <I>Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl, Penthouse Letters,
Penthouse Comics and Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix</I>. 

<p>

According to Colonel Maginnis, &quot;Pornographic material, like
alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.  Beginning with 'soft'  pornography
sold in military stores, the desire for sexually explicit material
grows to require more explicit images in order to reach the previous
level of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.&quot;

<p>

The Military Honor and Decency Act comes in the wake of the rape
of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a U.S. sailor and two Marines,
and the groping of a female sailor by a drunken chief petty officer
on a commercial flight.

<p>

Under current policy, military store managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of obscenity
outlined by the Supreme Court. The high court's criteria were
written to protect freedom of speech and expression but there
are kinds not protected by the Constitution.  These include, among
others, slander, libel, perjury, yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a
crowded theater and child pornography.

<p>

&quot;The government should not be involved in the distribution
of material that conflicts with the principles of honor and decency,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;With the growing number of sexual misconduct
cases in the military, it is time the federal government sever
its involvement in the pornography trade.&quot;

<center><h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS...<br>
ORDINARY PEOPLE DESERVE THE SAME PERKS<br>
AS FEDERAL WORKERS, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer joined with Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday in calling for
increased workplace flexibility and more &quot;comp time&quot;
options. Currently, laws on a 40-hour workweek prohibit flexible
schedules, and rather than merely offer time-and-a-half money
for overtime work, comp time could be expanded to offer time-and-a-half-off
options as well.

<p>

Bauer made the following comments during a 3 p.m. news conference
in S-211 of the U.S. Capitol:

<p>

&quot;Ironically, the federal government has boasted of its success
in providing flexible scheduling for the people who fill its ranks
... but rank and file Americans don't have the same options. Government
should do unto others what it has done for itself -- remove the
restrictions on a work week and allow freedom to enter the kinds
of  start-up businesses that are on the cutting edge of growth
and opportunity. And to allow those businesses which built America
to offer the same options that federal workers receive.

<p>

&quot;Recent focus groups have shown that women in particular
are deeply concerned about the amount of  time they have to spend
together as a family. Children's schedules are not always compatible
with corporate America. We need to get government bureaucrats
out of the scheduling business that takes place between employers
and employees who are juggling jobs and families. A recent study
conducted by the Family and Work Institute found that 66 percent
of employed families with children under 18 indicated that they
didn't have enough time for their children. And an original poll,
conducted for the Family Research Council, showed that 61 percent
of Americans favor more time over more money. We have the ability
to address the Family Time Famine in America.

<p>

&quot;Increasing opportunity is a women's issue, a children's
issue and most particularly, a family issue.

<p>

&quot;And I would also urge the Congress to adopt the $500 per
child tax credit, because it would reduce economic pressures on
families, thereby freeing parents to spend more time with their
children. These are the kinds of changes that men and women desired
when they voted for a change in Washington D.C. And I commend
Sen. Ashcroft's leadership in spearheading this positive change
in today's workplace.&quot;

<center><h4>EDITORS' NOTE: REPORTS INDICATE CLINTON TO RELEASE 
PARTIAL-BIRTH VETO STATEMENT AT 5 P.M.</h4>

<p>

<h2>CLINTON SHOWS SHOCKING DISREGARD FOR THE VALUES OF THE 
<i>MAJORITY</i> OF AMERICANS, AGAIN REWARDS PRO-ABORTION ALLIES</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>&quot;Clinton seems to find no life worth saving</i>,&quot;
says Bauer</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Clinton's veto of  the overwhelmingly
supported Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act shows once again his
absolute loyalty to the most extreme abortion advocates,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said on Wednesday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act -- a measure which passed both houses with wider
margins than almost any bill this session.

<p>

Bauer noted: &quot;Polling out this week shows once again that
the vast majority of Americans -- more than two-thirds -- support
either restrictions on abortion or its elimination. These numbers
tell a story that every man and woman of conscience understands.
People do not want to see life casually ended. And they do not
accept abortion as the highest and best offering of our great
Constitution. They are troubled by a 1.5-million person death
count every year. And the overwhelming success of pro-life candidates
in the last election, both Democratic and Republican, underscores
the troubled electorate's concern for run-away abortion 'rights'
turned into societal wrongs.

<p>

&quot;Bill Clinton has again aligned himself with the most extremist
elements of the abortion lobby -- those who see no value in life
poised on the edge of birth. Bill Clinton said he wants abortion
to be rare, but he seems to see no life worth saving, not even
a fully viable child, whose living brain tissue is vacuumed out,
causing painful death.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who knows that our
nation has more to offer than abortion. And from my travels around
the country, I can say for certain that this veto will mark the
Bill Clinton presidency with a stain that will not be white washed
with any amount of election rhetoric.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
DEFENDS MILITARY LAW<br>
IN <i>RICHENBERG V. PERRY</i></h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> <I>Richenberg v. Perry</I>, a military
case that involves a former air force captain challenging his
discharge for homosexuality, will be heard today in a federal
appeals court in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Family Research Council's
Military Readiness Project, the only national group actively defending
the military's legal ban in court, filed an amicus curiae brief
defending the federal law.  MRP representatives will be attending
the case in St. Louis and will be available for interviews. 

<p>

MRP Director Robert Maginnis, a retired Lieutenant Colonel, explains,
&quot;FRC is in court because the Clinton administration refuses
to defend the law.  Rather, it defends a faulty implementation
of the law labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; which permits
homosexuals to serve.  The American people, the law and military
tradition have spoken clearly on this issue:  homosexuals are
not permitted to serve in the armed forces.&quot;

<p>

MRP counsel Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, wrote
in the brief that Richenberg's case is fatally flawed when it
attacks the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.
&quot;This policy,&quot; she says, is only &quot;a political myth.&quot;
According to Wells-Petry, Richenberg's case argues that &quot;treating
detected and undetected homosexuals differently in terms of eligibility
for military service renders the policy irrational, in that it
furthers no legitimate governmental goal&quot; by sifting homosexuals
into two camps, separated only by detection.  On this, she notes,
&quot;No doubt the policy described by Richenberg might pose the
constitutional questions he attempts to raise.  But no such policy
is at issue in this case.&quot;

<p>

In addition, she holds that the Department of Justice does not
even need to defend the regulations.  Instead, the law passed
by Congress, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654, is what really is at issue
and is quite clear:  all homosexuals are barred from service.
Thus, there is no legal loophole through which homosexuals can
serve in the military.  The Military Readiness Project has long
maintained that the real problem is the Clinton Administration's
persistence in claiming the law permits homosexuals to serve instead
of enforcing the law's true intent, namely, to codify the armed
forces' long and constitutional policy of prohibiting homosexual
service.

<p>

MRP has provided briefs in similar cases concerning homosexual
servicemembers.  In the 4th Circuit case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
it was given the unusual opportunity to make oral arguments before
the full court.

<p>

The <I>Richenberg</I> case is one of eight appellate cases making
their way to the Supreme Court. It's expected that either the
2nd Circuit's <I>Abel</I> case or the <I>Thomasson</I> case will
likely be heard on appeal by the high court in its next session.

<center><h2>BAUER TO EDUCATION SUMMIT:<br>
&quot;Empowering Parents helps Kids&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;When all is said and done, the
highest goal of an education summit should be our children's improved
learning,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
on Tuesday as the Governor's Education summit began. Bauer, undersecretary
of education during the Reagan Administration, urged the attendees
of the summit to focus their attention on initiatives that help
children -- not bureaucrats.

<p>

&quot;We know that these kinds of meetings over the years have
made the participants feel good, but on the whole, they've done
little to improve American education,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But
when it comes to our kids, it's worth the effort to find what
really works. I would urge the attendees to follow these principles:

<p><b>

<li>Empower Parents not bureaucrats.<br>
<li>Reject the anti-American National History Standards<br>
<li>Submit any agreements made at the summit to the American
people.

</b><p>

&quot;I do not believe government-funded or endorsed national
standards will increase local control or lead to better education,&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Summit leaders can score real achievement by
voting to reject the outrageously biased, anti-American history
standards.  Proponents of national standards have had a difficult
time assuring the American people that their standards would be
high enough to make America internationally competitive and at
the same time low enough so that the vast majority of students
could achieve to such levels.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted that a goal since the Reagan Administration was to
dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. &quot;Governors have
a keen interest in education. They therefore should support calls
for abolishing the Department of Education. We need to bring decision
making authority back to local schools and local leaders.&quot;

<p>

&quot;But no matter what is agreed upon,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;I
urge the governors not to sign any agreement that has not been
released for public comment in their states.  I urge CEO's not
to sign any agreement that would increase government interference
with the American economy. American students deserve our best
efforts in their behalf.&quot;

<p>

<i>REPORTERS PLEASE NOTE: FRC Special Assistant to the President
Robert Morrison is attending the summit and will be available
for comment on site.</i>

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG AGAIN ON<br>
TEENS AND AIDS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> A White House report issued today shows
that 25 percent of Americans who are infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education, and HIV testing without parental notice.
<p>
&quot;This is a policy-driven tragedy unfolding, and the Clinton
Administration is offering only more of the same prescription
that got us here in the first place,&quot; said Family Research
Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight.  &quot;To
say that lack of information is causing the problem is outrageous.
The schools inundate children with graphic sex information beginning
in kindergarten, and when record numbers of teens experiment and
contract diseases and unwanted pregnancies, the answer, we are
told, is always more of the same -- more condoms, more 'education,'
more knowledge of deviant sex practices -- and less parental input.
<p>
&quot;Teens themselves have told reporters that information is
not the problem -- it's the presentation of sex as an inevitable
plumbing exercise in a sex-saturated culture, without regard for
marriage.  According to a University of Minnesota study by a homosexual
researcher, young males &quot;often engaged in high-risk sex despite
good knowledge about HIV.&quot;  The teens &quot;correctly recognized
they were more likely than others to be infected, but were not
deterred from dangerous behavior.&quot;  (Dr. Gary Remafedi, survey
of 239 gay and bisexual males aged 13 to 21, 1994).
<p>
Knight adds, &quot;The condom-based approach has failed miserably
for 20 years and ruined countless lives.  Good programs are available
that work, but the Clinton Administration and their allies are
trying to kill them off.  And the same government that wants to
steal children's innocence now wants to test them for HIV without
parents' knowledge.
<p>
&quot;Parents across America are vitally concerned about their
children's well-being, and they -- not the government -- should be
the primary counselor in their child's sexual development,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;Parents must not be cut out of their children's
lives, especially if their child's life is in jeopardy. No one
should face HIV test results alone,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h2>MILITARY CASE <i>PHILIPS V. PERRY</i><br>
TESTS HOMOSEXUAL LAW</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> --  In Seattle today, a Federal Appeals
court will <I>hear Philips v. Perry</I>, a case involving an openly
homosexual sailor who admitted to past misconduct and who intends
to continue that practice.  On October 27, 1995, the Family Research
Council filed a friend of the court brief calling for the dismissal
of the case.
<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.), FRC's director
of the Military Readiness Project (MRP) will attend the Seattle
hearing.  He said, &quot;Machinist Mate Mark Philips confessed
to homosexual misconduct in 1992 but he filed a lawsuit blocking
his discharge.&quot;  FRC first joined this case in early 1995
by filing a court brief at the trial court level.  Philips lost
that challenge.
<p>
&quot;Philips is a homosexual crusader,&quot; said Colonel Maginnis,
&quot;who wants to use the court to air and resolve national policy
on homosexuals in the military and in particular Congress' constitutional
authority to dictate military personnel policy.&quot;
<p>
Machinist Mate Philips claims that his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy board was swayed by his
admission of misconduct.  He also claims there are sexual acts
that are guaranteed within a constitutionally protected zone of
privacy.
<p>
This case is one of five military homosexual cases now pending
at the Federal Appellate Court level and three cases at the Federal
District Court level.  The MRP is involved in all the appellate
cases as an amicus and had the unusual opportunity last December
to make oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> hearing. 
<p>
As the nation's leading organization defending the military's
ban, FRC argues that many of these cases came about because the
Clinton administration purposely did an end run around the law
and wrote implementing regulations labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; which permit homosexuals to serve.  The law prohibits
service by homosexuals.

<title>February 28, 1996 Press Release</title>
<body>
<center><h2>MEMO</h2></center>
<p>
<b>February 28, 1996
<p>
TO:     National News Media<br>
FROM:   Gary L. Bauer, President, Family Research Council<br>
RE:     Statement on Religious Bigotry in Media Coverage</b>
<p>
<b>Religious bigotry, and facile appeals to such bigotry, have no place in the 
American political lexicon.</b> In the past few weeks, some media coverage of 
the 1996 Presidential campaign has betrayed a disturbing insensitivity to the
standards of civil discourse that our nation's founders intended to prevail in
public debate.  Last Friday night's edition of ABC's Nightline is only the latest
example of this insensitivity, an uncharacteristically superficial report by Ted
Koppel that attempted to legitimize the idea that American Catholics in the
1940s and 1950s were given to reflexive prejudice against their fellow Jewish
Americans.
<p>
<B>Americans of all faiths -- and even no faith -- cherish a heritage of religious 
liberty that celebrates the contributions of diverse denominations to our 
national life.</b>  They honor the examples of tolerance and courage that abound
in our history, from Sam Adams' call that the First Continental Congress open
with the prayer of a clergyman not of his own denomination, to the famed
incident of the four chaplains -- a rabbi, a Methodist minister, a
Catholic priest, and a Dutch Reformed minister -- who sacrificed their 
life-jackets to other men and perished in the sinking of the troop ship 
Dorchester in July 1943.
<p>
<b>Prejudice has certainly written dark chapters in every era of American 
history, but ABC breaches its responsibility to the American people when it 
paints a misleading and malignant portrait of American Catholics.</b>  As an
organization representing hundreds of thousands of American families, including
Catholics, the Family Research Council deplores ABC's report.  We urge everyone
engaged in coverage of the 1996 elections to maintain the highest standards
of journalistic ethics and to cover the issues with factuality and fairness. ABC
owes all religious people of goodwill a swift and heartfelt apology.

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG ON PARTIAL BIRTH</h2>
<p>
<h4>PRO-LIFE AMERICANS AND CLINTON KNOW THAT<br>
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER = ALL ABORTIONS</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement following President Clinton's
comments regarding his new position on the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act:
<p>
&quot;After Congressional hearings and extended public debate
and no doubt prayerful consideration, members of both houses of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle, passed a bill which would
ban partial birth abortions.  However, President Clinton has now
announced that, after 'praying' long and hard, he will support
the late-term abortions of babies who are breech-delivered alive
until all but the head remains in the mother's womb, and who die
because the abortionist stabs the back of their heads to suction
out their brains.
<p>
&quot;That President Clinton would veto a ban on a procedure characterized
as 'four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth abortion' shows his
clear disregard for the value of human life.
<p>
&quot;Even worse, Mr. Clinton has tried to cloud his extreme pro-abortion
stance by saying that he, in fact, supports the ban except 'to
save the life of the mother and <I><B>for the mother's health</B></I>.'
<p>
&quot;The Partial Birth Abortion Ban, as passed by both houses
of Congress, already includes a life of the mother exception.
But the health clause that President Clinton seeks to include
is so broadly defined in U.S. law that it would make <b>all</b>
partial-birth abortions acceptable, including the 80 percent of
partial birth abortions that are performed for purely elective
reasons.
<p>
&quot;The 1973 <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> Supreme Court decision defined
'health' as encompassing '<I>all</I> factors -- physical, <I>emotional,
psychological, familial</I>, and the woman's age -- relevant to
the <I>well-being</I> of the patient' (emphasis added).  As a
Yale Law school graduate, President Clinton is completely aware
that adding a health exception to the partial birth abortion ban
would render the bill meaningless.  And his attempts to deceive
the public by talking about prayer and health will not overcome
the overwhelming objections to this heinous form of infanticide.&quot;

<center><h2>SUING SUCCESSES, FLAUNTING FAILURES:<br>
HENRY FOSTER'S RECORD<br>
ON TEEN PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Wednesday in response
to President Clinton's teen pregnancy task force under the leadership
of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood</B> -- Dr. Henry Foster
has had a long-time association with Planned Parenthood and promotes
its goals.  Dr. Foster was a member of the Board of Directors
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) for several
years beginning in 1975.  In 1989, Dr. Foster served on PPFA's
National Leadership Committee in their Campaign to Keep Abortion
Safe and Legal, the main purpose of which was to fight against
parental consent laws, waiting periods, and other moderate restrictions
that states have the right to set.  In 1992, Dr. Foster was one
of PPFA's Public Policy Advocates, promoting PPFA's goals and
programs in the public policy realm.
<p>
&quot;<B>Suing Successes</B> -- Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits
against pregnancy prevention programs that work.  For example,
in Hemet, California, Planned Parenthood sued to remove three
successful abstinence programs -- <I>Teen-Aid, Sex Respect, </I>and<I>
Choosing the Best</I> -- from the school district.  In independent
evaluations, all three abstinence programs proved to reduce the
teen sexual activity level, the teen pregnancy rate, and help
change students' attitudes towards saving sex until marriage.
In Jacksonville, Florida, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit
against <I>Teen-Aid</I> despite the fact that Teen-Aid reduced
the teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent just 3 years after its implementation.
<p>
&quot;<B>Flaunting Failures</B> -- Dr. Foster sought to become
Surgeon General on the platform of combatting teen pregnancy due
to his experience with his own Nashville-based program, &quot;I
Have A Future&quot; (IHAF).  But IHAF's contraceptive-based approach
was a proven failure -- participants in the program actually showed
<I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those outside of the
program, according to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.  These
results are consistent with other contraceptive-based programs
-- all of which show an increase in sexual activity rates, teen
pregnancy rates, and increased exposure to sexually-transmitted
diseases.
<p>
&quot;<B>What's Wrong With This Picture?</B> -- Why has President
Clinton chosen Dr. Foster as his senior advisor on teen pregnancy
when it is clear that Dr. Foster's policies and philosophy have
failed?  And, why has Mike McCurry said that the task force will
pursue contraceptive-based approaches when research clearly shows
that such approaches only put our children at higher risk?  Most
of all, why select a senior advisor on teen pregnancy who associates
himself with suing prevention programs that do indeed work?  President
Clinton, the American people await your answer.&quot;

<center><h2>CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON:<br>
SUPPORT <i>REAL</i> PREVENTION OF<br>
TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Tuesday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
under the leadership of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry
Foster:
<p>
&quot;<b>For the Record --</b> In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton said that he would form an organization which
would 'support grass-roots community efforts all across our country
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Abstinence Programs Work</b> -- If President Clinton
is really serious about decreasing the teenage pregnancy rate,
he needs to look no further than the myriad of successful abstinence
programs around the country.
<p><ul>
<li>For example, <I>Best Friends</I> is a program which connects
teenage girls with mentors and utilizes the benefits of positive
peer pressure to promote abstinence.  A recent evaluation showed
that only 1.1 percent of its participants became pregnant, as
opposed to the 25 percent pregnancy rate for other girls in the
city.
<p>
<li>An evaluation of <I>Sex Respect</I>, an abstinence-based curriculum,
found that students participating in the program had considerably
lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group (5 percent
vs. 9 percent).
<p>
<li>Since Jacksonville, Florida (the fifteenth largest school
district in the nation) implemented the abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> three years ago, the rate of teen pregnancy has
dropped by 35 percent.
<p>
<li>Other successful programs abound such as <I>True Love Waits</I>,
<I>Reasonable Reasons To Wait</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>AANCHOR</I>, among others.  And the one common denominator
in all these programs is that they emphasize abstinence and character
development.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>Contraceptive-Based Approaches Fail</B> -- The data are
clear:  President Clinton should not support contraceptive-based
programs because they have proven to fail, increasing not only
the teen pregnancy rate but also teen sexual activity.
<p><ul>
<li>A study using data from the 1988 National Survey of Adolescent
Males (NSAM) found that adolescent males who had been instructed
in sexual biology and birth control were at a higher risk of early
intercourse than were those who had received no instruction.
<p>
<li>After Balboa High School in San Francisco instituted a condom
availability program, the school's overall teenage pregnancy rate
increased by a fourth in just two years.
<p>
<li>A recent <I>Washington Times</I> article reported that teen
pregnancy rates are higher in states that teach condom use than
in states that eschew sex education or stress abstinence.
<p>
<li>Participants in Dr. Henry Foster's Nashville-based program,
&quot;<I>I Have A Future</I>,&quot; actually showed higher rates
of sexual activity than those outside of the program, according
to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>What Will The Future Record Show?</B> -- The real question
is, will the Clinton/Foster task force support the abstinence
programs which have proven successful in reducing not only teenage
pregnancy, but also teenage sexual activity?  Or, will the task
force continue to support failed contraceptive programs and policies,
such as Dr. Foster's very own &quot;I Have A Future&quot; program?
<p>
&quot;We urge the President to carefully examine the data.  The
Family Research Council hopes that this task force will support
SUCCESS over IDEOLOGY.&quot;

<center><h2>PROMOTING FAILED POLICIES ON<br>
TEEN PREGNANCY:<br>
DR. HENRY FOSTER, TAKE 2</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Monday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
headed by failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Disappointing -- </B>Bill Clinton in his State of the
Union Address sounded a very loud call for sounder values in society.
We were skeptical but hopeful that he intended to follow through
with the ideas expressed in his speech. Unfortunately, this appointment
shows that that is not the case.
<p>
&quot;<B>Replicating Failure -- </B>When President Clinton nominated
Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General, he said that he wanted Foster's
program, 'I Have A Future' replicated throughout the nation. 
But part of  the reason Dr. Foster was rejected as Surgeon General
was because his program, like all contraceptive-based programs,
was a proven failure.  Participants in Dr. Foster's 'I Have A
Future' program actually showed <I>higher</I> rates of sexual
activity than those outside of the program, according to a Carnegie
Corporation evaluation.
<p>
&quot;During Dr. Foster's confirmation hearings, Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS) said that 'the bottom line' was that 'there were
difficulties' (with Foster's program), including a 'dropout rate
[of]...at least 47.6 percent.'
<p>
&quot;<B>What Works?</B> -- Evaluation studies are crystal clear:
the only programs that really work to reduce teen pregnancy are
ABSTINENCE programs.  During his State of the Union address, President
Clinton noted that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped for two
years in a row.  The reason for this decline is <b>not</b> due
to federally-funded &quot;safe sex&quot; programs nor Joycelyn
Elders' conscience-assaulting promotion of condoms. Rather<I><B>,
teen pregnancy is declining because more teens are choosing abstinence</B></I>
despite all of the federal government's efforts to promote the
contrary. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the decrease in teen pregnancy rates
is concurrent with the rising number of teens choosing to abstain
from sex.
<p>
&quot;<B>Lacking Common Sense</B> -- Why has the President appointed
Dr. Henry Foster to head a task force to combat teen pregnancy
when Dr. Foster's own program has a proven track record of failure?
Why has the President ignored all the data about the effectiveness
of abstinence-based programs and instead chosen to promote a failed
policy nationwide?
<p>
&quot;The American people rejected Joycelyn Elders, Kristine Gebbie,
and Dr. Henry Foster because they all promoted the same disastrous
policies.  Each of them was finally ousted because of the outcry
of the American people against their programs.  The President
should know that he cannot escape accountability simply by giving
Dr. Foster a back door by which to enter to do more harm to our
children.&quot;

<center><h2>FORGET DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SPINNING<br>
WHAT IS A PRO-FAMILY PLATFORM?<br>
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO WILL FIGHT FOR IT?<br>
<p>
THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE.<br>
<i>OUR HOPES, OUR DREAMS</i></h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- &quot;At Family Research Council, we
don't endorse candidates. But we want <b>every</b> candidate to
deal with the breakdown of values and the disintegration of the
family that is eroding the America of our hopes and dreams,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of Family Research Council and author
of the soon-to-be released <I><B>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision
for America.</B></I>
<p>
<b>This book is the answer to the most asked questions</b>, &quot;What
do you want for America?&quot; and &quot;What do you want people
to do about it?&quot; Gary Bauer is uniquely qualified to answer
those questions. His almost 30 years in political life include
serving President Ronald Reagan as domestic policy advisor and
serving as undersecretary of education under William Bennett.
<p>
Bauer notes, &quot;Every politician talks about supporting the
family, but when the election results are in and the rhetoric
dies down, different visions are in conflict. And every time,
America's families wonder why the people who sounded so good,
could make such bad policy. My book is a tool for deciphering
exactly what a politician means by 'pro-family policy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Hillary Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child</b>,
but the real 'village' is founded on strong parents, supported
by family, friends, churches, schools and the local community.
Big government isn't a village. And bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C. are not better able to make decisions for children than loving
parents. The village must be an environment in which families
are supported and strengthened.
<p>
&quot;<b>The problem today <i>is</i> the village</b>. Cultural
pollution, crime, violence, liberal government policies, sexually
explicit images, unresponsive educators and anti-faith bigotry
are among the 'village forces' that work against families trying
to teach their children right from wrong and trying to give them
a sense of  the American dream.
<p>
&quot;<b>The dream is not the pursuit of money</b>, but it is
the hope that every person will have the opportunity to succeed
in a world that does not self-destruct, but has enduring values
that protect us and our families.&quot;
<p>
Published by Focus on the Family,<I> Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
is a valuable grassroots tool. You can order a copy by calling
1-800-225-4008. <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> will be available
Feb. 1 at your local Christian bookstore.
<p>
&quot;<b>Dr. James Dobson and I want to get this book to one
million readers in 1996</b>,&quot; Bauer noted, &quot;so that
every American will have a pro-family resource. At the end of
each chapter, Yes-or-No questions make it possible for people
to take the spin out of the rhetoric.
<p>
&quot;But the heart of the book is the 'Compact with Our Fellow
Americans,' a commitment for those who sign it  that we will work
together to heal America and make it the place of  our hopes and
dreams.&quot;

<center><h2>AFTER JUDGE WITHDRAWAL, U.S. APPEALS<br>
COURT SET TO HEAR ABEL CASE</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> After almost a month delay, <I>Abel
et. al, v. U.S.A. et. al</I>, one of the many cases involving homosexuals in 
the military, will be heard today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City.  On Dec. 19, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out.  Today,
a new three judge panel will hear arguments about six service
members' discharges on the basis of admission of homosexuality.
 Family Research Council filed a friend of the court brief, written
by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project,
in the case.  Experts will be available for comment in New York.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent <I>Thomasson</I> hearings in
Richmond, Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the
Clinton Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress
by defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which
clearly excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
&quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is no such thing as a
chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
Because of <I>Abel's</I> delay, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>, another
case on this issue recently heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, may reach the Supreme Court before <I>Abel</I>.
FRC presented oral arguments in <I>Thomasson</I> and may have
the opportunity to argue before the highest court in the land
one of the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>

at the hearing. They also can be reached by contacting the FRC
media office.</h4></center>

<center><h2>FRC APPLAUDS TELECOM BILL<br>
CYBERPORN LANGUAGE,<br>
SAYS LAW PROTECTS MINORS<br>
FROM A &quot;LOADED GUN&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council applauds the
Telecom Conference Committee's decision to include pornography
restrictions in the Telecommunications Bill.   &quot;Leaving pornography
unrestricted in cyberspace is like leaving a loaded gun in a playground.
The new language will help parents protect their children by making
cyberporn inaccessible by children,&quot; Director of Legal Studies
Cathy Cleaver said.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of court-approved &quot;indecency&quot; standard, defined
in the bill as an <B>&quot;image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;</B> 
<p>
<li>Indecent communications <B>restricted from children</B>, available
to adults
<p>
<li>People liable only for <B>knowing violations</B> of the law
<p>
<li>Online service providers not liable for violations beyond
areas they own or control
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws unchanged
<p>
<li>Those taking good faith efforts to restrict pornography from
children have a defense
</ul><p>
Cleaver noted that, contrary to much of the current rhetoric,
the cyberporn provisions will not find Shakespeare or any other
serious work of literature or library art to be indecent. &quot;Adults
with common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently
offensive materials which degrade women, corrupt children, and
ruin men,&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;and the courts will be obliged
to evaluate material in its proper context.&quot;
<p>
FRC's Assistant to the President for Government Relations Marty
Dannenfelser noted that a few other provisions of the bill are
still unresolved and urged the conferees and the Congressional
leadership to make every effort to conclude these matters as soon
as possible.
<p>
&quot;I hope that both the House and the Senate are able to give
final approval to this important legislation by the end of the
year, so that we do not risk losing the opportunity to protect
our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn,&quot; Dannenfelser
said.

<center><h2>NEW DIVORCE RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The national divorce rate is 4.6,
according to a compilation of new data released today by the Family
Research Council.  In 1994, 4.6 of every 1,000 Americans divorced.
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank 1st and 2nd, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation.  Both states
experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between 1992 and
1994 to remain at the top of the list.  Massachusetts fell from
2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to
2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period.  Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to
9.0 in 1994.
<p>
Currently, divorce laws in almost every state give greater legal
rights to spouses who want to end the marriage than to spouses
who want to try to work out their marital problems. According
to FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey, 55 percent of the American
public want to see these laws modified to offer greater protection
to spouses interested in saving the marriage.  &quot;Clearly divorce
reform is an issue that needs to be addressed at the state level,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.

<center><h2>NEW ILLEGITIMACY RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Thirty-one percent of all births in
the U.S. are to unmarried women, according to a compilation of
new data released today by the Family Research Council.
<p>
&quot;Most Americans believe preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancy
is a realistic goal,&quot; said FRC president Gary Bauer.  He
cited findings from FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey showing that
most Americans actually have greater hope for illegitimacy prevention
programs than for workfare programs designed to move single mothers
off welfare.
<p>
In addition, FRC's poll showed that most Americans consider &quot;putting
the child up for adoption&quot; and &quot;marrying the child's
father&quot; to be better responses to an unwed pregnancy than
single motherhood.  A clear majority -- 55 percent -- say abortion
is the &quot;worst&quot; response to an unwed pregnancy, Bauer
said.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a ratio of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.  
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.

<center><h2>ABEL JUDGE PULLS OUT OF CASE<br>
GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, SAYS FRC</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> When Family Research Council staff got to
the New York court on Tuesday where the <I>Abel et al v. William
Perry </I>was being heard, they were prepared to hear arguments
about six service members' discharges on the basis of admission
of homosexuality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in New York City was the next stop for the case which could go
on to the Supreme Court. 
<p>
However, at the last minute, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out. Court
watchers said that the judge pulled out after the Justice Department
reminded him of the letter. Since there were only two judges left
to hear the case, rather than the three needed, the hearing had
to be postponed.
<p>
&quot;This is very good news for pro-family Americans,&quot; FRC
Director of the Military Readiness Project Robert Maginnis said,
directly after the hearing. &quot;The New York court is not expected
to be as favorable to the view of most Americans, the law and
military experience -- the view that homosexuals should not be
allowed to serve in the military because of the problems their
presence cause.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Abel was one of two cases on this issue making its way toward
the Supreme Court. The other, <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>, was heard
recently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
and Family Research Council presented oral arguments. Now, Thomasson
may very well make it to the Supreme Court first, and Family Research
Council could argue before the highest court in the land one of
the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration has not been making the case
that has traditionally fallen to the government -- the case for
a strong military force, free from a sexually charged environment.
It is critical that a fighting force be able to work as a team
without the complications of sexual politics.&quot;

<center><h2>ABEL CASE DOES END-RUN AROUND THE LAW,<br>
SET FOR TUESDAY HEARING IN NEW YORK</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council, a national
leader in the battle opposing homosexuals in the military, filed
this summer a friend of the court brief in the <I>Abel et al v.
William Perry</I> federal case which is scheduled for arguments
on Dec. 19.  Either this case or the 4th Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> case is expected to reach the Supreme Court next
year.  Family Research Council will be at the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit in New York City when the case will be
heard, and experts will be available for comment.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent Thomasson hearings in Richmond,
Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the Clinton
Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress by
defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which clearly
excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel
 &quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is not such thing as
a chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said. 
<p>
&quot;Feeling pulled to do something is not the defining issue.
A person who is tempted to shop lift when a clerk's back is turned
is not a thief. A thief is the person who acts on that temptation
or who enters the store looking for an opportunity to steal,&quot;
Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
After the hearing, a ruling could be expected sometime between
March and May, Maginnis said. The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, 
counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project. 
<p>
<b>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also will be reachable by calling the FRC
media.</b>

<center><h2>CLINTON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USES<br>
SUPREME COURT TO PROMOTE<br>
ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Today, the Family Research Council
filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court case of
<I> U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I> (the Virginia Military
Institute). FRC Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that &quot;in
this case, the Clinton Administration is promoting a radical agenda
that would enact the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
without a vote.&quot;   Oral arguments are set for January 17,
1996.
<p>
Clinton's Justice Department goes well beyond the issue of whether
single-sex public colleges should be legal.  According to the
government's brief, Clinton wants the high court to impose a &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; test which would make all classifications by gender
very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would
be a back door to the Equal Rights Amendment reviving old debates
about Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, homosexual marriage and unisex
bathrooms.
<p>
The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel to FRC's
Military Readiness Project.
<p>
&quot;Ironically, this case would strike its hardest blow on women's
institutions,&quot;  Wells-Petry said. &quot;Single-sex schools
for women number 87, compared to two all-male partially state-supported
schools. Educators working with both sexes have long appreciated
that for some girls and some boys, a single-sex education provides
unique benefits. We can include the First Lady and a quarter of
the female members of Congress among leading Americans who are
single-sex education alumni.&quot;
<p>
The government's Supreme Court brief states, &quot;The long history
of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex
as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing
under representation in government, all support the application
of strict scrutiny here.&quot;   This ignores differences between
men and women which were cited in the VMI hearings and helped
defeat the ERA.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appealed the decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which accepted Virginia's proposal
to offer a military-style alternative at Mary Baldwin College
in Stauton, Virginia.  The government claims that  the 1976 forced
integration of women at the service academies shows that &quot;the
admission of women into a rigorous, military-style educational
program does not impair any governmental interest in producing
military personnel, let alone 'citizen-soldiers.'&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Accepting this 'evidence' will seriously erode female combat
exemptions and may subject women to a future combat draft,&quot;
said Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
<p>
Drew Days, III, Clinton's solicitor general, argues &quot;that
strict scrutiny is, in fact, the correct constitutional standard
for evaluating differences in official treatment based on sex.&quot;
 Strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications challenged
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  It requires
the defendant to prove that any race-based classification is narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government objective.  But the
color of a person's skin and sex are different spheres.
<p>
Looking at legal precedents, Maginnis noted, &quot;A strict scrutiny
finding in this case could eliminate single-sex education, permit
homosexual adoption and marriage, prohibit single-gender sports
and even make single-sex prisons unconstitutional.&quot;

<center><h2>IT'S TIME WE KNEW  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE<br>
CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</h2>
<p>
<h4>Family Research Council calls on Congress to support the Child
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Fresh examination of the full
range of erroneous and fraudulent findings in the Kinsey research
is long overdue,&quot; Family Research Council Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Thursday in a news conference to
unveil the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995.
Knight made his comments in the 11:30 a.m.  news conference at
2222 Rayburn as Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) presented the legislation.
<p>
Mr. Knight made the following statement:
<p>
&quot;Family Research Council commends Rep. Stockman  and the
approximately 40 cosponsors on the introduction of The Child Protection
and Ethics in Education Act of 1995, a bill designed to resolve
unanswered questions about the ethics and scientific integrity
of the sex studies by Alfred C. Kinsey in the 1940s and '50s.
 Despite the flaws identified by early critics of the Kinsey methodology 
and findings, the twin studies Kinsey's team authored,
on male and female sexuality, continue to provide a pseudo-intellectual
foundation for social change that has proven deeply injurious
to children and families.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> by Judith Reisman,
Ph. D., and Edward Eichel, M.A. (Drs. Gordon Muir and John Court,
eds.) revealed a variety of serious problems with the Kinsey research.
 According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of these problems is 'compelling
. . . disturbing . . . and requires investigation.'  A review
of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud in the British medical journal The <I>Lancet</I>
concluded that the book 'demolish[es]' the foundations of the
Kinsey research, which The <I>Lancet</I> editors concluded was
'unethical [and] possibly criminal.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The<I> Lancet's</I> characterization of portions of the
research as 'possibly criminal' is based on the inclusion in the
male study of several tables compiled from information obtained
by 'nine' pedophiles.  Table 34 reports the results of orgasm
produced by adults in infants as young as a few months old.  The
current director of the Kinsey Institute, Dr. John Bancroft, now
says that there was but one pedophile engaged in this infant molestation,
but the Institute has refused to reveal his name, the names of
his child and infant victims, or anything else about the circumstances
under which this data was obtained and published.  These and other
key questions must be resolved now.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The introduction of The Child Protection and Ethics in Education
Act today takes a significant step forward in the effort to learn the full 
truth about the Kinsey research.  Given what we already know, it is unimaginable
that any reputable scientific study, any curriculum, or any public
policy today would be based on this work.  The American people
deserve a full accounting of the role that Kinsey played -- and
is still playing -- in molding the sexual ethics of our nation
and its children.&quot;

<p>
<h3>STOCKMAN BILL TO ADDRESS:</h3>
<p>
<h2>DOES DATA FROM MOLESTED<br>
CHILDREN SHAPE MOST SEX<br>
EDUCATION PROGRAMS?</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council will lend its
full support to the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act
of 1995 to be announced by Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) in a news
conference <B>Thursday, Dec.7 at 11:30 a.m. in 2222 Rayburn</B>.
<p>
The bill's purpose is &quot;to determine if Alfred Kinsey's 'Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male' and/or 'Sexual Behavior in the Human
Female' are the result of any fraud or criminal wrongdoing.&quot;
 If such is found, the Congress will &quot;require an in-depth
study be performed to determine if Kinsey and his fellow researchers
employed systematic sexual abuse of children to obtain the data
tabulated in 'Table 34' and other portions of the study,&quot;
the bill states. 
<p>
The bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO)
to study whether federal agencies and schools have used tax monies
to promote information on sexual behavior based upon &quot;erroneous,
fraudulent&quot; research.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Bob Knight wrote and directed
a 30-minute documentary, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot;
investigating Kinsey's studies.
<p>
Knight said, &quot;After looking at the video, people are compelled
to ask, did the researchers lie about their findings, or were
children actually molested in the name of science?  It's a frightening
story, but it doesn't stop there. This research is central to
current thought on sex education for our children today.&quot;

<center><h2>STOP EFFORTS TO REPLACE MOM &amp; DAD<br>
WITH BIG BROTHER, CLEAVER SAYS</h2>
<p>
<h4>PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995 ON DECK<br>
AT 10 AM HEARING, DIRKSEN 226</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In the growing struggle of parents
versus the government in a war over who decides for America's
children, &quot;the need for federal legislation is becoming increasingly
apparent,&quot; said Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Studies
for Family Research Council, on Tuesday.
<p>
Miss Cleaver spoke on behalf of parents and in support of the
1995 Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946, S. 984).
During the 10 am hearing, Family Research Council applauded the
efforts of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and  Rep. Steve Largent
(R-OK) in sponsoring the act because &quot;this is a good step
toward  restoring the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children.&quot;
<p>
In support of parents, Miss Cleaver related the following:
<p>
&quot;Consider the following: this summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon
Earls of Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year old daughters' room.  After repeated inquiries
of the school superintendent, they found that a school counselor
had driven the girls during school hours to a health clinic where
they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and given condoms
and prescriptions for birth control pills.  Mr. And Mrs. Earls
have not been allowed to see the results of their daughters' tests.
 This type of 'parenting' by agents of the state must stop.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tragically, there are cases of abuse and neglect that the
government agencies must address.  This legislation continues
to allow the government to intervene when it has a compelling
interest to do so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Stable, intact families rearing children with both love
and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed. Let's stop replacing Mom and Dad with Big Brother, and
pass the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL ARGUES TO<br>
UPHOLD 1993 LAW ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h2>
<p>
<h4><i>THOMASSON v. PERRY</i><br>
HEARD IN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council presents oral
arguments today in a landmark case in which the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 4th Circuit will consider the constitutionality of the
Clinton's Administration's homosexual policy as an interpretation
of the 1993 law passed by Congress excluding homosexuals from
military service. FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, former Army
lawyer who has litigated the military's ban on homosexuals for
years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect that
the dismissal from the Navy of Lt-Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.
<p>
Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department will be on
the same side of this case, however their arguments differ greatly.
The Justice Department opposes FRC's arguments, based on the intent
of the law passed by Congress, and submitted a brief attacking
their participation.  The Justice Department rests their case
on, and as their brief states, has a &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.
<p>
Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis says
the recent opposition  indicates that &quot;the Justice Department's
primary motive is to uphold Clinton's promise to the homosexual
community rather than to defend a law in the military's best interests.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot; 
<p>
Maginnis anticipates the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to refer
the case to the Supreme Court.

<h2>FRC TO PRESENT ARGUMENTS IN<br>
LANDMARK CASE, <I>THOMASSON v. PERRY</I></h2>
<p>
<h3>U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT TO HEAR<br>
CASE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h3></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a rare occasion, Family Research
Council will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding homosexuals
from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday, December
5 hearing.  FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney
who litigated the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the
law in the landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> before the
U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
FRC will be in the position of defending the law passed by Congress,
and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department will take
the more liberal position of building their case on the Department
of Defense regulations implemented to enact the law.
<p>
According to Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis,
the confusion between the law and Clinton's &quot;Don't Ask/Don't
Tell&quot; policy is a strategy designed to lead to litigation.
<p>
&quot;Military people support the ban and so do the American people,&quot;
Maginnis said. 
<p>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99% of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine the
cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.

<h3>HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY CASE,<br>
<i>THOMASSON v. PERRY,</i> TO BE HEARD IN U.S.<br>
COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h3>
<p>
<h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
WILL PRESENT ARGUMENTS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding
homosexuals from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday,
December 5 hearing. Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney who litigated
the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the law in the
landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry </I>before the U.S. Court
of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
To the surprise of court watchers, the Appeals Court granted
FRC's request to address them -- despite the objections of the
Department of Justice and attorneys for Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual serving in the military. Ironically, Family Research
Council will be in the position of actually defending the law
-- which would seem to be the province of the Justice Department.
However, the Clinton Administration's Justice Department has taken
the more liberal position of building their case on the regulations
implemented to enact the law.
<P>
According to Family Research Council analyst Robert Maginnis,
from the beginning of the &quot;Don't Ask/Don't Tell&quot; policy,
 the strategy of the Clinton Administration  has been to set up
a confusing situation between the law and the regulations.
<p>
<B>&quot;The confusion was designed to lead to ligitation,&quot;
Maginnis said.</B>
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot;

<p>
<h2>SENATE RESUMES DEBATE ON</br>
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Senate is expected to resume
debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) as early
as Monday, December 4.  Family Research Council supports the partial-birth
abortion ban and will oppose any weakening amendments to the bill.
<p>
The Senate voted November 7 to refer the bill to the Judiciary
committee for a public hearing. On November 17, the Senate Judiciary
Committee held a hearing to educate the Senators about this procedure.
 Senators heard dramatic testimony from a number of witnesses
including the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
Dr. Ellison. Delivering key testimony, Ellison dispelled the claim
of an abortionist who testified last summer before a House subcommittee,
that anesthesia given to the mother as part of the procedure protects
the fetus from pain, and that it causes &quot;brain death&quot;
in the fetus. Others testifying about the procedure were former
abortion nurse Brenda Shafer, Dr. Pamela Smith, Dr. Nancy Romer,
Helen Alvare, Jeannie Wallace French, and Professor Douglas Kmiec.
No amendments were offered to the bill, and it automatically returned
to the Senate &quot;calendar&quot; November 28. 
<p>
As early as Monday, December 4th, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) and Senator Bob Smith (R-NH), the prime sponsor of the
bill, may take up the House-passed bill on the Senate floor. 
<p>
The House has already voted overwhelmingly on November 1 to pass
the bill by more than a 2-1 margin (288-139).  In the Senate,
it is expected that the bill will receive support from a diverse
group of senators with various histories on pro-life votes.  FRC
will be urging Senators to oppose a series of misleading amendments
designed to gut the substance of the legislation.

<center><h2>FEDERALLY-FUNDED &quot;SAFE SEX&quot;<br>
COMMERCIALS SEND WRONG MESSAGE<br>
TO TEENS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement in response to the new
&quot;safe sex&quot; public service announcements released today
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):
<p>
<B>Flawed premise</B> -- &quot;The Family Research Council (FRC)
finds the HHS ads irresponsible in that all the ads -- with the
exception of the abstinence ad -- begin with the flawed premise
that there is nothing wrong or harmful about teenagers having
sex as long as they use a condom.  The truth is, out-of-wedlock
sex is harmful in and of itself, regardless if a condom is used:
 broken hearts, emotional regret, and greatly increased likelihood
to divorce are just some of the consequences of pre-marital sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Doomed for failure</B> -- &quot;These ads are doomed for failure.
 Research clearly shows that condom-based approaches actually
increase the likelihood that teenagers will initiate sex.  The
only approach that has proven to be effective in protecting young
people is abstinence.  The problem with these ads is that, when
they crash and burn, they'll likely take a whole host of young
people with them.&quot;
<p>
<B>Irresponsible use of federal funds</B> -- &quot;When public
opinion polls show that a majority of adults <b>and</b> teenagers
believe that it is best to save sex for marriage, it is irresponsible
for the federal government to be using taxpayer dollars to give
its imprimatur for teens to have sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Undermines parents</B> -- &quot;The ads, clearly aimed at teenagers
and 'Generation X,' undermine what most parents want for their
children.  These ads undercut the message that most parents explicitly
or implicitly relate to their children that sex should be saved
until marriage.&quot;
<p>
<B>FRC's position</B> -- &quot;FRC is, and always has been, committed
to protecting young people from the negative consequences of early
sexual activity (i.e., out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion, AIDS,
and other sexually-transmitted diseases), and to promoting the
positive benefits of saving sex for marriage (i.e., more stable
marriages, greater sexual satisfaction, fewer infertility problems).
 FRC has been a leader in educating young people about the benefits
of abstinence and heartily endorses other efforts which help strengthen
the resolve of young people to wait until marriage to have sex.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC WILL FIGHT FOR MILITARY<br>
LAW IN FEDERAL COURT</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council will defend
the military's homosexual law before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on December 5.   This rare privilege comes after extensive
FRC work in articulating a case about the real impacts of  the
radical homosexual agenda in the military.
<p>
Robert Maginnis, FRC's Military Readiness Project director and
a retired Army lieutenant colonel, announced on Tuesday that the
4th Circuit which sits in Richmond, Virginia, approved FRC's motion
to make oral arguments in the case of Navy Lt. Paul G. Thomasson.
 <b>This is the first challenge to President Clinton's &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy expected to reach the Supreme Court
next year.</b>
<p>
Mr. Thomasson, who worked for the admiral administering &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; told his commander about his sexual orientation
days after the policy went into effect.  After the Navy moved
to discharge him, he challenged the policy in federal court and
lost.  
<p>
Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator and now representing
FRC, will argue that the White House and Pentagon failed to follow
a newly enacted law when writing the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;
policy.  The law, enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, bars homosexuals from serving in the military.  But the
regulations allow homosexuals to serve as long as they keep their
orientation private.
<p>
Mrs. Wells-Petry explains, &quot;They're definitely trying to
do what I call 'the wink' in the regulations as opposed to a clear-cut
rule.  They're trying to put as a matter of policy, 'We're going
to wink at it until it becomes flagrant.'  In our view it's just
not a workable policy.&quot;
<p>
The Military Readiness Project has aggressively filed amicus briefs
in most homosexual military cases because, as Colonel Maginnis
says, &quot;The Clinton Administration is ignoring the law and
trying to erase centuries of prudent policy in favor of allowing
homosexuals to serve in the military.&quot; 
<p>
FRC's team will join a three-sided argument with the Justice Department
defending the regulations, Mr. Thomasson's attorney asking that
the law and the policy be ruled unconstitutional and the Military
Readiness Project defending the law.
<p>
In accepting FRC's motion for oral argument, the Court acknowledges
that there is &quot;extraordinary&quot; justification for a third
party to argue.  The extraordinary situation exists because neither
the government or Thomasson is addressing the right issue.

<center><h4>ANNOUNCING FRC'S NEW T.V. SHOW:</h4>
<p>
<h2><i>&quot;STRAIGHT TALK</i><br>
FROM THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council this month
launched a new one hour television program called, &quot;Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council,&quot; on National Empowerment
Television (NET), a cable Political NewsTalk Network. Every Wednesday
at 8 p.m., the show airs cutting edge news stories, fast-paced
discussions and commentary by President Gary Bauer, Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick, and guest appearances by FRC policy
analysts, members of Congress, and leaders of the pro-family movement.
<p>
The show includes many different segments, such as &quot;Behind
the Headlines,&quot; an insider's look at what is happening to
the family in Washington, and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; a highlight
of what FRC has been doing to bolster the family.
<p>
Each show tackles a single issue from many sides. Topics include:
what original FRC polling shows about Americans, welfare reform,
tainted sex research, and more. 
<p>
An exciting new venture for FRC, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reaches
into more than 11 million homes. &quot;Our dream of providing
a pro-family voice is much bigger than merely building a conservative
'speed bump' in a vast terrain of liberal reporting,&quot; Gary
Bauer said. &quot;Our vision is to help a national audience understand
not only what we believe but why we support the kind of pro-family
reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is to make
a connection with even more of those millions of Americans who
go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world their
children are inheriting.&quot;
<p>
To learn whether your cable company carries NET: Check local listings
or call your cable carrier. If you have a satellite dish, NET
can be reached on Galaxy 7, Transponder 20. <B>Beginning December
1st, NET will change settings to Galaxy 6, Transponder 7.</B>

<center><b>SENATE SENDS PARTIAL-BIRTH TO COMMITTEE:<br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A TIME FOR EDUCATION, SAYS BAUER<br>
<p>
<i>AND: MEDIA ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY HEARING.</i></font></b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Pro-family Americans support
the vote today because it allows more time to better educate the
Senators about this inhumane procedure,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer said Wednesday after the Senators
voted to recommit the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.  A hearing will be scheduled in committee
in the next nineteen days.
<p>
&quot;As we saw in the historic vote in the House, with members
on both side of the abortion issue voting for the ban, our representatives
acknowledged that there are limits to what can be done to the
unborn. A procedure that pulls a child into the birth canal so
that his or her brain tissue can be sucked out is blatantly unacceptable.&quot;
<p>
&quot;This ban will not affect women whose lives are in danger.
The bill is clear. And the additional time will allow the Senate
to fully consider what is being done to some children moments
before birth.&quot;
<p>
<b>MEDIA ADVISORY: FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
will testify 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, SD-342. TOPIC: The Family Privacy Act. The
bill would require the approval of at least one parent before
a minor could respond to surveys or questionnaires from federally
funded programs.</b>

<center><h2>FRC TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF A<br>
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AMENDMENT</h2>
<p>
<b>HEARING AT 10 A.M. IN SENATE DIRKSEN - ROOM 226</b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> At a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy
Cleaver said the following in favor of a religious liberty amendment
to the Constitution:
<p>
&quot;The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the
religious 'neutrality' amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism,
but to promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment
in truth, to which every American is entitled.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>
<p>
<h2>KINSEY SEX STUDIES ARE TOPIC OF<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY BROADCAST</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of this week, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a radio show reaching
over one million listeners with Dr. Dobson and guest Robert Knight,
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies, will discuss,
&quot;What happened to children in the sex studies conducted at
the Kinsey Institute on Indiana University's campus in the 1940's?&quot;
<p>
<I>The Children of Table 34, </I>a video that FRC released this
fall after three years of research and production, prompted the
broadcast. This video investigates the circumstances and people
involved in collecting the data that is revealed in Alfred C.
Kinsey's reports in 1948, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
</I>and in 1953, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>. 
<p>
FRC has repeated attempts to confront the Kinsey Institute with
questions regarding this study.  Recent controversies surrounding
the study include the Institute's claim that the data gathered
for this report originated from one anonymous man. 
<p>
Knight, who wrote and directed FRC's video, said, &quot;Kinsey's
sex studies have been used as the scientific basis to justify
everything from condom distribution in schools to teaching children
how to masturbate. If indeed this influential data was gathered
by one man who molested children ages two months and up, something
must be done by the new Congress to examine this horrific, scientific
experiment and to change the course of sex education as we know
it today.&quot;

<center><h2><i>ROMER V. EVANS</i>: THE IMPACT OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY?</h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- &quot;Today, pro-family Americans saw
a powerful repercussion of the Clinton Presidency,&quot; Family
Research Council attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Tuesday, following
oral arguments in the homosexual related case <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
&quot;Justices Ginsberg and Breyer, Clinton appointees,  led the
charge against the people of Colorado in the Supreme Court hearing
on the contentious Amendment 2 case.&quot;
<P>
Wells-Petry filed a &quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief on behalf
of Family Research Council and attended the oral arguments. Her
involvement follows on the heels of FRC Director of Communications
Robert Knight who testified at the trial court level on behalf
of the people of Colorado's right to make a democratically agreed
upon statement about homosexuality.
<P>
In the brief before the Supreme Court, Wells-Petry argued that
to throw out Amendment 2 and overthrow the people of Colorado's
decision was to cut off democratic options, such as legal referendum,
and make homosexuality the law of the land. 
<P>
The Clinton administration appointees were clearly aggressive
in their questioning of the   people of Colorado, Wells-Petry
noted. She made the following statement:
<P>
&quot;The Clinton appointees used 80% of the air time during the
one-hour hearing.  They sat in super judgment of the people of
 Colorado, apparently undisturbed at the prospect of substituting
their judgment for that of the over 1,524,000 Colorodans who exercised
their constitutional right to vote on this issue.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moreover, these two justices in particular seemed completely
unconcerned about the implications, both for the law and society,
of 'discovering' a new fundamental right that obviously was created
to award homosexuals special rights even though homosexuality
does not fall under established legal analyses of classes requiring
special protection.  In fact, in this very case the lower court
held that homosexuals are not a suspect class.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In short, during oral arguments before the high court, little
was said about the bizarre impact this case could have on the
democratic process.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have seen the future of a Clinton court,&quot; Wells-Petry
said. &quot;This is another wake up call on the implications of
the presidency. How many justices will be nominated by the next
president?  It's time for a national conversation on whether Americans
want the right to vote on the laws of the land, or to allow liberal
judges to overrule democratic decisions.&quot;

<i><font size=6><b>ROMER v. EVANS</font></i><br>
<font size=5>&quot;The Case of the Decade&quot;</font></b>
<p>
<h2>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUPREME COURT<br>
DECISION WOULD RESEMBLE <i>ROE v. WADE</i></h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
for <I>Romer v. Evans </I>on October 10, it could be a historical
moment, as sweeping as <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.   Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry, a former Army major and author of <i>Exclusion: Homosexuals
and The Right To Serve</i>, has submitted a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief, and has noted that this decision mirrors <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> in that &quot;it would present the same risk for public
policy disaster by foreclosing political choice.&quot; 
<p>
When the court in Colorado struck down Amendment 2, it said that
homosexuality cannot be the subject of negative public regulation,
even regulation by omission.  
<p>
In her brief, Wells-Petry said that such a decision from the U.S.
Supreme Court would provide homosexuals with &quot;'easy money'
-- a new constitutional right -- with which to buy a result they
did not earn in the marketplace of ideas. This new right allows
homosexuals to circumvent the process of obtaining a consensus
for their ideas in that marketplace of ideas. It allows homosexuals
to insulate their ideas from that market's ebb and flow.  Indeed,
no matter what ideas homosexuals advance, people never can use
the ballot box affirmatively to reject those ideas.&quot; 
<p>
Wells-Petry warned the court that such a &quot;tremendous change
in the functioning of our democracy&quot; would have as severe
an impact on society as did <I>Roe</I>. &quot;The social, political,
and jurisprudential ramifications of the judicial overreaching
of <I>Roe</I> must not be repeated through the creation of a new
fundamental right in <I>Romer,</I>&quot; Wells-Petry stated.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight testified at
the trial in Colorado and said that a gay rights ordinance violates
the free speech clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
 The implications of this decision would be felt across society.
FRC  Policy Analyst retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis stated
that this decision would even affect the military and its policy.

<P>
America's foremost family advocate, Dr. James Dobson, and former White House domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer team up in this analysis of the "civil war over values" in contemporary culture.  With candor matched by conviction, Dobson and Bauer describe the challenges parents face raising children in today's moral wilderness.  Each author brings to the book his special expertise:  Dobson as psychologist and author, Bauer as public policy expert and longtime observer of the Washington political scene.  They discuss the sexual revolution, declining respect for human life, the campaign to redefine the family, Washington's failure to defend hearth and home, and much more.

The perfect companion book to<I> Children at Risk</I>, this book describes the emerging signs of a pro-family revival, from trends in public opinion to the new attention being paid to the family in public policy.  Bauer not only describes these developments in detail, but he also offers parents concrete suggestions on how to maintain and strengthen the momentum for family values. <I> Our Journey Home </I>contends that the nation's return to the family comes not a moment too soon, as the corrosive effects of the culture of greed and sexual exploitation threaten the nation's survival.

The notion of "charter schools" is alluring (see, e.g., the last <I>Public Interest</I>), the point being to save public education by encouraging school districts to pay for innovative and rigorous new schools that evade excessive bureaucracy. But then theory runs smack into reality. The Board of Education in Washington, D.C., approved an application by A. . "Mama" Anigbo to open an Afrocentric charter school featuring standard English as a "foreign language," no failing grades, students dressed in military camouflage fatigues, and a staff including a convicted armed robber (the security guard) and a principal ("Mama" Anigbo herself) charged with assaulting a court officer and a housing inspector. When Susan Ferrechio, a <I>Washington Times</I> reporter, showed up to a do a story on the school, a mob of eight or nine students and teachers, including "Mama" Anigbo, told her to "get your white a— out of this school," then grabbed, kicked, and pushed her out. Miss Anigbo (250 lbs.) alleges that the Miss Ferrechio (110 lbs.) assaulted her first. When Miss Ferrechio came back with cops and a photographer, a still-larger melee ensued. Well, a charter school can't be better than the people who run it, who probably won't be any better than the school district that hires them. Conservative education-reformers, take note.

	For almost two decades Ralph Nader and his followers badgered car manufacturers to install airbags in every automobile. Eventually the Naderites got their way, and since 1991 all new passenger vehicles have been required by federal law to include these devices at an increased cost to car buyers of about $500 per vehicle. Now it is being publicly admitted that airbags are unsafe for children and small adults. Trouble seems to be that the airbags, which explode out of their housing at 200mph, will give you a powerful whack. For long-armed adults sitting well back in the seat, airbags do a fine job of cushioning the abdomen from the force of a head-on collision. But the same device will hit a child or a small adult in the face, producing head and neck injuries, sometimes fatal.
<P>
	In time, the manufacturers will probably succeed in fine-tuning airbags, but the existing 12 million cars equipped with the first generation will remain as testimony to the dangers of federal mandates. Every safety innovation involves costs and risks, whose consequences are different from different people—individuals should be permitted to do their own evaluating.

	In 1899 a baby girl was born to a poor family in China. Three previous children had died in infancy, and the family hoped for a boy. The midwife expected that the baby would be exposed to die as was customary, but the father allowed the girl to live and gave her an education. Jeanette Li became an educator and had a long and productive life, amply justifying her father's decision. She also had a son. Min Chu Li became a physician and obtained a position at the National Cancer Institute, where he showed that the drug methotrexate caused complete disappearance of choriocarcinoma, a rare but fatal tumor occurring in young women. This was the first demonstration that chemotherapy could cure metastatic cancer, as well as the first demonstration that widely disseminated cancer could be cured by any means.
<P>
	Abortion and infanticide have been discussed from many viewpoints, but often with the tacit assumption that potential or nascent human beings are interchangeable: the fetus aborted today can be fully replaced by a baby born later. One need not be a geneticist, or a theologian, to know that this is not so. Jeanette Li's father, an uneducated peasant, knew it. Overpopulation and unwanted pregnancy are real problems; lofty pronouncements cannot solve them. But it is equally unrealistic to assume that human beings, even potential or nascent ones, are as replaceable, and hence disposable, as automobile parts.

 [Note: The above letter with references was submitted to eight medical and scientific journals, including the <I>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</I>, where Dr. Li worked. All rejected it.]

It is rapidly becoming standard plant-breeding practice to use rDNA to accentuate plants' natural defense mechanisms against fungi, insects, and rodents. The same thing used to be done by watching the mutations of plants in plant-breeding farms and selecting those seedlings that had better protection. Advances in molecular biology now let plant breeders go directly to the plants' genetic material to find natural "pesticides" and implant them in new plant breeds.
<P>
	By relying on natural plant resistance, farmers need less synthetic chemical pesticide and fungicide to ensure that human beings, rather than a horde of little critters, get the crop. This was exactly what environmentalists advocated vociferously a couple of decades ago when it couldn't be done. Now that it is being done, they are against it. They raise the specter of Dr. Strangelove scientists misusing rDNA technology to develop strains of fruits and vegetables with subtle carcinogenic properties. Killer tomatoes.
<P>
Scientists around the world have repeatedly affirmed that rDNA is no more capable of changing the nature of plants than seed-selection techniques practiced since cultivation began millennia ago. But the eco-hysterics got the agricultural bureaucrats in Brussels to draft regulations for special labeling of rDNA use. Now protectionist farmers in Europe are using the lack of U.S. rDNA labeling to exclude U.S. produce.
<P>
And where is President Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency? On the side of eco-hysterics and protectionists, of course. It wants to bring genetic materials under its regulatory authority the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) by arguing that genetic extracts from plant materials are "plant pesticides" under the law and that they should be regulated and labeled in the same manner. FIFRA was enacted before rDNA techniques were developed and had been used to regulate conventional chemical pesticides. The EPA's effort to weigh in on the side of the anti-rDNA forces was signaled by an inconspicuous notice in the Federal Register.

 Mr. Clinton, in a CSPAN interview, took this not unreasonable measure of "right-wing talk radio": "I think that when it goes from criticism to ridicule, and particularly when it is at variance from the facts, which is quite often, it is not serving the country well."

It is a well-done critique, with wise prescriptions—a needed antidote to isolationist undercurrents that would leave the world a more dangerous place.

 <LI>Bill Clinton has charged Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle  with the unenviable assignment of negotiating a settlement with Congressional Republicans on the partial-birth abortion ban. His task: get the GOP to exempt  from the ban women whose "health" might be adversely affected by carrying their children to term.  Call it Mission Impossible. Pro-life Republicans know better than to fumble this issue; the Supreme Court has defined "health" so broadly that it includes emotional well-being and maternal youth. And, as Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Penn.) points out, "this procedure would never be used in an emergency," as it takes three days to perform. But given the Republicans' obvious intransigence, it seems peculiar that the President would be so eager to revisit this losing issue—unless he fears that the 105th Congress will succeed in overriding his ban. This is a valid concern: Senate Republicans fell only nine votes short of overruling the President in the last term, and in the meantime they have picked up two more seats. Moderate Democrats—those uncomfortable having their names associated with infanticide—will be less likely to succumb to White House arm-twisting when their President is a lame duck, and some have re-election campaigns of their own to worry about in 1998. The hitch is that the President will try to turn the issue against the GOP, chastising its refusal to sign on as gridlock and indifference to women's concerns. 
If Republicans shield their ears from this Sirens' song, however, the public will recognize Clinton's desperation strategy  for what is. Then Congress might just get that override Clinton so fears.

 <LI> For twelve days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, as is their right, but set up over 200 blockades—at ports, on freeways, and around major cities and oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gas ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins without washing. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten up by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not "use force" to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $200 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad who were severely hit. The French economy also suffered severely for the second time in a year—from a strike. But this is merely the inevitable tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

Mr. Bhaskar's stem-winder goes on for 58 more words, but you get the drift.

 Last month President Clinton came clean on Bosnia, finally revealing that 8,500 U.S. troops would remain past the original December 20 deadline. The original deployment of 35,000 Americans had "succeeded beyond our expectations," he said, but a follow-on force, more limited in size and mandate, was required for another 18 months to ensure political stability. IFOR (Implementation Force) will be renamed SFOR (Stabilization Force). The problems, needless to say, are many—beginning with Congressional anger at Clinton's denials before the election that any such extension was planned. More  important, the political provisions of the Dayton Accords, which aim at creating a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnian state, are beginning to unravel. U.S. training and equipping of the Bosnians—which the President had promised Congress—has barely begun, leaving them still dependent on foreign troops. The President may get his way, given the difficulty of cutting off funds and overriding a veto, but he compounds all his risks, at home and in Bosnia, unless he keeps his promise this time and gives the Bosnians the wherewithal to defend themselves.
<P>
<LI> A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites against blacks causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced. Dr. Nancy Krieger explained that this was a consequence of "suppressed or internalized response." The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crime—which according to Irving Horowitz in the January 1995 issue of <I>Society</I> in 60 times greater than white-on-black crime—has on the health of whites.

Don't cry for Disney, <I>pace</I> the omnipresent editorial cartoons of a brave Mickey Mouse facing down a Chinese tank à la Tiananmen Square. Michael Eisner's decision to go ahead with Martin Scorsese's biopic about the Dalai Lama, over the objections of China, merely demonstrates that he knows what the real currency of Hollywood is. Disney may lose the opportunity to build an amusement park near Shanghai and the chance to show Disney films to a billion Chinese, but what all that lost money couldn't buy is prestige. For accidental culture reasons, Tibetans have cachet that other victims of Communism—say, Latvians—lack. Had Disney scrapped Scorsese's film, Eisner & Co. would have had to face the wrath of Richard Gere and all the other pseudo-Buddhists in Shangri-la. Getting snubbed at a party is a wound that can't be healed—not by all the tea in China.

 <LI>Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, then tossed him in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what is they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will: "Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments."

 a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. I am for medical marijuana because of my politics. But I'm also for it because I've had to use it.
<P>
As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforward—operation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body wants to get rid of it. That's why chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked— to a point. But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
<P>
I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies. I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer because marijuana gives healthy people an appetite, and prevents people who are nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea, and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
<P>
There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this.
<P>
Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use it to relieve their symptoms. A good summary of all these experiences can be found in <I>Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine</I>, by Lester Grinspoon MD, and James B. Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the book is published by Yale University Press, so this is not something downloaded from the Internet. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana to help himself has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite, who lives in Manhattan, so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty of them go to jail.
<P>
There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana, all of them faulty.
<P>
The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available in a legally prescribable pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive. Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating nausea with a pill was not a bright idea.
<P>
The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically. This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated the pupils. The researchers found that it contracted the pupils; they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball. This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma.
But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome. For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for his experiments—to no avail. So doctors cannot prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed to do any tests. This is a classic Catch-22.
<P>
The third objection is that by legalizing marijuana in one area, we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs. In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher.
<P>
The connection between the issue of medical marijuana and the war on drugs runs the other way. The reason we don't allow medical use is because of the spill-over of an extreme war-time psychology. <I>National Review</I> has taken a stand on the war on drugs, but it is not relevant here. If you think the war is wrong, then the ban on medical marijuana is simply one symptom among many of its excess and folly. If you think the war is right, then the ban is an irrelevant and over-zealous off-shoot, like fighting the Kaiser in World War I by changing the German names of Midwestern streets.
<P>
I want to end by addressing my fellow Republicans. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles, but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick. I am for traditional virtues—I support the Christian Coalition, and I supported the Moral Majority. But carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to help themselves.
<P>
My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone in this room should ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that moment comes to you, you will turn to marijuana. Extend that liberty to your fellow citizens.

After crawling -- not surfing -- along for about an hour and a half in search of some specific item of information, I had come just within reach of what I wanted when a stupid little screen display popped up and declared that Netscape, suffering from sensory overload, had had the cybernetic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It was then that I punched my laptop.
<P>
In <I>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</I>, Sherry Turkle presents us with a somewhat romanticized vision of the evolving interaction between computers and people. She notes that she has named her computer Miss Beautiful -- a sobriquet for her daughter -- and she tells of one of her students who named a computer program that organized her daily schedule after an  ex-boyfriend (``I love to see him do my menial tasks''). To me such personification is totally alien, even if I confess to feeling a little sorry for having acted aggressively against a machine that had served me irreproachably for the past year. Though I refuse to personify my computer, however, I do spatialize it. That is, as I peer into the blue, lacustrine depths of the Windows program, with its delightful frieze of parti-colored icons along the top, I feel as if I were floating in a post-modern swimming pool somewhere on Ischia or Capri. In other words, I feel at home in my computer and I am comfortable and happy there.
<P>
Still, that does not qualify me as a ``computer person,'' and I even take a little pride in not being one. This was one reason I had delayed for some time before subscribing to an Internet service. Another reason was that I failed to see what consequence this technology could possibly have for my life, why I really needed it. What finally convinced me to subscribe was the prospect of sending and receiving e-mail, not to mention a commercial in which Barry Farber seemed to suggest, if I understood him correctly, that I would essentially be able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from the intimacy of my bedroom.
<P>
I was soon undeceived. The first thing one notices about the Internet is that it has been vastly overrated. Though you will have heard of the Information Super-Highway, what awaits you is rather a high-tech single-lane dirt road where an excess of traffic has brought transportation almost to a standstill. Though you will also have heard about ``surfing'' the Internet, the gliding swiftness implied by that word will mean little to those who seem rather to limp or stumble than to surf. And to the extent that the surfing analogy has any validity, it is only in the sense that any moment a big wave -- as in more data than your fragile modem can handle -- will overwhelm the whole contraption.
<P>
The second thing one notices is that the Internet is the subtlest thief of time. By making you wait for each parcel of data you want, it steals a minute here and four minutes there until, before you know it, two hours of your life are gone beyond recall. And during this period of waiting, because these deposits of time are so tiny, you are unable to engage in any other activity. Add to this the fact that, once you arrive at the site, you are apt to find a poorly written document whose loopy, time-consuming graphics are as appealing as public-access cable television in all its ranting, unedited profusion. There are many polished web sites, but most of these turn out to be little more than advertisements for providers of commercial goods and services, or they are documents provided by non-profit organizations. The idea that one can surf through the shelves of the public library may one day become a reality, but we are very far from that now.
<P>
The Internet works in two ways. By typing in a web address, you can go directly to a specific site that has information that you know you want. But to surf the Internet is different. This suggests going along for the ride and not quite knowing where you are going. You do this by typing in the name of the subject or person you want to research. A moment later, the search mechanism, in my case Netscape, applies its various inscrutable criteria to come up with the nearest matches to what you seek. Naturally I began by typing in my name to see how many people on the Internet had mentioned -- dare I hope it -- my articles or my book. Here I ran into one of the most common problems with the Internet. The searcher cannot give you the object itself, but only matches of greater or lesser probability and a synopsis of each site. Thus when I entered the name James Gardner, it told me that it had found 86,754 Jameses and 23,456 Gardners and then proceeded to give examples in which the two words occurred in the requisite proximity. Unfortunately my name is not an uncommon one, and so I had to get through several entomologists and chiropractors, two naval engineers and a masseur before finding any reference to myself.
<P>
For some time I continued in this way to putter around on the information dirt road, accomplishing little and gradually coming to understand that the Internet, for all that people have said about it, is a more or less total waste of time and a not inconsiderable waste of money.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> it was at precisely that moment that something happened which caused me suddenly to appreciate what everyone has been talking about for the last two or three years. What I understood was that the Internet can be viewed as a massive encyclopedia. But whereas all earlier encyclopedias, simply by virtue of their existing as physical objects, were in a sense dead and out of date as a precondition of their very existence, the Internet by contrast is the Encyclopedia of NOW. As it happens I am finishing up a book on fringe groups, a subject which the Internet is uniquely qualified to tackle. I found at my fingertips abundant information about flat-earthers, Andrea Dworkin, snuff films, Queer Nation, the John Birch Society, creationism, and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Another thing the Internet teaches you is that, no matter how obscure your interests, there are other people out there in cyberspace who are as passionate about them as you are. Though I know very few people whose interest in Latin is as energetic as my own, I soon found that I could correspond in that language with a group of college men in the Netherlands as well as an old professor in Finland and someone else in South Africa. What I find important and emblematic about this fact is that the futuristic Internet can be an agent by which the past is preserved and reinvigorated.
<P>
When I understood that, I confess that I had something of a conversion regarding not only the Internet, but also the great information revolution which is said to be getting under way. As of this moment mankind is entranced by the possibilities of computing. The almost obsessive insistence with which people seem to talk of nothing else, with which the Internet haunts our business pages, publishers' catalogues, and the graphics of advertisers and television producers, suggests that something almost incalculably big is afoot. To some degree this fascination resembles the interest in the atom 50 years ago and in space exploration 25 years ago. But neither of these technologies ever really promised, and surely neither ever produced, a direct and material effect upon our daily lives. With the Internet, by contrast, there is a nervous, giddy sense that, at long last, we are approaching some kind of critical mass. There is a buzz running so loud through all the breadth of human society, an electric excitement so jolting and so unexpected, that one could be excused for thinking that we are on the verge of some great new age. And though books, if we believe the prophets of doom, are soon to vanish from the earth, there is nothing publishers seem to find more attractive or salable than volumes that promote and explain this instrument of their allegedly imminent demise.
<P>
The <I>People</I> magazine approach to the information revolution can be found in <I>Road Warriors</I>, by Daniel Burstein and David Kline. For these two investigative journalists, despite a useful introduction that reveals their deep understanding of what is at stake, the information revolution is essentially a re-enactment of earlier heroic ages of capitalist free-enterprise. But instead of the Fisks and the Goulds, we have shakers and movers ranging from John Malone and Ray Smith to Viacom, Sprint, and the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the authors are too hard-headed and rationalistic to be taken in by the euphoria of the revolution at hand, or to allow that enthusiasm to affect the tenor of their reportage.
<P>
Far different is <I>The Road Ahead</I>, by Bill Gates, the prophet, if not the Messiah, of the information movement. His book can be read, if one is cynically inclined, as an extended sales pitch for Bill Gates. But Mr. Gates, despite his open and irrepressible enthusiasm for computing, has written a surprisingly candid and useful book. For Gates, the future of computing is the future of mankind, with technology becoming ever cheaper, more powerful, and more pervasive. As he expresses it in his chirping way:
<P>
<blockquote>
I've already said I'm an optimist, and I'm optimistic about the impact of the new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information. It will help relieve pressures on urban areas by enabling individuals to work from home or remote-site offices. It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits rather than of manufactured goods.</blockquote>
<P>
What makes <I>The Road Ahead</I> so surprisingly useful is that it seems to be a fair, even-handed, and sober appraisal of the situation and very clearly explains complicated ideas to laymen like myself. The author simply lays out one concept after another -- the Internet, the information super-highway, high-definition television, and fiber optics -- with the result that those of us who are not techies finally understand all the terms that have been buzzing around in our heads for the past five years.
<P>
Naturally the information revolution is not without its dissenters. Few are as dourly pessimistic as Mark Slouka in <I>War of the Worlds</I>. This book seems to me to overreach somewhat by buying into the whole virtual-reality racket -- which I predict will remain decidedly ancillary to the information revolution  -- and by supposing that this and other developments will spell the end of reality as we know it. As for the Internet itself, it ``combines the worst of television -- its addictiveness, its passivity -- with the worst of on-line communication -- its self-conscious glorification of superfice [<I>sic</I>], its pop-culture chattiness, its pointless immediacy.''
<P>
Mark Dery's <I>Escape Velocity</I> in one sense goes even further. Dery seems at once to mock and to believe recent ``post-human'' speculations that advocate or predict a literal, physical merging of man and machine into a digitized, dehumanized whole. His book is a highly detailed discussion of cyberculture: that is, those new forms of art, literature, music, and attitude that have arisen at the corners of the information revolution. In his pages we encounter all the technopagans, virtual anarchists, cyber-novelists, performance artists, and cult film-makers for whom the information revolution is a virtual Bohemia joined in cyberspace to an equally virtual, if dystopian, Wild West.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> fixation on the future that all these books exhibit to a remarkable degree has been a fixture of Western discourse for the last two hundred years: starting with Restif de la Bretonne, and extending through Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and William Gibson. The problem with books that seek, as these do, to discuss the future is that the future really is an undiscovered country from which imaginary travelers come back bearing more outlandish tales than Sir John Mandeville with his one-eyed anthropophagi. And because anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, there seems to be an overwhelming impulse to exaggerate in the most shameless fashion imaginable, since it is the <I>deformation professionnelle</I> of all writers to want at all costs to have something to say.
<P>
And yet futurologists, even when they are more circumspect in their predictions, always make the same fundamental mistake, whether they view the future as a light-filled, pyramid-powered Eden or as a cybernetic Hell. Indeed, it is precisely the same mistake that many historians make when writing about the remoter past. And this mistake, it seems to me, is to suppose that to change the material circumstances of life is to alter fundamentally the sense of life itself. But life as it is lived is always pretty much the same, with the same protocols of boredom and excitement, the same glare of midday and gloom of eventide, the same petty ambitions, existential doubts, and immortal longings. We can certainly create the circumstances of greater freedom or greater oppression, but the range of possible variation in life itself, in the simple, irreducible sense of being alive, is far narrower than our chattering classes usually appreciate.
<P>
At the same time, it would be foolhardy and unfair to reason from this that change never happens. We have undergone great changes in this century; and though the Internet is still in its earliest infancy, it promises to grow up quickly. From a purely technological perspective, many users of the Internet already have far more efficient modems than I have. And through Moore's Law, which states that every 18 months computers double in power as their prices drop by half, we can expect that we all shall soon be getting better Internet service for less money, which means that fewer users will feel the need to punch their laptops.
<P>
Earlier in my life, as a callow adolescent, I was so disenchanted with the paltriness of industrial civilization -- this was in the late Seventies -- that I almost felt, foolish as it sounds, that I'd like to repeal the modern age entirely. As each day passes, however, I find myself strengthened in the hope that, with the arrival at long last of the information revolution, human society will become more enlightened, more various, more efficient, cleaner, less expensive, freer, and more fun than it has ever been before. One feels privileged to be alive and conscious at this moment in history and can hardly wait to see what humankind will come up with next.

<H2>Mr. Dole's Fate.</H2>
</center> 
<P>
<center>By John O'Sullivan</center>
<P>
<center><I>Mr. O'Sullivan is the editor of</I> National Review.</center>
<P>
<center>
<B><I>This article originally appeared in the London</I> New Statesman, <I>August 9, 1996</I></B></center> 
<P>
If one had to predict the eventual verdict on the Republicans gathering in Convention at San Diego next week, it would be suicide by timidity. The GOP—a conservative party in a conservative country at a conservative historical moment—is facing a major defeat in November at the hands of the most distrusted President since Richard Nixon. It has reached these straits not by embracing a Pat Buchanan or a radical right agenda but by allowing the party establishment to impose a decent but ideologically flavorless moderate, apparently out-of-touch with both party and country, as its standard-bearer. And it proposes to celebrate this event, fittingly enough, by staging a Convention from which all debate, controversy and indeed politics will have been ruthlessly expunged to make room for short pep-talks, video cartoons, advertising films, and cameo appearances by political celebrities (who are, by definition, not very celebrated).
<P>
The manufactured enthusiasm in the hall, however, will be balanced by the sincere defeatism outside it. Even Republican politicians and pundits sympathetic to the GOP believe that Dole is as good as defeated already. The only question to be decided is whether he will take the Republicans in House and Senate down with him. Some even speculate that the Republican party itself is heading for a post-election crack-up in which economic conservatives ("moderates" in NewClassSpeak) will finally split from the Religious Right. After which, in the approved media version, Buchananite "America Firsters," Perotistas, supply-siders, right-to-lifers, and all the other inmates of the Right Zoo will battle endlessly to succeed the GOP , allowing liberal Democrats to regain their rightful place as the government of the country. Liberaldom, in ruins only last year, will have been restored.
<P>
If this vision seems at all plausible, it is a sour tribute to the extent of the GOP's collapse since 1994. The problem is generally assumed to be Dole the campaigner. Michael Kelly of the New Yorker brilliantly pinned him down as a "nega-candidate" who campaigns in an almost post-modern style, reciting his texts as instructed by consultants but then subverting their message with ironic ad-libs. Of his own campaign slogan, he remarked vaguely (and inaccurately) in one interview: "A Better Plan, a man for a better America—whatever that slogan is they're working on." But Mr. Kelly points out what others have missed: there is something attractive about this unwillingness to play by the rules of a stage-managed media game. Such an assertion of integrity, subtle but unmistakable, against the cynical tactics of modern campaigning (which Clinton has embraced in the person of super-consultant Dick Morris), might even be the only way Mr. Dole could win in November.
<P>
What is killing him is his carefully-thought-out and well-executed political strategy. He has been following Richard Nixon's advice that the way to win the White House is by veering rightwards in the primaries and centerwards in the general election. This left–right analysis was always better-suited to Europe than America, but it made some sense when Big Labor confronted Big Capital across a fledgling middle class, when most Americans lived either in cities or in rural areas, when lunch-pail issues dominated both people's lives and political debate, and when there were no culture wars or fears of Balkanization because almost everyone agreed on the virtues and opportunities that together constitute the American dream. It has been rendered virtually useless by the growth of suburban America (now home to half the electorate), the rise of the Sunbelt (51 per cent of the electoral college vote), the continuing decline of labor unions (representing only 15 per cent of the workforce), the growing importance of small business, entrepreneurship and highly skilled labor (over 60 per cent of the workforce is now classified as professional or white-collar), the emergence of single-issue politics from feminism to abortion (which has helped drive blue-collar Democrats into the GOP), the demographic transformation of America by immigration from a bi-racial nation to a multi-ethnic one (in which non-Hispanic whites are projected to be a minority by 2051), and the social fragmentation and cultural anxieties these trends have fostered. 
<P>
Where once two great political blocs fought over the small strip of middle ground separating them, today political parties have to assemble a majority anew in each election from among a scattering of regional, ethnic and social groups. Psephologist Patrick Reddy has identified seven such "tribes": Blacks, new minorities (Asians and Hispanics), white liberals, working-class or populist whites, Northern rural voters, suburbanites, and conservatives. The first three groups are in the Democrats' pocket; the last three lean to the GOP; and working-class whites in recent years have been moving sharply to the Right. But all of these groups need to be won over, or at least energized, by the powerful political appeals every four years. 
<P>
So far Bill Clinton has been wooing them far more effectively than the GOP. He shored up his Democratic base among minorities and liberals by portraying Republican cuts in projected Medicare spending (which he was also proposing, though to a lesser extent) as root-and-branch attacks on social entitlements. He simultaneously made inroads into the suburbanite vote by accepting a balanced budget—wittily balanced by spending cuts that would come into effect after the end of his second term. And he appealed to both suburbanites and populist whites by rhetorical and symbolic conservatism such as his call for school uniforms and teenage curfews. Shameless though they are, such tactics would certainly have blunted a GOP attack—if one had been launched.
<P>
But Bob Dole, in addition to diving towards a mythical center, has been almost entirely reactive, concentrating on issues like abortion or problems like the "gender gap" where his party is divided or the Republicans are less trusted . To grasp the effect, imagine that John Major had spent 1992 talking about the NHS and never mentioning taxes. 
<P>
In fact, as Clinton's tactics reveal, new demographics mean new issues. Most Americans (about four and a half of Mr. Reddy's seven tribes) are prosperous and believe that government is too big and too intrusive. They don't want to see middle-class entitlements eradicated, but they look at the budget and sense that they will have to be at least pruned. And anyway, with the combination of federal, state and local taxes at 31.5 per cent of GDP—low by international standards but a peacetime high in the U.S.—they feel the tax bite of government more. Here, at least, the Republicans have crafted a positive appeal to their constituencies. Dole's promise of a tax cut earlier this week serves as a proxy for all of these issues. The voters may not believe that as President he would actually cut taxes by $600 billion, but they will take his pledge as a sign that he will not raise them, that he may even cut them by some amount, and that therefore he will be forced to rein government back. 
<P>
The pressing political reality of 1996, however, is that for all the talk about "downsizing" and "economic anxiety", it is the issues of moral decline, social disorder and ethnic separatism that people are really worried about. As Michael Barone pointed out in <I>The American Enterprise</I>: "Violent crime is a greater threat to most Americans than short-term unemployment. Divorce is a far greater threat than job loss to the typical person's lifetime project of accumulating wealth . . ." Immigration, racial quotas, and multiculturalism arouse similar fears, and they have the added annoyance that, unlike crime, they are the deliberate effects of government policy. But the language in which people would once have expressed such anxieties has been discredited as "racist" or "nativist" and so they complain about them in the code of "economic anxiety."
<P>
Clinton, who allegedly blames his 1980 gubernatorial defeat on voter anger at the Mariel boatlift of Cuban immigrants, has been quick to sense the importance of these issues. His symbolic conservative gestures, the administration's theatrical "crackdown" on illegal border crossing, and the crime bill, itself largely symbolic, have defused some of them. But his signing of the welfare reform bill was as far as he could go in this direction without enraging his political base among liberals, blacks, and new minorities. Dole's obvious tactic therefore is emphasize those issues where the President simply cannot endorse conservative policies. A random sample might include: restricting the powers of the federal judiciary; extending school choice, via vouchers, to parochial schools; ending race and gender preferences; seriously enforcing laws against illegal immigration but also reducing legal immigration; supporting English as the official language and, more generally, opposing the wen of multiculturalism; and in general defending the concept of an inclusive "American" identity against the second coming of hyphenation. 
<P>
Most of these issues fall into neither of the two approved conservative categories: the "social conservatism" of the religious right and the libertarianism of the economic right. But what might best be called "cultural conservatism" gets support varying from 65 to 80 per cent in opinion polls. It arouses all three of the GOP tribes, plus the swing vote of populist whites, <I>and</I> Black Americans who face competition in the labor market from low-paid immigrants. In particular, it appeals to natural Republicans disaffected from the post-Reagan GOP—secularized Protestants, Northern WASPs, environmentalists, the Planned Parenthood crowd, and above all supporters of the Reform Party. A good example is Ross Perot's challenger, former Governor Dick Lamm, who is the author of tract entitled "The Immigration Time Bomb."
<P>
The GOP has dabbled in these waters with extreme nervousness. What restrains it is mainly that its post-civil-rights leadership is afraid of being seen as "racist" or "nativist" and "on the wrong side of history." This nervousness is rational. <I>The New York Times</I>, which noted in a single detached comment on a Democratic political ad that it was "unusual" for Democrats to use "inflammatory negative images of illegal immigrants," would still be shrieking "Willie Horton" if the GOP had done anything similar. There is also an ideological element in Republican reluctance. Leading Republicans like Jack Kemp and House Leader Dick Armey are uncomfortable with non-economic "hot button" issues like quotas, and intellectually committed to the view that immigration is an unqualified economic benefit. But they are resisting the majority of their party here. And it is a fair bet that, in any post-election struggle but especially one after a Dole defeat, the Republicans will move to add cultural conservatism to the religious and economic varieties. The signs are already there in Republican fund-raising letters which highlight quotas and immigration. 
<P>
But that will be too late for Mr. Dole. If he remains committed to a campaign of blandness and Nixon's advice, he will repeat his recent experience with two issues which have eighty per cent popular backing in virtually every poll but until recently a low political salience: increasing the minimum wage and making English the official language. Dole doubtless believed, following the conventional media wisdom, that the first is centrist, and the second "right," even "extreme." At any rate, hardly anything has been heard from him on official English since the primaries (indeed, he has been visibly edging away from the similar issue of racial and gender quotas). But he did not take long to move to the center to endorse a higher minimum wage once the Democrats had raised the issue. The net effect was to deny himself a popular issue with a powerful appeal both to his natural constituencies and to working-class whites, while helping to concentrate people's attention on the minimum wage where the Democrats enjoy a natural advantage with the public.
<P>
And this on the say-so of the late Richard Nixon. It is hard to believe that the Nixon of 1968, who crafted the new Republican majority with the southern strategy and appeals to law 'n' order, would have followed his own advice so blindly. 
<P>

<title>Daily Commentary - December 3, 1996</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
December 3, 1996</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

While you and I were enjoying our Thanksgiving turkey, a
judge in California was busy putting Proposition 209 on the chopping
block.  Through Prop. 209, California voters dismantled the state's
system of racial preferences in hiring and college admissions.
The judge issued what's called a &quot;temporary restraining
order,&quot; keeping the racial spoils system in place for now.
He claimed that Prop. 209 probably violates the 14th amendment's
guarantee of equal protection.  But that's exactly what Prop.
209 <i>does</i> guarantee:  equal protection for all citizens
regardless of race or gender.

<p>

Now whatever you think of affirmative action itself, this
case is yet another example of judicial tyranny.  In Colorado,
it was a ban on special rights for homosexuals.  In Washington
state, a law against assisted suicide.  In each case, the courts
overturned the will of the people on a hotly contested issue.
The real question we must ask is:  how can self-government survive
as our courts shrink our liberty?  To answer that question is
to determine the fate of our republic.

<p>

After months of delay, Hollywood's television executives
have come up with a plan to protect your children from sex and
violence on the tube.  But don't celebrate yet..  Because, unfortunately,
the only thing it will protect is the big-time producers' ratings.

<p>

In essence, what Hollywood proposes is something like the
current movie rating system.  Each television show would carry
a simple code pegged to the age of the viewer that Hollywood considers
appropriate for each program.  Well!  I'm not impressed.  I just
don't trust Hollywood's opinion of its own product.  Most parents
want to know what a program actually contains.  Does it include
profanity?  Violence or nudity?  Homosexual characters and themes?
Parents want this information before they sit down to watch,
or let their children watch, a program.

<p>

Last spring, President Clinton met with television executives
to encourage them to come up with a system to safeguard families.
After so many months, Hollywood has responded with a dud.  This
is one premiere that deserves a swift cancellation.

<p>

The year's not over yet, but here's my award for most cynical:
Those liberals in Congress and out who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act.  &quot;It's years away,&quot; they said of homosexual
marriage. &quot;Nobody's legalizing this,&quot; they said.  Conservatives
are &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; they charged.

<p>

Guess what. Hawaii's Supreme Court has just ruled that gay marriage
is legal in the Aloha State.  Pro-gay Bill Clinton has been safely
re-elected.  And the same people who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act have forgotten everything they said just a few months
ago.  Then, Clinton's spokeswoman said he &quot;scorned&quot;
the Defense of Marriage bill -- even as he signed it. And the
press sure scorned it.

<p>

But events in Hawaii prove how timely, how important, how <I>needed</I> 
the Defense of Marriage Act was.  This fight is not over.
We will not give in.  The overwhelming majority of people in
America -- and in Hawaii itself -- <I>oppose</I> homosexual marriage.
The more people find out about it, the more strongly they want
to defend true marriage. Remember, what the radical homosexuals
really want is not marriage for them, but the <I>end</I> of marriage
for everyone.

<p>

The December chill has set in around the city of Washington.
With Congress out of town and President Clinton embarking on
a second term, the news hereabouts would typically be dominated
by the White House.  But it's been strangely silent at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave.  Maybe it's the President's bad case of laryngitis although
most people who know Bill Clinton say not even that can keep him
from talking.

<p>

Just think: a month ago, as the Presidential campaign was
in high gear, the White House was reportedly simmering with ideas.
There were new proposals every day to counter education decline
and domestic abuse.  With all of that energy and excitement, staffing
the President's Cabinet should be easy.  But instead the President
only in the last 24 hours has been able to make appointments of
new officials to take us across that bridge to the 21st century.

<p>

Maybe the White House will shake off these December doldrums,
but it may also be that Bill Clinton is undergoing the curse of
the second term.  During this century, second terms have been
notoriously full of failure, indecision and scandal. Will that
be Bill Clinton's fate, too?  Only time will tell.

<p>

Honor. It's the missing word in modern English.  Honor is
a respect for norms, for history and tradition.  Honor is courage
fused with a deep humility.  Above all, honor is profound honesty.

<p>

But honor today is in trouble.  Just how much trouble is
obvious in a news report about the Congressional Medal of Honor.
It seems that the company that manufactures this prized award
has been doing a little business on the side.  It has been selling
duplicate copies of the medal to whoever is willing to pay.  You
heard me right.  For seventy-five dollars, you're a Congressional
Medal of Honor winner. The Congressional Medal of Honor is rarely
given.  Only the most unusual acts of bravery and self-sacrifice
-- extraordinary valor they call it -- qualify.  The Medal is
sometimes given to a grieving widow, parents pierced to the heart,
a now fatherless child.  None of these things has a commercial
price.

<p>

Once in a while an event comes along that captures vividly
how far we've fallen.  The case of the bogus medals is one of
those events.  America needs to recover its sense of honor.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

This week, more disturbing news was unveiled about the problem
called Gulf War Syndrome.  If you haven't been following this
story in detail, it involves nearly one hundred thousand American
veterans of the war against Saddam Hussein.  These veterans are
experiencing a wide variety of ailments, including birth defects
among their children, and a dispute is raging over whether exposure
to Iraqi chemical weapons is to blame.  For six years now, our
government has dragged its feet about getting to the bottom of
this.  The latest word is that key documents central to this investigation
are missing.

<p>

I'm neither a military nor medical expert, but foot-dragging
and ineptitude on matters like this are unacceptable.  The Pentagon
should be seeking answers to the nagging questions about Gulf
War Syndrome with the same vigor that it prosecuted the fight
against Iraq.  These young men, and now women, who answered their
country's call were heroes and heroines overseas.  Now our government
is acting like they are only hypochondriacs.  They deserve better
-- much better.

You probably haven't heard of the basketball team from Mount
Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, but chances
are you'll soon hear a lot about them.  Many sportswriters and
scouts are calling them possibly the best high school team ever
assembled.

<p>

That in itself is interesting, but this team of athletic
stars is &quot;best&quot; in another and deeper sense, too.  They
are a nucleus of young men brought together as much on the basis
of their dismal past as their bright future.  This Christian school,
led by Pastor Donald Fozard, committed itself long ago to using
basketball to reach boys' souls.  The kids Fozard has taken in
are a motley crew of ex drop-outs, &quot;fall-through-the cracks&quot;
young men.  At Mt. Zion, they experience school as a disciplined
environment.  There are runs at five in the morning, mandatory
church twice-a-week, team prayers.  They are not allowed to date,
swear, listen to rap music, or wear jewelry.

<p>

The focus at Mt. Zion is on character and on the long-term
future -- on right and wrong and on faith.  And that focus is
taking Mt. Zion straight to the top.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

American families want to trust their government in matters
great and small, but sometimes it isn't easy.  As we found with
the recent controversy over air bags, federal officials knew more
about the hazards of these devices than they were willing to tell
us -- supposedly for our own good.  The same goes for Gulf War
syndrome -- the possible exposure of our Desert Storm soldiers
to chemical weapons.

<p>

There was shocking testimony on Capitol Hill this week. 
It now seems clear that military commanders failed to pursue findings
by their own trained personnel that chemical weapon exposure had
taken place.  The British defense ministry has now publicly apologized
for its failure to follow through on the issue too.

<p>

These incidents have a common thread -- a national nanny
government that thinks it must shape and limit what the people
know.  Maybe you've had a similar experience with public officials
-- with the IRS, or with some environmental rule.  Practices like
these create an unhealthy gap between citizen and government.
That just isn't America -- here you have to earn your trust.

<p>

He has been christened the &quot;butcher of Tienanmen Square,&quot;
and he visited Washington this week, where he was received with
full military honors.  The communist general I am referring to
is China's Minister of Defense --  the same man, the very same
man, who ordered Red Army Troops to crush the unarmed student
protest that captured the world's attention in 1989.  He was invited
to the United States by President Clinton, who came into office
campaigning for human-rights and who has reduced U.S. policy in
Asia to one vast trade mission.

<p>

While the general was getting the red-carpet treatment, the
European Parliament was giving its major human rights award, the
Sakharov prize, to a jailed Chinese dissident, Wei Jing-Sheng.
Mr. Wei's sister received the award on his behalf.  She used
the occasion to remind us that we have betrayed our principles.
We are supporting &quot;a gang of tyrants&quot; in Beijing, she
declared, because we are focused narrowly on &quot;the great Chinese
market of the future.&quot;

<p>

American policy now betrays American ideals.  This was a
week of shame in Washington.

<p>

Bill Clinton has gone on the warpath again, this time taking
aim at talk radio.  Appearing on a popular talk show, Clinton
denounced talk radio as &quot;overwhelmingly right wing,&quot;
and said it doesn't serve the country well.  Well, I'll concede
one point.  Talk radio can sometimes be crass and crude.  Some
hosts believe you have to offend to get an audience.

<p>

But someone needs to remind the president of something. 
It takes gall to denounce one of the few unstructured forums in
this country for political speech.  Like most politicians, Clinton
ran a tightly controlled, carefully scripted campaign this year.
Talk radio, on the other hand, at least reflects some genuine
give-and-take among average Americans.  Own a phone and you can
be part of the conversation.

<p>

America is a land of freedom, and millions of men and women
have shed blood to keep it that way.  The last thing today's citizens
want or need is a lecture from the just re-elected president of
the United States that their views shouldn't be aired.  After
all, isn't having our say the American way?

Outside the White House press room, there is a gallery of
famous drawings by Norman Rockwell.  Rockwell portrayed reporters
as a classic group of working stiffs, lovable Joe's just waiting
for the right story to come along.  Just how far that image of
the press has faded from the public mind is obvious in a new Harris
Poll.

<p>

By large margins, the poll found, Americans believe reporters
are, get your paper and pencil ready, politically biased, obnoxious,
negative, sensational, and inaccurate.  And if that isn't enough,
the public also believes that reporters have too much influence,
ignore people's privacy, overlook their own errors, show too much
violence, and don't much care about people.  This is hardly good
news for our free press.  The public has about as much faith in
them as it would in Attila the Hun.

<p>

And the Harris Poll also had some hot tips for reporters.
By similar majorities, Americans want the media to root out corruption
in office and to protect the public from abuses of power.  In
short, to be good citizens first.  Now it seems to me that isn't
too much to ask.

Today is Christmas Eve, and across the country airports and
highways are jammed.  People are heading home for the holidays,
hoping to make it in time for Christmas.  But today there are
tens of thousands of Americans who can only dream of those airports
and highways -- of those homecomings that matter so much.

<p>

Those are the men and women of our Armed Forces.  America
may be at peace, but still there are an incredible 237,000 American
soldiers scattered across the globe.  We're all aware of the contingent
in Bosnia, but the majority of our sons and daughters overseas
are elsewhere.  They are serving with NATO, manning submarines
under polar ice, sweating as military attaches in Africa, or guarding
the truce line in Korea.

<p>

We are not at war, but none of these soldiers serve in safety.
As the publisher of the <I>American Legion Magazine</I> pointed
out recently, the great irony is that the very status of our forces
as emissaries of peace makes them targets of war.  To these men
and women, we say, &quot;Merry Christmas, and may God bless you
and your families.&quot;

<p>

On Christmas Day, we celebrate what might be called the &quot;mundane
miracle.&quot;  It was the most ordinary of events:  the birth
of a baby.  But it was the most impossible of miracles, too: 
the incarnation of God Himself.

<p>

The birth of that baby split human history in two.  Nothing
will ever be the same on this earth.  On an infinitely smaller
scale, the birth of any baby has the same effect on human habits.
Having a child changes us.  Suddenly, the carefree single becomes
caregiving father or mother.  Issues that didn't matter before
suddenly matter a lot --- from personal safety, to what's on TV,
to pornography -- right on down to regular mealtimes.

<p>

Such is the power of a baby.  But today, as more and more
of us turn our back on the child born in Bethlehem, our backs
are turned on other babies, too.  Babies slain in the womb or
left in dumpsters with the other debris of our too-fast times.
How foolish we are to reject new life -- for what is Christmas,
but the eternal promise of new life in Christ?

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
the today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us,

The newspapers have been filled lately with all sorts of
stories about questionable political contributions from Asian
sources to President Clinton's reelection and legal defense funds.
The stories raise major issues that go to the integrity of our
political system, and they should be thoroughly investigated.
Unfortunately, there's a danger in all of this that Asian-Americans
as a whole will be falsely stigmatized.

<p>

That makes the story of Kingston Technology even more important.
John Tu and David Sun are business partners who lost $2,000,000
in the 1987 stock market plunge.  Tu is a Chinese immigrant. 
Rather than despair, he and Sun restarted their California-based
business with just $4,000.  Through hard work and ingenuity, they
rebuilt their company and turned it into an American success story.
They just sold the company for $1.5 billion.  And get this, they
are giving their employees an average bonus of $75,000.

<p>

That's some Christmas present -- and it's an even more poignant
reminder that it's not race, but ethics that count.

<p>

Have you heard the news out of Oakland, California?  In that
city, the school board has done something truly idiotic.  They
decided to designate the language of certain minority students
as a foreign language.  The term for this language is &quot;Ebonics,&quot;
but in fact Ebonics is nothing more than English spoken poorly.

<p>

By getting the language patterns of these urban kids established
as a foreign tongue, the school board hoped to take advantage
of bilingual education money.  You heard me right.  Naturally,
the school board's action caused a firestorm.  It's tempting to
joke that all of this is merely a semantic dispute.  These young
kids obviously need help in learning to speak, read, and write
standard English, so who cares where the money comes from?  But
something deeper is at work here.

<p>

This issue really concerns false presumptions about who can
learn.  The Oakland school board is selling its own black students
short.  By doing so, it is limiting their horizons and their job
prospects.  The word for that is &quot;sad&quot; -- in any language.

<p>

I get caught up in holiday shopping as much as anyone, and
I have the bills to prove it.  So naturally my talk today is about
how we make too much of material goods during this spiritual season.
But I have special reason to emphasize that theme.

<p>

Just before Christmas, we received one of those calls in
the night every parent dreads.  The phone rang with the news that
our daughters, Elyse and Sarah, had been in an accident on the
interstate 75 miles from our home.  They were returning from Elyse's
college, and it was a night of sleet and slick roads.  The car
had spun across the highway and been rear-ended. The car was
totaled, but fortunately, both girls' injuries were minor -- a
bad head bump and some whiplash.  But it came home quickly to
us how easily our girls could have been killed on that highway
home.

<p>

The heart of Christmas is the miracle of the child Jesus,
God becoming man.  That miracle was even more meaningful this
year at the Bauer house, all because of what did -- and didn't
-- happen on a dark and icy road.

<p>

During his presidency, Bill Clinton's Secret Service detail
has had a sometimes-stormy relationship with the public.  The
latest incident occurred at the National Cathedral on Christmas
Eve.

<p>

The Rev. Bob Schenck got close enough to Clinton to whisper,
&quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot;  According
to Schenck, Clinton heard the remark and understood it as Schenck
meant it -- a reference to the Presidential veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban.  In any event, when the service was over, Secret
Service agents detained Schenck, rifling through his wallet. 
They denied him a lawyer, and told him Clinton had complained
about Schenck's words.

<p>

As I noted, this isn't the first time Secret Service agents
have made life unpleasant for people who dare speak to Clinton.
What Schenck reportedly said is hardly a threat.  In fact, every
one of us will be held accountable by God -- for what we've done,
or failed to do, to show mercy, or kindness, or love.  And on
that day of judgment, none of us will have Secret Service agents
at our side to shield us from the truth.

<p>

Have you ever noticed how America's elites always assume it's
inevitable that our young people are increasingly liberal in their
values?  Well there's a new survey out that shows the elites are
wrong once again.

<p>

The Higher Education Research Institute's survey of over 250,000
college freshmen shows that students are actually becoming --
listen to this -- more conservative.  For the fourth year in a
row, the number of students who support legalized abortion has
declined.  And there's no &quot;gender gap&quot; on the question.

<p>

The survey also showed that support for casual sex has reached
an all-time low. Over half of students now say that promiscuity should 
be avoided. They also say criminals should be punished, not coddled. 
Today's young people are also more self-confident and civic-minded, with
record numbers performing volunteer work and community service.  And 
up to 30 percent identify themselves as &quot;Born Again Christians.&quot;

<p>

These are exciting trends.  They show that conservatism is borne
out in practical experience.  It looks like increasingly young 
Americans are concluding that liberalism is a dead end.

<p>

I'm a bit old-fashioned, so every New Year's I make resolutions.
Some are personal -- like remembering to walk the dog before
I turn in for the night.  But others are public.  Here at the
Family Reserch Council, we've made several resolutions for the
New Year.

<p>

First, we're resolved to make 1997 the year of pro-family
tax relief.  Family tax cuts are one of those things that everybody
supports, but nobody enacts.  It's time this nation invested as
much in human capital as it does in physical capital.  Second,
we're resolved to make 1997 a year of national awakening about
the need for judicial reform.  With pending  issues like assisted
suicide and same-sex marriage, there's no time to lose in restoring
legislative power to the American people.  Third, we're resolved
to launch a new youth program, that will help train the next generation
of young men and women in the Judeo-Christian world view.

<p>

Finally, we resolve to seek these goals with an attitude
of prayerful humility.  As we reach out to the better angels of
our neighbors, we must first renew our own better angels.

<p>

When a set of indicators is headed in one direction, while
a related indicator is headed the other way, society must take
notice.  That's the case today in the area of drug-related arrests
among juveniles.  Overall, the national crime rate is declining.
But arrests of young people for drug possession are soaring.
Just one example.  In Fairfax County, Virginia, where I live,
the arrest rate for juvenile drug possession has increased <I>sevenfold</I>
since 1991.

<p>

That number is appalling, not just for what it says about
drug use, but also about the conditions in which drug use thrives.
Police now estimate that there are roughly 25,000 gangs operating
in the United States.  All told, these gangs have 652,000 members.
They typically commit all sorts of crimes, but the drug trade
remains a keystone business for most of them.

<p>

Thomas Constantine, head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, calls this situation &quot;a ticking time bomb.&quot;
I agree.  You and I -- and every citizen -- must re-enlist in
the war against drugs.  If we fail, that bomb will go off in a
crowd of our children.

<p>

Now here's some good news from America's inner city.  Picture
this.  In Baltimore, fifty-eight young boys arrive for school
at 7:15 am.  It's cold and dark outside.  But inside, the boys
get a warm greeting from a Catholic priest and the 31-year old
headmaster at Ignatius Academy.  Each boy shakes hands with the
two men.  It is a civilized ritual.  If their pronunciation is
wrong, it is corrected, but no one is demeaned.  Most of the fifty-eight
boys are black, a few are white or Hispanic.  Only eighteen are
Catholic.  But each boy knows he is a child of God.

<p>

The school operates on the assumption that it makes a 
difference when young children are taught
that Jesus loves them.  It costs five thousand dollars a year
to educate each boy, but that's far less than Baltimore spends
on its public school students.  Generous donors provide scholarships
for the boys and each boy writes a personal thank-you letter,
because they should.  There are no metal detectors here.

<p>

The donors, the parents and the teachers at this school are saving
Baltimore, one soul at a time.  I pray that 1997 will give us
more stories like this academy.

<p>

House Republicans are deciding whether or not Newt Gingrich will
remain Speaker.  Few think the GOP will fail to keep the leader
who brought them out of forty years in the political wilderness.
Whatever details eventually emerge on this continuing saga, one
thing should be clear:  We have a <I>double</I> standard in Washington
when it comes to ethics.

<p>

The charges against Speaker Gingrich need to be fully explained.
We believe that no official, Speaker or President is above the
law.  But let's be fair.

<p>

Liberals crucified Judge Bork.  They tried to lynch my friend
Clarence Thomas. They nearly ran Ed Meese out of town for ethical
violations so minor that today no one can even remember what they
were.

<p>

Yet serious charges against liberals often go without investigation
and without prosecution.  Why, even now, all the president's men
are in federal court arguing that Paula Jones' credible sexual
harassment charges should not even be heard.

<p>

The motto at the Supreme Court is &quot;equal justice under
law.&quot;  We need to see justice for conservatives as well as 
liberals.  It's only fair.

Vice President Al Gore will celebrate the twenty-fourth anniversary
of <I>Roe v. Wade </I>on January 22nd.  That's right, I said <I>celebrate.</I> 
He will be the keynote speaker at a gala luncheon sponsored
by NARAL, the militant National Abortion Rights Action League.
Gore will appear with actress Demi Moore.

<p>

Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, will present a <I>lifetime</I> 
achievement award.  Sad that Tipper honors some <I>lifetimes</I>
while millions are snuffed out.

<p>

NARAL, of course, presses for abortion-on-demand with American
taxpayers paying for it.  They defend every one of the 30 million
abortions that have been performed since 1973.

<p>

How tragic for Al and Tipper Gore.  Just eleven years ago,
<I>Senator</I> Al Gore wrote of his <I>deep, personal conviction
that abortion is wrong.</I> Today the Gores chose to be honored
by the abortion lobby.

<p>

It is always sad when someone aboandons principle for political
gain.  But time and time again, our unborn children have been
abandoned by politicians.  And that is a tragedy.

<p>

Here's a &quot;dear Abby&quot; story for you, but it's not about
the famous newspaper columnist who gives advice to the lovelorn.
The Abby I'm talking about is a darling kindergarten girl who
lives in suburban Washington DC.  Her classmates were passing
out Christmas cards and she wanted to share in the holiday joy.

<p>

But Abby's cards contained Bible verses and shared the love of
Jesus with the elementary kids in this local public school.  Believe
it or not, her teacher confiscated Abby's cards.  When her dad
went up to the school to complain, the principal said the materials
were &quot;offensive and inappropriate.&quot;  Apparently, he
hasn't heard the reason for the season.

<p>

Christmas comes but once a year, but this militant, anti-religious
attitude, unfortunately, can be found all year long.  It's not
just uncharitable, it's <I>unconstitutional</I> Supreme Court
rulings have been bad on voluntary school prayer and the religious
rights of students, but <I>no</I> court has gone to this outrageous
extreme.

<p>

We will work to correct these injustices.  We know that as long
as this is America, we don't have to hide our light under a bushel.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

When the lawyers in favor of assisted suicide stood before our
Supreme Court last week they made all kinds of arguments for what
they called the right to die.  But Justice Antonin Scalia nailed
them with this probing question: &quot;This is <I>lovely</I> philosophy.
Where is it in the Constitution?&quot;

<p>

Now, I've spoken with you about assisted suicide before.  Today,
I want to focus on Justice Scalia's question.  Over the past thirty
years, we have seen a judiciary that is out of control on a host
of issues.  If our judges would only ask themselves Scalia's question,
they would not give in every time some bizarre claim is presented
to them.  Think of the outrageous rulings our courts have handed
down.  Abortion-on-demand. Banning voluntary school prayer.  Approving
flag burning. 

<p>

We need to hold the courts accountable. Abraham Lincoln said
that if we don't,  we will cease to be our own rulers.  Let's
make all our judges answer Justice Scalia's question.  &quot;Where
is it in the Constitution?&quot;

<h3>Rebirth, Return, Reunion:  Hungary's Euro-Atlantic Agenda</h3>

By <b>His Excellency Arpád Göncz</b><br>
President of the Republic of Hungary<br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<P>
It is a great pleasure and honor for me to be able to brief you, an audience of one of the most prestigious policy think tanks of the United States, on the principal foreign policy endeavors of Hungary. In your full-fledged democracy, the activity of research institutes devoid of the burden of day-to-day politics but dedicated to the thorough analysis of long-term processes and historical causality plays an important role beside the protagonists of politics. When it comes to shaping U.S. foreign policy, people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue no doubt pay heed to the work of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> as well as the opinion of its researchers. I, therefore, address you now not only as researchers and people interested in the subject, but also as persons who have influence, to a lesser or greater extent, on the United States' foreign policy towards the Central European region, including Hungary, and thus on the success of Hungary's foreign policy objectives.
<p>
<b>Rebirth</b>
<p>
For well over 40 years Hungary, similarly to other Central European states, lived torn from the bosom of her natural European environment. In the wake of the imposition of Soviet rule, the Iron Curtain that fell across the center of Europe and along Hungary's western border hermetically isolated Central and Eastern Europe from the western part of the continent. The countries under Soviet rule were forcibly subjected to the inhumane and unnatural experiment of building communism. While east of the Iron Curtain the world witnessed the continuous destruction of human, moral, and material values, the United States and Western Europe registered never-before-seen democratic and economic progress, thus bringing about the cooperation of the community of prosperous democracies.
<p>
The non-viable Soviet regime eventually collapsed under its own weight, due in no small measure to the fact that it was simply unable to keep pace with the rate of development and the arms race dictated by the United States. It is clear today that the staunch anti-communist stance of President Reagan, accused of reviving the Cold War chill, in no way slowed the agony of the communist system; on the contrary, it reduced its duration considerably. In 1989 the zombie states of Central Europe came around from 40 years of inertia and set about building, on the ruins of communism, an open and democratic society working on the principles of a market economy. The undertaking has turned out to be a lot harder than was expected, in either East or West. The countries of the Central European region have had to come to grips with a gamut of difficulties posed by the simultaneous change of the whole political and economic system. This constitutes an unparalleled historical challenge for the region and, I daresay, the whole of the Euro-Atlantic zone as well.
<p>
The complexity of the tasks surfacing with the transformation is well illustrated by the example of Hungary. Democracy and the idea of an economy based on private property and healthy competition came as no novelty to Hungary. Perchance not all of you know that the basic principles of democracy and the thought of freedom had touched Hungary way back in the mid-19th century. Although the war of independence waged against Habsburg absolutism was lost in 1849, its ideals lived on and materialized to a large extent in the wake of the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867. Lajos Kossuth, leader and symbol of the Hungarians' freedom fight, is remembered to this very day as the champion of liberty not only in Hungary, but also in the United States, where his bust stands in the Capitol. It is also worth recalling that Hungary, albeit only as part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, formed an integral part of the economy and culture of Europe at the turn of the century, and her legal system met the requirements of the age.
<p>
All the above-mentioned traditions notwithstanding, the transformation following the events of 1989 has been an extremely painful process, particularly from the point of view of the economy. Nothing characterizes better the enormity of the undertaking than the fact that transforming the structure of the economy has called for exceptional efforts even from Hungary, a country that was the first and only state in the communist bloc to introduce gradual market reforms from 1968 onwards.
<p>
The fundamental institutions of democracy -- a multi-party system, free parliamentary elections, accountable government, independent courts, and the freedom of information -- had all been created by the end of 1990. Adapting to a market economy, however, entailed negative phenomena with repercussions to date, such as galloping inflation and unemployment, the waning of whole branches of industry, and the bankruptcy of state enterprises. Although these phenomena are obviously understandable for an economist, they provoke discontent among the people. The change of structure has, nevertheless, been completed by now, and today the economy is governed by market mechanisms. The private sector now accounts for some 60 percent of production. In 1994 the economy began to register a slight growth. Over 70 percent of Hungary's foreign trade is carried on with industrially developed countries. Besides, the influx of foreign capital into Hungary in the last six years has amounted to some 9 billion U.S. dollars, more than in any other country of the region. I am pleased to see that U.S. companies lead the way in the field of investment in Hungary with an approximately 40 percent share. Such favorable changes, together with strict financial stabilization measures, are creating the bases of long-term development.
<p>
In addition to the radical transformation of home affairs and the economy, Hungarian foreign policy has also undergone change. Hungary has turned towards the West again and is determined to return to the community of Western democracies. With the experience of the past well heeded, this time the overtures towards the West do not imply burning the bridges towards the East. Hungary has a vested interest in maintaining good relations with all the countries of the region. This intention, as well as our effort directed at our Euro-Atlantic integration, enjoys the backing of all the parliamentary parties and public opinion.
<p>

<b>Return</b>
<p>
Hungary thus has irreversibly launched a program to try to catch up with the developed world politically and economically, and hopes to be able to join as soon as possible the Euro-Atlantic integrational organizations, primarily NATO and the European Union. Our integration would not be complete without our membership in the OECD and the defense organization of the European Union, the Western European Union.
<p>
Our Euro-Atlantic integration is a means to an end and a symbol at the same time. It is a means to an end because, we firmly believe, securing lasting stability and prosperity hinges on Hungary becoming a member of NATO and the European Union. Twentieth century history has proved without the shadow of a doubt that the Central European region must not be abandoned or left to wither into a grey zone. Both world wars broke out partly as a direct consequence of expansionist powers regarding Central Europe as spoils of war. We are justified in stating that Hungary and her neighbors, with the exception of some tragic states of the former Yugoslavia, have to face no external threat at the moment; therefore, her Western integration is not a matter of life and death right now. Yet it is precisely the bitter experience of the past that urges both Hungary and her neighbors to preempt even the shaping of potential crises and drop anchor firmly in the community of Western democracies. Integration is a symbol too, as it indicates as clear as daylight that Hungary, a country that holds values and pursues objectives identical with those of the Western democracies, has the right to seek her due place in the Euro-Atlantic community.
<p>
It is in the sphere of the economy that the European Union could best promote the stability of the region and Hungary. On the one hand, it is a well-known fact that economic growth and the resulting prosperity considerably reduce animosity between different countries. On the other hand, the common market system of the Union is what could make Hungary's market, small just by itself, and production capacity really viable. The integration accomplished within the European Union is at the same time the symbol of reconciliation and cooperation in Europe. Although not primarily a defense organization, the Union provides, nonetheless, some form of guarantee against both outside aggression and conflicts between member states. Integration results in a kind of mutual dependence that excludes the possibility of inner hostility while shaping a bloc that, by its mere size, may serve as a deterrent. In the wake of the change of regime, Hungary did not delay in widening and institutionalizing her ties with the European Union, and is by now linked to the organization through an association agreement. Parallel to this, domestic processes have been launched in the fields of economic policy and law harmonization, which are prerequisites of admission to the Union. Hungary made an official announcement of her intention to join in the spring of 1994 and hopes to become a full-fledged member of the Union by the end of the millennium. Allow me to focus from this point forward on NATO above all else, since it is in this organization that your country plays the leading role.
<p>
In the course of the Cold War, NATO proved that it could deter any potential outside aggression and that its members could rely on the organization's "hard" security guarantees. The engine of the alliance's success was the United States, whose brave leaders of vision realized that the security of America and the security of Europe are inseparable, and that it is worth making sacrifices in the interest of common security. Beside the actual military defense and the U.S. nuclear shield, we must not fail to remark the alliance's good influence on relations between the members, in particular on relations between France and Germany.
<p>
Although the Cold War has ended and the Soviet Union has fallen apart, history has not come to an end, as Francis Fukuyama predicted a few years ago. On the contrary, the war in the Balkans and the conflicts raging in the former Soviet republics have shown that new and less predictable dangers encroach on the peace of the Euro-Atlantic region. The circumstances may have changed, and the tasks ahead may be different, yet NATO and an active United States presence in Europe are still needed as much as ever. Hungary, having taken the initiative to dissolve the Warsaw Pact, came to the early recognition that in order to ensure her long-term security she would have to become a member of the Union and join NATO. One cannot emphasize enough that Hungary's hope of becoming a member of the alliance is in no way directed against others. In other words, Hungary would not wish to use her eventual membership to the detriment of her neighbors in the region. On the contrary, it is in our interest that other Central European countries also be able to meet the requirements set for joining and be admitted to the organization, since security can be envisaged only in a wider context. Just to give you an example, the security of Romania and Slovakia, for instance, has a strong bearing on the development and security of Hungary, and vice versa.
<p>
Speaking of Hungary's intention to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, and the future of the Central European region, the question arises:  What interest does NATO, and particularly the United States, have in expanding the organization and, thus, covering the subsequent defense expenditure?  Among the numerous reasons, allow me to mention the most significant ones.
<p>
Guaranteeing human and minority rights and ensuring conditions for a free-market economy and democracy rank among the foreign policy priorities of the United States. In order for these values to prevail without any risks in Central Europe, not only today but in the future, the stability of the region must be increased, for which the expansion of NATO presents itself as the most convenient means. In the course of the Cold War, the world would have been swept to the verge of a catastrophe in the form of another world war had the United States endeavored to insist on the prevalence, even beyond the Iron Curtain, of the values she held dear. Today American values could spread and American interests could be guaranteed without a single gunshot and without any risk of a world war.
<p>
The United States has a vested trade interest in the stability and smooth economic development of the region, seeing that this region is becoming an increasingly significant market for U.S. products and investment. Expanding NATO may constitute a lasting means of securing this market. By the same token, the mere fact of NATO membership may exert a stimulating influence on investors, ever fearful of political risks.
<P>
We are positive that Hungary's NATO membership would benefit the security structure of the organization and, indirectly, the whole region and even the whole continent, in the geopolitical sense, as:
<p><ul>
<li>It would contribute to increasing stability in the Central European region;
<p>
It would ensure NATO an access route to the Balkans, which, despite the peace process currently under way, can be expected to continue as a region of instability in the future; and
<p>
<li>The Hungarian Army would contribute, albeit only to a modest degree, to the many-sided development of the alliance's military strength and even more favorable positions.
<p>
<li>NATO membership is a foreign policy goal based on substantial social consensus in virtually all the countries of the region. The expansion of NATO would, therefore, have a favorable effect on the faith our societies have in Western values, would increase their sense of security, and would prevent the eventual upsurge of frustration, which could well emerge should the extension be prolonged for too long.
</ul><p>


<b>Reunion</b>
<p>
Now that we have reviewed what motivates Hungary to approach NATO and what interest NATO has in extension, it is worth summing up briefly what we have actually done with a view to joining.
<p>
The fact that the Atlantic alliance has recognized the need for eastward extension and has launched the preparatory process for the admission of new members is an encouraging sign for us. We particularly welcome the initiatives in this issue of U.S. politicians, both in the Administration and in Congress. We regard the Partnership for Peace initiative, outlined in the fall of 1993 and launched in 1994, as an integral part of the road leading to membership. Not forgetting her size and possibilities, Hungary for her part endeavors to make the most of the opportunities offered by Partnership for Peace by taking part in the different operations and training programs. I was thrilled to hear that the Hungarian units taking part in Operation Cooperative Nugget, held in Louisiana this summer, stood their ground excellently. The mere fact of a joint operation tells a tale in itself. Just think it over. No more than six years ago, we would have laughed at the idea of the units of a small member state of the Warsaw Pact joining American and other allied troops for a military operation somewhere along the Mississippi.
<p>
Beyond Partnership for Peace, other forms of excellent cooperation now characterize relations between Hungary and NATO and NATO member states. For Hungary it was a great honor that the North Atlantic Assembly, NATO's parliamentary organ, held its May 1995 conference in Budapest, since it was the very first time it had held its session in a non-member state. The fact that NATO intelligence aircraft, the famous AWACS, carry on their activity in Hungarian air space in connection with the crisis in the Balkans provides promising bases for our future institutional cooperation. The joint U.S.-Hungarian military rescue operation held recently in Hungary was also a success. Military and technical compatibility, cited as a precondition for admission, is considerably improved by the Hungarian Army's increasing number of defense arms purchases from American companies.
<p>
We are fully aware that in today's world, security transcends the military aspect and embraces political, economic, social, and even cultural areas. Hungary does her utmost in order to ensure that her own peace and that of the region rest on stable foundations. Joining NATO as soon as possible serves our interest, but only as part of a complex process that aims, in the final analysis, at increasing the stability of the whole Euro-Atlantic region.
<p>
Keeping this objective in mind, Hungary pays particular attention to the most all-around possible strengthening of relations with her neighbors. Hungary looks upon the Hungarian minorities living in the neighboring countries as the cement of bilateral relations and not as a source of conflict. I must emphasize at this point that relations between Hungary and neighboring Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine are virtually problem-free. This spring we were able to sign a basic treaty with Slovakia with a view to accomplishing comprehensive progress in our relations and regulating the situation of the minorities. The agreement has already been ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, and we hope the Slovakian legislature will soon follow suit. We have conducted negotiations with Romania for nearly a year in order to draft a similar document, but unfortunately no breakthrough has yet come during the talks. I wish to stress that signing a basic treaty, while important, is not the sole element of relations between Hungary and Romania. We strive to deepen bilateral relations in all areas regardless of whether there is or is not a basic treaty. What gives us hope for the future is that economic, trade, and military ties are developing well between Hungary and Romania. All the aforesaid goes to show that Hungary has no problem with any of her neighbors that could even remotely hold the threat of a "second Bosnia," as is occasionally alleged by some who oppose the extension of NATO.
<p>
In connection with a more comprehensive interpretation of security, I wish to mention the pivotal role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE, among whose members the United States plays an active part, is the only Euro-Atlantic institution with wide-ranging security competence. Hungary, in her role as Chairman- in-Office, has recognized the OSCE's unique opportunities in the field of confidence building, crisis prevention, and management, and strives to make the most of them.
<p>
In 1995, under Hungary's chairmanship, the organization opened a mission in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, and appointed three ombudsmen responsible for human rights, thus considerably enhancing the activity of the Sarajevo mission. Another mission, soon to be inaugurated in Croatia, is also to serve the comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. These missions everywhere spare no effort to reach a peaceful settlement in the conflicts. In Chechnya this led to the signing of an agreement between the warring parties on July 30. If the guns in the Balkans are silenced for good, the OSCE is ready to undertake an increasingly active role in consolidating peace and the process of rehabilitation following the conflict. In the same manner, the OSCE provides an institutional framework for Russia to discuss Euro-Atlantic security issues. This function of the organization is expected to gain more impetus as NATO expansion materializes.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hungary did not delay in setting off on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration, and she is now doing her utmost, both in the area of preparing the country and in her foreign policy, to become a full-fledged member of NATO and the EU as soon as possible. The fact that Western democracies and integrational organizations have recognized the importance of the chance to open towards the East and are willing to cooperate with the fledgling democracies of Central Europe is a source of encouragement for us. And yet, opinions are voiced over and over again criticizing the too speedy reintegration of Hungary and her neighbors in the region and questioning the justification for NATO extension. Such opinions are fearful of accepting new responsibilities and the consolidation, not to mention the possible defense, of the Central European democracies. Any delay or uncertainty may eventually exact a high price, since there is no excluding the possibility of the situation in these fledging democracies growing critically worse due either to their own internal problems or to any unfavorable developments in the region east of them.
<p>
Our common task and responsibility is, therefore, possibly even greater than it was in 1989, when the picture was rather more simple. All the hard work of recent times may have been in vain unless Hungary and her neighbors in the region are able to drop anchor as soon as possible, and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven. In conclusion, permit me to quote the great statesman, President John F. Kennedy:  "The United States will pay any price, bear any burden in defense of freedom around the world.... "<sup>1</sup> If President Kennedy's message still holds good, bearing a not-too-big burden today, for the same purpose and right on the finishing line, cannot constitute a matter for discussion. The burden must be borne.

<h3>Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy: What Literature Teaches About the Collapse and Recovery of Home and Family</h3>
<p>
By <b>David Patterson</b><br>
Associate Professor of European Literature, Oklahoma State University
<p>
The second <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, October 19, 1995.
<P>
In a Heritage Foundation lecture titled "The Fraud of Multiculturalism," <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirkmem.html">Russell Kirk</a> noted that "cultural restoration, like charity, begins at home."  And he was quite right. For cultural restoration entails the restoration of what is most high, most dear, most enduring. And the ground for all such things is the home. The home is the place where our names are first uttered with love and therefore where we first discover that we mean something. It is the site where both human beings and human values first make their appearance in the world. It is the center from which we define and understand the nature of everything we encounter in the world. The home, then, is not one thing among many in a world of things; nor is it merely the product of a culture. Rather, the world of things derives its sense, and a culture its significance, from their relationship to the home. Without the home, everything else in the world or in a culture is meaningless.
<P>
Just as the home is not one thing among many, the human relationship from which it arises is not one among many. I am speaking, of course, of marriage, or, more properly, of holy matrimony. The sanctity of the home is rooted in the sanctity of marriage. And the holiness of human life is rooted in the holiness of this union through which life is born into the world. Indeed, from ancient times marriage has been a metaphor for the expression of the relation between the human and the holy. In the Christian tradition, for example, the Church is called "the Bride of Christ."  And according to the Jewish tradition, the two tablets given to Moses at Sinai signify a bride and groom, indicating that Israel is betrothed to God as a wife is betrothed to her husband. Marriage alone makes it possible to overcome a fundamental condition of exile and thus dwell in the world. Why?  Because in the union of holy matrimony the seed of the home is planted. That seed comes to life when a wife becomes a mother and a husband becomes a father; it comes into being upon the birth of a child, when the family comes into being. The home, then, might be better understood not as a place or a thing, but as an event in the life of the holy.
<p>
Viewed as such an event, the emergence of the family that constitutes the home is far more than just a biological phenomenon or even a natural wonder. A mother, for example, is not just one who gives birth, but one who emanates light, love, and compassion. Through her humanity receives a revelation of the light created upon the first utterance of Creation, the light that sanctifies all Creation. Indeed, only through the wife and mother of a household does blessing fall upon a home; for as the bearer of life she is most intimately aligned with the miracle and mystery of life. Indeed, she and the Creator of life at times share the same name. In Hebrew, for instance, the Creator is sometimes referred to as <i>Ha-Rachamim</i>, or "the Compassionate One," a term that has the same root as the word <i>rechem</i>, which means "womb." 
<p>
Similarly, the father of a family is more than the sire of some offspring. If he is a father, then he is also a teacher who by his example imparts to his children and his community something about truth, tradition, and moral responsibility -- about what there is to stand for and what we must refuse to stand for. A man, therefore, does not fully grow to manhood until he becomes a father; that is, until he becomes such a teacher and sets such an example, whether he actually sires children or not. That a father bears such a significance is demonstrated by the condition of families and communities that have been abandoned by their fathers.
<p>
Finally, the child born of the holy union of husband and wife signifies the dearness of all life and is a manifestation of holiness itself. If the world endures thanks to a direction we pursue, then it endures thanks to the child. For the child sets before us a direction and therefore a future, in which our most sublime aspirations, our most moving inspirations, and our most urgent questions might be decided. Those who have gazed into the eyes of an infant only seconds old and who have then looked up to behold the world transformed know what it means to realize, if only for a moment, what is infinitely precious. Infinity, you see, comes in small packages.
<p>
This gazing down upon the child is a looking up toward a height that elevates humanity from the realm of biology to the realm of spirituality. Here a survival of the strongest and the fittest is overtaken by a dwelling in the dearest and the highest. Without the home humanity loses this dimension of height that ordains and sanctifies all of being. Without the family we are left to a flat land that is a waste land and wander in an exile steeped in emptiness and indifference. Because the home and family have such a significance for human life, human meaning, and human values, a concern for the collapse and recovery of the home forms a significant part of much of the world's literature. For literature is not just a mirror held up to life. More than that, it is an interaction with life in the light of the truth that sustains life; it is part of the human seeking that takes us forever homeward. 
<p>
In order to illustrate this point, I have selected three literary masterpieces that address these issues in various ways. While they come from very different times and cultures, they represent a human condition that is as common to all humanity as motherhood, fatherhood, and childhood. They are the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer, William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, and Leo Tolstoy's novel <i>Anna Karenina</i>. Let us consider, then, the various perspectives on home and family that these texts offer us. In doing so, we may see why these works, like home and family, are among the permanent things.

<p>
<b>An Exile's Movement Homeward: The <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer</b>
<p>
Most of us know the <i>Odyssey</i> as a tale of adventure, in which the hero undergoes various trials on his return to home and family from the Trojan War, a war fought over the break-up of a home. The adventures of Odysseus have a mythical quality that may at first keep his ordeals at a safe distance from us. But if we take a closer look at this tale, we discover its deeper, universal aspect precisely in its mythical features. For in myth, as Joseph Campbell has shown, a shallow mind may perceive only the local scenery, but a deeper mind encounters "all the stages of the Way from the ethnic to the elementary idea, from the local to the universal being, which is Everyman, as he both knows and is afraid to know."  In the case of Odysseus the stages of the Way lead not only from the local to the universal being, but also from exile to home, which is the dwelling place of Everyman, as he learns what there is to fear and what there is fear for.
<p>
Every tribulation that Odysseus must endure, then, entails overcoming a threat to the integrity and the sanctity of home and family. Here we shall consider a few familiar examples to make this point. Recall, for instance, what transpires in the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There, says Odysseus, anyone who ate of the lotus would "forget the way home."  What immediately comes to mind in this connection is the threat that drugs pose for every family in every home. But why, exactly, do drugs pose such a threat? 
<p>
First there are the obvious reasons:  Drugs lead to health problems, the squandering of resources, and a plummeting into irresponsibility. But Homer notes a deeper, more insidious threat to the home that underlies the obvious ones:  It is the loss of memory. In the <i>Republic</i> Plato teaches us that "we must not list the forgetful soul among the lovers of wisdom, but we require a good memory."  A good memory is the memory of the Good, which is the mark of wisdom itself. If the Good first manifests itself in the home, then wisdom entails an understanding of the significance of the home. And since the home is the place where our names are first uttered, the memory of home includes a memory of who and what we are, which is the memory of the responsibility to and for the Good that only we can meet. To be sure, to bear a family name is to bear this memory. Therefore, according to a Jewish legend, when we die and the Angel of Death comes to take us to the Holy One, we must answer a question before we can find our way to God:  What is your name?  For to know the answer to this question is to know the Good that opens up the path to the holy, which is the path that takes us homeward.
<p>
What must be remembered, moreover, as Homer indicates, is not just the home but the way home. The home is not something permanently given but something permanently sought, so that memory here is memory of a direction. And that makes it the memory of meaning. For to have meaning is to have a direction, and to have a direction is to be in motion toward a good that is yet to be fulfilled. Memory, then, orients us not only toward a good established in the past, but also toward a good to be sought in the future. And this good, in the words of Martin Buber, "is the movement in the direction of home," which is sustained by memory. Therefore, drugs threaten that movement homeward because drugs bring on oblivion, and in our world we have made oblivion into a multibillion-dollar business, not only in the drugs we peddle, but in the diversions we promote. Indeed, so dear to us is our deadly sleep that we ignore, ridicule, or even kill people who try to shake us from it.
<p>
In Homer's tale, as in our own time, then, we find that violence follows in the wake of oblivion. For after the Land of the Lotus Eaters Odysseus comes to the Land of the Cyclopians, where, says Homer, there are "no laws" and "no one cares for his neighbor."  There the Cyclops Polyphemos declares to Odysseus,
<p>
<bq>"Stranger, you are a simple fool, or come from far off, when you tell me to avoid the wrath of the gods or fear them. We do not concern ourselves over Zeus of the aegis, nor any of the rest of the blessed gods, since we are far better than they."</bq>
<P>
With these words -- and with the consistency of a logician -- Polyphemos proceeds to devour the companions of Odysseus.
<p>
The one-eyed monster here has a vision of only one thing:  a power that justifies anything -- that is what makes him monstrous. Where power is the only reality, there is no law other than the law dictated by the one in power. The monster does not act for his neighbor but manipulates his neighbor, even to the point of consuming him. And he has no regard for God because he sets himself up in the place of God, thereby regarding himself as better than God and in need of no one. Hence, he has no home that he might open to others but seals himself up in a tomb-like cave, like an animal holed up in his lair, without wife or children.
<p>
Violence toward others does violence to the home because violence is an assault on the Holy One who sanctifies the home in the sanctification of the family through holy matrimony. And because humanity comes into being with the appearance of the family, violence aimed at God is perpetrated upon humanity. "He who kills, kills God," Elie Wiesel has repeatedly said; the Eternal is eternally the victim. By contrast, those who would nurture life rather than take life enter into marriage and form a family by bringing life into the world. This nurturing of life entails not only bearing children, but also affirming the sanctity of the other human being, beginning with our husband or wife. Matrimony derives its holiness from this saying of you to another person in such a way that we attest to the holiness of the other that derives from the Holy One Himself. This relation that lies at the heart of the family makes all other relations meaningful. For this is the relation that opens up a higher truth that is opposed to power. As we see in the case of the Cyclops, without this truth that is revealed in the home there is no law or care for our neighbor. And so it is no coincidence that those who do violence to others generally come from broken homes. When homes break up bodies get broken.
<P>
The oblivion that leads to violence against others also takes the insidious form of a subtle violence done to oneself, as well as to others, in the mode of sensuality. Here, as in the case of violence, getting physical means being reduced to a purely physical, animalistic nature, as Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> suggests. After escaping from the Cyclops, Odysseus makes his way to the island where the sorceress Circe lives. There his men are tempted by the voluptuous beauty of the sorceress, who gives them fine foods poisoned with a drug "to make them wholly forget their native land," as Homer says. And she then turns them into pigs. But they had already forgotten their native land as soon as they acted on the sensual, and they had already lost their human image as soon as they succumbed to their animalistic nature. When animal instinct overtakes moral responsibility, the human form becomes the form of a pig, and the home is reduced to a sty.
<p>
In contrast to this succumbing to temptation we have the refusal to succumb on the part of Odysseus when he was marooned on the island of Calypso. There he tells the goddess,
"I know that...Penelope can never match the impression you make for beauty and stature. She is mortal after all, and you are immortal and ageless. But even so, what I want and all my days I pine for is to go back to my house and see my day of homecoming."
<p>
Like Circe, Calypso possesses all that sensual beauty can offer. But the home is constituted by the spiritual, and not by the sensual. And the difference lies in the caress. In the groping and grabbing of sensuality, we manipulate and appropriate the other for ourselves, for our own pleasure. The caress, however, is an opening and offering of the self to another, whether it is between husband and wife or parent and child. It is an instance of a contact not between skin and skin but between soul and soul -- that is what makes it spiritual rather than sensual. The caress, therefore, seeks what cannot be touched. It seeks what lies at the heart of the home, and it reveals what lives in the heart of the family. For without the loving caress, neither home nor family can come into being.
<p>
Thus the <i>Odyssey</i> culminates in a husband's caress of his wife, and it ends with his embrace of his father. His return to his family includes a return both to the one with whom he brings life into the world and to one who lies at the origin of his life. Returned to both, Odysseus returns to a responsibility for life, which means:  He returns to the family.
<P>
The threat to the family, however, comes not only from without, as in the tale of Odysseus, but also from within. This brings us to the next work we shall consider.
<P>

<b>The Undermining of a Family: Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i></b>
<p>
<i>King Lear</i> is a drama about the premature collapse and failed recovery of a monarch's household. While Homer's epic generally unfolds in the external geography of adventure, Shakespeare's play focuses more on the internal struggle of a soul trying to regain a native ground that has crumbled out from under him. But what exactly threatens the home and family of the King and, indeed, brings them to ruin?
<p>
The home and family in this drama come to ruin as the result of a fundamental confusion about nature and natural law, where natural law may be understood much as Thomas Aquinas understands it. Natural law, he explains in the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, is "the participation in eternal law by rational creatures," and eternal law is defined as "the rational governance of everything on the part of God."  The idea here is that God operates by design and that, since they bear the image of divine being, human beings have a responsibility to become part of that design. The rational governance of Providence implies an ordering of the world with the aim of pursuing the Good, that is, with the aim of attesting to what is most precious in life. Natural law, therefore, establishes a bond between the human being and divine being; it summons humanity to take up a path that would nurture and sanctify life, as God sanctifies life when He pronounces it to be "very good."  Inasmuch as the relation between the holy and the human finds its first expression in the home and family, the life that unfolds in this realm bears witness to a natural law expressive of a sacred aim in life.
<p>
King Lear's confusion, then, is a fundamental confusion about the life that unfolds in the home, and it is revealed in his relation to the surviving members of his family, his daughters Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia. In the play's opening scene Lear does not offer his daughters a loving embrace expressive of a higher relation, according to the family bond determined by natural law. Instead, he arranges a business transaction, whereby he tries to purchase their words of affection by offering them portions of his wealth. Two of his daughters, Regan and Goneril, are eager to exploit this confusion that undermines the family:  They exchange the testimony to life as determined by natural law for lifeless property. And so the seeds of death are sown.
<p>
The bond of love that is established by natural law to sustain the family, on the other hand, is precisely what Cordelia invokes when she declares to her father,
<p>
"I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond, no more nor less." (I.i)
<p>
It is not that Cordelia knows her place, but rather that she knows what is placed on high. Inclined toward a higher responsibility, she obeys the commandment of natural law, and not the whim of the King. But Lear insists upon the false authority of his own whims:  Rejecting Cordelia's simple affirmation of her bond, he refuses what natural law commands. Refusing the commandment of natural law, he loses his relation to the eternal law that sustains the home and sanctifies the family. And so he is left homeless, turned over to the merciless power of the elements as exemplified by the storms in the fields. There he has no dwelling place, for there he is exiled from the truth of natural law.
<p>
Usurping the authority of natural law, Lear loses his identity both as the king of a realm and as the father of a family. Here we realize that the task with which natural law confronts us is not simply to follow some rule, but to be who we are. And who we are is defined by the eternal truth that sanctifies the family. Thus, as soon as Lear violates his family by casting out Cordelia, his daughter Regan notes that "he hath ever but slenderly known himself" (I.i). For he knows himself only by the power of manipulation, and not by the truth of family relation. Once he becomes powerless in the face of his daughters' deception, Lear himself cries out, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?"  (I.iv). He does not know himself because he does not know himself as a father, and he is a father before he is a king. To know himself as a father would be to know the natural law that binds him to his daughters in truth, and not through power.
<p>
Therefore, as we recall, Cordelia alone speaks the truth, for she alone knows the bond of nature that ties her to her father and, through her father, to a higher truth. Hence, it is she, says Shakespeare,
<p>
"Who redeems nature from the general curse<br>
Which twain have brought her to." (IV. vi)
<p>
Cordelia works this redemption by restoring to Lear the relation between father and child -- and with it the higher relation -- that her sisters have undone. But this undoing was also Lear's doing. Like most of those who exchange the truth of natural law for the power of human arrogance, he reaps what he has sown. The man who had understood himself only in terms of the power he could wield is overpowered and eventually crushed by the two daughters who would wrench power away from him. 
<p>
The corruption of nature and the destruction of the family exemplified by Regan and Goneril manifests itself not only in their treatment of their father, but also in the violence that they bring down upon Gloucester by blinding him. The central figure in the play's subplot, he is a father who is betrayed by his child Edmond and who mistakenly suspects his son Edgar of betrayal. Like Regan and Goneril, it is the bastard son Edmond who is the "unnatural villain" (I.ii), as Gloucester states it, and whose villainy includes the betrayal not only of his father, but also of Cornwall and Albany, the husbands of Regan and Goneril, respectively. For part of his power play involves making promises to take up with each of these wives who are Lear's daughters. And, having betrayed their father, they are all too willing to betray their husbands and chase after Edmond.
<P>
Thus, the violation of the relation between parent and child entails the violation of the relation between husband and wife:  The family is assaulted at every turn by those who would be a law unto themselves in a usurpation of natural law. And so when Albany suspects his wife's treachery, he says to her, 
<p>
"O Goneril,<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature which contemns its origin<br>
Cannot be bordered certain in itself."  (IV. ii)
<p>
That nature which contemns its origin -- the child who dishonors her father -- is a perverted nature that despises the family. Despising this origin of humanity, such a nature has nothing to limit its contempt for humanity. Goneril, then, divorces herself from all the limitations of natural law, which, as we have seen, is our link to the eternal law that sanctifies the family and all of humanity. Thus divorced from the family, Goneril is cut off from the origin of all that is holy in human life and ends by murdering her two sisters. And the murder of Cordelia, of course, results in the death of her father Lear.
<p>
Set in a time that came long before Shakespeare's time, this play continues to speak to us in our own time. As a commentary on our own humanity, it sheds light on the ways in which we, too, stand by and tolerate the assault on the family. It tells us, for example, something about the sickness of a society that hides away its parents to die in "homes" that are the antithesis of a home and that leaves the care of its children to people who are not their parents. It reveals to us a connection between murder and adultery, between the hand that steals, the mouth that lies, and the eye that covets. For all of these things belong to a nature that contemns its origin and therefore has nothing but contempt for the family. All of them result from the undermining of the natural law that lies at the center of the home and that links the life of the family to the life of the eternal. 
<p>
In these last five transgressions I have mentioned you will recognize the second five of the Ten Commandments. Here we may recall an ancient Jewish teaching, according to which the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets in order to designate two realms of relation. The first five commandments pertain to the relation of <i>adam la Makom</i>, or the human relation to the divine, and the second five pertain to the relation of <i>adam l'adam</i>, or the human relation to other human beings. What is of interest to the concern at hand is this:  The commandment to honor mother and father belongs to the first category. Which means:  The integrity of the family belongs to the integrity of the divine. Holding to the sanctity of the family, therefore, is prior to the sanctification of all other realms of human relation. Once Lear's daughters violate the family and destroy the home, there is no crime that they cannot commit. And justify.
<p>
Thus, the truth that comes to us through <i>King Lear</i> arises in an antiquity that long precedes it and lives in a modernity that far exceeds it. Truly among the permanent things, this truth finds another expression in a literary masterpiece that appears nearly three centuries after Shakespeare's play. Which brings us to the third work to be considered.

<p>
<b>Families Lost and Found: Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i></b>
<p>
Tolstoy's masterful novel <i>Anna Karenina</i> has found its way into the popular culture through various film versions, including one starring Christopher Reeve that was made for television. Generally speaking, the popular view of the novel that has resulted from these films is that it is the tale of an exciting but tragic love affair between a frustrated housewife and a dashing young aristocrat. Like many popular conceptions, however, this is a misconception. Tolstoy's aim in his portrayal of the adulterous love affair is to expose the moral corruption that leads to the dissolution of the family. And he makes this point by contrasting Anna's love affair with Levin's marriage.
<p>
A key to the contrast that Tolstoy sets up is the figure of the child; indeed, as we have noted, it is with the appearance of a child that a family comes into being. Should anyone suppose that Anna's affair with Vronsky is exciting and wonderful, we have only to recall Tolstoy's account of how this indulgence devastates her son Seryozha. He is described as "the compass which showed [his mother and her lover] the degree of their divergence from what they knew was right, but did not want to see."  It is not as a judge, however, that Seryozha reveals to them their divergence from what is right. Rather, it is as a victim. Because he is a child, he represents a precious but fragile possibility for life; because he is a child, he embodies the meaning and direction that open up a future in which some redemption from a life void of meaning may be sought. Hence, the child is the core of home and family. And the child is just the one who is betrayed in Anna's illicit love affair.
<p>
"I love two beings only," says Anna of Seryozha and her lover Vronsky, "but the one excludes the other."  And we know which one she chooses. After she has left her family, one of Seryozha's "favorite occupations," says Tolstoy, "was keeping a lookout for his mother during his walks."  But she is almost never to be seen. Once she has a child by Vronsky, in fact, we are told that "the separation from her son...did not trouble her," since she had grown so attached to the daughter she had by Vronsky "that she rarely thought of her son."  And yet the declaration of her love for "two beings only" was made long after the birth of her daughter. This attachment too, therefore, is soon eclipsed by her preoccupation with Vronsky's love for her and with a personal happiness that is forever longed for but never realized. 
<p>
Why is it never realized?  Because in truth Anna loves no being other than the counterfeit being she has fashioned by making herself her own heroine in a romance whose outcome is determined from the start. Living with her lover in a house that is not a home and in an arrangement that is inimical to marriage, she exchanges a family life for the illusion of a love life. To her, happiness is my happiness, and not the happiness of her family. Thus, becoming a sign only of herself, and not of the significance of the other human being, Anna is drained of all significance. Like Narcissus at the pool, she gazes into the mirror of her self-styled fairy tale until, as Tolstoy says, she no longer recognizes herself. For she has lost the image of wife and mother that would be the basis of such recognition. The only action that remains for her to establish some significance in life is to take her own life. This she does without a thought for the children who would be orphaned by her action.
<p>
What is missing from Anna's love for Vronsky is precisely the love that forms the basis of the family, which is a love for the other person expressive of a higher relation. It is the love for the holy, as it is evinced by the love between husband and wife, the love that puts the holy into holy matrimony. Only when marriage rests on such a foundation can a family come into being. In <i>Anna Karenina</i> Tolstoy illustrates this point through the tale of Levin, which is the tale of a movement into life that runs counter to the story of the title character.
<p>
Modeled after the author himself, Levin is a man who is engaged in a constant struggle for meaning in life. And it is through the pursuit of family life that meaning in life finally opens up to him. In contrast to Anna, who sets up a household with a man to whom she is not married, Levin enters into marriage with Kitty under the auspices of the Church. Despite his religious skepticism at the time, he embraces the prayers said at his wedding. When, for example, he hears the words "Give unto them perfect love, peace and help, O Lord," he is struck by them, thinking, "How did they know that it is help, yes, help, that one needs?"  And when he hears the priest say, "Who unitest them that were separated and who hast ordained for them an insoluble union in love," he realizes, "How profound those words are and how they fit with what one feels at this moment!"  Thus, he sees that the words addressed to One who is above consecrate the marriage between two here below.
<p>
Levin continues to engage in a struggle for life's meaning in the face of death even after he is married. But, "thanks to his wife's presence," says Tolstoy, this struggle "did not drive him to despair:  in spite of death he felt the need for living and loving."  For his wife's presence signifies the presence of the sacred in his life, as it was invoked on the occasion of his marriage. Unlike Anna, who sought to be loved by Vronsky outside of marriage, Levin seeks to offer his love to the wife he has taken in holy matrimony, and that is what sustains him in life. Knowing his wife, he comes to know something of life's origin; moving toward life's origin, he moves toward a meaning in life that is stronger than death.
<p>
Through this love that links him to the origin of life, he joins with his wife to bear life into the world. Here too, of course, the figure of the child is crucial to the condition of the home and family. Contrary to Anna's disregard for her children, Levin sees in the birth of his child a revelation of something beyond the human. And so we read, "The birth of a son, which they promised him, but which he still could not believe in -- so extraordinary did it seem -- appeared to him on the one hand such an immense and therefore impossible happiness, and on the other hand such a mysterious event that the assumed knowledge of what was going to happen and, as a result of it, preparations as for something ordinary, something human beings themselves were responsible for, seemed scandalous and degrading to him."  Thus, upon the birth of his child -- if only for a moment -- his skepticism gives way to a deeper vision, to a higher vision, and a prayer comes to his lips in spite of himself, as though the prayer had a life of its own. All his doubts, says Tolstoy, "fell away, like dust, from his soul. To whom else was he to appeal, if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love to be?"  The vessel of this revelation?  A newborn babe.
<p>
This vision of a mystery that transcends the handiwork of humanity is precisely a vision of the family. The vision unfolds as the family emerges in a place where there had been two but there are now three. And it is the vision of the family that makes it possible for Levin to receive the meaning in life that he has sought all along, a meaning that is as essential to the soul as bread is to the body. Near the end of the novel he meets a peasant who offers him the key to what he had struggled for, expressed in deceptively simple terms:  Live for God, and not for yourself. At first these words seem so simple to Levin as to be meaningless. But then he thinks to himself, "Well?  Did I not understand those meaningless words?"  And he answers himself, "No, I understood them just as he understands them:  I understood them perfectly and better than I understand anything in life, and I have never in my life doubted it or could doubt it." 
<p>
And yet he does not fully grasp the truth of the peasant's words until he sees his wife and son nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Seeing their lives threatened, he sees what his own life is for. What does it mean to live for God and not for yourself?  It means living for your family and thereby creating a home through which the holy may enter life and instill it with meaning. As God breathed life into the first human being, the family breathes life into all humanity. Only where such a breath is drawn can dwelling happen. And only where dwelling happens do we approach a realm called home.
<p>

<b>Concluding Thoughts</b>
<p>
While the literary masterpieces we have considered are varied in their approach to home and family, they do have a few things in common. In all three cases, for example, the assault on home and family entails a violation of holy matrimony. Recall, for example, the suitors who invade the home of Odysseus, Edmond's designs on Regan and Goneril, and Anna Karenina's love affair. And we find that when the holiness of marriage is threatened, the holiness of human life is compromised:  The suitors plot to kill Telemachus, Goneril plans the murder of Cordelia, and Anna ends by killing herself.
<p>
In all three cases, moreover, the issue of a wife's fidelity is directly tied to the presence of the mother. Because Penelope remains faithful to Odysseus, she remains a mother to Telemachus; therefore, it is thanks to her that Odysseus has a home and family to return to. Anna Karenina cannot take up with Vronsky without abandoning her child Seryozha; in contrast to her betrayal we have Kitty's faithfulness to Levin, which ultimately makes it possible for Levin to realize what is most dear in life. And in Shakespeare's play the mother is absent altogether because the devotion of a wife to a husband is altogether absent; there the absence of the mother is symbolically manifested in Lear's alienation from the earth itself when he is turned over to the chaos of the stark elements.
<p>
Similarly, all three works address the role of the father as a teacher and a witness. Odysseus is able to restore the integrity of his home, which includes a return to his own father, because he has attested to the higher relation that home and family signify. When, as in the case of Lear, that testimony is absent, the home and family collapse; Lear's tragedy is that by the time he realizes who he is as a father, the consequences of his absence as a father are already in place. And in Tolstoy's novel we find that only when Levin becomes a father does there open up for him an avenue to the Most High enabling him to recognize his responsibility for what is most sacred here below.
<p>
All three of these masterpieces also bear witness to the importance of the child to the sanctity of home and family and to the meaning of life itself. Before he relates the trials of Odysseus, for example, Homer establishes the position of Telemachus as the son of Odysseus and as the heir to his wisdom. If Penelope makes it possible for Odysseus to return to a home established in the past, Telemachus receives a legacy that posits a future necessary to the family. In the case of Lear, the presence or absence of the child parallels the presence or absence of his own identity. Lear is who he is -- and therefore might become more than he is -- only through his relation to Cordelia. In <i>Anna Karenina</i>, we recall, Anna's child reveals to her a moral path that she is summoned to follow, and Levin's child shows him the way to salvation. Indeed, in all three of these works the child bears a salvific significance.
<P>
What does all of this tell us about our own condition and the salvation that we are all in need of?  In a word, it tells us that if we are not mothers, nothing has value; if we are not fathers, we ourselves are nothing; and if we have no children, everything is meaningless. And yet, as never before, the mother, father, and child are under massive assault in our society. As in the literary works we have considered, that assault begins with an assault on holy matrimony, which is an assault on the holy itself. Divorce rates, for instance, are staggering, and they are higher among people who live together before they get married than among those who do not. Why?  Because those who live together out of wedlock have no regard for the sanctity of marriage. 
<p>
Premarital and extramarital sex, moreover, is not only tolerated -- it is romanticized and is therefore encouraged. Sex, I have been told, is a way of "getting to know someone."  No longer, then, is the sexual relation understood to be an expression of a higher relation, whereby a husband and wife join with the Creator to bring life into the world. Indeed, the last thing that most people want when they engage in sex is to become a mother or a father. Therefore, the question raised in the sexual relation is not "How do I express my devotion to God through this relation to another human being?"  but rather "Am I protected?"  And yet the more we are concerned with this protection, the more we plunge into ruin.
<p>
Because the sexual relation is central to bearing life into the world, our views on sex are directly tied to the value we place on human life. And as sex becomes more casual, motherhood and fatherhood become more corrupt. Instead of viewing motherhood as a blessing, we view abortion as a right. Women who have babies and decide to be mothers by staying home with their children are taken to be either deprived or deficient and are made to feel that they have to apologize for some transgression. As for fathers, they are held to no standards at all. Many abandon their families altogether, and when fathers are absent communities collapse into a combination of lotus eaters and Cyclopians -- those among whom the life of the other human being means nothing.
<p>
I am not speaking only of city neighborhoods where most households are headed by single mothers. No, the entire land has taken on the aspect of the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There is no evidence more convincing or more terrible to support this than the fact that the most common form of death among children between 15 and 19 years of age is the death related to drugs and alcohol. This has come to be the case not because our children have failed to learn what we teach them, but because they have learned all too well and have followed our teachings to their logical conclusions. These are the teachings that regard the family as a social unit, and not as a center of life's sanctity; that regard the ego as the center of the universe, and not as the seat of responsibility to and for the other human being; and that take morality to be a cultural curiosity, and not a means of expressing our relation to the God who summons us to be moral.
<p>
As in the case of Odysseus, violence follows in the wake of the lotus. And, of course, violence in the streets finds its way into the home. It goes by the scandalous name of "domestic violence."  Domestic violence is not the cause of the breakdown of the family; it is the result of that breakdown. For domestic violence is the outcome of a loss of the sacred in life, and the family is the primary ground for the manifestation of what is sacred. A man who understands his relation to his wife to be an expression of a relation to the Most High is far less likely to beat her than a man who has no such understanding. A father who sees that his children are a blessing from God and the basis of all there is to hold dear is far less likely to abuse them than one who has no such insight.
<P>
But we shall remain blind to this understanding and insight as long as we send women into wars, give the nod to abortions on demand, grant divorces without grounds, romanticize adultery, and accord so-called homosexual marriage the same status as a marriage that can bring children into the world. Much more than the signs of changing times, these are the signs of the loss of meaning; much more than the manifestation of cultural evolution, they are a manifestation of cultural collapse. As Abraham Joshua Heschel once said, "We have bartered holiness for convenience, loyalty for success, wisdom for information, prayers for sermons, tradition for fashion."  Which amounts to saying:  We have traded the home for the void and the family for the abyss.
<p>
Cultural restoration not only begins at home, as Russell Kirk has pointed out; it begins with the restoration of the home and of the family that constitutes the home. If home and family are indeed among the permanent things, as the literature we have discussed indicates, they require a permanent vigilance. For the permanent things are the most precious things. And nothing is more fragile than what is most precious.

<h3>The Mystic Chords of Memory: Reclaiming American History</h3>
<b>By Wilfred M. McClay</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">The Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures</a>, Delivered December 
13, 1995
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am delighted to be with you this afternoon and to have a role in the Heritage Foundation's worthy 
project of commemorating Russell Kirk's many contributions to American intellectual life. My own 
task today is to explore the subject of historical consciousness in America -- a subject about which, 
strange to say, Russell Kirk actually did not write a great deal, at least not addressing the subject 
directly. But he didn't need to. His entire life and work were nothing less than an extended 
elaboration of that very theme. Historical consciousness seemed to have been infused into the air he 
breathed and mixed into the soil of the ancestral land in which he chose to live. No place or thing, 
however ordinary, was too humble for him to grant it the dignity of a story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One notices this historical tendency even in Kirk's language. It has a most peculiar lilt, which often 
charms and sometimes startles the reader with its unexpectedly fanciful and antique echoes. (As an 
example of the latter, I remember being shocked when I read Kirk describe a leading social critic as 
an exemplar of "defecated intellect" -- shocked, that is, until I looked the word up, and saw that 
Kirk used the word in an older and more etymologically informed sense than my own, strictly 
scatological understanding.) What struck many readers as mannered or affected diction in Kirk was 
actually something quite different. It was evidence of his strong conviction that words, like people, 
are living things, bearing living pasts deserving of recognition and respect. That was typical of him. 
He had the ability to make even the dullest things gleam with the luster of historical imagination. 
With all due respect to Governor John Engler, who inaugurated this series of lectures, who would 
have thought that Michigan could ever be made a name to conjure with?  Yet Kirk made his many 
readers curious to see his beloved "stump country" and to explore the tiny burg of Mecosta. 
Although his Gothic and Romantic tastes drew him to old European cathedrals, Roman ruins, and 
other such haunted sites, he was not prone to sigh, in the perennial complaint of American writers 
such as Hawthorne and Henry James, that America was too new or raw or commerce-minded to be 
the stuff of art. On the contrary, Kirk knew how to see monuments, and ruins, everywhere he 
looked. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What others called "junk" Kirk thought of as "cultural debris," which is a short way of saying that 
Kirk took a long view of the disorders of our contemporary American world, seeing them in light of 
the thousand follies and disorders that have come before us in the human procession. Historical 
consciousness gave him a broad, capacious vision, which always insisted that the civilization we 
enjoy has deep living roots. Those roots of American order extend back in time not only to 18th-
century Philadelphia, but further back, to London, Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem. Virtually 
everything he wrote testified to his intense awareness of the immanence, inescapability, and 
indispensability of the past, and not only the past of the previous generation or two, but the distant 
past -- the past of the Law and the Prophets, of Solon, Cicero, Augustine, the English constitution, 
Montesquieu, Burke, Lincoln. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's career, then, went against the American grain, and it did so in two different ways. In the first 
place, he was an intellectual genuinely at ease in America. He may have fancied himself a 
Bohemian Tory, but he was never that most tiresome of bores, "the alienated American 
intellectual," a restless species that grazes in herds of independent minds. He knew he was fortunate 
to live in a country free and prosperous enough to permit him a career as an independent writer, and 
he never forgot that fact. But at the same time, he was never an uncritical celebrant of American 
culture. He loved his country, but he did not idolize it. Instead, he held it accountable to a 
transcendent standard, against which he often found it seriously wanting. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In particular, Kirk lamented the deification of progress, the cult of absolute equality, the advance of 
the Leviathan state, the licentiousness of the autonomous self, the transvaluation of values, and 
other such modern abstractions that have transformed and eroded the American republic. While he 
vehemently opposed ideology in all its forms, including conservative ideology, he at the same time 
lamented Americans' fixation upon short-term, practical, problem-solving, results-oriented, and 
utility-maximizing thinking in place of a deeper reflection upon the proper ends of things. Kirk, 
then, was trying to do something characteristic of traditionalist conservatives: fight on two fronts at 
once. He was defending the American way of life against its cultured despisers -- while at the same 
time challenging many elements of that way of life by holding it up to its classical and Judeo-
Christian antecedents. He comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable -- and sometimes 
they were the same people. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk was not the only one to act this way. Many American conservatives feel caught in a similar 
bind. Most of them are dyed-in-the-wool patriots, and yet they wonder whether the very America 
they so ardently defend is only too willing to sell its birthright for a mess of pottage -- or, for the 
more ideologically inclined, a pot of message. Even here at Heritage, which is a very busy, worldly 
place, teeming with clever people and clever ideas addressing themselves to the immediate concrete 
policy questions and debates of the day, one is likely to encounter that very American question: Of 
what use is historical consciousness? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The dangers inherent in this characteristically American attitude are wonderfully illuminated by a 
joke I heard the other day, which with your indulgence I will retell -- not only because it bears 
directly upon the point, but because storytelling seems a very Kirkean way to get at a Kirkean truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tale begins with a tourist, wandering through the back alleys of San Francisco's Chinatown, 
where he comes upon a little antique shop, filled with curious pieces of statuary and other art 
objects. What especially catches his eye is a beautifully wrought, life-size bronze statue of a rat. He 
asks the elderly shopkeeper for the rat's price. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The rat costs twelve dollars," says the shopkeeper, "and it will be a thousand dollars more for the 
story behind it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Well, you can keep the story, old man," responds the tourist, "but I'll take the rat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After buying the rat, the tourist leaves the store, carrying his newly acquired statue under his arm. 
As he crosses the street in front of the store, he sees two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall 
into step behind him. He looks nervously over his shoulder and starts to walk faster. Soon more rats 
appear and begin to follow him. In a few minutes rats are coming out of every sewer, basement, 
vacant lot, and landfill, forming themselves into swarms and packs and massing in step behind him. 
People on the street point and shout at him as the pursuing rats force him into a trot, and then a dead 
run. But no matter how fast he runs, the rats, now squeaking and squealing grotesquely, stay right 
behind him. By the time he reaches the water's edge, the line of rats trailing him extends back for 
twelve city blocks. Finally, in desperation, the tourist leaps as high as he can up onto a lamppost 
and hugs it by one arm while, with the other, he flings the bronze rat far out into the waters of San 
Francisco Bay. To his amazement, the hordes of rats race right by him and follow the statue, 
surging over the breakwater and leaping into the Bay -- and then promptly drowning. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whereupon the tourist hurries back up to the antique shop. When he appears at the door, the 
shopkeeper smiles knowingly and says, "Ah, yes, sir. So now you've seen what the statue can do, 
and you've come back to find out the story?" 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No, no, no," replies the tourist excitedly. "Now I want to buy a bronze statue of a lawyer!"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There's nothing more rich with cultural meaning than humor. Clearly the main point of this joke is 
its hardwired animus toward lawyers. But there's another point, too. The tourist in this story is a 
man interested only in immediate results, and things, and in what those things can be deployed to 
do. He couldn't care less about "knowing the story."  And the punch line assumes that we pretty 
much agree with him. If the statue eradicates lawyers, who cares how it works?  A picture may be 
worth a thousand words, but no story is worth a thousand bucks. Such is the characteristic 
American attitude toward the past -- You can keep your story, old man; I'll take the rat. But the 
tourist makes a completely unwarranted universalistic assumption -- that all bronze statues from 
this shop will have the same effect. How can he know that, until he has heard "the story?"  His lack 
of interest in "the story" is not only philistine; it is foolish. Hasn't he learned that you get what you 
pay for?  Yet this is the sort of mechanistic attitude, which has rightly been called "crackpot 
realism," that Kirk always had to battle -- as do all of us who care about the American past and 
about the state of our historical consciousness. For you can't really appreciate the statuary of 
American political and institutional life, or know the value of American liberty and prosperity, 
unless you pay the price of learning the story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, we also now have another, very different, problem: that the older "story" of the 
American past is increasingly regarded, especially by our academic historians, as nothing but a 
story of rats, which is another way of saying that the struggle to reclaim historical consciousness in 
contemporary America has to occur on two different fronts, too. It is one thing to believe the past is 
unworthy of our attention. It's another thing to assert that it is unworthy of our respect. We now 
confront both of these attitudes at once, and it is hard to say which is the more threatening. It is 
alarming to have our suspicion confirmed, most recently by a Department of Education survey of 
22,000 American schoolchildren, that our young people are learning next to nothing about 
American history. But it is equally alarming to contemplate what passes for historical study in the 
academy, the arena in which our leaders are educated. There the reign of identity politics and 
political correctness has, if anything, only fortified its hold in recent years. It sometimes seems that, 
to paraphrase the old blues song, if it wasn't for bad history, we wouldn't have no history at all. 
Indeed, it is a melancholy thing to reflect, as I sometimes do, that the only consolation to be had for 
the execrable courses our students endure is the fact that they won't remember them after they 
graduate. Unfortunately, though, they may not remember any of the good stuff either. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It's time, then, to recover some fairly basic truths. Historical consciousness is to civilized society 
what memory is to individual identity. One cannot say who or what one is -- one can't say one is 
anyone, or anything, at all -- without some selective retention of experience and source of 
continuity. One cannot learn, use language, pass on knowledge, raise offspring, or even dwell in 
society without the aid of memory. Without memory there are no workable rules of conduct, no 
standard of justice, no basis for restraining passions, no sense of the connection between an action 
and its consequences. There can be no sense of the future, as a moment in time we know will come, 
because we remember that other tomorrows have come, too. And there can be no recognition of the 
sacred, no act of consecration or devotion to the unseen -- for nothing exists but the proximate and 
the sensate. A culture without memory will necessarily be barbarous, no matter how 
technologically advanced and sophisticated, because the daily drumbeat of artificial sensations and 
amplified events will drown out all other sounds, including the strains of an older music.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our day, even the academic study of history has begun to yield to such barbarism. For an 
increasing number of younger historians, the whole point of studying the past is to "prove" that all 
our inherited institutions, beliefs, conventions, and normative values are arbitrary -- mere "social 
constructions" in the service of ignoble power -- and are therefore utterly without legitimacy or 
authority. In this view, it is absurd to imagine that the study of the past could have any purpose 
beyond serving the immediate needs of the present -- and anyone who thinks otherwise is either 
disingenuous or stupid. The very idea of being enlarged or drawn out of ourselves by encountering 
the strangeness of the past -- and the strange familiarity of the past -- now seems quite beside the 
point. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's view of the matter was different, first of all because, for him, the past was a land of 
enchantment, pervaded with flitting shadows and ghostly presences. But it was also the source of 
what little real solidity there is to be found in the world. The study of the past, he believed, should 
cause us to recognize the ways that the past has authority over us. For historical consciousness, as 
he understood it, is not merely an awareness of the past and of one's own connection to it. It is the 
cultivation of respect for what cannot be seen, for the invisible sources of meaning and authority in 
our lives -- for the formative agents and foundational principles that, although no longer tangible, 
have made possible what is worthy in our own day. To borrow from the language of religious faith, 
the tutelage of historical consciousness teaches us what it means to walk by faith, and not only by 
sight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We see, then, that historical knowledge and historical consciousness are two very different things; 
and the acquisition of historical consciousness, properly understood, will have to be something 
different from the academic study of history -- though the latter does not preclude the former. The 
acquisition of historical consciousness means learning the discipline of memory, which is far more 
than a matter of personal memory -- though that is, of course, where it begins and ends. Historical 
consciousness means learning to appropriate into our own moral imagination, and learning to be 
guided by, the distilled memories of others, the stories of things we never experienced firsthand. It 
means learning to make these things our own, learning to look out at the world we experience 
through their filter, learning to feel the living presence of the past inhering in the seeming inertness 
of the world as it is given to us. Of course, discernment between and among memories is of great 
importance. Not all are worth preserving, and not all are reliable. Here is where the practice of 
professional historians has been especially valuable, in preserving so much that would otherwise be 
lost and in ferreting out the evidence for certain propositions while uncovering the faulty basis for 
others. But the advocate of historical consciousness is likely to give preference to those memories 
whose importance and reliability have been established not merely by a select committee of the 
American Historical Association, but also by the passage of time. To repeat, historical knowledge 
and historical consciousness are different things, and the latter can never become the province of a 
historical priesthood.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An outside observer cannot easily tell when an individual's vision of reality itself has been 
transformed. No one else can see with another person's eyes, feel with another person's heart. But 
let us imagine a visitor to the battlefield at Gettysburg who knows the history of that battle and war, 
knows the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and knows something of subsequent American 
history -- not only knows these things, but has digested and internalized this knowledge. That 
visitor will experience something very different on his visit from what an uninformed eight-year-
old child will see. What the educated observer sees when he gazes at the modest grassy bump of 
Cemetery Ridge will be, in a sense, more real than what the unimpressed young child sees, even 
though they are looking at the same thing. Such an example undercuts the positivistic notion that 
we live in a world of inert facts to which we impute values. Insofar as we are historical, 
remembering creatures, we inevitably participate in the meanings that we apprehend -- a mysterious 
form of participant knowledge that is, as John Lukacs argues, something very different from mere 
subjectivity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Part of what makes our visitor different, too, is the fact that he comes to Gettysburg as a part of 
what sociologists call a "community of memory."  His reactions are not determined merely by his 
idiosyncratic impressions, though he may well have had some, or by his extensive knowledge, 
however detailed it may be. Instead, he is one of many people who remember what happened in 
that place, and in some way he is connected to all of them, to all who are bound together by 
remembrance of that story. In the end, communities and nation-states are constituted and sustained 
by such shared memories -- by stories of foundation, conflict, and perseverance. The leap of 
imagination and faith, from the thinness and unreliability of our individual memory to the richness 
of collective memory, that is the leap of civilized life; and the discipline of collective memory is the 
task not only of the historian, but of every one of us. Historical consciousness draws us out of a 
narrow preoccupation with the present and with our "selves," and ushers us into another, larger 
world -- a public world that "cultures" us, in all the senses of that word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historical consciousness is, then, part of the cement that holds America together and makes us 
willing to strive and sacrifice on her behalf. One might think of the Gettysburg Address as an 
exemplary text in this respect, since it sought to give meaning to the suffering of the present 
precisely by reference to the visionary sacrifices of the Founders. Instead of deconstructing the past 
in the name of the present, it reinterpreted the present by reference to the past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even better example, however, is Lincoln's first inaugural address, from which the haunting 
phrase in my title, "The Mystic Chords of Memory," is taken. To understand what sort of appeal 
Lincoln was making with these words, we need to recall the setting in which the address was given 
in March of 1861. In the wake of Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860 without the support of 
a single Southern state, seven states from the Deep South had already left the Union, and the crucial 
border states were on the verge of doing so as well. The Union that Lincoln so greatly cherished 
seemed to be dissolving before his eyes. With this inaugural speech, Lincoln began his attempt to 
counter this disintegration. He made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, the union of states 
under the Constitution could not be broken, for it was meant to be a perpetual union, rather than 
being revocable at the whim of a single state or combination of states. The speech takes a variety of 
turns, offering legal, political, moral, and prudential reasons for its case. Its tone is by turns both 
conciliatory and stern. But with its final clinching paragraph -- added (it is said) at the suggestion of 
William Henry Seward -- the speech soars to immortal heights: 
<p><blockquote>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. 
Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The 
mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to 
every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus 
of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our 
nature.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a rich, complex, intricately balanced sentence, built around a delicate musical image. The 
"chords of memory" will eventually be "touched" by our better angels -- one can almost envision 
them plucking the strings of a harp -- and once those memories have been made vibrant, they will 
elicit other sympathetic vibrations, the intervals and overtones that energize and "swell the chorus 
of the Union."  These are "mystic" chords, which means that they must come from a divine, 
mysterious source; and these mystic chords somehow have the power to link "every battlefield and 
patriot grave" to "every living heart and hearthstone" in the land. When they are sounded, the 
mystic chords have the power to connect past and present, inner and outer, private and public, 
household and polity, locality and nationality in a single harmonious whole. During times of 
confusion and crisis, such as the nation was then facing, it could find composure and direction in 
recalling the Spirit of '76 and the Founders' heroic sacrifices. Citizens will draw strength and 
comfort from associating their love of the nation with the same warm devotion that attaches them to 
their own hearths.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Lincoln, though, the battlefields and patriot graves deserved our reverence not simply for 
sentimental reasons, or out of reverence for our ancestors' great sacrifices, but because of the cause 
for which they sacrificed. It would not have been enough had they merely died for the 19th-century 
equivalent of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They died, as Lincoln expressed it in the 
Gettysburg Address, in order that government of the people, by the people, and for the people "shall 
not perish from the earth."  They died, he asserted, to sustain the possibility of a nation "dedicated 
to the proposition that all men are created equal."  The mystic chords of memory, then, also draw us 
back to first principles and to an understanding of America as a nation self-consciously founded, at 
a distinct moment in time, with particular ends in view. From this perspective, the United States is a 
nation with a uniquely creedal sense of national identity -- a nation, as Chesterton put it, with the 
soul of a church. In this view, one becomes an American less by <i>descent</i> than by 
<i>consent</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, Lincoln's oratory offered two different effects of invoking the mystic chords of memory -- 
first, as reminders of an inherited way of life and, second, as reminders of a set of universal 
propositions. This duality is at the heart of a longstanding debate about the nature of American 
institutions, and indeed it now presents itself at the heart of contemporary debates about 
multiculturalism, immigration, and national identity. Is America a transnational nation, founded 
upon certain abstract and universalistic principles which it both exemplifies and promotes?  Or is it 
a civilization built upon a series of specifically Western European, and largely British, historical 
accretions with language, laws, customs, conventions, institutions, and belief systems arising 
organically out of those particular legacies?  Such questions are exceedingly difficult to answer 
with finality, and the balance between them may remain contested for as long as the United States 
stays in business as a country. It is hard to imagine either one of the perspectives they represent 
ever being excluded from our sense of national identity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now let me turn to the possibility of "reclaiming" the American past, alluded to in my subtitle. 
What is meant by this?  First, a recognition that genuine historical consciousness ought to be the 
common possession of all. Quite simply, a democratic nation needs a democratic history. By this I 
do not mean the sort of fashionable history that ignores politics and constitutions and intellectual 
elites and insists upon viewing the past exclusively "from the bottom up."  There is in fact a kind of 
unconscious scorn buried in the assumptions behind such writing -- as if political and intellectual 
history is beyond the common people's means, and as if no one could be expected to be interested 
in anything that does not involve them directly. Surely, however, such assumptions are false. 
Instead, we need to encourage serious historical writing that is sufficiently accessible to shape and 
deepen the public mind. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here, too, one will need to battle on two fronts, challenging both the ignorance of the public and the 
malfeasances of the scholarly establishment. The American public has to want to reclaim its 
history, and it will have to be willing to work at it and overcome the tendencies so well illustrated 
by the rat joke. But that willingness will come far more easily if something can be done about the 
combination of political ideology and professionalization that has enveloped historical writing in 
recent years. The dangers of ideology are fairly obvious; but the dangers of exclusive 
professionalization are nearly as great. Though the professionalization of historical writing has been 
a source of many great improvements in our historical knowledge, it has wounded our historical 
consciousness. The time may have come to rethink the matter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent dust-ups over the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian and the National History 
Standards are revealing in this respect. In both cases, the American public reacted decisively, and 
negatively, to what it saw as efforts by anointed experts to hijack the American past and transpose 
the mystic chords into a minor key. What has been most notable in both episodes has been the 
surprised and outraged reactions of the historical profession (or more precisely, of its spokesmen). 
The responses have run the gamut: astonishment, shock, fury, wounded dismay, dripping 
condescension. And I regret to say that even now I do not think my colleagues quite grasp what has 
happened to them. It has long been fashionable in academe to talk about who "owns" history and to 
make very democratic noises whenever the matter is under discussion. But all the while, it seems as 
if the professional historians have not doubted that <i>they</i> own it, or at least deserve to, and if 
one could take control of the American Historical Association and other professional organizations, 
one could transform history in a manner nearer to one's heart. They now have discovered that what 
flies in the hermetic world of academic scholarship will not fly with the great American public. In 
the Enola Gay episode in particular, the use of a public, and publicly funded, commemorative 
exhibition to put forward a revisionist interpretation of the American war effort in 1941-45 crossed 
a line, and the public would not tolerate it. And they were right not to.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me hasten to add that I am not saying history ought to be all comforting myth. Nor am I 
suggesting that historians should never challenge conventional wisdom. On the contrary; we badly 
need such challenges. But surely this does not mean historians enjoy <i>carte blanche</i> 
protection against being themselves challenged in turn, particularly when they choose to address 
sensitive public issues. Indeed, the public has a responsibility to offer such counterchallenges, 
whenever appropriate, to test and ventilate the findings of academicians. That is part of what it 
means to have a democratic history and democratic discourse. Yet it was precisely the mounting of 
such challenges that most offended the historical clerisy: The <i>effrontery</i> of all those World 
War II veterans, thinking they knew something important about the war that had escaped the 
attention of the Smithsonian's baby-boomer curators!  The future may well bring many, many more 
such acts of effrontery as the public's patience with the follies of higher education wanes -- and, 
may it be hoped, as their interest in reclaiming the past waxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It will, however, take more than challenging academic revisionism to accomplish much along these 
lines. The two fronts I spoke of before symbolize two problems that are, in fact, mutually 
reinforcing. Revisionism would have little power in a country that was less ignorant of its past. The 
docu-slanders of Oliver Stone would be laughed out of court. So would the childish fantasies of 
<i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Hence, in engaging the second front, we must resist the temptation to 
blame others, to play the game of anti-anti-Americanism, and instead face up to our weaknesses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this connection, it seems to me that Russell Kirk was right to stress that technological progress 
and the unhindered market are not the answer to everything. Notwithstanding their many blessings 
and benefits, one cannot ignore the pathologies and casualties they engender -- and the loss of 
historical consciousness has been one of them. We live in a culture of such ceaseless, turbulent 
change -- economic, social, technological -- that for many of us it seems almost ridiculous, and 
certainly quixotic, to be speaking of chains of continuity linking generations past with generations 
to come. Indeed, the emerging postmodern understanding of the self counsels that it is fruitless, and 
even unhealthy, to seek continuity and consistency within one's self. Better to be a protean self, 
hanging loose, refashioning one's identity as changing circumstances dictate. Postmodernism is 
itself symptomatic, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a pervasive tendency within our society. It 
may be crackpot realism of the worst sort to think we can go on this way very much longer, 
particularly if it is true that the social problem at the bottom of all others -- the disintegration of the 
family -- is ultimately a problem of discontinuity between the generations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our popular culture conspires in a thousand ways to reinforce our sense of discontinuity and 
generational isolation. Consider, to take but one example, what has happened to professional sports 
in our time. When I was a boy, professional sports formed a central part of my life. They provided a 
tremendous source of common experience linking me not only with my own friends, but with my 
father and mother and members of their generation. I had a typical American boy's fascination with 
baseball statistics and delighted in my then-extensive knowledge of them. I did not realize it at the 
time, but those statistics were also a source of historical consciousness. For to enter seriously into 
the world of baseball statistics is to become aware of a world much larger and longer than your 
own, to see all major-league baseball players competing in one great continuum of slugging 
percentages, earned-run averages, and stolen bases. One becomes a kind of historian. I learned to 
care not only about the active players I followed, like Boog Powell and Brooks Robinson, but about 
long-gone players my parents had followed, like Dizzy Dean, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio; and that 
was a wonderful bond between us. I will always have a soft spot for the St. Louis Cardinals, even 
though I grew up following the Baltimore Orioles, because the Cardinals had been my parents' team 
when they were young. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I do not have any such soft spot, however, for the Indianapolis Colts. Nor do I expect to care much 
about the Baltimore Browns football team. When I was a boy, I was well aware that professional 
sports was a business. But I could never have imagined the degree to which it is now little else. We 
now have not only the free agency of players, but the free agency of franchises; and the rules, 
materials, schedules, game sites, players -- everything about the game -- are considered plastic and 
subject to revision. This is the triumph of utility-maximizing over all else, and I cannot help but 
think professional sports will ultimately be undone by it. In my own case, there is no magic left, 
and I am relieved that my own son has no interest in professional sports. Another chain of 
continuity broken.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even so, there will always remain the irreducible lure of seeing excellence in performance, a 
healthy antidote to the cult of victimization and self-pity that has swept our culture. But one cannot 
feel that lure without first having a consciousness of the larger historical context which so engaged 
me as a boy, that universe of statistics and records. After Cal Ripken, Jr., broke Lou Gehrig's 
consecutive-game record this past year, he spoke some very simple but hauntingly appropriate 
words which captured this fact perfectly. As you may remember, there was some feeling that 
Ripken ought not break the record, that to do so robbed Gehrig of his distinction. But Ripken knew 
that the opposite was true: that he best honored Gehrig by competing with him. If Gehrig were 
looking down on this, Ripken said, he would not be thinking about the record; he would instead 
reflect that here was "an example of what is good and right about the great American game."  It was 
a simple, wonderful statement -- one that, in its own way, sounds the mystic chords of memory, 
stretching from every batter's box and bleacher seat to every hearth and TV room in this broad land. 
It recognizes that a determination to achieve and a reverence for the past are by no means opposites. 
But of course, Ripken would never have used the words he did had there not been so much that is 
neither good nor right about the great American game in its present condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have delved into the example of baseball, but I could have picked any number of features of our 
popular culture -- our popular music, our extreme geographical mobility, our disintegrating 
families, our declining churches and voluntary associations, our mania for the bulldozer and the 
wrecking ball. Indeed, I think there is a growing recognition of these problems across the 
intellectual spectrum. It is important, however, to formulate the problem rightly. It is not the 
<i>commodification</i> of all things (to use a trendy, overused word) but the <i>fungibility</i> of 
all things, which is to say their <i>impermanence</i>, that afflicts us -- the fungibility of 
marriages, lovers, jobs, habitations, even genders. It is not just that all things are for sale, but that in 
the process all things are being made commensurable and interchangeable, and therefore ultimately 
homogeneous. An odd goal for a world that professes to prize diversity but is in fact frightened by 
it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of which should give added force in our minds to Kirk's permanent emphasis, in season and out 
of season, upon "the permanent things."  But it should also remind us that the recovery of historical 
consciousness is not merely an intellectual matter, a matter of rereading the great books and 
reemphasizing the roots of American order, as Kirk called them. It is also a very concrete matter, a 
matter of taking stock of the way we live, of what our pastimes and pleasures, our families and our 
marriages, our habits and our aspirations all say about our sense of connection to the past -- and, 
therefore, about ourselves. Karl Marx insisted that the past did not deserve our reverence; it was 
nothing but a snare. "The tradition of all the dead generations," he declaimed, "weighs like a 
nightmare on the brain of the living."  He was wrong about that, as about so much else. But too 
many of us live, whether we know it or not, as if we believed he was right. Perhaps it is time for 
that to change.

<P>
<H2>Third Generation</H2>
<hr><p>

The term Third Generation describes a generation of conservatives whose primary purpose in Washington is to roll back the liberal policies of the last 60 years. First Generation conservatives were the intellectuals, including Russell Kirk, Bill Buckley, and James Burnham. Far removed from power, these intellects drew the philosophical map for later generations. 
<p>
The crushing defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 sparked the Second Generation of conservatives -- men and women dedicated to putting conservatives in office.  The Third Generation of conservatives emerged from Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980.  Liberals, discredited intellectually by the First Generation, and defeated politically by the Second, were dismayed as swarms of young conservative activists came to Washington to chip away at their centralized power.
<p>
In January of 1984, The Heritage Foundation initiated the Third Generation project to identify young conservative leaders and bring them together in an informal setting to discuss the issues challenging them today and in the future.  Since then, Third Generation members have met every other Wednesday night for lectures and refreshments in Heritage's Lehrman Auditorium. 
<p>
While the initial goal of the Third Generation project was, and is, to identify and network young conservatives, its importance to the success of conservative policies runs much deeper. As a speaker said several years ago, "the central mission of the Third Generation is to continue to build the lines of communication between the various interests within our movement and develop a set of signals so that we can all move in one direction, to accomplish a common objective the rebuilding of America along the principles established by this country's founders."

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?

*Grade contingent on permanent repeal of the current federal income tax
<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.  
<P><i>See Karen Kerrigan's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-15-5.html">Repeal of the Davis Bacon Act</a>", or Raymond Keating's "<a href="/sbsc/reg1-5.html">Repeal the Davis Bacon Act</a>" for more information.</i>
<P>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;
<P>
Send a letter to the following Senators and Congressman expressing your support of the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act:<p>

<a href="/sbsc/l-ic-gephardt.html">Minority Leader Richard Gephardt</a><br>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Minimum Wage</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.  
<P><i>See Grant Maloy's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-22-5.html">President Clinton's Proposal to Increase the Minimum Wage</a>" for more information.</i>
<P>
Send a letter to the following Senators and Congressman expressing your opposition to an increase of the minimum wage:<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
When small business owners, entrepreneurs and concerned taxpayers take part in the lobbying process, our efforts to reform America's fiscal policies are enhanced.  And yet, many people say that writing letters to Congress to express your concern is a waste of time -- this belief is dead wrong.
<P>
Members of Congress spend most of their time trying to gauge their constituents concerns.  For this reason, congressional offices record the number of constituent responses (letters, faxes, email, mail) to pending and current issues.  Furthermore, congressional staff read and respond to correspondence.  SBSC encourages you to take the time to contact Members of Congress.  
<P>
In order to expedite the process of voicing your concerns, we have posted letters to send to your Congressman and issue descriptions of a few "hot" small business issues.  (We will update the 'hot' issues regularly.)  We suggest that if you decide to send a letter, send it on business letterhead (letterhead grants the issue more attention).  If you have any questions pertaining to contacting members of Congress, or if you would like to see other types of letters posted, please contact SBSC's Christian Cali at 1-800-233-7526 or 202-785-0238.
<p>

Should you decide to send your Congressman or Senator a letter, 
the proper address for Members of Congress is as follows:
<P>
The Honorable -----------------
<br>United States House of Representatives
<br>Washington, DC  20515
<P>
OR
<P>
The Honorable ------------------
<br>United States Senate
<br>Washington, DC  20510
<P>
(Or call your Representative or Senator at 202-224-3121 to voice your opinion or to obtain the fax numbers of your elected officials.)

	"While organizers of President Clinton's second inaugural have touted [the] celebration as smaller and less expensive than the 1993 extravaganza, the cost borne by taxpayers will be the highest ever, according to White House records. . . .
<P>
	"[A]ccording to budgets provided by the White House and Congress—and not including the undisclosed inaugural budget of the Secret Service—the public cost is at least $12.7 million. That is a 27 per cent increase over the taxpayer tab in 1993."

	"Georgetown University's abandoning of the requirement that English majors study at least two authors among Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton—which drew criticism and prompted a teach-in last year—is now the norm, a new study by the National Alumni Forum finds.
<P>
	"Two-thirds of the 67 colleges and universities responding to the forum's survey submitted requirements and course lists for English majors that indicate required courses on the great writers are falling by the wayside.
<P>
	"In their place, courses proliferate on popular-culture topics, like 'The Gangster Film' (Georgetown), 'Melodrama and Soap Opera' (Duke University), and '20th-Century American Boxing Fiction and Film' (Dartmouth College)."

	"Last year, when World War II hero Bob Dole was a candidate for the Republican nomination for president, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point wanted to invite him to a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Europe.
<P>
 
	"The academy superintendent even prepared a letter inviting Mr. Dole to not only speak, but to lead a parade, in his honor, of 4,000 cadets. Mr. Dole, who received advance word of the invitation, began drafting remarks, focusing mostly on his wartime experiences. 
<P>
	"As required, West Point's invitation was sent to the Pentagon for approval by the secretary of defense. It was denied.
<P> 
	"Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman—not Defense Secretary William J. Perry—took credit for the rejection. It was against regulations for the news media to accompany presidential candidates on military bases, he explained. 
<P>
	"Mr. Dole could visit West Point, but only alone. 
<P>
	"At the invitation of Mr. Perry, Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian—the architect of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989—arrives today for a 10-day visit in the United States.
<P> 
	"While here, Gen. Chi will tour several major U.S. military bases, including the Navy base at Norfolk, Fort Hood in Texas and the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii.
<P> 
	"Asked this week if the Pentagon had any reservations about rolling out the red carpet for someone who had unleashed tanks and troops against unarmed civilians, Mr. Bacon curtly replied: 'The answer to the question is No.' "

<blockquote>



"Barbara Coe, a leading proponent of immigration reform in California, was threatened with legal action by the Justice Department, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and immigrant advocacy groups for 'intimidating voters' on Election Day.
<P> 
	"Her crime? Distributing fliers that proclaimed: 'Only citizens can vote! Violators will be prosecuted!'
<P>
	"Latino groups saw her campaign as a blatant, racist effort to intimidate legitimate voters, many of whom were new citizens casting their first votes. But Mrs. Coe, 62, a Huntington Beach grandmother, said she felt the fliers were necessary to combat voter fraud after hearing from Hispanic members of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform, which she founded and chairs. . . .
<P>
	"In her view, the problem is twofold. Many immigrants are unaware that noncitizens cannot vote. Others, however, 'know it's against the law, but they don't care. They know there's no prosecution. There are no safeguards,' she said. 
<P>
	"She already has obtained a list of 18 illegal immigrants who voted, compiled by a social worker on duty at a local polling place, she said. . . .
<P>
	"An official from the Justice Department's civil-rights division called and interviewed her for more than an hour about complaints they'd received about her fliers. . . .
<P>
	"Then the Orange County registrar of voters called. 'She was just ballistic,' Mrs. Coe recalled. 'She said, If I get one complaint of voter intimidation, I'm going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.'
<p>
	"Likewise, California Secretary of State Bill Jones put her on notice that he would not tolerate any intimidation activities. 'Interfering with any individual's right to vote . . . is a crime,' he wrote." . . .

"We've seen Gary Aldrich's name on the best-seller list for several months now. Obviously he's raking in the dough with his book <I>Unlimited Access: An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House</I>. Think again. In fact, if the White House has its way, Mr. Aldrich may never see a dime in book royalties. 'I put all I own on the line to expose the criminal behavior and discredited security procedures in the Clinton White House,' Mr. Aldrich writes in a public appeal for donations. 'Now, my wife, Nina, and I and our three young children could lose everything. That's right, everything.' Attorney General Janet Reno, the former FBI agent writes, is deciding whether to prosecute him and confiscate the proceeds of his book, as the FBI recommends. . . .'Even now, the Clinton Administration lawyers are threatening to tie up all my assets and keep me in court for six years or more,' Mr. Aldrich writes in his letter. He says he's already spent nearly $100,000 in legal fees, exhausting his life savings fighting lawyers from the FBI, Justice Department, and White House."

To date, more than 30 children have been killed by air-bag deployment, many of them in low-speed accidents, and there is mounting evidence that these devices may endanger certain adults as well. The children's deaths are not merely a tragic side effect; air bags kill more kids under age 10 than they save."

<blockquote>
	"The Young America's Foundation of Herndon, Va., has published 'Comedy and tragedy,' a list of some of the courses available at the nation's institutions of higher learning. . . .
<P>
	"Not surprisingly, some of the course descriptions that standout, even in this amazing list, come from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, locally called Zoo Mass, where the education department offers three different courses on 'Special Issues in Education,' including two fairly recent concerns of the left, 'Handicapism—Dynamics of Handicapism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' 'Heterosexism—Dynamics of Heterosexism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' and third, that timeworn leftist obsession, 'Classism—Dynamics of Classism on Personal and Institutional Levels.'
<P>
	"But from the University of California at Santa Cruz comes the scariest offering. A Big Brother—or should we say, Big Sister-minded education department presents students with Education 189: 'Monitoring Girls for Science and Math Equity: This six-credit, multiple-term course provides opportunities for women students from any discipline to mentor girls in local K–12 classrooms. Mentors are trained to promote equity in science, math, and technology.' Gifted boys had better learn to keep quiet or face fierce reprimand."
<P>

<blockquote>

	"Officials of a California public-school system think black pupils who speak 'black English' should qualify for federal bilingual-education funds because they speak an authentic language other than English.
<P>
	"The Oakland Board of Education's Task Force on the Education of African-Americans already has agreed that the nonstandard English dialect dubbed 'Ebonics' is a bona-fide language.
<P>
	"In Ebonics—an old little-used term that grew out of a 1973 conference of educators, researchers, and psychologists concerned about the language skills of black students—speakers says, for instance, 'I been done walk' instead 'I have walked.' "

	"Florida prison doors will swing wide open for 445 murderers, sex offenders, kidnappers, and child abusers beginning today after a state Supreme Court restored time off for good behavior for the state's most violent offenders, prison officials said. Attorney General Bob Butterworth said he'll appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but by then hundreds of inmates will have been released. Officials are trying to determine who will be freed immediately. The pending releases have generated protests from the public. 'We've done everything we can to keep them locked up,' Corrections Department spokeswoman Debbie Buchanan said. 'We don't have any choice. Our hands are tied.' "

<h2>External Relations Department</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Founded in January 1995, the External Relations department handles Heritage's outreach to the business community, to other policy organizations, and to the nation's governors and state officials. 
<p>
External Relations is headed by Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew Gayner</a>, who directs department activities with the assistance of his managers: Bridgett Wagner, director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/business.html">Business Relations</a>; <a href="/heritage/staff/atwood.htm">Tom Atwood</a>, director of Coalition Relations; and the Project on Federalism and the States director, <a href="/heritage/staff/seay.htm">Doug Seay</a>.
<p>
To reach their target audiences, Gayner and his staff  sponsor Washington Policy Roundtables, bi-monthly forums for Washington-based corporate representatives; the Physicians Council, a coalition of doctors who advocate health care reform based on consumer choice and competition; the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>, Heritage's networking arm to other public policy groups in the U. S. and abroad; and <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">The Project on Federalism and the States</a> which works to directly involve governors and state and local government officials in national policy decisions.
<p>
Gayner also directs Heritage's Corporate Associates, a program of conferences, briefings, and special publications for the Foundation's major corporate donors; co-sponsors the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, a coalition of business and public policy leaders who advise Heritage on trade issues; and hosts bi-annual National Security Symposiums for the defense industry.  In addition, External Relations hosts monthly working group meetings with congressional staff and provides private briefings for business executives at Heritage and at corporate headquarters.

<h3>November, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><h3> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
</h3></CENTER><HR>
<P>
<dd>	Consider the many conservative policy proposals which have been enacted recently, or are on your "wish list." Think about the tremendous popular support many of these plans enjoy. . . .Then realize that the courts have overturned some of these programs already and may well derail numerous others. 
<P>
<dd>
	The combination of litigious, liberal advocacy groups and a judiciary too often willing to make law, rather than interpret the Constitution threatens to negate many of the gains conservatives have made in the war of ideas and at the ballot box. As soon as a program such as school choice or the California Civil Rights Initiative passes, a lawsuit is immediately filed to prevent its implementation. 
<P>
<dd>
	What we seem to get in many cases is a tyranny of judges -- <I>de facto</I> rule by jurists whose power is unchecked and who see fit to mold society to suit their own personal concepts of justice. Most often, this judicial activism reinforces the reigning liberal orthodoxy which has taken hold of American legal institutions.
<P>
<dd>
	As conservatives prepare to wage many crucial battles in the courts, the Federalist Society has built a network designed to overcome legal abuses and to return America to a legal system which operates according to the design of the founders.
<P>
<dd>
	The Federalist Society advances traditional legal principles such as limited, constitutional government; individual freedom and responsibility; traditional values; and the rule of law. Our 22,000 lawyers, law students, academics, public officials, and other concerned citizens actively forward these ideals locally and nationally.

<P>
<dd>	The Society's 145 Student Division chapters at law schools across the country and 60 Lawyers Division chapters in major legal centers provide us with a grass-roots community presence nationwide.
	<P>
<dd>The combination of our strong local base and our national stature allows the Federalist Society to promote the serious inquiry which generates solutions to vital legal and policy questions. Our members are increasingly involved in every stage of the public policy process from recognizing political opportunities to building intellectual and academic support to winning legislative debates. 
<P>
<dd>	We aim to involve in the public policy discussion Citizen-Lawyers who will fight the legal and policy battles crucial to our principles. Today, there is much of this work to be done.
<P>
<dd>
	The following list of activities highlights some of the ways in which the Federalist Society is forwarding its goals:
<P>
<dd>
	Our <b>E.L. Wiegand Practice Groups</b> create a national network of active attorneys dedicated to traditional legal principles. The 15 topics covered by the Practice Groups include: Civil Rights, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Environmental Law, Free Speech, Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Religious Liberties. By mobilizing our members in this manner, we will have a large impact on the development of law in each of these areas.
<P>
<dd>
	The Society's <b><i>Pro Bono</i> Resource Network</b> links Federalist Society lawyers with like-minded groups and individuals needing legal assistance. Through this outreach, our members use their professional talents on behalf of the principles in which they believe.
<P>
<dd>
	The <b>ABA Watch Project</b> centers around a semi-annual <i>ABA Watch</i> newsletter, the first of which was released in August at the American Bar Association convention. This periodical publicizes the activities of the ABA. In so doing, we expect to generate a great deal of discussion about the organized bar and the fears of many that it has become a left-wing advocacy group.
<P>
<dd>
	Of course, the Society's core programs -- local chapter meetings, national and regional conferences, and publications -- will continue to promote traditional legal principles. 
	<P>
<dd>
In sum, the Federalist Society educates the legal community and the general public about the proper role of the legal system, activates legal professionals on behalf of conservative causes, and provides assistance to friendly local, state-wide, and national groups.

<B>U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook 1996</B>,<br>
 compiled and edited by John Dori and Richard Fisher

The Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Center<hr>
<P>
John Dori, Research Associate of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, and Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, have compiled the 11th annual U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook. The authors note that U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995. The rise in exports to Asia outpaced the growth of exports to all other regions of the world. To help policy makers and the public understand the key issues facing the world's most dynamic region, the Asian Studies Center has compiled key social, political, economic, and military statistics on the United States and 33 countries in East of South Asia. this year's edition includes a chart summarizing the findings of Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom. 91 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

 by John Hillen<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1096, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States must enact a staged removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Bosnia in order to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to the region. Specifically, according to Hillen, the U.S. should keep only a limited number of support troops in Bosnia in 1997, and there should be no U.S. ground troops in a new follow-on implementation force. The follow-on implementation force should be European-led, and eventually lead to European responsibility for the regional peacekeeping burden. All U.S. troops should be removed by 1998, for, according to Hillen, America's main purpose in NATO is not to police ethnic conflicts in Europe. The peacekeeping responsibility should come under such European organizations as the Western European Union or the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe after NATO's departure.  11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc143.html">Building a Better U.S. Partnership With Australia</a>,</b><br>
 by Robert O'Quinn<br>
<I>Asian Studies Backgrounder</I> No. 143, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Robert O'Quinn, Policy Analyst at the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States should build a better partnership with Australia to protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has recently become a major player in the region. This has been due to Australia's efforts over the past ten years to deregulate its economy and dismantle its extremely protectionist trade policies that nearly brought the country to economic ruin by the 1980s. Australia has embraced the dynamic Asian market and reoriented its diplomatic and economic ties toward Asia and the United States. O'Quinn notes that the U.S. cannot duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and diplomacy have presented to Australia. To secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region, according to O'Quinn, Washington should cooperate with Canberra on trade and security issues. Specifically, the President should: ask Congress to end the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs that have prevented further trade liberalization in Australia; ask congress to allow intracoastal-coastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels to reduce logistics costs for American firms; ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues; ask congress to take further steps all around to liberalize trade, especially in areas of conflict between the U.S. and Australia; and strengthen U.S. military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra <I>Tomahawk</I> long-range cruise missiles and by including Australia in the development of a future Asian missile defense network. 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.or

<B>Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce</B>, <br>
by James Sheehan<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<hr><P>
James Sheehan, Research Associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, discusses international hazard waste regulations and their impact on international commerce. The Basel Convention was signed in 1989 to create a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes. It has three primary objectives: 1) reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 2) ensure that hazardous wastes be treated and disposed of as close as possible to their source of generation; and 3) minimize hazardous waste generation at source. Sheehan argues that global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change the root causes of environmental degradation. He notes that illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government bureaucracies. International trade  does not directly cause environmental degradation, and international trade controls cut off developing countries from important materials and supplies that only international markets can supply. Many developing countries see environmental demands by industrialized nations as new forms of protectionism designed to close markets. Sheehan argues that the U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel Convention. According to Sheehan, the U.S. should reject even the possibility of global trade regulation and an export ban. Free trade and government controls are incompatible concepts. He concludes that developing countries must stand firm against the green trade restrictions of the Basel Convention. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.

<I>Hoover Essays</I>, Hoover Institution<hr>
<P>
In this essay, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann, Senior Fellows at the Hoover Institution, write about the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The authors note that the fall of the Soviet Union represented the downfall of a secular religion. Economically, politically and militarily, Soviet communism was a failure. They argue that Gorbachev was an unwitting agent of decolonization, and that Yeltsin represents the architect of Russian reconstruction.  42 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA  94305-6010, 415/723-3373, fax 415/723-1687, Internet 	<a href="http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html">http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html</a>.

<B>ESTIMATING OSHA COMPLIANCE COSTS</B>,<BR> 
BY HARVEY JAMES<BR>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 135, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
According to a study by economist Harvey James, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes greater regulatory compliance costs to the economy than previously estimated. Based on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) commissioned by OSHA of 25 major rules issued by the agency after 1980, he estimates that manufacturers in 1993 paid an additional 46,300 each year on average per firm for the 25 OSHA regulations established since 1980. James's analysis has revealed some interesting facts, including: Construction firm spending exceeds $700,000 annually per firm to comply with just one hazardous waste operations regulation; OSHA rules on air quality and process safety are the most costly in the manufacturing sector with costs exceeding $9,000 and $36,000 a year per firm, respectively; the cost of compliance with OSHA's lead standard is nearly $400,000 a year for affected manufacturers; and OSHA's study of the economic impact of proposed Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) projects total compliance costs at over $10 billion a year. James argues that in order to expose the full impact of OSHA regulations, a reliable survey of compliance expenditures needs to be established. He proposes a survey similar to the Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures (PACE) reports made annually by the Census Bureau for the EPA. James concludes that there is reasonable basis for establishing a regulatory budget for OSHA. 29 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>The Last Monopoly: Privatizing the Postal Service for the Information Age</b>, <br>
Edited by Edward Hudgins<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
The Cato Institute presents a collection of essays on returning mail delivery to the free market. The first chapter is by U.S. Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. He tries to make a case that there is a national consensus to keep government in the business of delivering the mail, but that the right amount of deregulation will allow the U.S. Postal Service to compete on equal footing with other couriers. He maintains that universal mail service "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government," is necessary to bind the nation together. James Cambell looks at the creeping expansion of the postal monopoly. Peter Ferrara argues that their are inherent problems with a postal monopoly that have meant rates as much as 50 percent higher than they would be if competition were allowed. Stephen Gibson, Executive Director of the Bionomics Institute illustrates how the Information Age is bypassing the "Machine Age Postal Service." Economist  Thomas DiLorenzo and Richard Geddes contribute essays on "Natural Monopoly Myths" and "Patterns of Private Delivery," which undermine the case for privatizing the assets of the USPS and thereby moving postal services entirely into the free market. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher proposes converting the USPS into an employee stock-ownership company. And Douglas Adie, author of Monopoly Mail, proposes breaking up the U.S. Postal Service, into regional divisions that would then be sold off. 138 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href=:mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</a>.

<b>What to Do About Universal Service Subsidies: Support for High-Cost Areas</b>,<br>
 by Wayne Leighton<br>
<I>Issue Analysis</I> No. 39, Citizens for a Sound Economy<hr>
<P>
Wayne Leighton, Senior Economist for Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses the issue of Universal Service Subsidies for high-cost telephone service areas. The 1996 Telecommunications Act continues, and potentially expands, current universal service subsidies to high-cost telephone servicing areas. The Federal State Joint Board and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been granted considerable authority under the Act to significantly expand the current arrangement of subsidies. Leighton argues that a more limited approach could be taken by relegating more authority over universal service issues to state-level regulators and that subsidies should be brought to a minimum. The size of universal service subsidies, according to Leighton, should be based on the most accurate cost estimates. Methods for cost estimates based upon historical costs tend to inflate the amount of actual expenses incurred, while hypothetical estimates rely on a regulator's calculations. He concludes that for high-cost markets, competitive bidding may offer the most effective way to determine the minimum amount needed to provide a universal service subsidy. This would still guarantee the same quality of service to high-costs areas, while at the same time bringing competition to the market. This competition will drive costs down and efficiency up. 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse</a>.

<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 123, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
Ron Utt, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and Dan Hickey, Special Assistant to The Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Domestic Policy Issues, have compiled a third report on instances of waste and excess in government spending. Utt and Hickey list the names and phone numbers of the people in charge of each government agency where the financial abuses took place. Cases of waste and excess includes: 1) The expenses from the widespread misuse of Vice President Al Gore's recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards; 2) 93 percent failure of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) units in maintenance inspections, while 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles were purchased for the central office staff despite the availability of only one pickup truck for HANO maintenance crews; 3) Massive subsidies for such absentee ranchers and farmers as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and celebrity news reporter Sam Donaldson; 4) Amtrack's proposed use of $40 million in taxpayer money to set up costly new service between Boston and Portland, Maine, that will take longer than existing inexpensive private bus service; 5) Information from internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports that shows that up to one-third of the total funds spent on some projects are lost through gross misuse such as contributing to parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference; and finally, 6) Cases of food stamp abuse such as that by a Tennessee woman with assets valued at over $350,000 receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period, and another instance where food stamps were used to by caviar. Finding room for tax relief can begin with eradicating such flagrant waste as the examples listed in this paper. 4 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-49

<B>Federal Revenue Estimates: What's Wrong; What Should be Done</B>,<br>
 by Michael Schuyler and Norman Ture<br>
<I>Fiscal Issues</I> No. 10, Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation<hr>
<p>
Michael Schuyler, IRET Senior Economist, and Norman Ture, President of IRET, examine key deficiencies in federal procedures for estimating how tax changes affect government revenue. According to the authors, failings in current procedures, notably the insistence that tax changes do not affect the overall economy, systematically mislead policy makers, resulting in tax policies that may cost the American public hundreds of billions of dollars yearly. Schuyler and Ture call for correcting the deficiencies in the current estimating methodology. 70 pp.  CONTACT: IRET, 1300 19th Street, N.W., Suite 240, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/463-1400, fax 202/463-6199.

<b>The Case for an Across-the-Board Tax Rate Reduction</b>, <br>
by Bruce Bartlett<br>
<I>Policy Backgrounder</I> No. 140, National Center for Policy Analysis<hr>
<p>
Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, puts forth the case for reducing tax rates across the board. He points out that total taxes as a share of the GDP were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 -- 31.3 percent. American paid $151.1 billion more in federal taxes than if federal receipts had remained at their 1992 level of 19.2 percent of GDP. Reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 15 percent would lower federal receipts as a share of GDP to what they were in 1992. The across-the-board tax cut would not solve the tax problem. A tax reduction must be accompanied by spending reduction. As long as federal spending consumes over 20 percent of our national output, it will be impossible to lower taxes as much as is needed. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>The Moral Case for the Flat Tax</b>,<br>
 by Steve Forbes<br>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 10, Hillsdale College<hr>
<P>
Former Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes puts forth a moral case for the Flat Tax. Forbes stresses how the current tax system leads to political, civic and cultural corruption. The current tax code is mind-numbing and complex, according to Forbes, and the leading source of corruption in Washington. Lobbyists and special interest groups are the largest private sector industry in Washington. Over half of them work to convince politicians to manipulate the tax code in their favor. A flat tax would close all loopholes and throw the lobbyists and special interests out of work. An unfair tax code and excessive taxation leads to civic corruption by taking away a citizen's sense of self-reliance and integrity. Many Americans view the current tax structure as "legalized plunder." Forbes points out that this has a corrosive impact on an individual's sense of responsibility and trust, two necessary components for society to thrive. Despite the trillions in American taxpayer money that has been spent in the name of "compassion," there is more crime, more illegitimacy, more illiteracy, more drug abuse, more broken families, and more members of the permanent underclass than ever before. A flat tax that exempts the poorest citizens would help end the cultural corruption that has resulted from failed big-government programs. Forbes concludes by arguing that the federal government cannot provide the moral influence necessary to preserve families, reawaken faith, restore values, solve social problems and create prosperity. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<B>Do Automobile Fuel Economy Standards Work</B>,<br>
 by Michael Sykuta <br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 133, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
Michael Sykuta, a Research Associate and lecturer in business administration at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, argues that automobile fuel economy standards do not work. According to Sykuta, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards have not achieved their original objective of reducing gasoline consumption. He finds that the United States consumed 40 percent more gasoline than when the CAFE law was passed in 1975. His findings offers evidence that  freeze, if not a repeal, of CAFE standards should take place. Proponents of CAFE regulation argue that standards must be increased to further reduce the consumption of gasoline and its environmental side-effects. However, Sykuta found the following: average passenger vehicles on the road today are 59 percent more fuel efficient than the average cars of 1975 and continued through 1982, not because of CAFE standards, but because changes in product designed that began prior to 1975 as a response to prevailing market forces; the average fuel economy of the total U.S. fleet continued to rise after 1982 as the older and less efficient cars were slowly replaced with the newer more efficient cars, however the average fuel economy of all cars has leveled off in recent years; and, CAFE regulations have not achieved the goal of reducing American consumption of foreign oil. Sykuta reasons from his data covering a 44-year period (1951-1994), that average gasoline consumption per car is most significantly related to the price of gasoline and to the average fuel efficiency of the total U.S. fleet, not just new cars. He argues that, at least through 1982, the price of gasoline, not CAFE standards themselves, is the key determinant of average fuel efficiency. He concludes that federal government attempts to reduce gasoline consumption with a mandated fuel-economy standard shows no sign having an impact on the amount of gasoline consumed on a per vehicle basis. Overall, Cafe regulations have only served to create additional bureaucratic burdens on automobile ma
nufacturers. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Community-Run Fisheries: Avoiding the "Tragedy of the Commons"</b>, <br>
 by Donald Leal<br>
<I>PERC Policy Series</I> No. 7, PERC<hr>
<p>
Donald Leal, PERC Senior Associate, discusses how coastal communities can avoid overfishing. He presents several cases where fishing territories have been effectively protected and fish populations preserved through community-run fisheries. Leal mentions early native Alaskan fisheries, and today's ZECs (zones of controlled exploitation) in Quebec. In the examples, he shows that fishing areas can be protected from overfishing with minimal government involvement. Citing studies on well-managed, commonly-owned property, he illustrates that well-defined boundaries, a strong community tradition, and absence of government interference can preserve resources and avoid the "tragedy of the commons." He concludes that government has failed to regulate fishing successfully, and that a self-regulated fishery is an idea whose time has come. 27 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

 by James Wootton and Robert Heck<br>
<I>State Backgrounder</I> No. 1097/S, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, and Robert Heck, a former Justice Department official, have prepared a study on how state and local officials can fight violent juvenile crime. Wootton and Heck argue that a high-tech approach might be the answer. six percent of hard-core juvenile offenders, or "superpredators" commit up to 63 percent of all violent juvenile crime. According to Wootton and Heck, state and local law enforcement officials should build computerized case files on these criminals and make the information available to every public agency that deals with youth-police, prosecutors, courts, parole officers, schools and social workers. There is already a similar system set up in more than 150 communities across the United States and Canada called Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP). SHOCAP enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals. Wootton and Heck mention that Congress can aid efforts to fight juvenile crime with such legislation as the Violent and Repeat Juvenille Offender Act of 1996, and the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996. Ultimately, they argue, violent juvenile crime must be fought by smart, tough and tenacious officials at the state and local level with the most efficient and sophisticated resources for tracking the violent habitual offender.  17 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>Legal Services for the Poor: Is Federal Support Necessary?</b><br>
 by David Wilkinson<br>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<P>
David Wikenson, former Utah Attorney General, and the first Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91), questions whether the federal government should spend $283 million to fund legal services. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded agency designed to support legal services organizations that serve the poor. Conservative critics of LSC have charged that LSC funds are improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials. Liberal supporters of LSC argue that LSC-funded organizations spend most of their resources representing the poor in routine legal cases such as land-lord-tenant disputes. Whatever the case may be, Wilkinson argues, there are adequate private and non-federal resources currently available to meet the legal needs of the poor. Legal service providers receiving LSC funds also receive at least $324 million from private and other public sources. Furthermore, there are an additional 1,350 providers of legal services to the needy who receive no government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. On top of that there are 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers who perform an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work each year valued at $3.3 billion. Wilkenson concludes that if Congress is serious about balancing the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, then it may want to reconsider the next LSC budget. If LSC were abolished, there would still be at least a half billion dollars available each year for legal services for the needy. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Factories Behind Bars</b>,<br>
 by Morgan Reynolds<br>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 206, <hr>
<P>
Morgan Reynolds, NCPA Senior Fellow, calls for putting prisoners to work. Currently there are unnecessary legal restrictions keeping tens of thousands of prisoners from doing productive work behind bars. Reynolds proposes repealing the laws that restrict trade in prison-made goods. He also proposes recruiting private-sector businesses to supply jobs, once the restrictive laws are abolished. America's prison population is projected to grow to 1.6 million in the next decade. Only about half of all prisoners do any kind of work at all and most of that is part-time work on prison upkeep. According to Reynolds, it should be possible to create jobs for one of every four prisoners during the next five to ten years. If just 60 percent of prisoner earnings were allocated to compensating taxpayers, this would save about $2.4 billion annually, or slightly less than 10 percent of the cost of prison support. Reynolds points out that there is no reason why prisoners shouldn't help to pay for their own upkeep instead of having taxpayers pay for it all. Beyond taxpayer relief, productive work for prisoners would alleviate idleness in prison life, and increase the likelihood of responsible behavior upon the prisoners release. 29 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Reforming Public Education in Wisconsin: Moving from Bureaucracy to Accountability</b>,<br>
 by James Cibulka<br>
<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<hr>
<p>
James Cibulka, Professor and Chair of the Department of Education Policy, Planning and Administration at the University of Maryland, examines what has happened to educational reform in Wisconsin. He finds that Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction (DPI) is still bogged down with outdated "command-and-control" principles. He points out that while private sector organizations have undergone a "management revolution" achieving much greater efficiency, DPI has not reorganized itself to promote high student performance, local initiative, and accountability for high performance at all levels. Cibulka offers recommendations for improving DPI in three general areas: 1) greater regulatory flexibility; 2) improving accountability policies; and 3) a new approach to state leadership and a state-level partnership. He concludes that a new focus on high performance can be achieved within a system with a tradition of strong local initiative. He calls for a new model for education administration that is a state-local partnership. 23 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<b>Can Michigan Keep Its Status as a Leader in Education Reform</b><br>

<b>A National Survey of Americans' Attitudes Toward Education and School Reform</b><br>
The Center for Education Reform<hr>
<p>
The Center for Education Reform (CER) has conducted a nationwide poll of Americans' attitudes toward education and school reform. The poll shows 70 percent of the public supports school choice options, including tax-funded scholarships to allow poor parents to send their children to private, public or parochial school of their choice. This survey confirms data released earlier this year by the Public Agenda Foundation and disputes the results of a recent National Education Association (NEA) poll which claims to show public opposition to school choice and support for a federal role in education. CER's poll asked what size the role of the federal government should play in education. 50 percent of the respondents said "minor," and 24 percent said "no role." Overall, 93 percent of the respondent said that public schools need to be improved.  9 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 920, Washington, DC  20036, 202/822-9000, fax 202/822-5077.

<b>1996 Georgia High School Report Card for Parents</b><br> 
Georgia Public Policy Foundation<hr>
<p>
The Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) has released a "report card" on Georgia public schools. It provides a ranking of every school district in the state. This study attempts do the following: a) analyze the issues that GPPF thinks Georgia parents care most about; b) reduce the available statistical information to a concise and understandable form; c) isolate data from Georgia's public high schools only; and d) issue a publication that is accessible and easily comprehensible to the state's general population. The criteria that they used for ranking the schools were the Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, the percentage of students completing a college preparatory curriculum (versus a less vigorous curriculum), dropout rates, and, the number of weapons violations per 100 students. GPPF argues that parents are entitled to know about the quality of their children's schools. For the majority of parents, assessing the quality of a school is a mystery shrouded in unfamiliar terms and endless data. GPPF says that this report should be used to open dialogues between parents, teachers, administrators, government officials, and civic organizations. 35 pp. CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>The End of Welfare: Fighting Poverty in the Civil Society</b>,<br>
 by Michael Tanner<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
Michael Tanner, Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, discusses the corrosive effect of U.S. welfare policy, despite its good intentions. He points out that since the start of the War on Poverty in 1965, the federal and state governments have spent more than $5.4 trillion to end poverty. Despite the enormity of this 'investment' the result has been, primarily, more poverty. He argues that our welfare system is unfair to all. Taxpayers must pay the bill for failed programs. Society is hurt when its mediating institutions of community, church and family are increasingly pushed aside. Most of all, argues Tanner, the poor are hurt with welfare by being trapped in a system that destroys opportunity for themselves and destroys hope for their children. Welfare should be judged on its results, not its intentions. Despite the acknowledgment from all sides that the system has failed, Tanner argues, both liberals and conservatives, continue to believe that government can solve the problem of poverty. Tanner maintains that the answer to poverty does not lie with government. He argues that a new paradigm to fight poverty must be based on civil society instead of government or political society. Civil society, "while stressing self-reliance and individual initiative, would also provide a vigorous network of private, localized, nonbureaucratic charities that are far more capable than is government of helping those people who need temporary assistance." Tanner also criticizes the recent welfare reform legislation. According to him, welfare cannot be reformed, and instead, should be ended. He explains why liberal and conservative welfare reform won't work, and he elaborates on how civil society can replace welfare. This book also includes an appendix listing and describing major welfare programs. 225 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.

<b>The Tenth Amendment: The Promise of Liberty: Strategies to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal and State Governments</b>
American Legislative Exchange Council<hr>
<p>
With this paper, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has put forth strategies to restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments that is implied with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In October of 1995, ALEC and other organizations, held a national federalism summit to look at ways to restore the Tenth Amendment. The result of the summit was four proposals which, they believe, merit further consideration. 1) Set up a mechanism to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures, the power to require Congress to reconsider laws or regulations that interfere with state authority. 2) Set up a mechanism that would allow the states to propose specific amendments to the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the United States Congress. 3) Set up statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address the problems of conditions attached to federal spending grants, regulations and mandates. 4) Passage of a federalism act to enhance the political safeguards and give states a more effective voice in congressional deliberations. For each of these proposals ALEC recommends the following: 1) The National Government of the People Amendment, which would allow state legislatures to repeal intrusive federal legislation and regulations; 2) The States' Initiative, which would empower the People through their state legislature to ratify constitutional amendments that enjoy broad support but that Congress has failed to propose; 3) The Accountability in Government Initiative, which would end the three intrusive federal practices of regulatory mandates, unfunded mandates, and the imposition of impermissible conditions on federal spending grants; and 4) The Federalism Act, which would directly address discrete aspects of the current imbalance between the federal and state governments. 17 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1094.html">From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt</a></b>,<br>
 by Ken Weinstein and August Stofferahn<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1094, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at The Heritage Foundation, and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant at the Government Reform Project, examine organized labor's use of compulsory membership dues to finance their leadership's political agenda. An activist labor movement was a major force in the last election, and may be the most significant new force in American politics. However, Weinstein and Stofferahn point out, much of labor's new agenda has nothing to do with workplace issues, is not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and is outside of the mainstream of American politics. In the past few decades, organized labor has moved from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful, high-spending lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Weinstein and Stofferahn document labor's move to the left. They illustrate how organized labor has come to be dominated by government employee unions, instead of the traditional industry-based unions. Specifically, they show how the AFL-CIO have drastically departed from American Federation of Labor founder, Samuel Gompers', rule of separating labor from partisan politics. Organized labor has recently taken stances on issues that have nothing to do with collective bargaining and workplace conditions. For example, in 1995 the Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO led a campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Organized labor leadership has also taken stances on abortion, racial and gender preferences, welfare and the federal budget. This paper also goes into detail about the epitome of labor's leftward shift and blatant political partisanship, the National Education Association. In their conclusion, Weinstein and Stofferahn, point out that politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues. They argue that unions should not finance their political activities with compulsory membership dues. The
re is judicial precedent from the 1988 Supreme Court Case <I>Communication Workers of America v. Beck</I>, that declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>What About the Religious Left? Politics  Motivates and Bankrolls The Interfaith Alliance, Americans United Works to Keep Religion Out of Public Square</b>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<p>
In recent years the mainstream media has thoroughly covered the "religious right," often times generously quoting those eager to bash them, and implying that their rising influence may corrupt the American political system. <I>Organization Trends</I> points out that left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. This issue focuses on two groups, the Interfaith Alliance (TIA), and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. Calling itself a "faith-based" group, TIA engages in the same activism with similar methods as the Christian Coalition. The Interfaith Alliance distributed the same type of voter guides that earned the Christian Coalition criticism for excessive religious influence. Yet, TIA's guides, which ranked liberal candidates better, caused no such outcry. This 501(c)(4) organization was started with Democratic party money, and a look at the organization's leadership and activities uncovers its position clearly within the left of the political and cultural spectrum. This issue also covers the activities of another group having to do with religion and public life, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. TIA, a self-proclaimed "mainstream faith-based" group, is ironically allied with this group that is dedicated to eradicating the public expression of religion. In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to deter churches from distributing Christian Coalition voter guides, and warning churches that doing so could threaten their tax-exempt status. The issue concludes by observing that TIA apparently has no agenda of its own, other than bashing the Christian Coalition. TIA is most often quoted in the media as a "religious" organization denouncing the Christian Coalition. The author suggests that the liberal left only has a use for TIA because of the activism of religious conservatives. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005,

<b>The Adoption Option: Compassion that Works</b>,<br>
 by Ken Connor and Camille Godwin<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 7, Foundation for Florida's Future<hr>
<p>
Ken Connor, Chairman of the Board of Care Net, which represents the largest network of crisis pregnancy centers in North America, and Camille Godwin, an attorney in Tallahassee, FL, promote the option of adoption in the situation of a "crisis pregnancy." They argue that adoption can be a "win-win" situation for the people affected. The child gains a loving, stable and secure home, the adopting parents win by becoming parents of the child for whom they have longed, and the biological parents obtain the relief from the burdens of an unexpected or unwanted child. Connor and Godwin say that this makes it in the public interest to encourage and facilitate the adoption process. They discuss the current adoption procedures in the State of Florida, the obstacles to adoption, and the disadvantages of foster care. Connor and Godwin put forth several legislative and public policy suggestions to improve the adoption and foster care system: streamline judicial proceedings, increase access to information about adoption, reduce the financial obstacles for prospective parents, remove race as an obstacle to adoption, promote community-based responses to adoption and foster care issues, and encourage employer-based initiatives to promote adoption. They conclude by arguing that adoption must become a priority public policy issue. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<dd>The cover story of this issue, <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/shokraii.html">"Free at Last: Black America Signs Up for School Choice</a>," by Nina Shokraii, examines the growing support for school choice amongst African-Americans. Most black political leaders actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, yet their constituents are looking more and more to options other than decaying public schools ---which have a disasterous record of teaching black children. Shokraii, Director of Outreach Programs at the Institute for Justice, documents the school choice movements in black communities in Milwaukee and Cleveland, and charter school movements in California and Michigan. It is quite evident that standards, discipline, and parental involvement of private or charter schools are bringing more black parents to fight for schools choice. Shokraii concludes that school choice and charter schools are becoming the civil rights movement of the 1990s.

<B><I>Crisis</I></B><br>
Novemember 1996<hr><p>
<dd>
A notable article in this month's issue of <I>Crisis</I> discusses the bad economics of the pastoral letter of America's Catholic bishops, <I>Economic Justice for All</I>. Michael Joyce, President and CEO of the Bradley Foundation, contrasts <I>Economic Justice for All</I> with Pope John Paul II's <I>Centesimus Annus</I>. At the core of the comparison is how the respective writings proscribe ways to help those in need. Joyce points out the bishop's pastoral has much to say about the needy, but nothing to say to them. The letter calls for "an economy that truly respects persons," and even proposes measures to be taken by government as specific as a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Act. It calls for reforming social sytems in order to secure dignity for the needy, yet it never lists an action or task for the needy themselves. Joyce argues that <I>Centesimus Annus</I> cannot be read without a clear sense that the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is not quite so subordinate. While the Pope acknowledges that there is a need for political, economic, social, and cultural commitment to the poor, he maintains that the decisive commitment must be made within the heart and conscience of the human person and not depend on asking government or other institution to solve the problem. 60 pp.  CONTACT: 800/852-9962.

<B>Competitive Enterprise Institute</B><HR>

<P>
In October, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a First Amendment challenge to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' (ATF) ban on statements concerning the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements. A substantial body of research has shown that moderate alcohol consumption significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in adults. While these findings are now widely accepted and have been incorporated into the federal government's new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ATF still prohibits their inclusion on products or advertisements.
<p>
CEI had petitioned ATF in 1995 to allow such statements, and included the following suggested language: "There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease." ATF did not respond to the petition. Consumer Alert, a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in the free flow of information to its members and a supporter of the CEI petition, is also a party.
<p>
CEI is relying on an extensive body of Supreme Court precedent protecting so-called commercial speech. Most recently, two Court decisions, <I>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.</i> and <I>44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island</I>, held that information on alcoholic beverage labels and ads is protected by the First Amendment against government restrictions.

<b>Flooding Farm Reveals Government Double Standard</b>
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is guilty of using double standards when it comes to its dealings with small farmer Roy James, according to Defenders. Mr. James's farm abuts the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (Tyrrell County, North Carolina). A drainage problem in the refuge causes the farm to flood. Due to the flooding, Mr. James loses at least 40% of the productivity of his farm every year, and suffers further losses from erosion and the cost of paying to have the water pumped off the land. FWS admits to causing the flooding, but simply refuses to resolve the problem.
<p>
Mr. James offered to exchange land with FWS, but FWS declined because the land "does not have significant enough wildlife values to be advantageous." So after two years of flooding, Mr. James had the U.S. Soil Conservation Service draw up specifications for a dike. He built the dike with some fill from the refuge land. Ironically, when the government's land was physically invaded, FWS took immediate action, threatening to sue Mr. James for damages. In fact, Mr. James was forced to compensate the federal government in order to avoid litigation, but has yet to receive a dime from the government for its years-long physical invasion of his land. Defenders is now representing Mr. James seeking damages on his behalf.
<p>
<b>Last Developer in Is a "Rotten Egg"</b>
<p>
A wetland designation by the Army Corps of Engineers has derailed investment-backed expectations of the owners of industrial-zoned property in Centerville, Utah, leaving a handful of property owners with no economically beneficial or productive use of their property.
<p>
The land at issue was purchased by several investors in the early 1970's. The local government zoned the area industrial and encouraged its development as an industrial park. By pooling their resources, the landowners built public roads and other infrastructure, and began to develop their individual lots. After half the lots were develop and Mr. Smith began developing his lot, the Army Corps ordered him to cease because the land, according the government, is now "wetland."
<p>
In fact, however, Mr. Smith's dry land is only wet when rain water runs off the adjacent developed parcels onto his undeveloped parcel. Now that the parcel has been declared a wetland, Mr. Smith faces the unfair reality of not being able to make any beneficial or productive us of his property.
<p>
<b>Sales Contract Canceled Due to Government Interference</b>
<p>
Anyone who still claims that wetland designations do not diminish land values should look closely at the case of <I>Robbins v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</I>. In 1976, Mrs. Robbins purchased as investment property, 34 acres in Paris, Tennessee to fund her retirement. The land is zoned commercial and lies along the main highway leading to the "Lands Between the Lakes" Park, a popular national tourist destination. Following her husband's death in 1994, Mrs. Robbins decided to sell the property. She had no problem finding a buyer, and the parties executed a sales contract. The purchaser deposited one third of the sales price in escrow to secure the purchase.
<p>
Three days later, the buyer canceled the contract because unbeknownst to Mrs. Robbins, the land is now deemed "wetland." In spite of the fact that the property is surrounded by commercial building and directly abuts a highway, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the property exhibits the characteristics of federal jurisdictional wetlands.
<p>
Mrs. Robbins has asked Defenders to seek compensation for the property on her behalf. Her just compensation claim is based on the fact that the federal wetlands delineation interfered with her contract for sale, reduced the property to nominal value, and destroyed its development potential and marketability.
<p>
<b>97% Open Space Is Not Enough</b>
<p>
Teton County, Wyoming is 97% public land, consisting of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and state lands. Only 3% of the county is privately owned: 1.5% is held by large ranchers and 1.5% (the only developable land in the county) is held by landowners whose families typically hold the land to subdivide for future generations.
<p>
Michael Shidner is one of those property owners. He owns 35 acres, which he planned to divide three ways. Under the latest Teton county comprehensive plan, however, Mr. Shidner will  not be able to subdivide unless he places a conservation easement over 70% of his property. In addition, he must agree to cluster the homes, since the area is considered winter habitat for endangered species.
<p>
Defenders will argue in a lawsuit that the permit conditions violate the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, which requires conditions to be "roughly proportional" to the burden created by the proposed us of the property. The permit condition faced by Mr. Shidner far exceed the burden that a few homes would create in a county that is already 97% open space.

<b>Religious School Choice in Vermont</b>
<p>
On August 26, 1996, IJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Chittenden Town School District against the Vermont Department of Education and its commissioner. The Department had denied general state aid to the District because it was prepared to pay tuition to a religious high school among other schools its students attend. (Vermont towns that have no public high schools send all their students to whatever school, public or private, their parents choose.) The issue is whether religious schools can be included in the tuition program.
<p>
The District withdrew its preliminary injunction request and agreed not to pay tuition to the religious schools until it received a favorable ruling from the Superior Court. The Department agreed to send the aid to the District and expedited discovery in the case. The judge stated he would issue his ruling quickly after discovery and briefings were complete. IJ hopes for a declaratory judgment in the District's favor this fall.

<b>Landmark Continues Milwaukee School Choice Defense</b>
<p>
Representing State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams and low income families, Landmark Legal Foundation continues its defense of the Amended Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The amended program allows families access to religious private schools under the nation's first school choice plan, which Landmark successfully defended in 1991 and 1992. Landmark, joined by other school choice advocates, recently filed papers asking a Wisconsin state court judge to declare the amended program constitutional. The judge likely will rule against the religious school access provision, however, and the issue is certain to be determined in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, hopefully prior to the 1997-98 school year.
<p>
<b>Landmark to Appeal Ruling on State-Created Insurance Company</b>
<p>
Landmark Legal Foundation will ask the Missouri Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a Missouri state-subsidized insurance company. Representing Casualty Reciprocal Exchange ("CRE"), Landmark will tell the Court that the Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company ("MEMIC") also unfairly competes with private insurance companies and is a risk to taxpayers because of important financial reserve requirements from which it was exempted by Missouri Director of Insurance Jay Angoff, also a defendant in the lawsuit.
<p>
MEMIC, in its most recent quarterly report, disclosed that it underestimated its 1995 year-end losses and related expenses by more than $11,000,000. 
<p>
MEMIC was created in 1993 by the legislature, which provided MEMIC a $5 million taxpayer-financed loan for the company's startup capital. MEMIC also was given the authority to revenue bonds for additional capitalization -- both in direct violation of Missouri's Constitutional provisions prohibiting the use of state funds for private loans and investment.

<b><i>Adarand</i> Set for Oral Argument</b>
<p>
The landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc v. Pena</I>, won by MSLF on June 12, 1995, has reached the final stage before the Colorado federal district court. The Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado after it "alter(ed) the playing field" regarding the standard to be used in reviewing race-based decision making by Congress. Overturning two earlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that the "strict scrutiny" standard applies to Congress. With the completion of briefing by both parties, the case is scheduled for oral argument on December 20.
<p>
<b>Michigan Property Owners Seek Supreme Court Review</b>
<p>
Two lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court holding left undisturbed by the 7-7 split of the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <I>Stupak-Thrall, et al. v. United States of America, et al</I>., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) denied two lake front property owners the right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake, as Michigan law permits them. This despite the language of applicable federal law that "valid existing rights" are protected. On behalf of the property owners, who MSLF have represented since they first filed their lawsuit, MSLF sought Supreme Court review asserting that the USFS has rendered the "valid existing rights" language "meaningless" and that the federal government's use of the Property Clause to regulate private property is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
<p>
<b>Babbitt's Park Service Goes Back to Drawing Board</b>
<p>
After MSLF's victory on behalf of commercial climbers, the National Park Service (NPS) has obtained the permission of the Wyoming federal district court to return to the drawing board to determine how it may implement President Clinton's Executive Order regarding regulating federal land for Native American religions. MSLF had obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the NPS from closing Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming to commercial climbing. Regardless of the NPS decision, MSLF will return to court to seek damages for its client and to prevent other Establishment Clause violations within the Monument.
<p>
<b>Clinton Plan to Empty Idaho Reservoir in Jeopardy</b>
<p>
The National Marine and Fisheries Service plan to empty a reservoir in northern Idaho, ostensibly to "save" the salmon was dealt a blow in federal district court when the court requested further briefing on whether the specific statute creating the dam controlled over the general Endangered Species Act (ESA). The controversy is in Clearwater County, Idaho, where the government is seeking to drain a reservoir created by Congress for power generation, recreation, and timber transport. The government says those purposes are subservient to the command of the ESA.

<B>PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>
<p>
<b>Local Law Enforcement Conscripted into Federal Service</b>
<p>
Named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, the Brady Act requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on gun buyers during that period to determine whether there is any legal reason to stop the sale. Theoretically, this law addresses the salutary purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be robbers and murderers. But in reality, the Brady Act goes far beyond that purpose and conscripts local law enforcement officers into federal service, forcing them to compromise their local responsibilities by engaging in time-consuming, costly, and futile paper work for the federal government. What is more, no financial reimbursement is made.
<p>
Background checks under Brady go beyond felons. The law also applies to anyone who may be "otherwise prohibited by law from buying a gun." That means local sheriffs and chiefs of police must search through medical records to determine if a gun buyer has ever been committed to a mental institution or is an illegal drug user who has evaded arrest. Law enforcement officers must also check the records of fugitives, dishonorable military discharges and expatriate citizens. Civil court records must also be checked for restraining orders imposed on spouses in domestic relations cases. As if impressing local officers into federal service was not enough, the law includes an unconscionable provision that could subject them to fine or imprisonment or both for failing to make a "reasonable effort" to complete the work for the federal government.
<p>
The Brady Act's unfunded mandate was the "last straw" for Ravalli County, Montana, Sheriff Jay Printz and Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff Richard Mack, both of whom are being shut into their offices and tied to their desks to complete the background check requirement. These law enforcement officials would much rather devote their resources to protecting the citizens than doing bureaucratic paper work-of questionable efficacy-for the federal government.
<p>
Both Sheriffs Printz and Mack sued and won trial court rulings striking down that position of the Brady Act requiring background checks. In both cases, the lower courts agreed that the law illegally commandeered local officials for a federal program. However, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions ruling that the Brady law's background check requirement is constitutional and its intrusion upon state sovereignty minimal. The sheriffs' appeals are now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Legal Foundation is arguing that the federal government has no constitutional authority to force local law enforcement officers to carry out a mandate that materially impairs their ability to serve the local citizens whom they were hired to protect.
<p>
<b>Farmers Forced to Advertise Competitor's Products</b><br>
<I>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc.</I>
<p>
According to Thomas Jefferson, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical." So why does Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc., a peach and nectarine grower in California, pay lots of hard-earned money to help pay for a generic advertising message that says its competitors' fruits are as good as its own? Because the federal government is forcing this grower to.
<p>
Government "marketing boards," which essentially are agriculture cartels made up of farmers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have vast discretionary powers and can punish farmers who don't abide by their edicts. One of the boards' dubious functions is to force farmers to subsidize generic advertisements that extol the virtues of certain commodities in general. Remember the dancing raisins, "Got Milk?" and "It's the Cheese" ads? Such campaigns were financed through mandatory fees paid by individual growers. According to <i>Forbes</i> magazine, commodity boards for agricultural products have raked in over $750 million a year from U.S. farmers through coerced contributions. (The government pays out an additional $90 million of taxpayers' money for overseas promotions.) In California, about 50 such boards collect some $125 million from growers yearly.
<p>
Where do government bureaucrats get the idea in the first place that it is their job to tell business owners how to promote their own products? Forcing producers of agricultural commodities to pay for generic commercial ads is antithetical to the principle of free market enterprise. It is also a blatant violation of the constitutional free speech right not to be forced to pay for messages with which one disagrees. This is why Pacific Legal Foundation is helping Wileman Brothers & Elliot challenge the government's mandatory fee program in the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to federal regulations and marketing orders, Wileman must pay an assessment for a generic advertising program with which it disagrees. Moreover, the payments reduce Wileman's ability to pursue its own individual advertising program.
<p>
PLF argued to the U.S. Supreme Court last week to strike down the government's "marketing order" that assesses small farmers to pay for government-concocted advertising programs.

<b>Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Parents' Rights Case</b>
<p>
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case that could have a considerable impact on parents' rights. In <i>M.L.B. v. S.L.J.</i>, the court will consider whether a state court can condition an appeal for the termination of parents' rights on their ability to pay court costs in excess of $2,000.00.
<p>
In the case, a Mississippi lower court terminated a mother's parental rights to her 7 and 9-year-old children. She appealed the case to the state Supreme Court but could not afford to pay the costs involved. The court refused to waive the fee and dismissed her case. The Supreme Court must now decide if parents' rights are, in fact, fundamental liberties.
<p>
<b>California's Policy Restricting Employees' Religious Expression Unconstitutional Says Ninth Circuit</b>
<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a California state agency's policy against religious advocacy and display of religious artifacts is unconstitutional. The ruling reverses the finding of the lower court.
<p>
The Rutherford Institute represented state employee Monte Tucker, who placed "By Monte Tucker, SOTLJC" in a computer screen program he designed. The acronym stands for "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ." Tucker's supervisor threatened him with suspension if he refused to remove the acronym. The department then issued a policy forbidding religious advocacy during work hours and storage or display of any religious artifacts except n closed offices.
<p>
<b>The Rutherford Institute to File Class Action Suit Against Dept. Of Health 
and Human Services</b>
<p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a class action lawsuit against Donna Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services for allowing county officials to profit from depriving disabled foster children of their rightful monies.
<p>
The suit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Service has violated federal law by failing to follow the Social Security Act's mandates to ensure that foster children receive their rightful benefits. This policy has in essence encouraged Contra Costa County to prevent handicapped children from being adopted in order to keep funds intended for foster children. The suit claims that he violations occurring in Contra Costa County are indicative of foster care in other counties nationwide.

<b>Commercial Free Speech Defended</b>
<p>
In <I>AAA v. Kessler</I>, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of advertising groups challenging the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations of tobacco advertising, WLF filed a brief arguing that the regulations imposed by FDA violated the First Amendment rights of advertisers and the adult public. FDA's regulations, announced on August 28, 1996, and set to begin taking effect in early 1997, impose sweeping restrictions on tobacco advertising, including: (1) requiring black and white, text-only advertisements in all media, i.e., billboards, print media, point of purchase, and direct mail, except on those locations or print media that are "adult-only;" (2) prohibiting billboards within 1000 feet of schools or play areas, effectively eliminating all billboards in urban areas; and (3) banning the use of any tobacco brand name in sponsoring any cultural, sporting, or musical event, and on all types of secondary product, such as t-shirts, umbrellas, lighters, etc. WLF argued that the regulations are unlawful because the government has available to it several obvious and non-speech related methods to attack the problem of youth smoking. Moreover, even if some restrictions on advertising could be lawful, the broad and sweeping restrictions imposed by FDA are not "narrowly tailored" to the harm they were intended to address and would primarily restrict the free speech rights of adults. FDA cannot properly, for example, ban the use of tobacco brand names to sponsor all sporting or cultural events when many of these events have minimal, if any, children in attendance. WLF's clients on the brief include race car drivers, Mario Andretti, Don Garlits, Al Unser, Rusty Wallace, and Cale Yarborough, U.S. Representatives Richard Burr, Cass Ballenger, Howard Coble, and David Funderburk, and U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth.
<p>
<b>Excessive Antitrust Penalty Challenged</b>
<p>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit arguing that a $10 million fine imposed on a family-owned bakery company that kept its bread prices below the national average during the relevant period should be set aside as grossly excessive and unlawful. In <i>United States v. Mrs. Baird's Bakeries</i>, the evidence was undisputed that, during the time of the alleged pricing conspiracy, Mrs. Baird's bakery held prices steady and, indeed, even reduced its prices on several occasions. Despite this, Texas federal Judge Jerry Buchmeyer imposed the maximum statutory fine, one of the largest antitrust fines in U.S. history. Mrs. Baird's is now in bankruptcy. In its brief, WLF argued that there was little evidence of price fixing, and that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the maximum fine.
<p>
<b>Objection to HUD's Rulemaking</b>
<p>
WLF filed formal comments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requesting that HUD immediately rescind an interim rule that would abolish the right of respondents in fair housing complaint proceedings to obtain discovery from witnesses and the complaining party. The interim rule is procedurally and substantively defective on a number of grounds. HUD flagrantly violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and its own policy by not publishing the interim rule as a proposed rule for public comment. WLF also took strong objection to HUD's primary rationale for abolishing rights of respondents, namely that it would expedite the investigation process. WLF research discovered that the main cause of delay is <i>agency</i> inefficiency; it takes HUD, on average, 53 days from the time a housing complaint is filed until HUD even <i>begins</i> an investigation.

<b>Lecture Series to Examine the Impact of Religious Conviction on Politics</b>
<p>

The Foreign Policy Institute, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Ethics and Public Policy Center will sponsor a lecture series to examine "The Impact of Religious Conviction on the Politics of the 21st Century." All lectures will be held at SAISin Washington. The purpose of the series is to assess evidence of a worldwide resurgence in religious belief and to reflect on the implications of such a development at the end of the current millennium. Specifically, the project will address the following questions: What are the origins of the revival of religious fervor at the end of the 20th Century? How far and how long will this revival go? What are the chief elements of the critique of the secular order mounted by the various religions and ethical traditions enjoying a resurgence of popularity? To what degree are the religion-based critques rooted in common assumptions and compatible responses to the perceived shortcomings of secularity? What are the implications of this phenomenon particularly as they relate to international politics: prospects of war and peace, economic development, and the definition of human rights and social justice?

<TITLE>Third Wave of Think Tanks -- October 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>October, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Wave of Think Tanks<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>


<P>
<dd> Tip O'Neill once said &quot;All politics is local.&quot; He was
correct, but failed to mention an important corollary, that all
policy is local too. That's why we have formed the Allegheny Institute
for Public Policy -- the nation's first think tank devoted exclusively
to bringing free market solutions to local government.
<P>
<dd> Market oriented think tanks have come in three distinct waves.
In the 1970s, they began operating in Washington and laying the
intellectual groundwork for the Reagan revolution. In the 1980s,
in keeping with Reagan's revived spirit of federalism, conservative-movement
dollars and energies started working in the states as well. Intellectual
capital was &quot;block granted,&quot; as a number of entrepreneurial
policy analysts left Washington to found the second wave of policy
research groups. These state-based think tanks went on to provide
the intellectual infrastructure for the reinvention of state governments
in places like Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin, Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania,
Bill Weld's Massachusetts, and John Engler's Michigan. These groups
put welfare reform, charter schools and school choice on the public
policy map.
<P>
<dd> The time has come for a third wave -- the formation of locally-oriented
think tanks.  As dollars devolve from Washington to local governments,
taxpayer accountability should devolve as well. It would be ironic
if at the same time sound economic principles are revived in Washington,
that government programs might avoid accountability to these principles
by escaping to local bureaucracies still mired in the 1960s model
of big government.
<P>
<dd> Even before the devolution revolution, more dollars were spent
by local governments than by states or the federal government.
As devolution progresses this will become more true. Even federal
and state programs are frequently administered by local governments,
or by local subdivisions. Domestic government programs are ultimately
applied at the local level.
<P>
<dd> Although the Allegheny Institute is the first of this third wave
of local policy advocacy, it is unlikely to be the last. After
less than one year in business, we were approached by a group
from California interested in forming a similar organization modeled
after the Allegheny Institute. Due to the hard work of founder
Don Blake and others, and a little guidance from us, California
now has the benefit of the Table Mountain Institute near Sacramento.
Requests for help in starting local think tanks have come from
other places even farther away than Sacramento-Nigeria and Italy
for example. In addition we have received requests for advice
from several state think tanks that wish to start local policy
projects in their home states. Furthermore, our ideas have been
cited by all three local network television affiliates, all the
local radio news outlets and talk shows, and the local newspapers,
as well as the CBS radio network, and national newspapers such
as <I>USA Today</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
 <dd>Why all the attention? It has come largely because of our close
involvement in the restructuring of the government of Pittsburgh's
Allegheny County. This county, the second largest local government
between New York and Chicago, was under the rule of liberals for
over 60 years. In the last election, two conservatives won on
a privatization and deregulation platform. The crown jewel of
their platform was a 20% tax cut their first day in office.
<P>
<dd> The only way to make large tax cuts that work is to force the
bureaucracy to compete with the private sector to see who can
achieve the most efficient service delivery. This form of privatization
is sometimes called managed competition. Drawing upon research
by the Reason Foundation, we have published extensive research
on the benefits of privatization. In fact, there are over a dozen
privatization initiatives being implemented right now in Allegheny
County, including the only privatization of a property-assessments
department in the country and the first full privatization (sale)
of an airport in U.S. history.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about privatization, but about harnessing markets
in other ways. We are engaged in the creation of a pilot program
for electricity de-regulation. We estimate that a full-scale electric
utility consumer choice program could add 5 or 6% to the regional
domestic product. In addition, we are working with the county
economic development department to quantify the amount of burden
placed on the economy by local government, with a view toward
a streamlined business-friendly permitting process.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about markets either, it's also about culture.
Working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise we are helping to shift social service programs from
the political society to the civil society, to remove a permissive,
redistributive, liberal, social-service bureaucracy and replace
it with a flexible, results-oriented, low-cost provider network.
<P>
 <dd>Less a &quot;think tank&quot; and more a &quot;do tank,&quot;
the Allegheny Institute is taking the conservative intellectual
revolution to the laboratory of real life. Not satisfied with
having produced 30 full-length reports (and 40 editions of our
Newsfax) in our first year and a half of operations, the Allegheny
Institute has set out to prove not only that &quot;ideas have
consequences,&quot; but that <I>conservative</I> ideas actually
work at the local level.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1092, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Sweeney argues that since Mexico's
economic meltdown in 1994, both the Clinton Administration and
the 104th Congress have allowed America's once-respected leadership
role in Latin America to erode. The Administration and the Congress
have been reluctant to put expansion of NAFTA on the fast track
and instead have allowed the tremendous foreign policy successes
of the Reagan and Bush administrations to fall apart. If this
retreat is allowed to continue, writes Sweeney, U.S. economic
and security interests in the region could suffer a &quot;sustained
decline.&quot; 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

by Joshua Muravchik

<I>On the Issues</I>, American Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Joshua Muravchik, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, argues that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy
is misguided and that this has lead to the erosion of American
military supremacy. According to Muravchik, Clinton's foreign
policy has been a &quot;jumble of improvised responses to crises
and to foreign and domestic political pressures and calculations
of electoral advantage.&quot; The author writes that Clinton nearly
doubled his proposed defense cuts so he could appear to look like
he is reducing the budget deficit, while not having to reduce
domestic spending. A symbol of Clinton's low priority given to
defense is his order for sharp reductions in the development of
strategic defenses. Muravchik also argues that Clinton's policy
with China, North Korea, Serbia, and Somalia, have substantially
hurt America's credibility abroad. Overall, Muravchik concludes,
Clinton's tenure as Commander and Chief has narrowed the wide
margin of security that came about with the demise of America's
Cold War rival. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute,

<B>The World Bank's Procurement Myth, <BR>
</B>by John Thibodeau
<P>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 43, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
John Thibodeau, Director of Research at Probe International, a
Canadian environmental group, reports that the World Bank's soft-loan
window, the International Development Association (IDA), is losing
many contributions due to its failed projects and the bank's increasingly
risky loan portfolio. The United States recently decided not to
contribute any new money to IDA in 1997, with any future funding
beyond that uncertain. Thibodeau argues that the World Bank has
launched a misleading public relations campaign to convince Congress
and the American public that U.S. taxpayers' contributions to
IDA are beneficial to the American economy. The World bank says
that such contributions are returned in the form of contracts
for U.S. companies. In reality, Thibodeau points out, U.S. firms
receive only about $0.23 in contracts for each $1.00 the United
States contributes to IDA. The IDA gets billions of taxpayer dollars
for bad projects and pork-barrel contracts for a few American
firms. Thibodeau concludes that Congress and lawmakers from other
donor countries should see through the World Bank's desperate
attempt to seek more funds and refuse to waste their constituent's
tax dollars on IDA in 1997 and beyond. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute,

<B>The Innovation Age: A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution,

by Peter Pitsch
<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Peter Pitsch, Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and the
former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications
Commission, shows why the United States cannot maintain its preeminent
position in information technology unless it reforms a number
of outdated regulatory restraints. Pitsch shows how artificial
regulations on a market, such as telecommunications, stifles the
progress and productivity that innovations were designed to stimulate.
Pitsch illustrates the superiority of a market-based approach
to regulation, and uses the theories of Austrian school economists
Hayek and Schumpeter to point out the flaws of planned economies.
Overall, Pitsch creates a positive image of what the future can
hold with an open-road policy toward the telecom industry. 120

<B>Lights Out on Federal Power: Privatization for the 21st Century,
</B><br>
by Michael Block and Rep. John Shadegg
<P>
<I>Future Insight</I>, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation<HR>

<P>
Michael Block, Senior Fellow at the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
and John Shadegg, United States Congressman from Arizona, urge
the privatization of federally owned power facilities. Power Marketing
Administrations (PMAs) were created during the New Deal to provide
a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas. Block
and Shadegg argue that demographic changes since the 1930s mean
that many of the areas deemed in need of subsidized power are
no longer rural or undeveloped. They argue that PMAs force taxpayers
to provide subsidized power to the rich, and they distort and
hinder competition and productivity in the electric energy market.
Block and Shadegg outline how the federal government should sell
three PMAs. Selling off this large source of frozen assets would
generate nearly $4.5 billion, and help reduce the budget deficit.
Finally, to overcome interest-group oppostion to PMA privatization,
they propose that the current consumers of PMA power be given
the option to purchase shares in the newly privatized PMAs. 7

<B>Ten Thousand Commandments: A Policymaker's Snapshot of the
Federal Regulatory State,</B> <BR>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, <BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, CEI Fellow in Regulatory Studies, illustrates
that compliance with federal regulations, which are officially
off-budget, have quietly expanded into costs greater than the
entire GNP of Canada. According to Crews, regulatory costs absorb
almost 20% of the average family's after-tax budget. Politicians
can avoid accountability for more expenses to taxpayers by passing
mandates and regulations that transfer costs to business and consumers
and are not reflected in the budget. Crews warns that a Balance
Budget Amendment may pressure Congress to push even further regulations
that put costs off-budget. He calls for Congress to establish
rules that new agency regulations require Congressional approval,
and to establish a limited regulatory budget. Overall, Crews calls
for making regulatory costs as transparent as direct taxes, and
ensuring that Congress bears direct accountability for every dollar
that agency regulations cost voters. 23 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>A Revolution in Regulation: New York Must Treat Employers as
Customers to Compete for the Growth and Jobs We Need</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
New York's regulatory bureaucracy is a primary reason that the
state has an image of being hostile to business-and a record of
losing jobs to other locations. In addition to the hassle of overwhelming
amounts of red tape, these regulations can hurt or even shut down
businesses by imposing prohibitive fees, fines and taxes. Employers
must be treated as customers if New York is to compete for the
jobs and growth it needs, according to the Public Policy Institute.
The Institute recommends several steps to achieve regulatory reform,
arguing that key draft regulations should be rewritten before
they become additional burdens to companies. Also, needless regulatory
costs imposed by the Labor Department and the workers' compensation
system should be eliminated. Overall, the report recommends the
laws that limit the powers and responsibilities of regulators
should be enforced, and innovative use of new technologies to
achieve regulatory goals should be allowed to happen. 67 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Regulatory Costs in Profile, </B><br>
by Thomas Hopkins
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 132, Center for the Study of <BR>
American Business<HR>

<P>
Thomas Hopkins, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of
American Business, illustrates the vast extent of regulatory costs
in virtually every segment of the U.S. economy. 60 different federal
agencies enact and enforce countless regulations that result in
hidden compliance costs of $668 billion annually. In this book,
Hopkins presents estimates of annual private-sector compliance
costs with federal regulation for 1977 through 2000, and focuses
on the differences in compliance costs among firms. The figures
show that regulatory compliance costs facing all U.S. businesses
rose by $10 billion or more annually in the four years ending
in 1992 after a decade in which such costs generally moved downward.
With the figures presented in this book, Hopkins hopes to bring
a better understanding of the scope and incidence of compliance
costs to help facilitate a more rational debate about the role
and effects of government agency regulations. 25 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Capital Versus Labor? The Dubious Economics of Class Conflict,
</B><br>
by Alan Reynolds
<P>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper</I>, No. 195, Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute,
responds to the recent mood of hostility toward investors, property
owners, and corporate managers in recent press commentary on the
U.S. economy. Such hostility, according to Reynolds, seems to
be an encouragement toward class warfare between &quot;workers&quot;
and &quot;shareholders.&quot; He argues that the data contradicts
the assertions that workers and shareholders are  natural adversaries.
He points out that workers benefit only when productivity increases,
and that productivity depends on capital investment, which depends
on saving. It is punitive tax policies that explain the recent
sluggish productivity growth that has brought stagnation in employee
wages and compensation. Overall, Reynolds argues, the economy
needs more, not less capital, and the only way to end the stagnation
of employee wages is to decrease punitive tax rates against saving
and investing. 9 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center,

<B>An Analysis of the Dole-Kemp Tax Cuts, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Issue Brief</I>, Institute for Policy Innovation<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins, Senior Research Fellows at the
Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the proposed Dole-Kemp
tax cuts. Their analysis finds that the Dole-Kemp plan would boost
the U.S. real growth rate by roughly one-half a percentage point
over the next six years. They scored the proposed tax plan using
both static and dynamic methods. After adjusting for greater incentives
to work, save and invest, the economy, according to Robbins and
Robbins, would be 4.5 percent larger than it would have been without
the tax cuts, and would produce about 2.8 million new jobs. The
growth would offset 35 percent of the $551.3 billion static revenue
loss between 1997 and 2002. A standard distributional analysis
shows that 60 percent of the Dole-Kemp tax cuts would go to taxpayers
earning under $100,000. They also found that although the people
with the lowest 20 percent of incomes pay less than one percent
of federal income taxes, they would receive the greatest percentage
boost of after tax income in higher wages. 16 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>Understanding Washington State Taxes </B>
<P>
<I>Special Report</I>, Washington Research Council<HR>

<P>
In 1988, the Washington Research Council made a systematic review
of Washington's state taxes, and found the tax system to be fundamentally
sound. Since then, however, there have been a number of changes
in tax rates and bases. This paper, updates WRC's review of the
state tax system using five criteria: economic neutrality, fairness,
administrative simplicity, transparency, and stability. The report
 also provides a history of Washington's state taxes, including
a list of major tax events from 1889 to the present to show how
the state's tax structure has changed over the years. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Public Subsidies, Private Gain: Stop Violating the Oregon Constitution,
</B><br>
by Professor Dale Rubin
<P>
<I>Fiscal Insight</I>, No. 13, Cascade Policy Institute<HR>

<P>
Dale Rubin, Professor of Law at Willamette University, examines
how public subsidies lead to private gain, and how this procedure
violates the Oregon Constitution. He points out that legislators
explain that public expenditures that directly benefit private
individuals, such as professional sports teams, are legal because
they are extended for a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Rubin argues
that this response is simply wrong. He explains that the Public
Purpose Doctrine was not made in order to provide legislators
an excuse to spend taxpayer dollars on whatever project they choose.
In fact, the Oregon Constitution contains clear and unambiguous
clauses that explicitly prohibit the legislature and political
subdivisions from giving any aid to private individuals or corporations.
Rubin argues that the courts' misuse of the Public Purpose Doctrine
has made it possible for public entities to spend public dollars
on almost any private project despite a specific constitutional
prohibition. Rubin argues that the constitutional provisions prohibiting
the commingling of public and private funds have been rendered
meaningless by modern court decisions. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Cascade

<B>The Prisoners of Charity: Welfare 'Reforms' in New York Have Done Little to Break the Cycle of Dependency</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute finds that welfare reforms in New
York have done too little to break the cycle of dependency of
its recipients. After Congress enacted legislation in 1988 intended
to move welfare recipients into the workforce, New York took an
expensive detour to implement legislation that emphasized &quot;back-to-school&quot;
rather than &quot;back-to-work.&quot; These programs were a failure
and caused the percentage of welfare recipients in the job market
to actually drop. The Public Policy Institute argues that in order
for any welfare-to-work strategy to be successful it, must incorporate
programs that make work pay. They also argue that private sector
jobs need to be made to look more attractive compared to welfare
benefits. While raising the minimum wage reduces the number of
entry level jobs, lowering welfare benefits could send more people
into the shelter system-at a greater cost financially and personally.
Instead, the Institute suggests a &quot;fill-in-the-gap&quot;
approach that allows more wages to be kept before welfare benefits
are reduced. They conclude that overall successful reforms will
begin when it is acknowledged that the poor want to, and can,
take responsibility for their future. The report includes a foreword
by United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 47 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Arizona's Charter Schools: A Survey of Teachers</B>

<P>
During the Spring of 1996, the Goldwater Institute conducted its
second annual Charter School Survey. The first survey was directed
at parents. The latest survey was aimed at charter school teachers.
Arizona is home to approximately 30 percent of the nation's 350
charter schools. Approximately 16,000 students will attend such
a school during the 1996-97 school year. The results of this survey
tell a great deal about these charter schools, including teachers,
school and classroom configurations, teaching methods, parental
involvement, and students receiving instruction. Additionally,
the survey describes why educators are choosing to teach in charter
schools and offers a glimpse of charter school organization and
school development. 40 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank

<B>Competition, Choice, and the Structure of Public Education</B>
<P>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 16, Pioneer Institute<HR>

<P>
This paper is the transcript of a forum sponsored by the Pioneer
Institute on the state and direction of the Boston Public School
System. The forum included these four panelists: James Peyser,
Executive Director of the Pioneer Institute, and member of the
State Board of Education; Neil Sullivan, Executive Director of
the Boston Private Industry Council; Kristen McCormack, charter
school founder and former head of Federated Dorchester Neighborhood
Houses; and Edwin Melendez, Member of the Boston School Committee,
and Director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute at the University
of Massachusetts/Boston. In the opening remarks given by James
Peyser, the failure of school reform is blamed on the underlying
structural defect of public schools-the monopoly power of school
districts. He also argues that spending priorities have been out
of line. While real per-pupil spending has rise by 53 percent
from 1967 to 1991, only 4 percent of it went to regular education-the
core of schools. He argues that public school education priorities
have been driven by politics rather than the needs of the students,
the desires of parents, or the strategies of educators. Peyser
lays out a plan for structural reform of the Boston Public School
System in which there will be a system of schools, rather than
a unitary school system, that will place parents, students and
educators at the center, and will end the political and bureaucratic
constraints that have made past reform efforts fail. 11 pp. CONTACT:

in School,</a> </B><br>
by Dorothy Hanks
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 120, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dorothy Hanks, Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation,
examines how the Milwaukee School Choice Program, enacted in 1990,
has helped poor children succeed in school. Milwaukee's program
was the nation's first publicly funded school choice program,
and gave low-income parents vouchers to send their children to
private schools. Hanks relays the findings of a recent assessment
of the program by Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of
Houston Center for Public Policy, and Paul E. Petersen of Harvard
University's Program in Education Policy and Governance. Their
study reveals that the reading scores of choice students were
3 to 5 percentile points higher in their third and fourth years,
respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school
students. On math scores, Greene and Petersen found that choice
students were 5 and 12 percentile point higher for the third and
fourth years respectively. Hanks explains, in detail, how the
study was performed, and how it corrected the methodological errors
of previous studies on the subject of school choice. She also
lists a number of other bodies of research that back up the Houston-Harvard
analysis on the value of private schools among urban poor and
minority students. In the conclusion, Hanks emphasizes that the
success of Milwaukee school choice is now a matter of record,
and that it is time for state legislators and members of Congress
to allow low-income children to escape the failing urban public
schools. 5 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<P>
Despite the presence of serious flaws in current environmental
laws, conservatives have failed to develop a coherent vision of
how these laws ought to be reformed, writes John Shanahan, Environmental
Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the debate
about reform usually results in conservatives being falsely characterized
as &quot;anti-environmental.&quot; Shanahan offers an examination
of how conservative critics of our existing environmental policy
can better emphasize the good intentions of present law, and at
the same time, argue for elimination of the sometimes senseless
and oppressive regulations that burden the economy. He shows how
liberal policies have brought little in return for exorbinant
costs, and calls for tapping into the powerful forces and positive
incentives of the market and property ownership-incentives that
reward responsible behavior. Shanahan concludes that Americans
can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously
increasing economic freedom and growth. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris

panel speeches discussing different aspects of the Act. The first,
by Edward Yodowitz, a Securities Defense Litigator at Skadden
Arps, discusses proportionate liability, pleadings and motions,
and the safe-harbor provision of the new Act. Next, Mark Gitenstein,
a strategist in the Act's passage, warns about a California ballot-initiative

<I>Policy Analysis</I>, No. 259, Cato Institute<HR>

The issue of term limits will be on fifteen different state ballots

Supreme Court decision that voided federal term limits. Doug Bandow,
Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, argues that term limits are
needed, but, that the only way to achieve them is by a constitutional
amendment. Since Congres is unlikely to voluntarily approve one,
Term-limits supporters need to convince 34 states to call for
a convention to draft an appropriate amendment. Bandow believes
that if the states call for a convention that it would encourage
Congress to propose an amendment, in the same way that the Seventeenth
amendment came about.  16 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

Barry Maley, Director of the <I>Taking Children Seriously </I>program

of marriage despite the fact that legal, economic and cultural
change makes marriage less necessary and easier to end. In this
paper, Maley looks at ways to give marriage greater legal support
without creating undue obstacles to divorce. He advocates introducing
fault into divorce settlements as a way to indirectly re-enforce
the institution. &quot;Fault&quot; in divorce proceedings is where
one party-for reasons such as violence, substance abuse or child
neglect-is at fault in the marriage and that this should therefore
be taken into account in a divorce settlement. Maley concludes
that this reform would create clear standards of marital conduct
and give incentives for standards to be observed. 32 pp. CONTACT:

Cindy Silver, a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia, examines
family autonomy and the Canadian Charter of Rights. She observes
that a radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of
the family and state has developed. The state is taking an evermore
active role in protecting child rights as defined under the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Silver discusses
the impact on the family of state attempts to both define and
protect &quot;the best interests of the child.&quot; She reviews
certain recent cases that deal with the state superseding parental
rights over a child, and calls for affirming the importance of
the family by, once again, giving explicit recognition within
the Canadian constitution. Finally, she lauds a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that renewed recognition of the family
and provided a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial
polices of the state in cases involving the parent-child relationship.

<B>Settlement Reached on <BR>
Behalf of VCU Professors</B>
<P>
CIR represented six male professors who sued Virginia Commonwealth
University for sex discrimination arising from a 1992 &quot;women-only&quot;
pay raise. After the trial judge granted VCU summary judgment
on the basis of a regression analysis that purported to show a
pay imbalance between the sexes, the full Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed. The <I>en banc</I> court said that a question
existed as to whether the regression analysis actually established
a pay imbalance and remanded the case for trial.
<P>
The day before the September 23 trial date, the parties negotiated
a settlement. VCU promised not to adjust pay in the future without
considering merit, but demanded that the financial details of
the settlement remain confidential. The professors stated that
they were very satisfied with the terms of the settlement.
<P>
<B>CIR Represents Class Objecting <BR>
to Proposed Settlement</B>
<P>
In September, a class of non-black Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (BATF) agents moved to intervene in <I>Stewart v.
Rubin</I>. The initial case was filed as a class action lawsuit
in 1990 on behalf of all African-American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents. The plaintiffs charged the BATF's Office
of Criminal Enforcement with discrimination against African-American
agents in its hiring and promotion practices. The parties reached
a proposed settlement that received the preliminary approval of
District Court Judge Royce Lamberth on July 9, 1996.
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, the class of African-American agents
will receive a multi-million dollar cash settlement. Further,
African-American agents will be eligible for promotion pursuant
to an informal procedure that will be distinctly different from,
and far less rigorous, than that applicable to all other agents.
<P>
CIR, on behalf of non-black BATF agents, is challenging the race-conscience
relief provided for in the proposed settlement on the ground that
it is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,
there is  no evidence of present effects of past discrimination
and the remedy is not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government
interest.

<P>
<B>Due Process Due Private Contractors</B>
<P>
The United States Supreme Court has been asked to hear a due process
case, in which the Department of Defense (DOD) arbitrarily canceled
a lucrative contract for default, without holding a hearing mandated
by federal law.
<P>
In <I>DCX v. William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense</I>, a defense
contractor was hired to manufacture lighting equipment for the
government, and had hired a subcontractor (the only subcontractor
with the necessary technology) to test the equipment. However,
the government intervened in the testing schedule and forced the
subcontractor to test other systems with a higher priority. The
delay resulted in DCX being in default on contract. DOD then abruptly
canceled the contract.
<P>
In taking that action, DOD did not follow its own regulations
requiring it to assess the circumstances and determine whether
the default was excusable. Under the government's own regulations,
the assessment must be made prior to terminating a contract. DCX
sued, alleging that by not applying the regulations, DOD violated
DCX's due process rights. Had a hearing been held, DCX would have
shown: 1) the government was responsible for the delay; 2) DCX
would still be able to meet the contract delivery date; and 3)
termination of the contract would bankrupt several small businesses
that subcontracted with DCX. The federal trial and appellate courts
held for the government, and DCX has now petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the case.
<P>
In its <I>amicus curiae</I>, Defenders urged the Court to review
the case on the ground that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, government must act fairly when it deprives a
person of property, which in this case consists of contract rights.
<P>
<B>State Corners Market By Infringing Private Property Rights</B>
<P>
Defenders is co-counsel to Mr. Taylor who owns property surrounded
by the Cass Scenic Railroad in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
Mr. Taylor decided to build a restaurant and souvenir shop to
service the hundreds of tourists to the Railroad. At present,
the only concession stand in the park is operated by the state.
Fearful of the competition from Mr. Taylor's proposed shop, the
state decided to simply block the only access to the property
across the state land. On the day construction was to begin, the
state locked the gate to the public access road, and has refused
to allow Mr. Taylor entry onto <I>his own property</I>. Since
then, the state has proceeded to take any action it desires on
the property without the consent of the owner, including removing
trees and altering its elevation.
<P>
Defenders plans to file a lawsuit in federal district court in
West Virginia, alleging the state: 1) unconstitutionally deprived
Mr. Taylor of his right to use and enjoy his private property
in violation of the United States and West Virginia constitutions;
2) tortuously interfered with Mr. Taylor's economic advantage
by preventing him from establishing his business; and 3) unlawfully
trespassed on private property.

<B>Report on School Choice Cases</B>
<P>
Ohio - The parties are briefing the case in the Court of Appeals.
The IJ brief is due on October 29th. Jeanne Allen of the Center
for Education Reform has agreed to coordinate an <I>amicus</I>
brief on behalf of pro-school choice groups. IJ expects oral argument
later this fall, and a decision most likely in the spring.
<P>
Milwaukee - IJ is briefing the non-religion state constitutional
issues in trial court, with a resolution expected later this fall.
 The court granted the NAACP's motion to consolidate its lawsuit,
which it filed in August, with the ongoing cases. The NAACP repeats
the same allegations, but adds a racial segregation claim. The
court will hold that issue until resolution of the current issues,
and we expect appeals to follow the next ruling rather than awaiting
resolution of the segregation claims.  The IJ's goal is to move
the litigation along swiftly, winning on as many issues as possible
at this level.  So far, the NAACP's efforts to derail the case
have not succeeded.
<P>
Vermont - As expected, the ACLU joined the lawsuit challenging
Chittenden's decision to pay tuition at religious schools. At
a status conference on October 1, the trial judge ordered the
state not to withhold education aid from Chittenden, and directed
Chittenden not to pay religious school tuition pending a ruling
on its merits. The court directed the parties to stipulate the
facts, and indicated it would expedite the case and render a decision
later this fall. That means the case should be in the Vermont
Supreme Court this winter, and possibly in the U.S. Supreme Court
as early as next year.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>NELF Enters Declaratory Jurisdiction Dispute</B>
<P>
NELF has entered a case which threatens to undercut the usefulness
of the federal declaratory judgment law. A declaratory judgment
is a method of obtaining judicial determination of rights and
wrongs before a matter has reached the stage of ordinary litigation.
Businesses often use this procedure to eliminate uncertainty.
<P>
The case involves a looming patent dispute between EMC Corporation
and Norand Company. Norand sent EMC a letter claiming EMC was
infringing its patents and suggesting EMC pay it millions in licensing
fees. Negotiations broke down and EMC filed suit in Boston seeking
a declaratory judgment that there was no infringement. A district
court judge found that the dispute was not sufficiently ripe to
confer jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which hears patent-related appeals, affirmed, but on
different grounds. It found jurisdiction but held that trial judges
have almost total discretion to decide whether to hear declaratory
actions, even when statutory jurisdiction is conceded.
<P>
NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief in its own name supporting rehearing
which argued that declaratory actions are a valuable way to remove
uncertainty. By giving judges broad discretion not to hear such
cases, the court undercut that process and may have introduced
subjectivity into the judicial process. Judges can now avoid types
of cases they do not want to hear and, may choose to hear cases
which interest them and for which they may have preconceived views.
This conflicts with the ideal of a neutral, objective judiciary.
While rehearing has been denied, NELF is supporting EMC in seeking
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief in Connecticut <BR>
Property Tax Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association,
NELF has filed a brief in a test of whether that state's courts
will continue independent reviews of appeals from local tax authorities.
The case involves Hartford's taxation of copiers owned by Xerox
Company. The assessor used &quot;book&quot; value as the basis
for taxing the copiers, rejecting Xerox's evidence as to their
true market value, the statutory basis for local taxation. A Superior
Court judge affirmed the city's decision.
<P>
NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief to the Connecticut Supreme Court argued
that the judge erred by looking only to whether the assessor's
decision was &quot;reasonable.&quot; NELF argued that, because
of the inherent conflict between assessors' duties to apply the
law and to maximize tax revenues, courts can and must independently
determine all necessary issues including determinations of value.
Ceding that power to assessors could leave taxpayers vulnerable
to arbitrary and even malicious misassessments.
<P>
<B>NELF Defeats Effort to Tax Non-Profit <BR>
Legal Groups</B>
<P>
In a case with ramifications for all non-profit firms, NELF has
defeated the City of Boston's effort to levy taxes upon NELF's
Boston office. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that Boston violated state law when it denied NELF the tax exemption
statutorily allowed to all non-profit organizations.
<P>
The case began in 1991 when Boston reject NELF's first application
for exemption for its Boston office. Possibly referring to NELF's
successful challenge to a Boston ordinance, a city bureaucrat
sneered that the city would not &quot;feed the hand that bites
it.&quot; NELF appealed to the Appellate Tax Board and eventually
went to Superior Court. The city's position throughout was that
NELF was &quot;too political.&quot; While conceding that NELF
is non-partisan and completely avoids electoral politics and lobbying,
the city claimed NELF's work in the courts was an impermissible
effort to &quot;change the law.&quot; Eventually other property-owning
legal foundations headquartered in Boston were caught up in the
dispute when NELF's attorneys pointed out the hypocrisy of taxing
NELF while exempting groups with different missions.
<P>
The Court's decision resolves this matter. It stresses NELF's
essentially conservative role. Courts apply law, they do not make
it. By pursuing cases, NELF is not seeking to make new law; it
is trying to uphold the law as it already stands. The Court also
rejected Boston's claim that NELF serves too small a fraction
of the community to be entitled to exemption. It held that NELF's
legal work benefits the public as a whole and so NELF meets the
statutory test for a charitable organization.
<P>
By rebuffing Boston here, NELF not only protected its own interest
but also set a precedent that will limit future government attempts
to extract revenue from non-profits or to coerce them into tailoring
their missions to fit government's wishes.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief for Realtors in <BR>
Large Lot Zoning Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, NELF filed
an <I>amicus</I> brief with Massachusetts' highest court, urging
adoption of guidelines on how to review local zoning rules which
impose large minimum lot sizes. The case comes from Martha's Vineyard
where the town of Edgartown bars new housing on lots smaller than
three acres, substantially reducing the supply of affordable new
housing and imposing significant limitations on landowners' rights
to use their property. NELF's brief argued that the court should
require lower courts to give special scrutiny to large lot zoning
because of its negative impact on migration into the town and
because of its devastating effect on owners of lots under minimum
size.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>Texas IOLTA Program Derailed</B>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation scored a major victory when the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously ruled
on September 12, 1996 that Texas' Interest On Lawyer's Trust Accounts
(IOLTA) program is subject to First Amendment and Fifth Amendment
takings challenges. In <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation</I>, the court of appeals took
bar authorities to task for arguing that the interest generated
on clients' funds that are pooled before the funds are disbursed
to them is not the property of the clients. Comparing this fund
raising scheme to alchemy, the court ruled that interest always
follow the principal regardless of the amount generated. IOLTA
programs generate approximately $150 million<B> </B>annually nationwide,
which is used to supplement Legal Services Corporation funding
for activist groups. Texas bar authorities, along the American
Bar Association and other groups, are expected to seek Supreme
Court review of this precedent-setting decision, which conflicts
with a First Circuit decision also litigated by WLF.
<P>
<B>Superfund Law Challenged</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit in <I>U.S. v. Olin Corporation</I> seeking to uphold a
lower court decision that ruled that the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund
law, does not apply to discharges of hazardous wastes that occurred
before the law went into effect, and that if it did, the law as
applied would violate the Commerce Clause because there was no
showing how the inactive site affects interstate commerce. WLF's
clients in the case include U.S. Senators Bob Smith, Lauch Faircloth,
Larry Pressler, Alan Simpson and Representatives Michael Oxley,
Bob Livingston, Joe Barton, Sonny Callahan, Jack Fields, Jimmy
Hayes, John Hostettler, Enid Greene, and Bill Goodling.
<P>
<B>Junk Science Challenged in the Courtroom</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court of Nevada in <I>Mahlum
v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, arguing that Dow Chemical should not
be held liable for alleged injuries caused by silicone breast
implants made by Dow-Corning, a separate legal entity. WLF argues
that not only is there no credible evidence showing that the silicone
implants caused any harm, but that in any event, Dow Chemical,
which had nothing to do with the manufacturing or testing of the
silicone, should not be held liable because of a lack of legal
causation between the injuries and Dow Chemical. Rather, the plaintiff's
attorneys were simply trying to obtain money from Dow Chemical
because Dow Corning had filed for bankruptcy under the crush of
implant lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Sex Offender Law Defended</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Kansas v. Hendrick</I>
seeking to uphold state laws that impose preventive detention
on dangerous sex offenders after they complete their original
sentences. WLF filed its brief on behalf of Kansas state legislators,
asz well as Kansas's entire House of Representatives delegation
-U.S. Representatives Sam Brownback, Jan Meyers, Pat Roberts,
and Todd Tiahrt, as well as .

<B>Young America's Publishes Briefs on Social Security and Financial
Aid, and 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber Barons</I></B>
<P>
The latest two issue briefs from the Young America's Foundation
provide information on the issues of social security privatization
and reform of the student financial aid system, two issues important
to college-aged students. These two briefs will provide information
that will allow conservative students to challenge liberal professors,
fellow classmates, and slanted editorials on the two subjects.
 
<P>
YAF has also published the 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber
Barons,</I> by Burt Folsom, Visiting Fellow at the Mackinac Center.
First published in 1987, the book was widely praised and is now
assigned in scores of colleges and universities throughout the
United States. The book challenges the liberal interpretation
of the rise of big business that is found in many textbooks on
American history.

<B>Grove City College Rejects Department of Education Demands</B>
<P>
Grove City College in western Pennsylvania has announced that
it will end its participation in the Federal Stafford and Federal
PLUS loan programs at the end of the current academic year. The
college will replace the Stafford/PLUS loans for its students
with a privately financed loan program. Current regulations require
that Grove City sign a complex participation agreement that subjects
it to federal government oversight, and also to furnish audited
financial statements to the federal government. According to the
school this move reflects its long-standing principles of remaining
independent and free from government intrusion in the operation
of the College.

<B>Free Congress Foundation Video Tape: &quot;America the Bankrupt.&quot;</B>
<P>
The Free Congress Foundation has released a new video tape hosted
by the former Governor of Delaware, Pete DuPont, entitled &quot;American
the Bankrupt.&quot; The tape examines the &quot;true&quot; national
debt. The problems highlighted in the tape include: a national

Fiscal <BR>
Restraint Project</B>
<P>
The National Tax Limitation Foundation (NTLF) has initaited a
project to review and analyze state and local government fiscal
restraint mechanisms. The maturation of the tax limitation movement
at state and local levels, and the devolution/block granting of
functions from Washington to the states convinced NTLF to undertake
this project. NTLF is seeking to create a systematic body of knowledge
that can illustrate what types and combinations of fiscal restraint
devices work best to control state/local government taxes and
spending. This will provide a unique, permanent body of data and
analysis that NTLF hopes will enable policy makers to shape state/local
government institutions in a more fiscally responsible fashion.
NTLF plans to work with key players in each state: state policy
councils, ALEC legislative leaders, tax research groups, fiscaly
conservative academics and taxpayer advocacy organizations and
activists.  CONTACT: National Tax Limitation Foundation, State/Local

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Reviewing the Revolution: Conservative
Successes in the 104th Congress<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<P>
Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections,
conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress.
For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership
roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members
of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their
successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold
commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope
of government.
<P>
Considering President Clinton's many vetoes of major
legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming
government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks
and retreats, the 104th Congress has fulfilled conservative's
hopes in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation.
<P>
The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly
significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses.
While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with
only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses
had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed
by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents.
Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives
should appreciate the progress that has been made.
<P>
No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete
without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if
the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important
accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which
would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating
$245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would
have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.
<P>
This legislation not only represented the first balanced
budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in
government programs which would have returned power to states
and communities. In spite of the President's opposition, Congress
succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time
since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would
have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the
taxpayers' appreciation for cutting the Administration's projected
deficit nearly in half.
<P>
Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th
Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While
the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated
that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills
only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal
entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time
limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to
&quot;end welfare as we know it.&quot; But it was conservatives
in Congress who made this promise a reality.
<P>
In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting
conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced
by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill.
Congress restored funding for important national security programs
that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress.
Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of
costly federal mandates, and gave the President the line-item
veto.
<P>
Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton
health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this
Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that
had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance.
However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions
in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts
access to health insurance.
<P>
Congress has more work to do to complete work on
other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation
to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government
funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close
down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation
live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs
that were unthinkable before 1994.
<P>
It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state,
and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed
to reform it. The 104th Congress, has taken significant steps
to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states,
local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated
that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; The 104th
Congress has actually done something to turn this rhetoric <BR>
into reality.<BR>

A Challenge to the U.S., <BR></a></B>by Richard Fisher
<P>
<I>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</I>, No. 142, The Heritage
Foundation<HR>
<P>
China's moves to expand and modernize its air force poses the
first major challenge to the U.S. post-Cold War strategy in Asia.
With China's commitment to build a world class air force, Richard
Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues
that the United States must proceed with programs to guarantee
American air superiority in Asia. According to Fisher, the U.S.
should: sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter; maintain 12
Navy aircraft battle groups; develop an air-superiority fighter
for the Navy; accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile
and make advance U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies;
develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and
friendly Asian air forces; and ask Russia and Israel to curtail
sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.

Ariel Cohen, Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, scrutinizes the fall of the Soviet
Union on the grounds that it was an empire. Prior to the downfall
of the Eastern Block, Sovietologists held no consensus that the
USSR was an empire to begin with. This is one reason why the fall
was so surprising. In theory and writings on empires, however,
there was abundant evidence that the USSR was soon going to collapse.

Korean military and the leaders of heavy industry, will be the
powers who will control North Korea's destiny for the next few
years. The authors expect that North Korea will enter a period
of political instability and Kim Jong-Il will become little more
than a figurehead. The authors conclude that North Korea will
not likely improve its economy or stabilize its government in
the next few years. 19 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Antiproliferation of the 21st Century, <BR>
</B>by Kerry Herron
<P>
<I>Strategic Review</I>, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, United States Strategic
Institute<HR>

<P>
Kerry Herron, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, and Associate Director
for Security Studies at the University of New Mexico Institute
for Public Policy, examines the issue of &quot;full spectrum antiproliferation&quot;
as a nuclear deterrent in the post-Cold War world. Full-spectrum
antiproliferation presents an alternative to nonproliferation
and systematic deterrence. Herron explains that full spectrum
antiproliferation integrates: 1) polices that are designed to
slow and limit the number of states with nuclear weapons; 2) procedures
intended to reduce the nuclear dangers among proliferates by promoting
nuclear deterrence, nuclear surety (safety, security, and use
control), and responsible management of nuclear materials while
reducing the risks of nuclear terrorism; and 3) reactive capabilities
and policies for reducing risks associated with nuclear crises
that are not deterred or otherwise prevented. Herron believes
that full-spectrum antiproliferation is the best way to deal with
the world's current situation with nuclear missiles. According
to Herron, this policy &quot;recognizes the value of both prevention
and deterrence in coping with the challenges of nuclear proliferation,
and provides for their integration into policy options consistent
with a comprehensive proliferation strategy.&quot; He concludes
that twentieth century prescriptions are inadequate for twenty-first
century problems.  10 pp. CONTACT: United States Strategic Institute,

<B>The Nuclear Black Market</B><BR>
<P>
<I>CSIS Task Force Report</I>, Center for Strategic and International
Studies<HR>

<P>
CSIS's <I>Global Organized Crime Project</I> (GOC) was established
to develop short- and long-term strategies to deal with the threats
to U.S. national security in the post-Cold War era posed by global
organized crime. This report, produced by the Nuclear Black Market
Task Force, one of seven groups that make up GOC, focuses on the
supply, illicit trafficking, and demand for nuclear weapons and
weapons usable uranium and plutonium, from the Former Soviet Union
(FSU). The task force presents a bleak picture of poorly protected
storage sites for Russia's more than 1,500 tons of weapons-grade
fissile material guarded by demoralized and underpaid guards.
This creates a situation where terrorist groups or corrupt security
personnel, and even rogue states could obtain the components needed
to build a nuclear device. The current situation is ripe for struggling
nuclear workers to be tempted to steal or sell materials. Partly
as a result of dismantlement, the current trafficking trends have
upward trends. The potential for an accident or use of smuggled
nuclear materials is likely to increase. On a brighter note the
Task Force reports that certain trends are favorable. For example,
improvements in the material protection, control, and accountability
programs in the FSU is progressing, albeit slowly. Also the number
of deployed warheads has been reduced, transit states are starting
to use technical detectors, and the international community beginning
to respond to the problem. The Task Force has developed policy
recommendations in policy, organization, technology, legislation,
and international instruments. They recommend that U.S. policy
makers do the following: apply performance measures' aim for sustainability;
implement cooperative programs for material destruction and removal
of weapons from the FSU; develop bilateral safeguards with Russia;
consider exchanges on science-based stockpile stewardship with
Russia; encourage and enhance opportunities for bilateral cooperation
of law enforcement on a case-by-case basis; robustly support intelligence
efforts; pursue and prosecute nuclear smugglers to the fullest
extent of the law; and declare common policies on nuclear black
marketing and extradition with like-minded governments. 50 pp.

<B>The Prophets of Doom: The Security Threat of Religious Cults,<BR>
</B>by Andrew Hubback
<P>
<I>Occasional Paper</I>, No. 67, Institute for European Defence
and Strategic Studies<HR>

<P>
Andrew Hubback, a freelance writer and a commentator on security
affairs, examines the potential terrorist threat of some religious
cults. A recent example of such violence was the nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese religious cult <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>
(Search for the Supreme Truth). The <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I> attack
was only part of growing trend of violence by religious cults
directed at forces of authority within states and targeted at
the general public. Religious cult terrorism introduces a new
aspect to terrorist warfare-their violence is as inspired by religion
as much as politics. Even the most violent secular terrorist groups
have eschewed such cruel weapons as nerve gas because they believe
such an attack would be counter productive to their political
cause. As recent peace settlements in certain hotspots in Central
America, the Middle East and Southern Africa have shown, former
terrorist groups have some common interests with their enemies.
Some fanatical apocalyptic religious cults have no such rational
ends as peace with those they see as their enemies. Hubback briefly
surveys violent cults throughout history and illustrates the recent
increase in cult terrorism. He then goes into detail about several
groups including <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>, The Christian Identity
movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, and other international
cults such as the Order of the Solar Temple. He concludes with
suggestions on how to counter religious cult terrorism. He says
the first and most important step that should be taken is to recognize
the threat in the first place and be on guard. According to Hubback,
the security services of democracies should devote the necessary
resources to collecting intelligence on &quot;subversive, anti-social
and potentially violent cults. The authorities must be prepared
for a pre-emptive strike not only to protect the general public,
but to protect innocent cult members as well.  44 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Developing a Consensus for the Future: A Report of CSIS U.S.
China Policy Task Force</B><BR>
<P>
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<HR>

<P>
In 1994 the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS)
established the U.S. China Policy Task Force, co-chaired by Senators
Max Baucus (MT), Frank Murkowski (AK), Chuck Robb (VA), and Representative
Jim Kolbe (AZ), Harold Brown, a CSIS counselor, and Lawrason Thomas
of the Amoco Corporation. The Task Force has addressed several
issues affecting U.S.-China relations including: U.S.-China economic
and commercial relations; political issues including human rights;
domestic developments in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; regional
security; and cross-strait relations. U.S.-China relations have
developed to a point where disputes over individual issues pose
a threat to the overall relationship between the two nations and
prevent a consistent and coherent bilateral policy. This report
covers four elements that the Task Force believes U.S.-China policy
should revolve around; 1) developing a new consensus to reestablish
executive branch leadership and bipartisan congressional support
in regards to the priorities of U.S.-China relations; 2) a new
consensus that reflects &quot;value propositions&quot; to promote
U.S. interests and give direction to the overall relationship;
3) striving within U.S. politics and policy to accommodate both
pragmatism and idealism; and 4) the new consensus should hold
a firm U.S. position concerning cross-strait relations that acknowledges
that Chinese on the mainland, and in Taiwan, maintain that there
is only one China. The rest of this report covers the issues of
economic and commercial relations, political and human rights
issues, and bilateral and regional security relations, with specific
recommendations. 93 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and

<I>F.Y.I.</I>, No. 116, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Angela Antonelli, Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, shows that the 104th Congress has
made several strides toward cutting regulatory red tape and began
to return common sense to regulation. However, she points out,
alarmists have been successful in convincing the American people
a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences.
According to Antonelli, this Congress has a solid record of reforms
that will create a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory
system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels
of public health, safety, and environmental protection. 11 pp.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/cbrief27.html">Why Congress Should Privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,</a></B>
<br>
by John Barry 
<P>
<I>Committee Brief</I> No. 27, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, calls for
the privatization of the two largest housing-related government
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac). Ongoing hearings on the subject have brought forth the diverse
opinions of different federal agencies over whether federal sponsorship
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is necessary or not. Barry points
out that Congress is now considering privatization while at the
same time defending its oversight role. Barry says that Congress
should keep in mind two important facts to guide its decision
concerning the two GSEs: 1) Congress is ultimately responsible
for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers-so congressional oversight
of these GSEs is necessary if they remain government sponsored
as and place the taxpayer at risk; 2) the original mission of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary
mortgage market, has been fulfilled-so Congress should end their
sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barry includes other
reasons for breaking the links between Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, and the federal government: government intervention in the
mortgage credit markets is no longer necessary with the increased
availability of mortagages to all potential home buyers; the vast
size of the housing GSEs, due to federal guarantee, is a dangerous
presence in the capital markets; and the mixed private/public
nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of
interest. 6 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

</B>by Ken Weinstein and Thomas Wielgus
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I>, No. 1087, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
In the 1988 case <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I>,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers are entitled a refund
of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance processes.
In 1992, President Bush issued an executive order requiring that
federal contractors post notices to inform workers of their Beck
rights. However, the Clinton Administration has rescinded this
order and has cooperated with union officials to keep workers
from knowing about these rights. The Worker Right to Know Act
is currently under consideration in Congress. The bill would require
unions to get permission from their members in order to use mandatory
dues for politicking or other activities outside of collective
bargaining. Weinstein and Wielgus argue that The Worker Right
to Know would enable union workers to exercise their rights freely.

<B>Competition in Electric Power: Strategies for Reform,</B>
<br>
by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I>, No. 14, John Locke Foundation<HR>

<P>
Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, discusses deregulation
of the electric utility industries. Until the 1970s, it was assumed
that electric utilities were natural monopolies, and that electrical
service could not be provided through competitive markets. However,
examples of successful deregulation in the airline, banking, broadcasting,
energy, telephone and other utilities have made it less far fetched
to call for a similar deregulation of electric power. Steps toward
electric power deregulation have slowly been made since the disastrous
economy of the late 1970s shed light on the problems with electric
industry monopolies. In 1992 Congress mandated wholesale competition.
And by 1994 California and other states have even moved toward
retail competition. Bandow stresses the point that this process
of moving toward increased competition in the electricity industry
will not be without its difficulties. The complicated structure
of the system now as an enforced monopoly, with its state and
federal power subsidies, special regulatory impositions on utilities
for non-energy purposes, ownership restrictions of power companies,
and control of power grids, means that none of the issues can
be solved in isolation. Bandow calls for a federally planned and
enforced program to eliminate subsidies, contracts made under
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, non-energy
requirements, restrictions enforced under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUCHA) of 1935, and control over access to transmission
grids while limiting stranded costs. This whole process will be
complicated politically and any change will generate opposition
from some interests. Bandow stresses that utilities deregulation
will be a significant factor in improving Americans' quality of
life in the early 21st Century. He concludes by saying that the
federal government, states, industry, consumer groups, and other
interests should work together to create a true market for electric
power that will provide Americans with better services at lower
costs. 62 pp.  CONTACT: The John Locke Foundation, P.O. Box 17822,

<B>Understanding Electricity Deregulation in Pittsburgh,</B>
<br>by Jake Haulk
<P>
Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
Jake Haulk, Research Director at the Allegheny Institute, discusses
how the deregulation of the nation's electric utilities holds
extremely large potential benefits in terms of lower prices and
higher quality of service for consumers. According to Haulk, regulation
as it is currently practiced is no longer appropriate for the
U.S. economy. &quot;Regulation encourages too much capital spending,
provides no inducement to cut costs and results in huge and wasteful
expenditures on litigation of prices and other regulated activities.&quot;
Steps have already been taken to ease the transition to deregulation.
For example, Haulk points out, federal agencies have mandated
that transmission grids of all competition at the wholesale level
will be open to all qualified generators. Retail deregulation
will soon follow this introduction of competition at the wholesale
level. Haulk also says that all customers will be able to choose
among a number of suppliers and have a choice of service levels
and price schedules in the new competitive system. Transmission
and distribution companies will be separately owned and probably
still regulated, but the generators and retail marketers will
be free to operate in a profit maximizing manner. He conservatively
estimates that a typical local residential customer in Allegheny
County will save about 30 percent, or $350 per year on electric
bills. 16 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy,

<B>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</B>
<br>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
discusses the implementation of a Regulatory budget. He examines
the pluses and minuses of requiring Congress to set enforceable
limits on the amounts that federal agencies can force private
citizens to spend on federally mandated rules and regulations.
According to Crews, there currently exists a breach between rulemaking
and accountability. What he calls &quot;regulation without representation.&quot;
Congress loves to take credit for such legislation as the Clean
Air Act, but then blames the federal agencies, whose powers they
drastically increased with such legislation, for being &quot;out
of control.&quot; Meanwhile, the federal agency bureaucrats are
not accountable to voters. A regulatory budget would require Congress
to set and enforce cost caps on the regulations that the agencies
impose. Prioritizing what regulations bring the greatest benefits
and sensible protection would be a responsibility of Congress
and the agencies. Congress will become more accountable to the
voters for the costs and results of regulatory policy. Crews calls
for a few other steps to be taken to ensure that a budgeting effort
remains manageable and accountable. He calls for the establishment
of a regulatory cost freeze and the implementation of a &quot;Regulatory
Reduction Commission&quot; to address the existing $647 billion
regulatory enterprise; employing separate budgets for economic
and environmental/social regulation; and the controlling of hard-to-measure
indirect costs by abandoning the regulatory methods that most
often generate them. 28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute,

<B>How the Market Self-Polices Against Predatory Pricing,</B>
<br>

<P>
<I>Antitrust Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Donald Boudreaux, Professor of Economics at Clemson University,
and Andrew Kleit, Professor of Economics at Louisiana State University,
argue that market forces are more effective than antitrust laws
in preventing monopolies from occurring. Kleit and Boudreaux argue
that economic research shows that predatory pricing is not likely
to result in a monopoly. Rival competitors have the incentive
and the ability to withstand a predatory price war. They maintain
that customers and suppliers of the predatory prices often have
the incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts. Some elements
of antitrust law serve to thwart market forces of policing against
predation. Lawful 'private policing' strategies such as minimum
resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, and
price discrimination are rendered unlawful as a perverse consequence
of antitrust law. Antitrust prohibitions then increase the costs
of private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly. 20 pp.

<B>Candidates for Corrections Day: The Ten Worst Regulations of
the Federal Government,</B>
<br>
introduction by Robert Kasten
<P>
Institute for Policy Innovation, and Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<HR>

<P>
In a joint publication, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
and the Institute for Policy Innovation, present a list of the
top ten worst government regulations. In the introduction, Robert
Kasten, former Senator from Wisconsin, and Chairman of the Center
on Regulation and Economic Growth for the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, points out that government regulators frequently
far exceed the original intent of Congress when enforcing regulation.
Without &quot;sunset&quot; provisions, regulations stay in effect
even after they have become obsolete or outdated. To compile this
list, IPI and AdTI asked leading policy experts to write a brief
article on what they believed exemplified the worst regulations
from Washington. Kasten proposes that the regulations would be
perfect candidates for Congressional overhaul or elimination during
the next &quot;Corrections Day.&quot; Those ten regulations are:
the federal wetlands policy; the 60-40 rule; off-label drug use
regulations; the federal peanut program; the FDA's slow approval
process; Superfund; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; The Delaney Clause;
Discipline of special education students; and Toxic Release Inventory.

<B>The Impact of Enterprise Zones, <BR>
</B>by Terry Van Allen<HR>

<P>
Enterprise Zones are set aside low-income areas that have reduced
tax and regulatory barriers in order to stimulate economic development,
investment, and opportunity. Terry Van Allen, Director of Research
Initiatives at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, examines
the issue of how Enterprise Zones affect employment. He argues
that Enterprise Zones have a major impact on reducing unemployment.
His study also shows that vast majority of the new entry level
jobs go to the residents of the low-income zone, contrary to the
claims of critics. He also dispels the myth that most businesses
relocate to Enterprise Zones from other communities. Instead,
the evidence shows that most of the businesses in Enterprise Zones
have either been expanded or newly created from &quot;within&quot;
the designated communities. He also counters the argument that
the cost of providing tax incentives is too high. Van Allen argues
that poverty areas already have low tax revenues and high welfare
costs, so the benefits far outweigh the costs. The analytical
model that Van Allen has created projects that the designated
poverty areas on average can reach employment rate parity with
the surrounding more-prosperous communities within twelve years.
He recommends that the Clinton Administration and Congress increase
the number of Enterprise Zones and provide for capital gains tax
incentives within Enterprise Zones. 145 pp. CONTACT: Austin &amp;

<B>Is New York City Killing Entrepreneurship? </B><br>
by William Mellor
<P>
Institute for Justice<HR>

<P>
The Institute for Justice examines how New York City has made
it hard for self-employed entrepreneurs to pursue productive livelihoods.
New York's regulatory system is filled with entrepreneurs who
find that if they were to comply with the law, they would have
to abandon their way of making an honest living. The underground
economy in New York City now may represent as much as 20 percent
of the city's overall economy. This report looks at the government-created
barriers of licensing and permitting laws and public monopolies,
and their effect on entry-level entrepreneurship in New York.
They illustrate how obstacles to enterprise created by government
often times far exceed any legitimate exercise of government authority
to regulate in order to protect health and safety. IJ also focuses
on the tragedy, as well as the heroic efforts of those who try
to earn an honest living, despite the burden of senseless rules
and requirements whose main purpose seems to be to limit competition
in particular occupations. Finally, IJ makes recommendations for
how to create easier legal entry into entrepreneurial endeavors.

</B>by Bill Beach
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1091, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
As long as governments have been collecting taxes, the death of
well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors.
The manifestation of such a tax today is the estate tax. Except
the estate tax effects more than just the wealthy, with the hardest
hit being small business owners. Bill Beach, John M. Olin Senior
Fellow in Economics, puts forth the case for repealing the estate
tax, and identifies it as the &quot;worst tax of all.&quot; According
to Beach, the social and economic costs of the estate tax far
exceeds the revenue that it brings to the government. Growing
evidence shows that the estate tax: reduces economic growth, and
hurts the incomes of the people that wealth redistribution was
intended to aid; it increases the cost of capital, this slows
down research and development and the investment in machines that
would increase worker productivity instead-and thus wages; it
keeps the interest rates on home loans and other major purchases
unnecessarily high; and it does not raise very much money-and
may, in fact, cost government and taxpayers more in administrative
and compliance fees than it raises in revenue. Using two leading
econometric models, a Heritage Foundation study found that the
repeal of the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect
on the economy. According to the analysis, if the tax were repealed
this year, over the next nine years: America's economy would average
as much as $11 billion per year in extra output; an average of
145,000 additional new jobs could be created; personal income
could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current
projections; and the deficit would actually decline with the revenues
generated by extra growth. Beach points out that that estate tax
has few friends other than tax attorneys. 30 pp. CONTACT: Chris

</B> 
<br>
by Dan Mitchell
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1090, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy, explains
how dynamic scoring should be used to modernize the revenue-estimating
process. Dynamic scoring recognizes that tax policy effects the
economy, as opposed to static analysis, which assumes that tax
changes have no impact on economic growth. Mitchell argues that
dynamic scoring, if used properly, can help bring about sound
tax policy by reducing the politically unpleasant side-effects
of tax cuts. Static analysis does not take into account the fact
that a larger economy created by easing a tax burden brings in
larger revenue to government coffers. Politicians usually support
the idea of cutting taxes. However, they are afraid of being blamed
for the higher deficits that static analysis predicts will happen
with tax cuts. Mitchell lists several points that policy makers
should consider when taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating
process: learn from history that static scoring overestimates
how much revenue will be generated by a tax increase, while underestimating
the revenue feedback that pro-growth tax changes will generate;
realize that dynamic analysis is not perfect, as opposed to static
analysis which is guaranteed to give the wrong answer; tax cuts
that have a greater effect on behavior, such as a capital gains
tax cut have a greater revenue feedback effect; policy makers
should insist that taxpayers get full disclosure on whatever model
and methodology is used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee
on Taxation and the Treasury Department; have the goal of tax
policy be the maximization of growth, not tax revenue; and include
the estimated private and governmental compliance costs of taxation.
Mitchell concludes by saying that dynamic forecasting is based
on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and that history
has shown this approach to be more realistic. 17 pp. CONTACT:

This report from Cato presents an objective, comparative analysis
of the spending and tax policies of 46 state governors. Stephen
Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, and Dean Stansel, Fiscal
Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, constructed a 14-variable
index of fiscal performance and applied it to the records of each
governor who took office before 1993. The authors then graded
each of the governors on their fiscal conservatism. George Pataki
of New York, Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, and Fife Symington
of Arizona, received the grade of &quot;A.&quot; Gaston Caperton
of West Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware, Lawton Chiles of Florida,
and George Voinovich of Ohio received &quot;F's.&quot; A significant
trend that was uncovered by the study was that states have become
more fiscally conservative since 1994, and the new governors as
a class tend to be more fiscally conservative than those elected
before 1993. 84 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<B>Accounting for Growth: Incorporating Dynamic Analysis Into
Revenue Estimation, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 138, Institute for Policy Innovation
<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin Senior Research Fellow at the Institute
for Policy Innovation, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley Senior Research
Fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the issue
of &quot;dynamic analysis.&quot; Dynamic economic analysis is
the process of estimating economic changes that occur because
of changes in tax policy. It does not assume that all economic
behavior and variables remain the same if tax laws or government
expenditures change. Robbins and Robbins used dynamic analysis
with three hypothetical changes: a per capita tax of $5,200; an
elimination of the capital gains and dividend taxes on individuals;
and a uniform rate for individual and corporate income taxes of
19 percent, all with a commonly accepted baseline of 2.5 percent
annual growth from 1996 to 2010. They found that the head tax
raises GDP 22 percent above baseline by 2010. By removing individual
capital gain/dividend taxes raises GDP 8.5 percent, and the 19
percent uniform rate puts real GDP 7.5 percent above baseline
by 2010. Their use of dynamic analysis suggests tax reform aimed
at growth can increase annual output roughly 10 to 15 percent.
This boost would lead to more jobs, higher incomes, and an expanded
tax base which would bring higher revenues, not losses. 19 pp.

<B>The Hidden Heir: How Estate Taxes Are Swallowing up Family
Businesses And Farms-And How We Can Stop It</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute of New York examines the detrimental
effects of New York's state-level estate and gift taxes. With
federal estate taxes, and the additional burden of New York state's
top rates reaching 76 percent, owners of family businesses and
farms are often times forced to flee New York when they retire,
taking valuable assets with them. Most states do not add to federal
estate taxes, but simply take some of the tax that otherwise would
go to the federal government. New York collects the most revenue
of the states that do levy estate or inheritance taxes and has
the highest top rates on inheritance to children. Contrary to
the nationwide trend of states repealing their death taxes, New
York has been expanding its estate tax. This paper argues that
New York must reduce its rates, reduce the burden of the state
gift tax; conform estate tax credits to the federal level; and
make policy changes that can ease the transfer of family businesses
from one generation to the next. Finally, this paper argues that
New York could go further than a reduction in disadvantages, and
create an actual incentive for family businesses to locate in
New York state. By establishing a New York Sate Family Business
Fund, the fund could loan family businesses and farms money to
pay federal estate taxes. It would be capitalized with a small
share of exiting estate revenue flow-so that revenues from the
rich would pay for keeping family businesses and their jobs in
New York. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Public Policy Institute of New York

<B>Public-Private Promises #1: Three Rivers Stadium,</B><br>
by Grant Gulibon

<I>Report</I>, No. 96-14 Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
In light of the proposal to build a new government subsidized
baseball stadium in Pittsburgh, Grant Gulibon, Research Associate
at the Allegheny Institute, examines the rosy promises made in
a similar proposal approximately thirty-five years ago for Three
Rivers Stadium. Gulibon's report examines the claims used to justify
the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and contrasts them with
the stadium's actual performance since its opening. He found:
the original estimated cost of the stadium was $13.8 million,
while its final cost is estimated to be between $52 and $62 million;
the 83.5 acre site where the stadium was built was estimated to
cost $10 million in 1958, re-estimated to cost $21.72 in 1962,
but ultimately cost $45 million; Three Rivers Stadium was to be
a &quot;self-financing&quot; project which would not require city
or county operating support, but, has run up a $43 million deficit,
and has received operating subsidies for the Allegheny County
Regional Asset District; very little of the predicted private
development plans for the area surrounding the stadium exists
due to a lack of market demand; Through 1991 the city had over
$100 million on the stadium, still owes $40 million on the bonds
floated for the original construction, and had provided $27.1
million in subsidies for stadium operating deficits over the same
time period; deficits continued even after the stadium authority
hired a private management group to manage Three Rivers in 1982;
and St. Louis' Busch Stadium, four years older than Three Rivers
and nearly identical in size and design, privately financed and
has been privately owned and operated since it opened, was completed
under budget, has turned a profit each year since it opened, and
has been cited by baseball officials as one of the model facilities
in operation today. 19 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute, 7 Parkway

<B>Restoring Opportunity to Arkansas: Changing a &quot;Tax and
Spend&quot; State to a &quot;Save and Invest&quot; State,</B>
<br>
by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel
<P>
Arkansas Policy Foundation
<P>
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute,
and Dean Stansel, Fiscal Policy Analyst at Cato, discuss how changing
the tax policy in the state of Arkansas, would restore opportunity
to the state. In Arkansas, tax and spending has exploded over
the past fifteen years. Moore and Stansel list several examples
of Arkansas' heavy taxation: state spending is 50% higher than
it was in 1980-and spending has risen 12% faster than state income
in the same period; if the state budget had only grown at the
rate of personal income growth, Arkansas could both balance its
budget and give every family in the state a $1,000 tax rebate;
Arkansas' high tax burden is 15% above the national average, and
is weakening the state's competitiveness with other states; spending
priorities have been radically rewritten since 1980, from traditional
state responsibilities such as education, highways, and hospitals
to less productive and more redistributive goals such as welfare,
public health, and debt service; and that the state budget has
been growing at an annual rate more than twice that of inflation.
To solve these tax problems, Moore and Stansel offer the following
spending restraints and tax cuts: a 25% cut in personal income
tax rates, eventually to become a 5% flat tax to deliver economic
growth; indexation, which prevents state government from benefiting
through inflation; eliminate the state capital gains tax on new
investment, to have a giant impact on investment and job growth;
enact a one-year budget freeze to allow the rest of the state
to catch up; and finally, implement a constitutional budget cap
that prevents growth of spending from rising faster than the growth
rate of the state population plus inflation. Moore and Stansel
conclude that such measures have led to stunning economic success
in states as  different as Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey.

in tax rates, however, tends to make the economy perform more
favorably. Hauser notes that economists have debated for the past
two centuries over whether or not higher rates of taxation leads
to increased levels of government revenues. More recently, he
points out, the revenue generation forecast for the tax increase
of 1990 and 1993 fell short of the mark. According to Hauser,
higher tax rates tend to reduce the tax base because of the disincentives
that they cause to work, produce, save, or invest. There are also
incentives to hide, shelter, and underreport income when tax rates
are raised. Policy makers still continue to believe that increases
in marginal tax rates will raise revenues without the adverse
effects on economic growth, job creation, or standard of living.

<B>Operating on American Health Care: Will Free Market Reforms
Survive? </B>
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, American Legislative Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
This issue of <I>F.Y.I.</I> examines how free-market reforms concerning
health care have grown since the failure of the Clinton health
care proposals. According to ALEC, states are repealing the bad
reforms associated with Clinton Care, such as, community rating,
guaranteed issue, price controls, and managed competition. States
are now busy dealing with the massive managed-care systems and
protecting patient's rights. Instead of the centralized systems
of Clinton style reforms, states are moving toward market solutions
that allow choice to the patients and better overall care. !8
states have enacted laws allowing for medical savings accounts
(MSAs). Also in this issue, Dr. Merrill Mathews, Health Policy
Director at the National Center for Policy Analysis, discusses
solving the portability problem. He says that the problem should
be resolved without costing the federal government additional
money or distorting the health insurance market. States should
provide risk pools for uninsurable individuals. Kim Pacelli, ALEC
Research Assistant, briefly examines how states might reform Medicaid
programs if block grants are granted to states. More than 40 states
have already sought waivers from the federal government. 19 pp.

<B>Multicultural Mental Health: Does Your Skin Color Matter More
than Your Mind? <BR>
</B>by Sally Satel and Greg Forster
<P>
<I>Policy Brief</I>, Center for Equal Opportunity<HR>

<P>
Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale University
School of Medicine, and Greg Forster, Policy Analyst at the Center
for Equal Opportunity, examine a new mental health field called
&quot;cultural competence&quot; or &quot;multicultural therapy.&quot;
According to Satel and Forster, this movement threatens to discredit
traditional therapy and replace it with identity politics. This
concept of therapy sees human behavior as primarily culture-dependent.
So according to the theory of this practice doctors and patients
will experience mistrust and miscommunication if they are of different
racial or ethnic groups. It also assumes that white therapists
are racist. San Francisco General Hospital has the most prominent
cultural competence program in the United States. The doctors
in the mental health unit there specialize in different patient
groups-blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women,
and HIV-positive. The city of San Francisco has even created a
racial specialization for non-doctor health professionals: African
American Health Services Specialists. The authors argue that no
one believes that race and culture are irrelevant to mental health,
but that muticultural therapy seeks to establish rigid rules of
treatment based on stereotypes and groupthink. They conclude that
the patient is a human being, not a cultural puppet, and that
multicultural approach to psychotherapy spends more energy separating
patients into groups than treating them. 19 pp. CONTACT: Center

<B>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</B>

<P>
<I>Critical Issues Bulletin</I>, Fraser Institute<HR>

<P>
Cynthia Ramsey, Health Economist at The Fraser Institute, and
Michael Walker, Executive Director of The Fraser Institute, present
the Institute's sixth attempt to examine and document the extent
to which waiting lists are being used as a way of adapting to
the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and the potentially
unlimited demand for free health care. This year's results show
that Canadians waited longer in 1995 than in 1994 to receive medical
treatment. They found that patients in 1995 waited longer-10.2
weeks from referral by a general practitioner to a specialist
until the receipt of treatment-compared to 9.7 weeks in 1994.
They also found that the number of people on surgical waiting
lists and the amount of time they are waiting for the treatment
varies from province to province. Patients in Prince Edward Island
wait almost two months longer for surgical procedures than people
in Quebec. Fraser's survey measured what specialists consider
to be clinically reasonable amounts of time to wait for surgical
procedures. In almost every instance, the responding specialist
thought that patients were waiting too long for treatment. Ramsey
and Walker conclude that a plausible explanation for the waiting
times is that governments are using them as a way to control health
care expenses by rationing access to health care.  58 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Repairing the Ladder: Toward a New Housing Policy Paradigm,
</B>
<br>by Howard Husock
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I>, No. 207, Reason Foundation<HR>

<P>
In this report, Howard Husock, Reason Foundation Adjunct Scholar,
examines the reasons why housing policy for the poor has not worked.
He lays out an overall plan and specific details for an new housing
policy paradigm that is based on ongoing, already successful initiatives.
He argues that the problems of public housing and related subsidy
programs is partly a result of a fundamental misunderstanding
of the role which housing plays in social and economic life. He
also argues that replacement policies that emphasized subsidized
rentals risk creating a new generation of problems and complications,
including the further undermining of the social structure of civil
society in poor neighborhoods. According to Husock, housing must
be seen as more than a physical good, and viewed as part of a
social system. or &quot;housing ladder.&quot; The housing ladder
concept relies on the notion that to best serve the most people,
the fullest range of privately owned housing types must be built.
The desire of the occupants of housing to move up the ladder from
one type to another, and the need to protect the value of one's
housing investment, plays a key role in maintaining the social
fabric of neighborhoods, especially very poor neighborhoods. Husock's
concept of the housing ladder comes from historical data that
indicates that private, owner-occupied housing has played a key
role in the lives of those of modest means. He uses examples of
private, public and nonprofit initiatives which have begun to
build or facilitate the construction of the housing that regulation
or deep subsidy programs have made difficult to build in recent
years, that can lead the way to a new housing paradigm. 66 pp.

<B>The Social Security Fraud,</B>
<br>
by Abraham Ellis

Foundation for Economic Education<HR>

<P>
Abraham Ellis, a New York City attorney, illustrates that Social
Security is just another entitlement program, not an insurance
system. He also shows that the Trust fund is an &quot;economic
house of cards.&quot; The payments are continuously being raised
regardless of a retiree's contributions. Meanwhile, the receipts
from the Social Security tax go into general government revenue.
Ellis points out, that in the event of a real economic crisis,
the government would have trouble meeting its obligations to elderly
Americans that depend on it. According to Ellis, Social Security
is unfair to prudent young people who could produce much more
for retirement by investing the amount that goes into social security
taxes. Overall, Ellis shows that Social Security is just another
way for getting additional taxes from the people. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

percent of Americans believe that Social Security will require
&quot;major&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; change within the next
20 years. They also found that: 88 percent of Americans believe
that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in
trouble within the next 20 years; 60 percent of all Americans
under the age 65 believe that Social Security will not be there
for them when they retire; voters reject most traditional Social
Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll
taxes, or reducing benefits; and approximately two-thirds of voters
would support privatization of Social Security, and transforming
it into a privatized mandatory savings program. 7 pp. CONTACT:

the New York Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation

the State University of New York. They discovered a nationwide
trend in whereby students take an odd mixture of courses that
do not build on previous knowledge, while avoiding more fundamental
and serious subjects. For example, one campus mandates that students
take courses in physical education while at the same time does
not require courses in history, literature, philosophy, arts,
English composition, mathematics or science. In addition, intellectual
permissiveness and political correctness are running rampant on
these campuses with courses such as, &quot;Literature of Sports,&quot;Deviance,&quot;

<B>Charter Schools in Action: What Have We Learned?</B><br>
 by Chester Finn, Bruno Manno, and Louann Bierlein
<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Finn, Manno and Bierlein report their findings from the first
year of a two-year Hudson Institute study of U.S. charter schools.
The report focuses on the schools' start-up problems, solutions
to those problems, and the policy environments in which such schools
are most apt to thrive or falter. Start-up problems, not surprisingly,
include financial burdens and regulatory and political hurdles.
Among the many recommendations the writers make are setting up
charter schools to be legal entities in their own right, giving
charter schools the same per pupil operating funds that conventional
public schools receive, and using the charter model to develop
ways of holding all public schools accountable for their results.
Hudson suggests that charter schools may be the most vibrant force
in American education today and notes that the current demand
for charter schools far outweighs the supply. 127 pp.  CONTACT:

reinventing the federal role in education. Finn and Ravitch discover
rising enrollment figues in advanced math and science courses,
but disappointedly find that while more than three-fifths of high
school graduates now proceed directly to college, barely two-fifths
of them were in the academic track in high school. The study recommends
that schools continue to try to adhere to the strong academic
core that the National Commission on Excellence suggests. 66 pp.

<B>The New Paradigm on Environmental Enforcement: Environmental
Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</B>
<br>by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura Wolf
<P>
<I>The State Factor</I>, Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative
Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
R. Kinnan Golemon, a prominent expert in the field of Environmental
Law, and Laura Wolf, an environmental lawyer in Austin, present
a new paradigm for environmental enforcement. For the last twenty-five
years environmental regulation has focused on the &quot;command
and control&quot; model. Golemon and Wolf argue that this model,
which has developed an extremely complicated regulatory scheme,
is outdated and needs to change. They believe that a new environmental
regulatory model should focus on and encourage voluntary compliance.
Goleman and Wolf present &quot;audit privileges and penalty immunities&quot;
as part of the solution. These give an incentive for regulated
entities to conduct environmental audits without the fear of major
sanctions. The audits will promote candid, effective discussions
within the regulated entities to help find the causes of, and
the solution to, environmental noncompliance. They will also remove
the incentive to not identify or hide noncompliance so that the
problem can be solved in the most constructive possible way. 13

<B>Privatizing the Public Lands, <BR>
</B>by B. Delworth Gardner
<P>
<I>Focus on Utah</I>, No. 1, Sutherland Institute<HR>

<P>
B. Delworth Gardner, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brigham
Young University, argues that the federal government should dispose
of its public land in the West, and permit private parties to
own and control the land itself. According to Gardner, private
management is superior to public management in conserving resources.
In economic markets, the future generations are represented by
entrepreneurs who will profit from, and are most interested in,
conserving resources for their future use. She continues by stressing
that consumers and taxpayers are the beneficiaries if market products,
in this case, land use user fees, are priced at competitive levels.
Although some public management products appear to be free or
subsidized, taxpayers must pay for such things as the lobbying,
campaign contributions, propaganda, and court costs that are incurred
in order to influence public decisions. Privatization and market
allocation at a price would make it so each consumer would pay
for what he gets. Resources would be more productive, and products
would increase in variety in order to be tailored toward consumer
tastes. If private entrepreneurs marketed hunting and fishing
privileges, they would manage the resources more efficiently and
more successfully. Private firms also have a greater incentive
to stop undesirable managerial behavior than government bureaucrats.
Finally, Gardner argues that the federal government should gradually
dispose of the public lands, and they should try alternative ways
for privatizing the public lands, such as long-term competitive
leasing of public lands to private groups. 17 pp. CONTACT: Sutherland

<P>
John Tottie, Senior Economist for Tax and Budget at Citizens for
a Sound Economy, examines the $47 billion in research and development
(R&amp;D) spending by the Department of Energy (DOE)-supposedly
for the benefit of taxpayers and the U.S. economy. In the early
days of the 104th Congress, DOE published &quot;Success Stories:
The Energy Mission in the Marketplace,&quot; highlighting what
the department thought were its successes in applied energy research
and development. The 22 page report seems like an attempt to fight
off the much needed reductions in the bloated spending by DOE
on R&amp;D. Tottie argues that the private industry that stands
to benefit from the R&amp;D spending, not taxpayers, should be
responsible for the costs associated with developing scientific
knowledge that has specific commercial applications.  8 pp. CONTACT:

The Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned <I>The Polling
Company</I> to perform a nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters
nationwide. They found that most Americans support environmental
protection, but are not activists. They also found that most Americans
support a greater role for state and local governments in environmental
policy, and that state and local governments are better suited
at addressing environmental concerns than the federal government.
According to the survey, most Americans see devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights as being consistent with environmental
protection. Also, Americans see nothing anti-environment about
alternative approaches to environmental policy. CEI argues that
the challenge for supporters of environmental regulatory reform
is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy
that combines the public's concern for environmental protection
with their preference for limited government policies. Americans
have come to realize that extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and that pursuing
environmental reform is not &quot;anti-environment.&quot; 25 pp.

<B>A New Environmental Tool? Assessing Life Cycle Assessment,
</B> 
<br>
by Mark Duda and Jane Shaw
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 81, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
&quot;Life cycle assessment&quot; (LCA) is a process that attempts
to measure the total environmental impact of a product and its
manufacturing process. Mark Duda, Fellow at the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC), and Jane Shaw, a Senior Associate of PERC,
discuss the reasons why this procedure should not be used to shape
public policy. According to Duda and Shaw, LCA is useful to companies
that want to know whether the raw material they use might become
scarce or become environmentally harmful. When companies use LCA
their data is generally reliable and their goals are usually clear.
If such procedures were used for public policy and regulatory
purposes, argue Duda and Shaw, it would require that practitioners
use data from a wide range of sources and then translate this
data into environmental impacts. The averages and aggregates produced
would be inaccurate and would not describe the differences between
one product and another. According to Duda and Shaw, it is hard
to translate resource consumption and emissions data into actual
environmental impacts. For example it does not take into consideration
the environment in which production occurs. Overall, they conclude,
LCA makes sense for individual firms, which use it to plan how
they will respond to environmental regulations and to the environmental
concerns of their customers. If LCA information is collected at
the industry level it is not sufficiently accurate for making
broad public policy decisions.  20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

<B>A Turf Fight for Indoor Air Quality Protection, <BR>
</B>by Dwight Lee
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 79, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
Dwight Lee, an Adjunct Fellow for the Center for the Study of
American Business, discusses the bureaucratic turf war over the
control and regulation of indoor air. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) has jurisdiction over workplace
safety and is in a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency
over jurisdiction of indoor air quality (IAQ) in the workplace.
The agency that is able to gain control over IAQ will be in a
good position to expand its budget and power. According to Lee,
EPA and OSHA are using the political issue of tobacco smoke to
muscle for their larger budgets. OSHA has made a proposal to ban
smoking in all work sites under its jurisdiction. According to
Lee, OSHA's position relies on flawed and biased studies that
emphasize that indoor pollution can be addressed by singling out
particular pollutants such as tobacco smoke. In reality, indoor
air pollution is a general problem that cannot be effectively
dealt with by singling out particular pollutants. Lee argues that
OSHA ignores cost saving alternative approaches, ignores the advantages
of market incentives and exaggerates the benefits of regulation.
Overall, it exploits the politically contentious issue of tobacco
to grab for more power. Lee concludes that the only argument that
can be made for OSHA IAQ regulation is that it would be no more
inefficient than EPA regulation.  16 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

Bruce Yandle, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom

Auburn University, and Mark Brandly, a doctoral candidate in economics
at Auburn, call for the creation of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs). EIAs will recognize that different regions face different
environmental and pollution problems. Different regions should
be given flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways that
are best suited for their particular area, instead of the top-down
command and control system that we currently have. Yandle, Barnett
and Brandly call for an end to federal fuel taxes that discriminate
against alternative fuels. With EIAs, states and regions could
design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner
burning fuels for their area. Changing the laws that discriminate
against alternative fuel vehicles will be a lower cost way to
improve automobile efficiency and a reduction in American reliance
on imported petroleum than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards. 57 pp. CONTACT: Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

The trend of privatization, which was in part, inspired by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, is being hotly debated throughout
American government. This book is a collection of original essays
by distinguished scholars that examine the potential benefits,
as well as the possible pitfalls, of national and global privatization.
This book also provides several perspective on how privatization
can best be achieved. With the support of empirical evidence,
the various authors asses the institutional changes and economic

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1089, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Bob Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation, and Ed Meese, former Attorney General of
The United States and Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow at The
Heritage Foundation, present twenty-one steps that public officials
can take to support their local police. Moffit and Meese draw
upon the success of former New York City Commissioner of Police
William Bratton's short tenure, in which serious crime dropped
36 percent, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45
percent drop in murder. A reduction in crime does not depend upon
new cars or computers, more officers and bigger budgets. What
is most important, this paper says, is solid personnel management
and a clear mission for combating crime and disorder, with support
from the public, the state and the courts, and the press. Moffit
and Meese give the following suggestions for specific ways that
local officials can strengthen their police forces through their
own efforts: police should have a more back to basics role; police
should combat minor &quot;disorder&quot; crimes that provide an
environment for more serious crimes; raise the standards for who
can become a police officer; improve police compensation; target
hot spots; and reduce caseloads for detectives, among other suggestions.
Moffit and Meese call on the federal government to: block the
appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity
to public safety; review federal statutes dealing with crime,
and repeal the ones that impinge on the legitimate authority of
local and state law enforcement officials; review the impact of
the <I>Miranda</I> ruling; and pursue ways through enterprise
zones to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods among other suggestions.
Overall, states and localities need maximum flexibility to combat
violent crime. 37 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<I>Government Integrity Project Report</I>, No. 10, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at the
Heritage Foundation, reports that under the Clinton Administration
a string of federal grants have continued to subsidize the Laborers'
International Union of North America (LIUNA) even as government
investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence
in the union. Weinstein argues that restrictions or elimination
of grants to politically active groups such as unions should be
seriously considered by Congress. Meanwhile, Congress should act
immediately to: require that relevant grantmakers at certain federal
bureaus testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal
infiltration of LIUNA; prohibit organizations whose officers have
records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
renew efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and order
a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling
of federal grants. Weinstein concludes by pointing out that it
is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used
to pay for corruption and political activities, tax payers should
not have to pay as well. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<B>Civil Right and Sexual Behavior: An Analysis of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, <BR>
</B>by Paul Mero
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Paul Mero, a political consultant and congressional staffer, examines
how the Employment Non-Discrimination Act might lead to the adoption
of the entire homosexual rights agenda. He argues that organized
homosexuality, the political pragmatic side of the homosexuality
movement, has narrowly worded this bill as a calculated risk that
the final determination of this legislation will rest on some
very fundamental notions about homosexuality <I>per se</I>, and
whether or not mainstream America will accept these notions. According
to Mero, the narrowly worded language of the legislation is very
ambiguous and includes the curious term &quot;bisexual.&quot;
Mero says this term is one of the calculated risks with which
organized homosexuality is testing mainstream America. &quot;Bisexual,&quot;
is a person that has sex with both men and women. Unlike the word
&quot;lesbianism&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; which some
of the public can accept as possibly genetic traits, bisexuality
cannot be taken seriously, according to Mero. He argues that amending
the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the word &quot;bisexual&quot; would
be the same as society granting its crowning approval of promiscuous
sexual activity and to renounce marriage and traditional mores.
It would be no different than implying that promiscuity is a genetic
trait. Or it seriously confuses behavior with orientation. Mero
concludes by showing how organized homosexuality has exploited
the Hate Crimes Bill to further their agenda. They did it claiming
victimhood, confusing homosexuality with innate human properties
such as skin color, using bogus studies to support quantitative
claims of discrimination, winning the endorsement of former &quot;conservative&quot;
Republicans, and taking the media along for the ride with their
disregard for facts. Many of the same components exist for the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 17 pp. CONTACT: Family Research

<B>Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?</B>
<br>by Michael Weiss and Cathy Young
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 256, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
Cato Associate Policy Analyst, Cathy Young, and University of
Houston Law Professor, Michael Weiss, argue that the rise of feminist
jurisprudence has gone far beyond the original and widely supported
goal of equal treatment for both sexes. According to Young and
Weiss, the new feminist legal theory agenda is to redistribute
power from the &quot;dominant class&quot; (men) to the &quot;subordinate
class&quot; (women), while such key concepts of Western jurisprudence
as judicial neutrality and individual rights are declared to be
patriarchal fictions designed to protect male privilege. Some
feminist-initiated legal reforms have addressed real wrongs such
as the inadequate protection for victims of domestic violence.
However, say Young and Weiss, feminist legal theory has resulted
in increasingly loose and subjective definitions of harassment
and rape, dangerous moves to eviscerate the presumption of innocence
in sexual assault cases, and a broad concept of self-defense in
cases of battered wives. The authors conclude that Courts and
legislatures should not limit individual rights and reaffirm the
fundamental principle of the classical liberal origins of the
movement for women's rights: equality before the law regardless
of gender. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

The Heritage Foundation has examined what successes the 104th
Congress has had in achieving conservative goals. Despite setbacks,
bad public relations and Presidential vetoes, the 104th Congress
has been successful in meeting conservative's high expectations
in several key areas. Overall they began a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,

by Christine Olson and Robert Rector
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 228, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
According to Christine Olson, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
and Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467) will promote
the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most
poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The bill is sponsored
by Representatives J.C. Watts (OK) and James Talent (MO). It will
use tax incentives, regulatory relief, innovative school reform
pilot projects and homeownership incentives for areas of high
rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and
poor schools. Olson and Rector argue that the bill will achieve:
increased job creation; small business expansion and formation;
moral renewal; expanded educational opportunities; greater private
philanthropy to aid the poor; and greater participation by religious
organizations in providing services to the poor. This bill gives
Congress and the Administration an opportunity to change the way
the federal government has been involved in community development
over the last 30 years. The bill realizes that what our nation's
poorest communities need more than larger benefits checks from
the government is economic conditions that enable depressed communities
to become more profitable places for work and businesses. Olson
and Rector conclude that this bill represents an excellent opportunity
to make a bipartisan stand for children by tackling the root causes
of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. 18 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain,

<br>by Pat Fagan and Wade Horn
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 227, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Pat Fagan, William H. G. FitzGerald Fellow in Family and Cultural
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Wade Horn, Director of
The National Fatherhood Initiative, illustrate how Congress can
protect the rights of parents to raise their children. They argue
that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, introduced
by Senator Charles Grassley (IA) and Representative Steve Largent
(OK), will give parents superior standing over government and
its agencies in their children's education and in the protection
and formation of their children's moral character. Fagan and Horn
point out that the bill will declare that parents' rights to direct
the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which
government can curtail only under conditions of &quot;compelling
interest&quot; and under &quot;strict guidelines&quot; of judicial
procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
Overall, they say, the rights of parents as a group are disregarded
or endangered in too many cases by government officials. According
to Fagan and Horn, because of the persistent danger to the fundamental
rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations,
government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international
agencies and bodies, parental rights need codification into law.

<P>
John Walters, President of the New Citizenship Project, and James
O'Gara, Director of Research for the New Citizenship Project,
call for President Clinton to exercise leadership in the war on
drugs. They report that he has a poor record in this area. Interdiction
efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug
usage and emergency room admissions are up. Walters and O'Gara
argue that part of the problem has been not appointing effective
leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong antidrug
message, and inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated
to fighting drugs on the front lines. They call on Congress to
focus federal efforts on law enforcement and programs that work,
and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track
record of success. One way to do this is to allow funding for
drug counseling and rehabilitation programs provided by religious
organizations. Walters and O'Gara conclude that American taxpayers
deserve presidential leadership on this issue, and the complexity
of the issue is not an excuse for ineffective policy and lack
of serious effort. 15 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<P>
Edward Lazear, Hoover Senior Fellow, discusses how the culture
wars in America threaten our ability to absorb new immigrants,
and to benefit from the diversity already present in the United
States. He argues that much of the conflict of the culture wars
in America is generated by government policies that reduce the
incentives to become assimilated and emphasize the differences
in the population. Some examples that Lazear lists are: education
in one's native language; unbalanced immigration policies that
result in large and stable ghettos, welfare availability; and
encouragement of a multilingual society by allowing citizens to
vote in languages other than English. Lazear explores patterns
of cultural assimilation and makes recommendations on policy related
to immigration, education, and language that may lead to an end
of the culture wars. 32 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Federal Drug War Ignoring Great Ally: Faith-Based Treatment,
</B><br>
by Robert Maginnis
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Robert Maginnis, Senior Policy Analyst at the Family Research
Council, illustrates how the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs from drug treatment. Faith-based
drug treatment programs have consistently produced the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country for treating drug abusers.
State and federal agencies have tried to shut down several faith
based drug treatment centers because their practitioners did not
have proper medical qualifications This is despite the fact that
faith-based treatment has had much higher success rates at a fraction
of the cost of government endorsed centers. Maginnis says that
there are two differing schools of thought on the root causes
of drug addiction. Government agencies mostly believe that it
is a disease and should be treated as such. Faith based treatment
sees addiction as beginning with a moral problem and that treatment
requires an acceptance of moral absolutes. Maginnis says that
as far as drug treatment goes, one size does not fit all. Therefore
a diversity of treatment alternatives, including low cost taxpayer-free
and faith based programs must be available. The government should
not try to fight the drug war alone when the local faith community
can play a vital role in prevention and treatment. 12 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Violence Against Women Act Declared Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR won a victory on July 26, 1996, when U.S. District
Judge Jackson L. Diser ruled that the Violence Against Women Act
(&quot;VAWA&quot;), was an impermissible exercise of Congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause and the Enforcement Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<I> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic
and State University</I>, CIR represents Antonio Morrison, a Virginia
Tech football player, who was sued, along with two teammates and
the University itself, by a female who formerly attended the school.
The July 26th Order granted CIR's Motion to Dismiss the case based
on VAWA's unconstitutionality.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At issue in the <I>Brzonkala</I> litigation was the
section of VAWA providing a federal tort remedy for crimes of
violence motivated by an animus toward the victim's gender. Although
the Department of Justice and the National Organization for Women
argued that VAWA was constitutional because of (i) the enormous
impact gender-based crimes have on the national economy and interstate
commerce and (ii) Congress's power to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause, the court disagreed. Judge Kiser ruled that the Supreme
Court's recent decision in <I>Lopez v. United States</I>, striking
down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's Commerce
Clause power, undermined the arguments of DOJ and NOW. Finding
extensive similarities and few distinctions between the School
Zones Act and VAWA, Judge Kiser held that the latter was also
unconstitutional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for the Enforcement Clause claim,  Judge Kiser
points out, VAWA attempts to compensate women who are victims
of violent acts because of their gender, not because of the states'
denial of their Equal Protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR to Represent School Board in Supreme Court</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR, along with Michael Carvin of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge, represents the Bossier Parish School Board
in <I>Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</I>, a Voting Rights
Act case which should be argued during the Supreme Court's fall
1996 term. This is expected to test a question left unanswered
by the Court in its major Voting Rights decisions of last term:
whether a local government may be forced to create racially gerrymandered
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bossier Parish is a rural district of northern Louisiana,
with a minority population of about twenty percent. Because of
the highly scattered nature of the minority population, every
voting subdivision in the parish currently has a white majority.
This has not prevented African-Americans from winning local elective
offices in the past.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the Bossier Parish School Board unanimously
accepted a new voting map with twelve districts, all of which
had white majorities. The district lines were based upon nonracial
considerations; an identical plan had already been approved for
use in other elections. Nonetheless, the Justice Department refused
to dilute minority voting strength. This refusal was based in
part on the development by the NAACP of an alternate map, which
would include two oddly-shaped (but majority-minority) districts.
The Justice Department has taken the position that the Voting
Rights Act requires a system of race-based proportional representation,
or, alternately, that the failure to embrace a gerrymandered map
is proof of racist intent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Professor Sues Bowling Green State University
for Sex and Race Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Hartman v. Trustees of Bowling Green State
University</I>, CIR is representing Dr. John Hartman, a white
male professor, who has sued Bowling Green and the Accrediting
Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for
discrimination against him based on his race and sex. The Complaint
was filed July 1, 1996 in Federal District Court in Ohio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994, in response to an advertisement, Dr. Hartman,
a tenured professor of Mass Communications at Central Michigan
University, applied for a faculty position that would involve
teaching a class on diversity in media at Bowling Green. Despite
Dr. Hartman's excellent credentials, Bowling Green hired a less
experienced black female without a Ph.D. This hiring decision
came on the heels of the Accrediting Council's withdrawal of full
accreditation from the Bowling Green School of Journalism because
the percentages of women and minorities on its faculty were less
than those in the general population.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Ohio Civil Rights Commission previously concluded
that there was probable cause to believe that Bowling Green discriminated
against Dr. Hartman in this matter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union College Sues Maryland Officials
for Religious Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In June CIR, along with Co-Counsel R. Hewitt Pate,
Sarah C. Johnson and Mark B. Bierbower of Hunton &amp; Williams,
filed a complaint on behalf of Columbia Union College in Federal
District Court in Maryland. The Complaint alleges First and Fourteenth
Amendment violations, and violations of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union is a private college affiliated with
the Seventh-day Adventist Church that applied for funds from the
State of Maryland through the Father Sellinger Program. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission denied the fund request stating that
Columbia Union was &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The Commission
has granted funds to Catholic schools such as Mount St. Mary's
and Loyola University, schools which, although &quot;sectarian,&quot;
are apparently not pervasively so. Columbia Union met all the
other requirements necessary to participate in the program and
asserts that the denial of funding by the Commission constitutes
discrimination on the basis of its religious beliefs and speech.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR wins reversal in Fourth Circuit in <BR>
<I><B>Smith v. VCU</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Smith, et al v. Virginia Commonwealth University</I>,
CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex
discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female
professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an <I>en banc</I> panel of
the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the
court obtained the support of six judges with three judges concurring
and five dissenting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>en banc</I> decision rejected VCU's attempt
to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity
between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of
material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's
study-like performance, productivity and merit-skewed the results
and permitted a false finding of &quot;gender disparity.&quot;

<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>High Court to Decide Who Can Sue Under ESA</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on November
13, 1996 in <I>Bennett v. Spears</I>, to determine whether a property
owner may assert an injury to an economic interest or constitutionally
protected property right under the citizens suit provision of
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners are two individual ranchers and two irrigation
districts in southern Oregon who rely on water from a series of
federally-operated reservoirs known as the Klamath Project. The
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
determined that a minimum level of water needed to be maintained
in the reservoirs to preserve endangered fish species that inhabit
the reservoirs. However, maintaining this water level threatened
Petitioners' beneficial and productive use of their property by
making the supply of irrigation water irregular.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners filed a &quot;citizen's suit&quot; under
Section 11(g)(1) of the ESA, challenging the decision on the ground
that the government failed to consider economic factors in making
the decision. The federal district court dismissed the suit, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the petitioners' economic interest did not fall within the
&quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by the ESA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders has argued that Congress specifically included
economic factors among those to be considered in making decisions
under the ESA. Furthermore, protecting private property rights
and economic interests is an integral part of species conservation.
Therefore, economic interests are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot;
protected by the ESA and petitioners should have standing to bring
a citizen's suit to protect those interests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Federal Pressure on Local School Board Violates
Constitution</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Sakaria &amp; Hillman v. Dare County (North
Carolina) Board of Education</I>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
orchestrated the condemnation of private beachfront property for
wetland mitigation, by backing a county school board into a corner
over a required wetland permit. The owners of the property that
is being condemned are now petitioning the United States Supreme
Court to review their case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners Elpis Sakaria and Mr. and Mrs. Hillman
each purchased a residential beachfront lot on Cape Hatteras Island,
North Carolina, to build a retirement home. Adjacent to the lots
is the local school. In 1988 the School Board needed to expand
the school's athletic field, to qualify the school for accreditation.
The Board owned 12.5 acres next door, enough for the expansion.
However, the Army Corps delineated 3 acres &quot;wetland,&quot;
and arbitrarily required the Board to create 1.84 acres of wetland
for each acre of wetland used to expand the field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From 1988 to 1992, the Army Corps rejected 41 sites
suggested for mitigation. With time growing short to obtain accreditation,
the Board &quot;negotiated&quot; an outcome with the Corps: the
Corps would grant a permit if the application included creating
a .5-acre wetland on the Sakaria and Hillman properties. The Board
filed the permit application, and immediately began to condemn
the private property. The property owners challenged the validity
of the condemnation of their property on Fifth and Tenth Amendment
grounds, but so far have been unsuccessful in court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders will file a brief <I>amici curaie</I> supporting
a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court arguing that 1) coercion by the Army Corps of the county
school board to carry out a federal objective at the local level
violates the Tenth Amendment and 2) a state agency violates the
Fifth Amendment when it uses its power of eminent domain to accomplish
a federal purpose unrelated to its narrow grant of eminent domain
authority.<BR>

<P>
<B>Hog-Wild Regulators Jeopardize Family Farm</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Warren family has been raising hogs in Chesapeake,
Virginia for three generations. But Earl Warren's livelihood is
now at risk because of a new city ordinance enacted specifically
to regulate him out of business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For over sixty years, the Warrens have operated a
traditional feed-lot hog farm. Over time, urban expansion has
moved into rural areas and now surrounds their farm. The Warrens,
however, have been able to adapt up until now by simply down-sizing
their operation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recently, the city has grown more aggressive in its
effort to make Chesapeake hog-fee, and adopted a new swine control
ordinance in April of 1992. Despite Mr. Warren's good faith attempts
to conform his hog-farming practices to the ordinance, many of
its mandates are arbitrary and have nothing to do with public
health and safety-making full compliance impossible. Indeed, the
farm has continued to comply with applicable environmental standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Mr. Warren does not fully comply, however, he
faces being shut down as a &quot;public nuisance.&quot; This flies
in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's admonition in <I>Lucas
v. South Carolina Coastal Council</I> that a legislature cannot
simply decree a historically lawful use of property a &quot;nuisance&quot;
without compensation being paid to the owner. In a lawsuit filed
against Mr. Warren on March 30, 1995, the city has openly stated
in court that its goal is to permanently close down the farm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the city is suing Mr. Warren, it has
not yet met its own burden of demonstrating that the farm is a
nuisance according to Virginia common law. Defenders' attorney
Barry C. Hodge is defending Mr. Warren in Circuit Court in Chesapeake.
A trial was held on September 8, 1995, but the court has stayed
its decision to hear further evidence as to the feasibility of
complying with the ordinance.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Sell Columbia Gas Eight Inches and They'll Take
Fifty Feet</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1995, Deana Drain and her husband Robert were
forced, at their own expense, to move their home and shed to comply
with a utility company's claim of a fifty-foot right-of-way for
the gas line that crosses their .44 acre lot in Randolph County,
West Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1950, a right-of-way was sold to the gas company
across what is now the Drain's property to install an eight-inch
gas pipeline. The agreement did not specify the width of the right-of-way,
therefore full use was made of the property over the years. A
shed was built six inches from the line in 1962, and the Drains
installed their modular home seven and a half feet from it in
1992.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In April of 1993, however, Columbia Gas informed
the drains that their buildings encroached on the company's newly
claimed fifty-foot right-of-way, and later sued the Drains to
force them to move the buildings. According to Columbia, the Drains
cannot put any structures-including fences and trees-within twenty-five
feet of either side of the pipeline. The new easement affects
one-third of their property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Gas bases its authority of federal pipeline
safety standards. Columbia asserts that these regulations allow
it to claim a fifty-foot right of way without having to purchase
the Drains' property through eminent domain. Federal regulation,
however, does not require a gas company to maintain a fifty-foot
right-of-way. Another inconsistency is that many other property
owners have buildings within the claimed easement boundaries who
have not been force to move them under pressure from the gas company.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With Defenders serving as co-counsel, the Drains
filed a counterclaim alleging Columbia Gas's action was an unconstitutional
taking of their private property. After a three-day non-jury trial,
parties are now preparing post-trial documents.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>California Religious Freedom/Property <BR>
Rights Violation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner, Mrs. Evelyn Smith, earns a living by
renting four townhouses she owns in Chico, California. Due to
her religious beliefs, she refused to rent a townhouse to an unmarried
heterosexual couple. The couple complained to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Commission, which found Mrs. Smith guilty
of unlawful &quot;marital status discrimination&quot; under state
law and prohibited Mrs. Smith from excluding heterosexual unmarried
couples from her property, even though &quot;heterosexual couples&quot;
is not a constitutionally protected class. The California Supreme
Court affirmed the decision, stating that Mrs. Smith could have
avoided the conflict &quot;by selling her units and redeploying
the capital in other investments.&quot; Mrs. Smith has petitioned
the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, on the
basis that the California law violates her First Amendment right
to religious free exercise and her Fifth Amendment property rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders presented the Fifth Amendment argument
in its brief to the Court supporting Mrs. Smith's petition for
review, that the California law violates Fifth Amendment rights.
Specifically, the law deprives Mrs. Smith of her right to exclude
others, which is among the property rights protected by the Fifth
Amendment Just Compensation Clause, and which has been identified
by the United States Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental
aspects of property ownership.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear
a challenge to a local zoning by-law that imposes a three-acre
minimum to build on residential lots on Chappaquiddick. The purported
public interest underlying the three-acre minimum was environmental
protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner Herring Creek Farm owns 215 acres of residential
property on the Island and had planned to develop it with homes
on one-acre lots for low- to moderate-income families. At trial,
Herring Creek showed that the three acre minimum did not advance
the stated environmental goals and further that the large lot
sizes makes home ownership nearly impossible for middle- and lower-income
families. The trial court upheld the by-law. This appeal to the
highest court in the state followed directly from that decision,
bypassing the intermediate appeals court due to the interest in
the high court in establishing statewide guidance on this issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> supporting
Herring Creed that the zoning restriction is constitutionally
invalid because it fails to &quot;substantially advance&quot;
the government interest in protecting the environment. The United
States Supreme Court has held that a law that derogates from private
property rights is invalid if the law does not substantially advance
the goal sought to be achieved by the law. Oral argument is currently
scheduled before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<BR>

<B>Indians Claim Right to Harvest Shellfish on Private Property</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Years before Washington became a state, the United
States purchased by treaty from 16 Northwest Indian Tribes the
right to use the beach and surrounding upland in Puget Sound.
Under the treaties, the Tribes retained their right to take &quot;fish&quot;
from all customary locations not staked off or occupied by settlers.
The State of Washington later took title to the tidelands and
sold them to private citizens. These private landowners have &quot;seeded&quot;
the tidelands to create new shellfish beds, and have harvested
the shellfish, enjoying exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the
tidelands for over a century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Now the United States-on behalf of the Tribes-is
suing the State of Washington, claiming that the Tribes' right
to &quot;fish&quot; includes the right to harvest shellfish even
on privately owned tidelands. The United States has offered no
payment of just compensation for its destruction of these private
property rights on behalf of the Indian Tribes. The outcome of
this case between the federal and state governments will affect
200,000 private property owners. The federal district court decided
the case in favor of the Tribes. The case is now before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I> in the
Ninth Circuit on behalf of 65,000 members of the Upland Property
Owners of Washington (UPOW), which has intervened in the lawsuit.
Defenders advanced three property rights arguments. First, the
United States' claim to fishing rights for the Tribes constitutes
a physical invasion of private property and second, destroys the
private owners' investment-backed expectations in the tidelands.
Third, Defenders argued that the government's position in this
case violates the Equal Footing Doctrine, which requires that
any state admitted to the Union must be granted all rights and
privileges given to the original thirteen states.<BR>

<B>Milwaukee School Choice Action</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As expected, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Paul Higginbotham
in August refused to lift an injunction preventing Milwaukee school
children from attending religious schools in the choice program,
and ruled that the program violates the religion clause of the
Wisconsin Constitution. However, the judge dissolved the remainder
of the injunction, meaning that at least 300 more youngsters will
be able to attend nonsectarian schools this year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ruling followed four hours of testimony and three
hours of oral argument. Former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent
Howard Fuller led off with testimony on why the choice program
is essential not only to expand opportunities for minority and
economically disadvantaged kids, but to foment needed reform in
the public schools.  Zakiya Courtney testified on the real-world
effects of the program and the injunction. Two parents, Pilar
Gonzalez and Val Johnson-representing hundreds of others-offered
personal perspectives on what private schools have meant for their
children and economic burdens the families face in keeping them
there. Harvard professor Paul Peterson testified on his recent
study finding substantial academic gains among choice students.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, it was clear that Judge Higginbotham,
though moved by IJ's witnesses' testimony, found the religious
school aspect of the program untenable. He concluded that the
Wisconsin Constitution is more prohibitive than the First Amendment,
and that the program's &quot;primary effect&quot; is to advance
religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But Judge Higginbotham was not persuaded that the
plaintiffs showed a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their
other state constitutional claims, so he lifted the rest of the
injunction on the enrollment caps. That means the number of eligible
students increases from 1,500 to 15,000; and that schools may
enroll up to 100 percent of their students from the choice program
(up from 65 percent.) Last year, about 1,500 choice students were
enrolled in nonsectarian schools in the choice program. This year,
about 1,900 applied to nonsectarian schools. They now will be
able to attend, which also somewhat relieves the pressure on the
PAVE program to provide scholarships.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the litigation front, IJ will attempt to extricate
the religion issues from the remainder of the case and seek an
immediate appeal of that portion of the judge's ruling. The non-religion
issues are schedule for three rounds of briefs and argument before
Judge Higginbotham over the next three months. Also, on the eve
of the hearing, the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming the expanded
program promotes racial segregation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religious School Choice in Vermont</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will file a lawsuit this week against the State of Vermont
on behalf of the Chittenden school board. The board voted to include
religious high schools among those available to students at public
expense. (Vermont towns that have no public  high schools pay
tuition for students at neighboring public high schools or private
schools.) Contending that tuition payment at religious schools
chosen by parents violates the First Amendment, the state has
cut off all education funds to the town, even though the portion
that would be allocated for religious high school tuition constitutes
only two percent of the town's education funding.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will seek a preliminary injunction in state
court, arguing that (1) including religious schools among the
options does not violate the First Amendment, (2) exclusion of
religious schools violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
and (3) the cutoff of state funds exceeds the state's authority.

<B>Landmark Legal Foundation Blasts Senate Ethics Committee</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Landmark Legal Foundation, co-counsel to former RTC
criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis, who last year testified before
the Senate Special Committee investigating Whitewater, blasted
the Senate Ethics Committee for its failure to sanction Maryland
Senator Paul Sarbanes and the Whitewater Committee's minority
chief counsel, Richard Ben-Veniste, for their use of a private
letter written by Lewis, which was &quot;undeleted&quot; from
a computer diskette.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Ethics Committee completely abdicated its
responsibility to Ms. Lewis and to all Americans. Senators and
Senate staffers are not above the law,&quot; said Landmark President
Mark R. Levin, who filed the ethics complaint on Lewis's behalf
last December. &quot;They are not free to behave as rogue federal
police violating the privacy rights of witnesses appearing before
Congress. Nor are they free to take a witness's personal property,
which they did in this case.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lewis's 22-page personal letter, which was unrelated
to Lewis's work in investigating Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan and the Whitewater Development Corporation, was apparently
retrieved by computer technicians from a computer diskette Lewis
produced in response to the Senate Whitewater Committee's subpoena
for information relevant to her investigative work. Since her
letter was not subject to the Whitewater Committee's subpoena
as it fell outside its subject matter and time frame, when Senator
Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste retrieved it from the diskette they violated
Ms. Lewis's Fourth Amendment privacy rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Astonishingly, the Ethics Committee did not
talk with Ms. Lewis or her counsel at any time during the nine
months following the filing of the complaint, though it apparently
interviewed Senator Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste to return to Ms.
Lewis her personal property; and, it offered no explanation or
justification for its summary dismissal of our complaint,&quot;
declared Levin. &quot;When the Constitution can be so easily trampled,
when an individual's rights can be so easily ignored, and when
Ethics Committee members close their eyes to these abuses, there
is something terribly wrong in the U.S. Senate.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Federal Appeals Court to Determine
Whether Students' Rights to Free Speech Includes Giving Religious
Messages At Graduation Ceremonies</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On August 14, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals reheard oral arguments in the case of <I>Adler v. Duval
County School Board</I>. This case is on appeal from a decision
of a federal district court in Florida which held that a school
board policy permitting students to determine what type of graduation
message they would give does not violate the Constitution, even
if that message includes religious speech. Arguments were presented
to the Eleventh Circuit in March 1995 on this case. The court
did not hand down a decision, but instead has asked to hear further
argument.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case began in May 1993 by challenging a school
board policy allowing the graduating senior class to elect to
have two minutes of uncensored speech to open or close the graduation
ceremonies. If the students chose to utilize the two minutes,
they would then elect a fellow student to address the class. The
content of the message was to be determined by the student addressing
the class and was not to be censored by the school. The school
policy allowed students to give any type of message, from poetic
speech to religious speech. During the 1993 graduation ceremonies
of the 17 schools in Duval County, 6 senior classes chose either
no message or a secular message, while the remaining 11 chose
a religious message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ACLU brought suit on behalf of 3 students against
the Duval County School Board arguing that this policy allowed
religious messages or prayer and thus violated the First Amendment.
Liberty Counsel, a religious civil liberties legal defense organization,
intervened on behalf of 11 students to defend the school policy,
arguing that the free speech rights of students was at stake.
If the school board were to lose the case, the students' free
speech rights would be taken away.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The men and women of northwestern Montana and northern
Idaho have just as much right to sue regarding violations of federal
environmental statutes as do organized environmental groups says
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In a decision
reversing a federal district court ruling, the appeals court held
that rural residents of the timber producing area have legal standing
regarding environmental issues despite the fact that their primary
concern is economic. In addition, the court held that statutes
governing the management of national forests are dedicated to
timber harvesting activities and that the local resident may sue
to challenge U.S. Forest Service decisions reducing allowable
timber harvests.<BR>

<B>MSLF Help Stops U.S. Forest Service</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A property owner in northern California says the
willingness of MSLF to provide her legal assistance brought an
almost immediate concession from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
even before MSLF filed a single document. For years, the USFS
had used the property of Kate Novoa without permission. Yet when
she objected, the USFS asserted that it had an easement over her
land. Remarkably, the USFS never produced documented proof of
its alleged easement. When Ms. Novoa advised USFS officials that
MSLF was willing to provide her legal assistance, the USFS suddenly
discovered that it had no easement over her land and agreed to
end its use of her property.<BR>

<B>Forest Service Ignores Facts - Locks Out Miners</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clinton Administration officials have taken steps
to prevent mining in Park County, Colorado by creating what they
call the Hoosier Ridge Research Natural Area (RNA). But in so
doing, they have ignored the fact that the proposed area does
not meet the requirements of federal regulation that the area
be &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;unmodified&quot; by act of man.
In addition, the area contains numerous mining claims of which
the federal government is well aware. Remarkably, none of the
federal documents supporting the creation of the Hoosier Ridge
NRA addresses the fact that the are is neither &quot;virgin&quot;
nor &quot;unmodified&quot; or the fact that mining claims are
present. As a result, MSLF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Park
County Mining Association and others seeking to have the RNA classification

Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit split 7 to 7 on overturning an earlier holding

that the phrase &quot;valid existing rights&quot; did not protect
the riparian rights of lake front property owners. A ruling by
a three judge panel of the Sixth Circuit that upheld the Michigan
court was vacated when an <I>en banc</I> hearing was granted.
Judge Danny Boggs, in a 40-page opinion, chastised both the federal

rights,&quot; and the other seven members of the court for upsetting
a delicate legislative compromise that permitted the designation

<FONT SIZE=2>In a case involving the Montana man who has become
the poster child for Endangered Species Act (ESA) abuse, the Interior
Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has ruled that self defense may not
be claimed in the death of a grizzly bear. John Shuler, who killed
a grizzly bear when confronted in his own yard, was convicted
of a violation of the ESA despite his plea of self defense. An
Administrative Law Judge ruled that although Shuler reasonably
feared for his life (the necessary precedent for the use of deadly
force), he could not claim self-defense since he was at fault
for introducing himself into &quot;the zone of imminent danger.&quot;
The IBLA upheld that remarkable ruling, declaring that since Shuler
knew a grizzly bear was outside, he should not have left his house.
Since the IBLA's ruling conflicts with the law on self-defense
(a homeowner may confront an armed intruder on his own property),
MSLF will file a lawsuit in federal court.</FONT>

building in Dummerston, Vermont into a day care center. But its
plan hit a roadblock in Vermont's Act 250. A jurisdictional opinion
by Vermont's Environmental Board held that the Town did not have

to adopt its subdivision rules. That let the state-wide Board
assert authority over the project.<BR>

while they were on strike. The case involves a labor dispute at
Yankee Gas. The company offered a raise but announced a plan to
later change medical benefits. The union did not immediately strike,
but refused to commit to staying on the job during negotiations.
Realizing that would leave its operations at the union's mercy,
Yankee put its offer into effect. The union promptly struck and
its members filed for unemployment benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The state ordered benefits paid to the workers because
it felt portions of Yankee's offer were inferior to the prior
contract. Yankee appealed. NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief with the
Superior Court, in the name of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association argued that the refusal to commit to staying on the
job prevented the union from claiming a lockout. The judge agreed
and reversed the order to pay unemployment benefits. He also noted
that the state should have reviewed the final offer to see if,
viewed as a package, it was inferior to the expired contract.

<FONT SIZE=2>NELF has joined with Lawyers for Civil Justice, a
Washington-based public interest group asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia to reconsider a decision which overturned
a settlement of a millions of prospective asbestos-related cases.
In this, <I>Georgine v. Amchem</I>, the District Court used a
Rule 23 class action to approve a single settlement in one &quot;case&quot;
which disposed of millions of individual cases. Notwithstanding
the proposed settlement, the Court of Appeals reviewed the class
action settlement to see if the underlying &quot;case&quot; could
have met requirements of Rule 23. Because it did not, the court
vacated the settlement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unless reversed, the consequences of this decision
on business and the judicial system will be dramatic and negative.
Instead of one comprehensive and fair settlement that resolves
the issue and caps businesses' exposure, there will be years of
litigation with inconsistent judgments, enormous legal expenses
and a lack of predictability. The upshot will be that, while some
plantiffs may get more money, many will get less, far more money
will be spent on legal fees and kept by plaintiffs' lawyers, and
courts will be crowded with hundreds of thousands of complex,

<B>Court Allows Second Bite at the Apple</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>California Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) is
fighting tooth and nail to get a &quot;second bite at the apple.&quot;
He and a handful of his supporters have filed suit in federal
court trying yet again to strike down term limits. Furthermore,
Bates' bid to undo the state term limits is being given a sympathetic
ear by a federal trial court that is disregarding PLF's precedent-setting
victory in <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> and is heading down its own
path requiring the validity of Proposition 140 to be litigated
through the court system all over again!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court has refused to dismiss the lawsuit and
has given Mr. Bates great latitude to make up arguments for keeping
his suit alive. For instance, the Berkeley lawmaker has argued
that since he was not individually named as a party to the first
Proposition 140 lawsuit, he was not bound by it. Well, Mr. Bates
may not have been named in that prior suit, but an investigation
of documents filed with the Fair Practices Commission revealed
that he helped underwrite it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Public records show that Mr. Bates spent $12,000
trying to defeat Proposition 140 at the ballot box, and when that
failed, he paid another $1,000 directly to the law firm that represented
the Legislature in the California Supreme Court for the purpose
of supporting the first challenge to state term limits. In addition,
a subpoena of that law firm's billing records revealed that not
only did Tom Bates help finance <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> litigation,
but 39 of his colleagues who were not parties to that case also
contributed to the lawsuit- to the tune of $229,000! With this
information  in hand, PLF went back to federal court demanding
again that Mr. Bates be bound by the first lawsuit and that his
suit be dismissed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of Mr. Bates' obvious involvement in the
prior case, the federal court decided that he could start the
case all over again in her court because in her opinion his contribution
was too small a sum to buy him &quot;control&quot; over the prior
lawsuit. The court would not accept that 58 legislators challenged
Proposition 140 in 1991 by either lending their names to the complaint
or by opening their pocketbooks, with nonparty legislators underwriting
 half the lawsuit. Instead the court has permitted the lawmaker's
lawyers to recruit two Democratic Assemblywomen, Barbara Friedman
and Martha Escutia, as additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

<P>
<B>Voting Districts Drawn by Race Rules Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In another victory for equal protection, the United
States Supreme Court held on June 13, that election districts
in Texas and North Carolina that were drawn along racial boundaries
are unconstitutional. PLF argued in both cases that race is an
inappropriate criteria for drawing lines for congressional districts
and that the interests of all Americans are ill-served by political
boundaries that isolate minority voters in so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot;
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Texas' 18th, 29th, 30th and North Carolina's 12th
congressional districts were oddly configured and bizarre in their
geographic configurations. There was nothing compact or contiguous
about the districts in question which were drawn for the sole
purpose of assuring the election of black representatives, while
completely disregarding traditional districting principles. In
both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the arguments made
by PLF which has long advocated individual rights over group rights
and the necessity for government to act in a color-blind manner,
both in the context of &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs
and in the context of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court
also rebuffed the Department of Justice's continuing attempts
to coerce states into a &quot;max-black&quot; scheme of maximizing
the number of minority districts, even when there is no compelling
reason to do so.<BR>

<B>Fate of Santa Monica Rent Control Before State Supreme Court</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under the pretext of &quot;helping the poor and the
elderly&quot; the Santa Monica rent control bureaucrats have been
taking rental property owners to the cleaners while expanding
the scope of regulation and control of rental properties throughout
the city. And yet, despite the economic and social harms it causes,
rent control remains a source of long-term security and prosperity
for the bureaucrats and huge administrative staffs need to keep
the program operating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Using 1980-1990 census data from Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Cotati, a California Apartment Association-PLF Rent
Control Project study reveals the damaging impact rent control
has on housing and people-particularly the poor, minorities and
the elderly. The study proves the bureaucrats wrong, rent control
does not accomplish what was originally intended, and this is
evidence that cannot be ignored.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CAA-PLF Rent Control Project fired its first
salvo in the war against rent control on March 16, 1994, against
the City of Santa Monica. That suit charged, among other things,
that Santa Monica's rent control ordinance effects an uncompensated
taking of private property in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition to showing that the rent regulations fail to advance
any legitimate governmental interest (and therefore are unconstitutional),
the suit challenges the local rent board's bizarre accounting
practices and determined whether owners receive a &quot;fair return.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A trial court threw out PLF's lawsuit claiming the
rent control board had a &quot;rational basis&quot; for imposing
its restrictions. Under this weak standard, rental property owners
have little hope of successfully challenging such measures as
unconstitutional takings. Fortunately, the California Court of
Appeal overturned that trial court decision in this case, ruling
that courts must not take challenges to rent control too lightly
and instead must examine such cases with a higher level of scrutiny.
In so holding, the court unanimously rejected the idea-urged by
the Rent Control Board and accepted by the trial judge-that courts
must uphold rent ordinances if they can imagine any conceivable
rational basis for enactment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court determined that if rental property owners
can prove that a rent control law has denied them economically
viable use of their land or fails to substantially advance a legitimate
government interest, then that law &quot;goes too far.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In so ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the trial
court to conduct a full trial and hear PLF's damaging evidence.
Greatly disturbed by the prospect of having to defend its rent
control regime and accompanying socialist policies, the city sought
refuge in the California Supreme Court where the case presently
sits.<BR>

<B>SLF Again Mounts Legal Assault on City of Atlanta &quot;Domestic
Partnership&quot; Ordinance</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The city of Atlanta in September enacted a &quot;domestic
partners&quot; ordinance, allowing for non-married<B> </B>partners
of City employees to receive healthcare and other benefits. SLF
filed suit in local superior court challenging the constitutionality
of the ordinance. A similar ordinance was enacted in 1993, and
SLF's lawsuit against the City in that case was successfully decided
by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court held that the City ordinance
defined specifically both &quot;dependence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;
for purposes of justifying the extension of employee benefits
in a manner which conflicted with the state constitution and statutes
and was therefore unconstitutional and void.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the present case, the City ordinance similarly
defines &quot;dependent&quot; in a manner which SLF attorneys
contend conflicts with state law. In a press conference held in
Atlanta in September to announce the lawsuit, SLF President Matthew
J. Glavin told the press corps, &quot;Atlanta has once again crossed
the line drawn by the General Assembly and the Georgia Supreme
Court by attempting to recognize relationships not recognized
at the state level. We trust that this lawsuit will once and for
all put an end to the City's illegal efforts.&quot; <BR>

<B>FDA's Dr. Kessler Ordered to Give Deposition</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF scored a major victory in its ongoing litigation
against Dr. David Kessler and the Food and Drug Administration
regarding the FDA's ban on dissemination of vital medical literature
to doctors on the off-label use of FDA approved drugs and devices.
In <I>WLF v. Kessler</I>, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia recently denied Dr. Kessler's attempts to prevent
WLF attorneys from taking his deposition regarding this clearly
unconstitutional FDA policy of censorship, and ordered him to
appear for a two-hour deposition. Justice Department and FDA attorneys,
however, are seeking to appeal that decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Represents Congressmen Seeking to Uphold &quot;3/5 Rule&quot;
on Taxes</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in <I>Skaggs v. Carle</I> on behalf of 22
U.S. Senators and Representatives who are defending the constitutionality
of the House's recently adopted &quot;3/5 Rule&quot; on taxes.
The rule, which requires a three-fifths vote rather than a simple
majority to raise taxes, is under attack by several Democrats
in the House and a variety of liberal organizations.  WLF's brief
argues that the plaintiffs claims are not justiciable and the
Constitution imposes no restraints on the House of Representatives'
power to adopt procedural rules.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Supporting Tort Reform for Municipal Governments</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw
out a huge tort award imposed on an Oklahoma county because one
of its deputy sheriffs allegedly used excessive force when pulling
a motorist from her car during a traffic stop following a high-speed
chase. WLF argued in <I>Bryan County v. Brown</I> that while public-sector
employees can be sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 if they
violate someone's constitutional rights, a municipality should
not be held liable for the actions of its employees unless those
actions were taken pursuant to some established municipal policy.
WLF urged the Court to reject the lower court's determination
that such a policy can be found to exist based simply on the municipality's
alleged negligence in hiring the deputy sheriff. WLF argued that
plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate that the municipality
repeatedly has made negligent hiring decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Demands Probe of FDA's Contacts with Plaintiffs' Bar</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently demanded that HHSs Inspector General
launch an investigation of meetings between senior FDA officials
and members of the plaintiffs' bar. FDA officials have had repeated
contacts with plaintiffs' lawyers who are pushing FDA to take
action unfavorable to the many pharmaceutical and medical device
companies who are targets of class action lawsuits. WLF recently
determined through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that FDA
has been failing to keep written records of all such meetings,
as it is required to do by law. WLF is demanding that the Inspector
General investigate the full extent of the violations by senior
FDA personnel. WLF charges that by attempting to hide their meetings
with plaintiffs' lawyers, FDA officials create the impression
that the agency has become beholden to a politically powerful
interest group, at the expense of the health and safety of the
American people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>High Court Sides with WLF in First Amendment Challenge to FEC
Rule</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down a Federal
Election Commission rule that restricted party committees in making
independent expenditures in connection with congressional elections.
The ruling in <I>Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC</I>
was a victory for WLF, which had represented eight Members of
Congress as well as former Senator Eugene McCarthy in the case.
The High Court accepted WLF's argument that the First Amendment
prohibits restrictions on the type of independent political speech
(i.e., campaign spending not directly controlled by a candidate)
at issue in this case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Court Once Again Says No to Racial Gerrymandering</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down racially
gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas,
holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits using race
as the predominant factor in drawing electoral lines. In the Texas
case, <I>Bush v. Vera</I>, WLF had represented Linda Chavez's
Center for Equal Opportunity and several Members of Congress who
opposed dividing the electorate along racial lines. WLF argued
that racial gerrymandering is unnecessary to permit blacks and
Hispanics to compete in elections on an equal footing and promotes
divisiveness between people of different races.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Commercial Speech Rights Supported</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF continued its strong advocacy of commercial speech
when it argued this month in the Maryland Court of Appeals (that
state's highest court) that Maryland may not constitutionally
restrict the right of businesses to advertise going-out-of-business
sales. Maryland imposes strict licensing requirements on all such
advertising and has been attempting to fine a furniture store
that advertised a liquidation sale without first jumping through
all necessary bureaucratic hoops. WLF argues in <I>Jakanna Woodworks,
Inc. v. Montgomery County</I> that the First Amendment bars Maryland
from attempting to suppress advertising that the State does not
claim is false or misleading and that calls attention to activities
that are fully legal (indeed, that are not even subject to regulation
in Maryland).<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




	On almost every indicator of child well-being, children today fare worse than their counterparts just a generation ago. The reason: the dramatic rise, over the last thirty years, in the number of children living in fatherless households.  Indeed, children growing up without fathers are more likely to fail at school or to drop out, engage in early sexual activity, develop drug and alcohol problems, and experience or perpetrate violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Fatherhood Initiative was founded three years ago to counter the growing problem of fatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore responsible fatherhood as a national priority. With the support and involvement of such notable Americans as former U.S. Education Secretary <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, actor James Earl Jones, and pollster George Gallup, we developed the following three-part strategy for ensuring that more children grow up with a loving father. <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

First, we are pursuing an aggressive public education campaign highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of children and communities.  In fact, NFI has netted nearly 20,000 media mentions over the past two years. In addition, we have developed, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a national public service announcement (PSA) campaign to raise the awareness of every American that fathers make unique and irreplaceable contributions to the lives of their children, and that collectively we need to support and encourage men to be good and responsible fathers. One of these ads has appeared nearly a half dozen times in <i>USA Today</i>. In partnership with Radio America, we have also developed a series of two dozen radio PSAs featuring such prominent Americans as former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Senator Dan Coats, General Colin Powell, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Second, we are organizing coalitions of national and local community leaders committed to creating a culture that values and supports good fathers. In October of 1994, we convened the first ever National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, Texas, where hundreds of our nation's civic, business, and philanthropic leaders gathered to begin building a national consensus on the need to quickly reduce father absence. We then organized and hosted an interfaith leadership summit on fatherhood in June 1996. This summit attracted dozens of representatives from various faiths who discussed ideas for encouraging, both individually and collectively, engaged fathering.  Additionally, we are partnering with national civic organizations, including United Way of America and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, to stimulate local voluntary efforts toward father-friendly community building.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are also increasingly working with the nation's governors.  For example, NFI was recently awarded a contract by the Virginia  Department of Health to implement a state-wide fatherhood promotion campaign as part of Governor George Allen's citizen empowerment initiative.  As the coordinator of this effort, NFI developed a series of state-specific PSAs, hosted local fatherhood forums throughout the state, and developed a resource center to assist grassroots organizations and individuals to implement local fatherhood promotion efforts.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to our work in Virginia, NFI has been asked to provide consultation and advice to such diverse governors as William Weld of Massachusetts, Roy Romer of Colorado, Pete Wilson of California, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, as each seeks to find ways to promote, rather than discourage, responsible fatherhood through state policy initiatives. To help support our state policy work, NFI recently co-authored a document entitled "Seven Things States Can Do To Promote Responsible Fatherhood." Published by the NGA's Council of Governors' Policy Advisors, this report has been widely disseminated to state and local government officials.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Third, we are taking our pro-fatherhood message directly to individual men.  Through the skill building and community resource materials, we provide information on how men can become better fathers, and how local communities can promote, encourage, and support fathers.  One of our most successful publications, Father Facts, contains national data on trends in fatherhood, as well as research documenting the negative consequences of father absence.  We also publish a resource catalogue containing books, tapes, and other fatherhood products.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is substantial evidence that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Whether reflected in stadiums filled with Promise Keepers, the streets of our nation's capital inundated with Million Man Marchers, or news stories highlighting the connection between absent fathers and such diverse social ills as crime, educational failure and welfare dependency, fatherhood is in the air. Virtually everyone-from Dan Quayle to Bill Clinton-now agrees: fathers matter, and they matter a lot more than many had previously realized.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The job, however, is only half done.  Though few still argue seriously that fathers are superfluous, the number of children growing up in father absent households continues to rise.  This year, more than a million children will experience the divorce or separation of their parents. An additional 1.3 million babies will be fathered out of wed-lock. Overall, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the fatherless.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certainly, much has been accomplished.  But we must not delude ourselves into believing that the struggle to renew fatherhood has been won. Far too many children grow up in homes without fathers. The most important battles are still before us.  Achieving attitudinal change may be hard; but behavioral change is even harder.  And that is what our children need most of all.

<b>Neoisolationism and Global Realities,</b> by Murray Weidenbaum<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 130, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Murray Weidenbaum, Director of the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. cannot revert to isolationist policies in the post-Cold War era given the current and strong trends towards globalization. To support his argument, Weidenbaum presents eight major points which illustrate the increasingly strong movement towards globaliliztion. First, he states that existing technology and international competition have already made America part of the global marketplace. Second, he points to the fact that U.S. businesses are increasingly participating in the international economy given the potential high profits and growth rates. Third, he presents the argument that with growing numbers of cross-border alliances, transnational enterprises are becoming more and more common. Then, Weidenbaum argues that the booming economies and little government regulation in some foreign countries, have made it so the rewards of foreign investment far outweight the risks of political instability. The fifth point is the attraction the diversifying of investments internationally holds to businessmen seeking to minimize their vulnerabiltiy to regional recessions. Next he points out that the U.S. can not ignore the rise of China and other Southeastern Asian countries as Economic powerhouses; it must be prepared to compete with them both in the U.S. and Asian markets. Similarly, the continued process of economic unification in Western Europe and the growing strength of Germany, also demands a U.S. presence in the global marketplace. Finally, he argues that given the United States strong economy, too much potential for further growth exists in the international sphere that would be lost should the U.S. choose to follow an isolationist course.  Weidenbaum concludes by asserting that protectionism does not work and that as the twenty-first century approaches, private enterprises, not government, will lead the U.S.'s movements on the global stage. 16pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington Univers

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/fyi103.html">Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide for Missile Threat</a>, by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 103, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In his assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 report on America's need for a missile defense system, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation Baker Spring argues that given a host of inconsistencies, the report should not be used by members of Congress to help them determine their votes on the Defend America Act.  The act would commit America to the deployment of a missile defense system by 2003, but the intelligence community's report asserts that the U.S. is under no real threat of a missile attack in the near future.  Spring writes, however, that the authors of the assessment: 1) fail to address the threat posed by long-range missiles in China and Russia; 2) write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack; 3) are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles; 4) unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America; 5) underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation; 6) are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles; and 7) inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized launches against the U.S. Baker concludes by raising questions about the legitimacy of the report, noting that the General Accounting Office has launched an investigation to determine if the Clinton Administration intervened in the production of the report. 4pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">Will Clinton Pay the Price for America to Remain a Global Power,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1083, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Baker Spring, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its own proposed force structure for America's military by approximately $130 billion.  According to Spring, this coming shortfall will leave the United States with two options: 1) increase defense spending to match America's current level of international commitments; or 2) renege or partially withdraw from existing U.S. security commitments.  While opponents of defense spending have argued that with the Cold War over the U.S. no longer needs to have a defense budget three times the size of any other nation (as it currently does), Spring disagrees. He holds that the American military's distance from the areas to which it is committed and must project power, the high technology weaponry it uses in order to limit casualties, and its volunteer rather than conscription troops all demand higher levels of spending.  Spring also argues that reneging on security commitments could open the door to a host of international conflicts that a down-sized U.S. military could not deal with. In order to resolve the funding shortage, Spring calls for a large scale debate in Congress to alert the American people to the problem and ultimately lead the U.S. to be capable of meeting its global security commitments. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<i>F.Y.I.</i>  No. 104, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ariel Cohen, Senior Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, outlines a report written by advisors of Communist Party Leader and former Russian presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov. The authors of the report, proponents of hard-line communist doctrine and advocates of more aggressive military posturing, make a number of suggestions which, if adhered to, could prove profoundly disturbing for the United States. Such possibilities include: 1) Russia adopting a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats; 2) maintaining the conception of the U.S. and NATO as Russia's enemies.; 3) reorganizing Russia's military into a series of smaller but highly mobile units; and 4) preparing to reconquer by force the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Cohen cautions that regardless of the election's outcome, the views expressed in the report reflect those of many highly placed officials in Russia's government and military and could influence policy in the years to come. 11pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc141.html">Why Renewing MFN for China Serves U.S. Interests,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><p>
<i>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</i> No. 141, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Stephen J. Yates, Policy Analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, contends that revoking China's Most Favored Nation trading status would be directly contrary to the United States' interests in Asia.  China's human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, and a host of other problems have prompted many in Congress to call for the denial of MFN to China. But Yates argues that  such a revocation is not in accordance with either the MFN's historical or contemporary purpose. MFN, rather than being the extension of special trading privileges, is more aptly described as the normal trading status.  According to Yates, the termination of normal trade relations with China would have serious consequences. Rather than revoke MFN, Yates outlines a policy which he holds to be more consistent and cohesive than that carried out so far by President Clinton. This policy, whose aim is to promote both democracy and improved U.S. Chinese relations, includes: 1) renewing China's MFN status; 2) inviting China's president to the White House for a full state visit; 3) following a more broad-based strategy towards Asia; 4) using policy tools better suited to the problem; and 5) repealing or amending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 12pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/lect566.html">China: Friend or Enemy?</a> by Hon. Barbara Hackman Franklin<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 566, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Barbara Hackman Franklin, former Secretary of Commerce examines the relationship between the United States and China in light of China's growing economic, geographic and military importance.  Despite China's increasing commitment to free market principles, Franklin sees human rights, trade deficits, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and intellectual property rights as obstacles to improving ties between the two countries. Even with these difficulties, however, Franklin believes the U.S. must continue to strengthen its relationship with China. Only by doing so can the U.S. help to strengthen the democratic and free market ideas currently gaining strength in China. She argues that the current U.S. policy lacks consistency and direction. Her remedy for this problem is the adoption of a strategic framework, outlining the goals, objectives, and expectations for the United States' relationship with China.  Included in this framework would be actions such as granting China permanent Most Favored Nation status and bringing the country into the World Trade Organization.  Franklin concludes by asserting that only by strengthening its economic and political ties with China, can the U.S. help direct the course China will take in the years to come. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/lect562.html">Entering the Pacific Century,</a> by Senator Jesse Helms<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 562, The Heritage Foundation<p>
United States Senator Jesse Helms calls for a shift in America's policy towards Asian nations, condemning the Clinton Administration for its indecisiveness and lack of priorities.  Helms believes continued support for political and economic freedom should be first on America's Asian agenda.  He asserts that the U.S. must use a firmer hand in dealing with the People's Republic of China, refusing to tolerate China's flagrant abuses of human rights and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Helms also argues that the U.S. must encourage Japan to take a leadership role in the international community commensurate with its economic standing. Facilitating dialogues between North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan figure significantly in Helm's agenda for U.S.-Asian relations. Finally, Helms cautions that the U.S. must pay close attention to Russia's dealings with Asian nations and work closely with states in ASEAN in order to promote democracy in Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.  According to Helms, the U.S. must adopt a more cohesive Asian policy if it is to be prepared for the emergence of Asia as the focal point of political and economic power in the near future. 20pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>.

<b>Terrorism: The Failed Response,</b> by Geoffrey Lee Williams and Alan Lee Williams<p>
<i>Occasional Paper</i> No. 66, Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies<p>
Geoffrey Lee Williams, Professor of International Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Lee Williams, Director of the Atlantic Council of the United Kingdom, argue that although the power to terrorize with weapons and violence as a means to an end has a very long tradition, modern terrorists are distinguished from their predecessors by an adherence to ideology. Marx, Lenin, and Mao all considered violence to be useful only as an instrument for the advancement of the revolution. However, they were wary of the use of terror because the shedding of innocent blood could alienate "the masses." The authors also offer definitions in order to provide distinction between the various terms and euphemisms for terrorists. In addition, they encourage governments to cooperate in order to avoid further violence. 55pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Privatization 1996,</b> edited by John O'Leary<p>
<i>Tenth Annual Report on Privatization</i>, Reason Foundation<p>
In this annual report, the Reason Foundation provides a comprehensive account of privatization of government assets, enterprises, and public services. The first section focuses on trends towards privatization in the public sector at the federal, state and local levels. The next area of analysis examines the politics of privatization, looking especially at the experiences of Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Then, the report examines tools which will enable the government to understand the trends of activity based costing, contract monitoring techniques, and the use of competition within government.  This year's survey also covers contracting trends such as education privatization, solid waste management, and emergency medical services.  The final section of analysis looks at infrastructure trends, examining how industries as diverse as air traffic control, electric power, and corrections facilities are making the transition towards privatization.  68pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>Designing Comprehensive Privatization Programs for Cities: Pittsburgh,</b> by John Stainbeck and Paul Kengor<p>
<i>Allegheny Institute Report</i> No. 96-14, Allegheny Institute and Reason Foundation<p>
John Stainback, President and CEO of Privatization for America, and Paul Kengor, Research Fellow for the Allegheny Institute, examine the challenges faced by city governments struggling with falling revenues and rising expenditures. Their solution centers around a comprehensive city-wide privatization program. The program involves nine different types of privatization for a city's assets, services, facility operations, debt, and infrastructure. The plan relies on government involvement in the creation and implementation of the privatization process. In an attempt to strengthen their governing ability and improve the quality of services provided to their citizens, city officials work to determine the types of privatization their situation demands, the level of control they want to maintain, and the assets they are willing to put into play.  Stainback and Kengor caution that while some risks do exist, they are still far outweighed by the benefits comprehensive privatization holds. These include: 1) reduced government costs; 2) generation of non-tax revenue; and 3) improved capabilities of developing and financing infrastructure. 46pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220-3703, 412/937-4526, fax 412/928-1501

<b>Power Struggle</b>, by Kerry Jackson<p>
<i>FYI</i> May 8, 1996, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
Kerry Jackson, Editor of <i>FYI</i>, examines the current move towards deregulating the electric power industry.  According to Jackson, while some consumer groups and utility companies have reservations about opening up the electric power market to competition, the move toward deregulation grows stronger everyday, particularly among industry insiders. As Jackson points out, legislators in approximately 30 states are devising legislation that would provide the best service to consumers, but in a low-cost, competitive market. ALEC is addressing the issue with its Energy, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Task Force. Jackson concludes that competition within the electric power industry will lower costs for consumers and offer them the best form of consumer protection possible. 4pp.  CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Reinventing Air Traffic Control: A New Blueprint for a Better System,</b> by Robert Poole and Viggo Butler<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 206, Reason Foundation<p>
Robert Poole, President of Reason Foundation, and Viggo Butler, Chairman of United Airports Limited, Inc., assert that the Federal Aviation Administration: possesses a bureaucratic subculture; is subject to external micromanagement; and suffers from conflicts of interest between safety regulation and air traffic control operation.  In order to solve this problem, they set forth a plan by which a system of user fees would replace the current airline ticket tax and general aviation fuel tax. The authors believe that doing so would cure many of the FAA's structural weaknesses, leading to improved air safety, fewer flight delays, and shrunken operating costs. The new fee structure would be determined by aircraft weight and distance flown, and would exempt smaller, private aircrafts from most fees and taxes. To determine the fee structure, Poole and Butler recommend the development of a new user-controlled, not-for-profit Air Traffic Control corporation. Modeled after the ATC board which will soon assume control of Canada's air traffic control, the board would be set up and controlled by the government, air traffic controllers, airlines, and business aircraft owners. The new ATC system would be funded entirely by user fees and would be subject to arms length regulation by the FAA. Poole and Butler conclude that if the United States follows the example of not only Canada, but also Germany, Britain, and Switzerland, the fundamental problems of the system can be solved.19pp  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1085.html">Senator Pressler's Bold Proposal for Spectrum Freedom,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1085, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Adam D. Thierer, Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, examines Senator Larry Pressler's staff discussion draft intended to enforce a complete overhaul of the United States' wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Thierer asserts that the Senator's reform proposal is badly needed because the current system suffers from a host of problems, including a resistance to change and a lack of respect for First Amendment rights. According to Thierer, Pressler's plan would: 1) provide spectrum flexibility; 2) expand and make permanent the auction and allocation process; 3) create a second broadcast spectrum solution; 4) prohibit FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates; 5) demand release of more publicly held spectrum; 6) transfer all spectrum responsibilities from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the FCC and block grant public safety spectrum to the states; and 7) require a spectrum report to monitor progress. While Thierer, on the whole, endorses Pressler's proposal, he lists four changes which he believes would improve upon the initial plan. These include: holding outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users;  ending "public interest standard" regulation and guaranteeing equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic; ending protectionist policies in spectrum technologies; and  de-licensing the entire spectrum. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>A Free Market Solution to Groundwater Allocation in Georgia,</b> by Terry L. Anderson and Pamela S. Snyder<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Terry Anderson, Executive Director of Political Economy Research Center (PERC), and Pamela Snyder, a PERC Research Assistant with, discuss the overuse of the Floridian aquifer system by groundwater pumpers in Georgia. Anderson and Snyder write that the state's use of regulation to reverse overdraft of the aquifer is not being welcomed with open arms, but, in the absence of well-defined property rights to groundwater, water users "race to the pumphouse" to capture their share of the resources before someone else does. The authors offer a market-based alternative to proposed government regulation, calling for privatization of the Floridian aquifer system in Georgia on a regional basis by defining quantified groundwater rights and allowing their transfer among users. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>California's Fiscal Condition,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<i>Briefings</i> No. 1996-51, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies, writes that, despite some positive signs, the California economy is still not stable. Attributing California's recession in the early 1990s to dramatic tax increases, McClintock points to a growing state debt, deferral of pension loans, and several bookkeeping anomalies as key indicators of impending economic difficulties. With these economic weaknesses, he holds that California is ill-repared to deal with its crumbling infrastructure. Noting that while spending per capita had increased significantly over the past twenty years, California is now providing fewer-and poorer-quality services to its citizens. Based upon this, McClintock concludes that California's problems stem not from how much revenue the state is receiving but rather how that revenue is spent. To remedy this problem, McClintock suggests two fundamental shifts in how California's policy makers allocate the budget: 1) restoring the state's constitutional restraints requiring a balanced budget, prohibiting borrowing, and limiting spending growth; and 2) downsizing the state bureaucracy and incorporating more competitive, free market oriented principles into the provision of goods and services. 9pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>Small Business Survival Index: Ranking the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<p>
Small Business Survival Foundation<p>
Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business Foundation, examines the impact of a variety of taxes on small businesses on a state by state basis.  Asserting that how a government manages issues of investment and entrepreneurship is a vital economic matter, he concludes that high taxes and burdensome regulations will significantly reduce incentives for entrepreneurs to engage in high risk ventures. The end result of this process, according to Keating, is the restraint and diminishment of economic growth.  In order to provide both entrepreneurs and legislators with a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative degree to which their state promotes investment and growth, Keating ranks and measures some of the major costs imposed on entrpreneurship, investment, and businesses in each state.The Index surveys nine major government related costs imposed on small businesses and entrepreneurs. The taxes compared include: personal income taxes; capital gains taxes; corporate income taxes; property taxes; sales taxes; and death taxes. The survey also looks at the impact of unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation costs, and the total crime rate on small businesses.  Using these nine factors to shape his analysis, Keating summarizes the climate of each state for investment and small business opportunities.  13pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Social Security: Facing the Facts,</b> by Mark Weinberger<p>
<i>Project on Social Security Privatization</i> No. 3, Cato Institute<p>
Mark Weinberger, a partner in the law firm Washington Council, P.C., singles out Congress for their failure to address Social Security reform in the midst of the budget debate. Weinberger shows that the Social Security program could begin going bankrupt as early as 2113. He attributes this problem to the combined impact of the "graying of America," combined with increased costs and higher standards of living. To remedy this situation, Weinberger asserts lawmakers have four options: 1) reduce benefit payments; 2) increase the program's funding; 3) run up the federal debt; or 4) restructure the program so that people can save money in private accounts yielding higher returns. It is the fourth option, Weinberg endorses, concluding that it has the best potential for averting a potential crisis. 10pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Private Means, Public Ends: Volunteerism vs. Coercion,</b> edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr.<p>
Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.<p>
This collection of twenty-six essays, Edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr., Professor of Economics at Berry College, challenges the assumption that the government is the best institution to provide basic services such as policing, a transportation infrastructure, and education.  In his introduction, Mixon argues that while the trend towards privatization is gaining support, most people still endorse government involvement in activities as diverse as mail delivery and banking.  But it is because of the government's long standing involvement in these services, Mixon asserts, people have forgotten that private initiatives are also capable of meeting society's many needs.  In fact, as one essay, authored by Henry Hazlitt, concludes, private, voluntary means are actually more effective in serving the community than forced government initiatives.  Other selected essays by Barbara Dodsworth, William R. Allen, and William Dickneider focus on the relationship of government funding and art.  Clint Bolick and Raymond J. Keating write against regulation of the communications industry, while Hannah Lapp and Scott Payne make the case for increased privatization of education.  The revitalization of private charity rather than public welfare is discussed by authors including Gerald Wisz, Robert Peterson, and David T. Beito.  Finally, the deregulation and privatization of banking, transportation, and law enforcement, are the focus of essays by Richard Syll, William B. Irvine, and Nicholas Elliott.    CONTACT.

The history of taxi regulation in Hong Kong shows that the uncertain regulation is the major source of risk in that business, according to Christopher Hall, Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. After World War II, the taxi business in Hong Kong was basically a cartel of more expensive brand name operators controlled by the police as if it were a private enterprise with public monopoly rights. By the mid-1960s the burgeoning transport-bureaucracy introduced public auctions to allocate licences and, in effect, stripped the police of their power to control the business. The illegal taxi trade grew soon after. In 1985, the current de facto arrangement came about in which licence holders have gradually gained control of the taxi business. Hall argues that the taxi business would be a safe investment if regulation change, real and suggested, did not create so much uncertainty. 266 pp.  CONTACT: Hong Kong Center for Economic Research, School of Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 852/2547-8313, fax 852/2548-6319

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp14.html">Creating a Financial Services Industry for the 21st Century Part One: Tear Down the Walls,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><p>
<i>Heritage Talking Points</i> The Heritage Foundation<p>
John S. Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, condemns the current financial regulatory system which mandates the forced separation of financial services.  According to Barry, historically barriers were created between commercial and investment banking because of fears of high risk losses and conflicts of interest. But he argues that these fears are groundless, that in fact banks engaging in investment activities are less likely to fail than those that did not. He also asserts that integrated banks are less likely to succumb to conflicts of interest than purely commercial or investment banks. Having addressed the major arguments against bank integration, Barry outlines the following plan for modernizing America's financial services industry: 1) repealing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; 2) repealing the Banking Act of 1933; 3) eliminating federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and 4) allowing commercial companies to offer financial services such as individual savings and checking accounts, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services. Barry holds that the implementation of these suggestions will benefit both American businesses and consumers, providing them with more profitable investment opportunities, easier access to capital, reduced costs, and a more stable financial services sector. 17pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 102, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Angela Antonelli, Heritage Deputy Director for Economic Policy, illustrate that the real problem behind workers' declining take-home pay is not a low minimum wage, but rather the hidden costs of government mandates, taxes, and regulations. According to Wilson and Antonelli, government mandated benefits, ranging from unemployment insurance to workers compensation, dramatically increase the cost to employers to hire and keep workers on their payrolls. They also point out that growing numbers of government regulations increase the cost of employing workers and in the long-run drive down productivity, further escalating costs. Wilson and Antonelli assert that if Congress truly wants to increase wages and job opportunities for American workers they should not raise the minimum wage. Rather, they should focus on reducing the costs of employing workers by cutting payroll taxes; cutting the capital gains tax; enacting significant regulatory reform; and increasing the skills of the workforce. 10pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>How Corporate Welfare Won: Clinton and Congress Retreat from Cutting Business Subsidies,</b> by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel<p>
<i>Policy Analysis</i> No. 254, Cato Institute<p> 
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, and Dean Stansel, Cato Fiscal Policy analyst, demonstrate that the federal government currently spends $75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Despite that last year both Congress and the Clinton Adminstration pledged to attack this pervasive corporate safety net, the study finds that those promises have been largely unfulfilled. The study reveals that many corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. In addition, the Clinton Administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, the Administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in spending. The report concludes that an unwillingness to reduce the corporate social safety net undermines the rest of the government downsizing agenda. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>


<b>Georgia Jobs Tax Credits: Needed Incentives or Needless Subsidies?</b> by Dr. Steve Morse<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Dr. Steve Morris, a member of the Academic Advisory Board at the Georgia Center for Public Policy, argues that tax incentives passed in Georgia in 1994 to attract business were unnecessary and fail to address the real needs of Georgia's businesses. According to Morse, while such actions sound good in theory, in reality they have been proven to do little to affect a state's overall economic development. He bases his arguments on over thirty years of studies showing that most tax incentive programs simply give unnecessary tax incentives to businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Morse believes that if Georgia wishes to remain economically competitive in the coming years, it must abandon its current agenda of unnecessary tax incentives and adopt a policy which  focuses on factors businesses find truly important when making location decisions.  These factors include: 1) the availability of an educated and trainable workforce; 2) low taxes; 3) a high quality of life; 4) first-class research and development facilities; and 5) non-burdensome regulations. 9pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>How Title XI Ship Subsidies Sink the Taxpayer,</b> by John S. Tottie<p>
<i>Issue Analysis</i> No. 28, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
John S. Tottie, a Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, argues that the 60 year old Title XI Federal Ship Financing Guarantee Program, which guarantees loans for a wide variety of vessels and shipyard modernization projects, has accumulated $1 billion in loan defaults. Tottie posits that the case against Title XI is the case against entrenched political pork. Because the Title XI loans have a "subsidy value" and the resources available for investment are not unlimited, the government's favoritism of the shipbuilding industry also means that other goods and services that consumers want will be less plentiful. Tottie continues that any defense of Title XI must explain why the government, and not the American people, should decide how scarce economic resources are to be allocated. In conclusion, Tottie believes Title XI should be repealed. 16pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a>

<b>White House Tax Theories,</b> by Alan Reynolds<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 191, Hudson Institute<p>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute, critically anaylzes <I>The President's Council of Economic Adviser's 1996 Economic Report</i> assertion that changing tax rates have had no discernable effect on work effort, productivity, savings and economic growth. Reynolds debunks the myths presented by the CEA report which declares that the reduction of tax rates in the early 1980s was responsible for the large budget deficits that have persisted since. The Economic Report also states that whereas the impact of tax policy on savings is ambiguous, the ability of decreasing fedeal budget deficits to increase national savings is perfectly clear. Reynolds argues that the report does not bolster its finding with facts, and dismisses inconvenient truths as though they have become politically incorrect, in effect asking Americans to disregard scientific method in favor of naked politics and raw emotion. 16pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1084. The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, dispels some of the myths and misconceptions associated with welfare and children. He argues that children are suffering simply because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Furthermore, the system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. Rector writes that flawed assumptions that children in families with higher income do better in life, and that welfare can easily raise family income, amount to the false conclusion that welfare is good for children. Rather, Rector points out, welfare has detrimental effects on cognitive capabilities, negatively effects the long term employment and earning capacity of young boys, and promotes illegitimacy. Rector concludes that those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependency and illegitimacy. 14pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Unintended Consequences: How Government Policies Hurt Oregon's Poor,</b> by Martin L. Buchanan<p>
<i>Fiscal Insight</i> No. 12, Cascade Policy Institute<p>
Martin Buchanan, Policy Analyist for the Cascade Policy Institute, argues that government policy at many levels is actually hurting Oregon's poor families in four ways. In order to escape poverty, families or individuals must surmount four barriers which Buchanan likens to four Berlin Walls. These barriers consist of taxes on the poor, obstacles to employment and enterprise, forced purchases of certain services, and higher prices for the poor. The paper also recommends several government actions to help poor Oregonians at the federal, state and local levels. Buchanan believes that the interests of the poor align well with the general interest and if these burdens are lifted from the poor, the burdens will lighten for all. 12pp.  CONTACT: Cascade Policy Institute, 813 S.W.

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, reports on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros's plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the public housing industry despite efforts to hinder the plan by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. However, with the support of House reformers and leaders, in conjunction with bold intervention by the federal courts, Utt believes, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive the lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. Utt argues that this clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. Rather, the dispute concerns how government should help the poor. 13pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Value of Welfare: Cato vs. CBPP,</b> by Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez<p>
<i>Briefing Papers</i> No. 27, Cato Institute<p>
Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez of the Cato Institute reviewed the Center on Budget and Policy Priority's critique of the Cato study comparing the benefits available from entitlement programs with income available from work. Tanner and Lopez maintain that a review of the original study published by Cato and the criticisms in the CBPP study reveals that the Cato study remains an accurate appraisal of the level of welfare benefits. The study, by Tanner and Lopez, states that the CBPP report fails to account for the values of non-cash welfare benefits such as Medicaid. In addition, the Cato study's inclusion of housing benefits more accurately reflects the work vs. welfare tradeoff for long term welfare recipients. Turner and Lopez conclude that with the exception of a small error in the calculation of the values of food stamps in five states, the criticisms of the Cato study are unfounded. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Replacing Welfare in Wisconsin,</b> by Andrew Bush<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 192, Hudson Institute<p>
Andrew Busch, Assistant Professor of Political Science at The University of Denver, examines Wisconsin's new welfare reform program. This new program, "Wisconsin Works" (W-2), is a work-based system which tries to help parents establish their own means of long-term support, primarily through work. The focus of W-2 will be with its financial and employment planners (FEP's), who will help families plan and execute employment strategies. The idea behind W-2 is that consistent employment is the way out of poverty, and finding a job for unemployed parents is only the beginning of the process-showing them how to keep a job is the real aim. 8pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>A Working Solution to the Welfare Crisis: The Full Employment Model of Welfare Reform,</b> by Peter S. Barwick<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
Peter S. Barwick, Research Associate for The Commonwealth Foundation, posits that thirty years after the inauguration of the Great Society, it is clear that the welfare state has failed to deliver on its promise to end poverty. In fact, there is now a broad consensus that welfare programs have contributed substantially, if unintentionally, to a worsening of the plight of the poor by undermining the two-parent family and a commitment to work. Barwick presents the Full Employment Model as a promising and fully developed proposal for reforming the current welfare system. The merits of the reforms are detailed and the improvements of the current system are underscored. Advantages cited by Barwick include an end to welfare as an entitlement and the provision of practical work experience. However, Barwick acknowledges and explores important questions raised by the Full Employment Model such as the cost and the role of the bureaucracy. 12pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

<b>Challenging America's Inverted Health Priorities,</b> by Elizabeth M. Whelan<p>
<i>Priorities</i> Vol. 8 No. 1, American Council on Science and Health<p>
This speech by Elizabeth M. Whelan, President of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), relates that her top priority at ACSH involves helping Americans distinguish between real and hypothetical health risks, and to separate the leading causes of disease and death from the leading causes of unnecessary anxiety. She argues that the purpose of public health measures, whether carried out at EPA, the FDA, in Congress, or in the private sector, should be the prevention of premature disease and death. She rejects the notion that public health efforts should have hidden goals which might include harassing industy, alarming people about nonrisks, banning useful, subtances or advancing other social and political agendas. Whelan posits that the nation's health priorities are inverted because health issues are pushed to center stage, squandering limited public health resources. Examples include the mother who worries about the alleged carcinogin Alar in applesauce, but fails to buckle her child into a car. She suggests that the influential factors creating inverted health policies include the enormous political and economic clout of the manufacturers of the leading cause of preventable death, cigarettes ,and the contamination of the public health profession by an ideologically fueled form of political correctness that chills open dialouge. 10pp.  CONTACT.

<i>Contemporary Issues Series</i> No. 78, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Courtney LaFountain, Environmental Researcher at the Center for the Study of American Business, offers nine fundamental questions that readers should ask when evaluating a story about a new risk. LaFountain's concern focuses on press coverage of studies of three possible environmental health risks to show that many of these points are not addressed in media coverage of risk-based research. The author suggests that journalists have a tendency to report the political or human interest side of a risk, rather than the technical or scientific side. Her nine point plan for the analysis of information involves inquiries which are directed toward correcting false information and disclosing the whole story on partial reporting. Cases she applies her nine point plan to include the major news coverage of the Savitz-Loomis Study, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study and the Greenpeace Chlorine Study. 24pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<i>Issue Analysis </I>No. 27, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Michael F. Cannon, Health Care Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses Nancy Kassebaum's Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act of 1996. Cannon believes the proposal addresses the FDA's obstruction of doctors' and patients' efforts to obtain badly needed treatments, the rise in health care costs, and violations of the First Amendment. These proposals include such measures as refocusing the FDA's mission and balancing the agency's safety and efficacy standards against the needs of the seriously ill. The bill would also allow FDA accredited private firms to review product applications on behalf of the agency and would shorten the time it takes to bring drugs, medical devices and biologics to market, where they may help patients. Though not without shortcomings and with several provisions yet to be added to the bill, Cannon believes the Kassebaum Bill will enable doctors and patients to obtain new treatments faster, and at a lower cost, than under the current regulatory regime-without compromising patient safety. 9pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a><p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience,</b> by Thomas A. Massaro and Yu-Ning Wong<p>
<i>NCPA Policy Report</i> No. 203, National Center for Policy Analysis<p>
Thomas Massaro, Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law, analyzes Medical Savings Accounts in Singapore and has revealed a system which offers individuals access to care while holding down costs. According to the study, the island city-state spends only 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, lower than other Asian nations and well below the United States at 154 percent. In addition, Singaporeans have access to the most modern technology, including CAT scans, bypass surgery and organ transplants. Moreover, there is very little waiting in Singapore, either to see a doctor or to obtain high technology services. Massaro argues that the fact that people are spending their own money, rather than a third party insurer, has helped to curtail Singapore's health care costs. Also, because people are free to exercise choice in the medical marketplace, providers of care have strong incentives to maintain quality. The study concludes that if Medical Savings Accounts were available in the United States, prudent buying would begin to chip away at the high price of care and might significantly reduce it. 19pp.  CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

Moore's study of America's 85 largest cities, using Census data over a 15-year period, which demonstrates that high levels of immigration are generally associated with cities that have more positive economic indicators. The study finds that, compared to cities with the fewest immigrants, cities with the highest proportion of immigrants in 1990 had on average: 15% higher per capita incomes; 90% lower tax burdens; 130% higher job growth; 17% lower crime rates; and 17% lower poverty rates. 48pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Issue Brief</i> No. 120, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution<p>
John  Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, relates that a review of contributions by the political action committee of the National Education Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the direction of American government. Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly expand federal spending and taxation. The average House candidate supported by the NEA during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year. On the other hand, the candidates that the NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year. Berthoud also states that, despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on American families or hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations. 7pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Committee Brief</i> No. 26, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Education, argues that Congress has a historic opportunity to convert Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, into a voucher program. He proposes that poor families, rather than bureaucrats, decide where their children will go to school. Doyle cites the widely recognized problems with Title I, including the adverse effect of the Supreme Court's Aguilar decision which actively discourages poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. Doyle concludes that in order to reform Title I, the program should be reconnecting to its true beneficiaries-students and not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child and if that money were available as a Title I voucher it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs. Such an approach, writes Doyle, would mitigate the effects of the school bureaucracy and begin to instill values which foster character development. 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

Rossell and Baker provide eight recommendations for improving edicuational programs for LEP students: 1) free school districts from the legal obligation to provide native language instruction; 2) increase the LEP population size needed to trigger a self-contained classroom; 3) require parental consent for enrollment in a self-contained classroom; 4) require English language fluency for teachers in an educationl program for LEP children; 5) change the criteria for entering and exiting a self-contained classroom; 6) eliminate specific class-sized ceilings; 7) better research that would allow social scientists to analyze the success of the programs; and 8) the ideal program is that which involves "structured immersions." 242 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute For Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Heartland Report on School Finance Reform for Illinois,</b> by Joseph L. Bast, Herbert J. Walberg, and Robert J. Genetski<p>
<i>Policy Studies</i> No. 72 and 73, Heartland Institute<p>
Joseph L. Bast, President of The Heartland Institute, Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Robert J. Genetski of Chicago Capital, Inc., formulate a reply to the Governor's Commission on Education Funding and offer alternative principles for school finance reform. The report cites evidence which demonstrates why public schools are failing in Illinois, such as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Moreover, the writers maintain that spending more money will not alleviate the situation. They argue that student achievement is not related to spending because increased spending rarely addresses the reasons schools are failing. The second part of the report offers a means to improve public schools through a market-based approach. The plan incorporates parental choice, private school choice, competition, and curriculum based exams to improve the quality, and the means to gauge the quality, of public schools.

<b>With Liberty and Justice for All: Redefining the Educational Choice Debate,</b> by Jennifer A. Marshall and Jennifer E. Marshall,<p>
<i>Family Policy,</i> Family Research Council<p>
Jennifer A Marshall, Educational Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, and Jennifer E. Marshall, Welfare Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, survey the philosophical and historical background of public education. They assert that, given the failure to establish a full educational choice program anywhere in the U.S. after a quarter century, choice proponents must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed by the education establishment. Marshall and Marshall also believe the new proposal should avoid the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace of government regulation, consistent challenges to constitutionality, dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries to support passage. The authors invest faith in a refundable tax credit scheme to overleap the hurdles presented by means tested voucher programs. 7pp.  CONTACT: Family Research Council, 700 13th Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC  20005, 202/393-2100, fax 202/393-2134, Internet <a href="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp15.html">How to Talk About Property Rights: Why Protecting Property Rights Benefits All Americans, </a>by John Shanahan<p>
Heritage Talking Points No. 15, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Shanahan, Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, argues that although the government has the power to confiscate private land, it must compensate the owner. However, when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs. Shanahan notes that this de facto taking of property-the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction-is now being questioned. The author discusses House and Senate bills which would protect private property and contract rights. Shanahan also offers the philosophical groundwork concerning the importance of private property. Shanahan laments that although the Supreme Court has clearly sided with the Constitution when requiring the government to pay just compensation when any amount of land is confiscated, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear. As a result, executive branch agencies have had wide latitude in taking property through regulation. 4pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Regulation vs. Conservation,</b> by Jonathan H. Adler<p>
<i>CEI Update </i>Vol. 9, No. 5, Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how regulation, the primary means that the federal government employs to protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive lands, might actually discourage voluntary stewardship and conservation of private property. He calls for non-regulatory, incentive based programs and compensation to maintain environmental standards. Forcing agencies to compensate for a regulation that constitutes a "taking" out of their own budget will cause them to examine whether the benefit of the regulatory action is worth the compensation. This way, according to Adler, "land-use regulation will only be pursued when the benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or more costly." The coercive regulatory system that is presently used by the federal government costs the taxpayers approximately $300,000 per wetland acre protected. Adler argues that incentive-based programs would conserve wetlands at a fraction of the cost and would protect private property rights. 3pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/488-0806.

<b>Key Issues in Environmental Risk Comparisons: Removing Distortions and Insuring Fairness, </b>by George M. Gray<p>
<i>Policy Study </i>No. 205, Reason Foundation<p>
Dr. George Gray, Deputy Director and Regulatory Toxicologist at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, maintains that environmental risk management is crucial in order to ensure that scarce public health resources are used wisely. Risk assessment plays a key role in environmental decisions such as setting drinking water standards, Superfund site cleanup goals, and standards for pesticide residues on food. The Reason Foundation claims that risk assessment is associated with nearly all of the two percent of Gross National Product that is spent annually in the United States on environmental protection. Gray argues that many of the standard risk assessments use to establish regulatory standards deliberately overstate people's exposure to environmental contaminants. To best employ risk assessment to protect people, risk characterization must be improved to make better use of science in order to find the most accurate estimates, not "conservative" estimates. All risk comparisons, concludes Gray, require the best science and risk assessment to maximize protection of human health. 18pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy, </b>by Bruce Yandle<p>
<i>The Shape of Things </i>No. 6, Progress & Freedom Foundation<p>
Bruce Yandle, Alumni Professor of Economic and Legal Studies at Clemson University, delivered the remarks in this paper at a Progress & Freedom Foundation roundtable on the environment. Yandle begins by mentioning that it has been nearly a quarter century since the United States and most of the industrialized world have been engaged in a massive effort to maintain environmental quality. He argues that the current "command-and-control" system is obsolete and that U.S. environmental polices need to be changed. An agenda for change would involve the following elements: <i>Goal Orientation</i>, policy should emphasize measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental policy; <i>Flexibility,</i> innovation should be rewarded instead of penalized; <i>Biological Envelopes</i>, organizations such as river-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations should be encouraged and allowed to innovate in order to achieve goals; <i>Community Common Sense</i>, environmental protection decision making should take place where outcomes and costs matter the most; <i>Common Law,</i> statutory blocks against common law solutions to environmental problems should be removed; and <i>Property Rights</i>, private parties should be justly compensated for public benefits that they are asked to provide. Yandle concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs to update the blueprints for America's environmental policy-which have changed very little in twenty-five years.  4pp. CONTACT. Richard F.

<b>The New Paradigm in Environmental Enforcement: Environmental Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</b> by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura D. Wolf<p>

This issue illustrates how self-audit environmental laws are beneficial to both industry and the environment. It debunks four myths about self-audit privileges, reveals the flaws in the Environmental Protection Agency's policies and philosophies regarding the laws, and provides an update of legislation in the states. The authors examine-and then dismiss-arguments against self-audit laws, deeming them unfounded. The conclusion they reach is that the pervasive and voluminous regulation that has evolved over the years is inferior to a "model that focuses on and encourages voluntary compliance." Such a policy would allow regulatory agencies "to direct their limited enforcement resources at those among the regulated community that do not strive to be good citizens." 13 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

They also find that ensuring adequate funding for agricultural research, as well as researching new ways to fight soil erosion around the world is a priority.

 <b>Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace,</b> by David Forte<P>
<i>The Catholic University of America Law Review </i>Vol. 45, No. 2, The Columbus School of Law<p>
David Forte, Professor of Law at Cleveland State University, examines the Federalist politics behind William Marbury's appointment as Justice of the Peace in the last days of John Adam's presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson discovered the undelivered commisions of the previous president that included Marbury's, and immediately ordered them withheld. Forte shows how the ambition of Marbury, the son of an established, but impoverished, family, worked his way up to a position of power in the Maryland gentry. Marbury's political loyalty to the Adam's wing of the Federalist party in Maryland earned him a nomination as Justice of the Peace, "the most powerful office in the lives of the common people." Marbury's position amongst Adam's loyalists brought him Jefferson's enmity. It was Jefferson's refusal to allow Marbury to take office that lead to the landmark case <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, that established judicial review, and sizably increased the power of the judicial branch of government. 53 pp. CONTACT: The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C., 202/319-5140.

<b>Gun Control: Is the Tide Turning, </b>by Austin Fulk<p>
<i>Organization Trends  </i>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
Austin Fulk, Research Associate at the Capital Research Center, examines the recent move in many states to allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed weapons. Fulk points out that as the federal government has been tightening gun control laws, anti-gun control organizations have been focusing their efforts at the state level. He points to approximately a dozen states where regulations regarding the carrying of concealed weapons have been relaxed. After debating the arguments against concealed weapons, and asserting that guns do not lead to increased violence, Fulk goes on to document the contributions of groups such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Next, he traces the rise of the gun control movement, detailing the work of groups such as Handgun Control, Inc., Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center. Fulk concludes by noting that while the federal government may soon assist proponents of concealed weapons by passing legislation allowing concealed weapons holders to carry guns across state lines, that help is not critical. Just as education and welfare reforms have been devolving to state levels, so too, he claims, has the issue of gun control. 7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Handbook on Religious Liberty Around the World, </b>edited by Pedro C. Moreno<p>
Rutherford Institute<p>
Edited by Pedro Moreno, International Coordinator for The Rutherford Institute, the <i>Handbook on Religious Liberty</i> examines the historical and legal aspects of religious liberty around the world.  In John W. Whitehead's forward, he argues that a type of religious apartheid-the exclusion of religious belief and persons from the public sphere-is occurring throughout the world, even in the United States.  To support this thesis, Moreno provides detailed accounts of instances of religious persecution throughout the world.  Attacks against Christians, Jews, and a variety of others are documented from a wide array of countries, including India, Sudan, Israel, China, Kenya, Australia, and Thailand.  Given special attention are the instances of religious persecution in the United States, where, The Rutherford Institute argues, religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, are being systematically eradicated. Knowing where religious discrimination is occurring and taking action to stop it are critical, according to Rutherford because: 1) where religious apartheid exists, persecution of individual believers inevitably follows; and 2) with the rise of secularism, the positive restraining effects of Judeo-Christian beliefs upon citizens will end.  347pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Freedom: Sorting Out the Issues,</b> by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>American University Law Review,</i> Vol. 45, February 1996 <p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, analyses the current debate over affirmative action from the perspective of First Principles. Arguing that individual liberty is grounded in the idea of individual sovereignty, he demonstrates how the breakdown of the distinction between private and public has led to the confusion that surrounds the anti-discrimination/affirmative action debate among both liberals and conservatives, with liberals trying to impose affirmative action in both the public and private sectors, conservatives trying to impose anti-discrimination in both sectors. Neither side seems to appreciate how the ideas of private and public sovereignty would sort the issues out in the respective sectors.

<b>A Court Without a Compass, </b>by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>New York Law School Law Review </i>Vol. 40, No. 4<p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues in a symposium on James F. Simon's <i>The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court,</i> that Simon presents a one-dimensional morality play of the last 40 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Concluding, correctly, that the Reagan/Bush appointees have shifted the Court only slightly, Simon's analysis, according to Pilon, nonetheless misses the deeper currents in 20th century jurisprudence that help explain why the Rehnquist Court is as political as the Warren and Burger Courts were and why constitutional law today has become so politisized. The Court today, Pilon concludes, is without a compass because its members, reflecting those currents, have no deeply grounded philosophy of the Constitution.

<b>Emancipating School Prayer: How to Use the State Constitution to Beat the ACLU and the Supreme Court,</b> edited by Harry V. Jaffa<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
Harry Jaffa, Professor Emeritus of Political Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College and a Distinguished Fellow at the Claremont Institute, argues that Congress has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation allowing voluntary prayer in schools. He adds that this prayer would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions. This would at once recall the idea of "liberty under God," and remind all Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but rather the formation of unparalleled freedom for two centuries. Further, he argues that a joint resolution of Congress would preclude the Supreme Court from acting in opposition without declaring all 46 state constitutions unconstitutional. 49pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href=" http://www.claremont.org">	http://www.claremont.org. </a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 567, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In this speech given at The Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Annual Meeting, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith puts forth ways in which Americans can liberate themselves for self-government. He begins his speech by discussing his experience as mayor and how he eschewed the public policy trends of the last thirty years of continuously raising taxes and establishing social programs and control mechanisms to solve the city's problems. As mayor, he has contracted out several city services, set up incentives for social workers to place welfare recipients in jobs, connected kids in tough neighborhodds to their local churches, fought for school choice, and overall, allowed flexibility and innovation in the delivery of public services. Goldsmith calls for devolution, but warns that it will not be successful unless it leads to a market-based system for providing government services. The system has to recognize that "the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisons that are in their own best interests." 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Initiative and Referendum in Pennsylvania,</b> by Charles E. Greenwalt II<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
The process of "direct democracy," by way of initiatives and referendum, has fallen short of what reformers had in mind because of its extreme vulnerability to corruption. The question is, writes Charles Greenwalt, Senior Policy Associate at The Commonwealth Foundation, should Pennsylvania join the list of 24 states (and the District of Columbia) that have adopted procedures for statewide initiatives and the 25 states (and the District) that have adopted statewide referendum? Some of the major opposition relates to issues involving "finances," which would only allow those special interest groups with a good financial backing to get their issues on the ballot. Another problem the opposition raises is the belief of a 'complexity' of issues', which argues that the average or even slightly above average citizen would not really understand what he/she was voting on because the topics are too complex for their understanding. Proponents see this "direct" process as a must and point to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which says that the power and right to make laws ultimately rests with the citizentry. In addition, proponents of initiative and referendum believe that a higher voter turnout that develop and provide additional checks on lawmakers. Either way, concludes Greenwalt, what will work for one state may not work for another, thus each state must decide individually if the process of initiative and referendum outweighs the cost of corruption. 40pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

Moreover, these amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government, something that was implicit in the design of the government and understood by the Founders as an essential part of the system they created. In addition, Mitchell identifies and outlines the motivations of the obstructionists in Congress who blocked these reforms. 95pp.  CONTACT. Americans Back in Charge, 900 2nd Street, N.E., Suite 200A.

<b>Rethinking Divorce,</b> by William A. Galston<p>
Center of the American Experience<p>
William A. Galston, Director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, surveys the ramification of divorce upon America's children, and calls for a reexamination of divorce laws in the United States. Galston holds that America currently tolerates a system that cares more for adults' interests than for children's.  Because of this, he argues, millions of children each year are being adversely affected by divorces-which the current legal and cultural environment permits. To remedy this, Galston states that Americans must first make it the country's goal to both reduce the number of divorces involving minor children, and, when such divorces are unavoidable, seek to mitigate their consequences for the children. Next, he recommends implementing social and legal changes to help couples before and during marriages, as well as at the threshold of divorce.  He also advocates eliminating the unilateral no-fault divorce system when there are children involved.  If divorce cannot be prevented, Galston advocates working to minimize the effects upon children by attempting to prevent diminished income, diminished parenting time, and the disruption of established ties. 5pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis MN 55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.<p>

<b>Hollywood's Two Big Lies,</b> by Michael Medved<p>
<i>Declarations of Independence</i> Vol. 3, No. 1, Independence Institute<P>
Film critic Michael Medved condemns the Hollywood entertainment industry for what he calls their "two big lies:" 1) their claim that they present a realistic picture of the world; and 2) that they tailor their work to meet consumer demands. Taking on the first claim of Hollywood insiders, Medved critiques their portrayal of violence, sexuality, and religion. Next, he provides empirical evidence that more traditional, family-oriented entertainment fares better at the box office than more violent, sexually explicit fare which the industry claims the public wants. Medved asserts that people in Hollywood are not motivated by any desire to have their work mirror real life, or even make money. Their real desire, he claims, stems from a desire to win the approval of their peers for producing shocking and untraditional work. To combat this phenomena, Medved recommends that the American public should be more selective about the television programs and films they choose to watch. Their individual boycotts may not impact industry decisions, he writes, but it will impact their own lives. If they are not seeing the negative images of Hollywood, they can not be directly harmed by them.  5pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute, 14142 Denver West Parkway, No. 101, Golden, CO  80401, 303/279-6536, fax 303/279-4176.

<b>On the Frontline of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America,</b> by William A. Donohue<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
William Donohue, President and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, examines the attack launched upon the American Boy Scouts by various groups charging them with discrimination.  Donohue begins his essay by first examining the principles upon which the organization was first founded.  Asserting that the Boy Scouts were intended to be a group dedicated to instructing young men on how to live moral, upright lives, he argues that the exclusion of atheists and homosexuals is in accordance with the group's mission.  Next, Donohue documents several recent court cases brought against the organization by various individuals in the homosexual, atheist, and feminist communities.  His next area of analysis focuses on the cultural war he feels the liberal establishment and members of the cultural elite have declared against the Boy Scouts.  Donohue then examines the role of the ACLU in the legal proceedings, arguing that an anti-family, anti-God bias permeates the legal association and is prompting it to promote  an agenda which seeks the exclusion of morality and tradition from the American landscape.  The essay concludes with an afterward by Edward J. Erler, Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, which recounts the recent court rulings pertaining to the Boy Scouts, most of which seem to favor the group's right to ascribe to its traditional moral code.  37pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org"> http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>The New Majority: The "Leave Us Alone" Coalition,</b> by Grover G. Norquist<p>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 5, Hillsdale College<p>
 Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, asserts that America is currently in the midst of a historic political realignment.  This shift is occurring, Norquist writes, as traditional liberal coalitions break down, and a more conservative coalition forms.  He terms this new political coalition the "Leave Us Alone" coalition, describing its members as ordinary men and women motivated by their love for freedom, family and tradition, while sharing the common desire of being left alone by the government.  The opposition they face in their efforts to control the political landscape, Norquist calls the "Takings Coalition."  He claims that while for years this alliance has been made up of groups wanting the government to take money from other Americans and give it to them, they are now fighting amongst themselves, and their numbers are shrinking. With victory for the "Leave Us Alone" coalition in sight, Norquist outlines a four-step plan to insure their success. According to him, they must: 1) oppose any and all tax increases; 2) end the Left's sense of inevitable victory; 3) seize the moral high ground; and 4) defund the opposition. 5pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<b>The Intellectual Foundations of the Cultural Decline,</b> by Stephen B. Young<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Stephen B. Young, member of the Board of Trustees at the Center of the American Experiment, argues that a powerful force has been eating away at the soul of American society in recent years.  This force he attributes to a line of political thought which holds personal license and moral relativism as superior to the American tradition of freedom and liberty under the rule of law. Intellectually, Young ascribes this philosophy to a French ethic originating in Rousseauian theory. The triumph of this ethic over that purported by English philosophers Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Smith and German writers Kant and Hegel, generated what Young terms "the deconstruction of traditional norms and ethics."  For the origins of its growing dominance in modern American thought, Young looks to the Vietnam war and the need of baby boomers to find a social philosophy that supported their opposition to the traditional claims of the American state. Young not only criticizes the prevalence of this ideology in American society in general, he also examines its specific impacts upon America's colleges and universities.  Its existence there, he charges, has made any true leadership or reform impossible. To solve this widespread problem, Young calls for society at large to demand greater accountability amongst themselves and within the university community.  15pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621

<b>Public Policy Grantmaking: Four Women Donors Offer Their Views, </b>by Ethelmae Humphreys, Heather R. Higgins, Sue Anschutz Rodgers, and Kristin Avansino<p>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy </I>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
While women control approximately 60 percent of the nation's wealth and are gaining more and more prominence in the workforce, the Capital Research Center reports that women donors are less likely than men to support non-profit organizations promoting changes in public policy.  This issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> takes a look at four women serving at key positions at foundations who do contribute to institutions involved in public policy.  Ethelmae Humphreys, Chairman and President of the Humphreys Foundations, discusses her work to promote a free society, outlining the parameter her foundation has set for public policy recipients and her devotion to social issues.  Next Heather R. Higgins, Director of The Randolph Foundation, writes about the important benefits of contributing to public policy groups rather than just giving directly to charities.  Then, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of The Anschutz Family Foundation, discusses how philanthropic donations to public policy best facilitate the interplay between business, government, and the non-profit sector.  Finally, Kristin A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, relays how her foundation's respect for the sacred, democracy, free-market principles, and hard work have led them to award grants to public policy organization.  4pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>The Council on Foundations: The Era of Lady Bountiful Is Over Message to America</b><p>
<I>Foundation Watch </I>Vol. 1, No. 5, Capital Research Center<p>
From April 22nd through 24th in Atlanta, Georgia, the Council of Foundations held their annual meeting. The program, comprised mostly of liberal activists and philanthropists, did feature conservatives Father Richard Neauhaus, founder of the journal <I>First Things,</I> and John Von Kannon, Vice President at The Heritage Foundation.  According to the Capital Research Center, the convention was representative of modern philanthropy's obsession with appearances. More than one hundred awards were distributed for accomplishments in public relations, yet not one program was commended for delivering lives from welfare, helping drug users overcome their addictions, or helping the handicapped.  In other words, for their charitable contributions. Much of this arises, asserts Foundation Watch, from the Council's current President, Dorothy Ridings,  and her obsession with media relations.  But in the Council's focus on how people perceive their actions, they are forgetting to carry out their true mission, claims the article. Foundation Watch suggests that the Council reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of philanthropy, recognizing where America's charitable institutions have gone wrong.  7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>All the King's Horses and All the King's Men: What Would Charity Do Without Them?</b> by Leslie Lenkowsky<p>
<I>Philanthropy </I>Vol. IX, No. 3, Philanthropy Roundtable<p>
Leslie Lenkowsky, President of the Hudson Institute, examines the controversy in the philanthropic community over proposed changes in their relationship with the federal government.  He notes that while much of the American public supports philanthropic groups assuming greater responsibility for social work, those same groups fear the repercussions of losing government funds.  But Lenkowsky argues that partnership has actually harmed the work of philanthropies more than it has helped them. To support this, he points to the restrictions placed upon programs, and the realignment of priorities to match government demands.  Another problem arising from the mutual dependency of the federal government and philanthropies, according to Lenkowsky, has been that their goals and beliefs have merged, depriving the relationship of any diversity of thought, and along with that, any vitality.  Lenkowsky compares their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage that leaves both parties worse off.  To remedy these problems, he calls for a reexamination of their partnership that will lead to the formation of a new partnership, where government and philanthropic organizations maintain a greater degree of separation from each other. This, Lenkowsky believes, would facilitate a reordering of priorities, increased flexibility, and a reinvigorated private sector more capable of meeting society's needs.  6pp.  CONTACT: The Philanthropy Roundtable, 320 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN  46204-1725, 317/639-6546.

<b>Liberalism and Community,</b> by Steven Kautz<p>
Social Philosophy & Policy Center<p>
Steven Kautz, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Emory University, defends the classical liberalism of Locke and Montesquieu, against its communitarian critics.  According to Kautz, communitarians have charged liberalism with being both morally and politically deficient.  He counters these arguments by first exploring the problem of community as it has evolved in recent years. Kautz then looks at the various disagreements which have taken place between Democrats and Republicans. The next component of Kautz's analysis centers on the arguments of three important, new communitarians: Richard Rorty, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel. Contrasting their views against more traditionally liberal philosophies, he discusses Walzer's account of moral reasoning, Barber's concept of the nature of republican community, and Cory's writings on the nature of the self. Kautz also addresses the issues of patriotism, self-government, and virtue, ultimately confronting the question of whether liberal reason can sustain the moral life of a community. Kautz concludes that it is the very liberalism which communitarians attack that has made the notion of community possible, that because of its tenets people can live together in a peaceful, prosperous and just society. 232pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Communitarian Challenge to Liberalism,</b> edited by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul<p>
Social Philosophy and Policy Center<p>
This book focuses on the debate over the protection of individual rights verses the importance of community interests.  The collection of essays included in this volume addresses questions such as whether individual rights should trump group rights, the role communities ought to play in shaping their members' values, and the extent to which government should promote community values. One series of essays deals with conflicts between liberal and communitarian doctrines on the nature of moral agency and the functions of good government. Another collection focuses on alternative ways to conceive of the two doctrines and challenges the basic assumptions about the harmful effects of capitalism on communities. Also explored in this volume are the basic questions of whether it is possible for any society to have one common good, whether culturally diverse states can ever become true communities, and whether participation in the community should be voluntary or mandated by the government. Contributing to this work, and coming from a variety of perspectives are: Neera K. Badhwar; Martha Nussbaum; John Haldane; Chandran Kukathas; Will Kymlicka; David Conway; Steven Kautz; Ronald Beiner; Cass R. Sunstein; George B. Fletcher; Stephen Macedo; Benjamin R. Barber; and James S. Coleman. 306pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in California Government Contracting,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<I>Briefings</I>, No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute, argues that when arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. The author examines the financial costs associated with such policies, specifically with respect to California government. McClintock relates that affirmative action and racial preferences in California permeate many aspects of life, including education, and that federal requirements incur additional costs. The costs are divided six ways between private and public sectors costs and include costs to government from above market prices, caused by reduced competition, and opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. 10pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a>

<b>Still Choosing by Color,</b> by Michael Lynch<p>
<I>Briefings </I>No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Michael Lynch, Public Policy Research Fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, looks at the recent report by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the admissions process at The University of California, Berkeley, calling the validity of their findings into question. For seven years, the OCR has been investigating whether race played an undue influence on admittance to the University. Recently, they concluded that the admissions policy does not discriminate on the basis of race. Lynch holds, however, that the, OCR's findings notwithstanding, race does play a major role in admissions at Berkeley. He charges that the OCR's report does not include even the most basic data on which it should have formed its conclusions (applicant pool versus admission data and SAT GPA data for the various admission categories and ethnic and racial groups). When this matrix of criteria is examined, according to Lynch, it reveals that white and Asian applicants were not given the same access to reviews and were seriously underrepresented  in acceptances when compared to their numbers in the applicant pools. Based upon the sheer empirical evidence, Lynch concludes that the admission policies of UC Berkeley would be found unconstitutional under the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas.

<b>Virtuous Markets: The Market as School of the Virtues, </b>by Ian Maitland<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Ian Maitland, Senior Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, questions the assumption that the market destroys virtues such as honesty, loyalty and responsibility.  He asserts that proponents of that philosophy base their belief on the existence of a self-seeking, individualistic mindset which supposedly reigns there. This camp sees the market as both destroying the virtues within society and undermining the market's own moral foundations.  Maitland, however, takes a different point of view.  He argues that rather than undermining societal virtue, the market actually works to generate them. In order for businesses to function successfully, he asserts, they must be staffed by individuals who trust and are able to work with each other.  Trustworthiness, self-control, and sympathy are all virtues he claims the market requires and, because of that need, promotes.  Maitland concludes by calling into question the modern presumption that competition forms the basis of the market system, asserting that cooperation in fact is the most fundamental aspect.  11pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.

<b>Theft By Consent: The Lottery's Economic and Social Impact on Alabama,</b> by John Hill<p>
Alabama Family Alliance<p>
John Hill, Policy Analyst at the Alabama Family Alliance, looking at the case currently being made in Alabama in favor of a state lottery, assesses its probable impact on the state's economy.  Despite the promised benefits lottery advocates claim Alabama would reap, Hill finds that any good to come from such programs would be minimal, while the harm would be significant.  By comparing one proposed model to a similar program already in place in Georgia, Hill concludes that the lottery is essentially a voluntary, regressive tax.  The scholarship money lottery revenues provide in Georgia go mostly to upper and middle class students, according to Hill, while the funds from the ticket purchases come mostly from the state's poor. Next, he asserts that lottery sales have led to a decline in food sales equivalent to the revenue of lottery ticket sales, thereby negating any supposed benefit to retailers.  He also documents that the legalization of state sanctioned gambling such as lotteries have been shown to lead to increases in the rate of violent crime, gambling addictions, and, indirectly, instances of spousal abuse. Hill also points to the wide-spread illegal purchases of lottery tickets by teenagers, and notes that administering lottery programs has proven costly in other programs where administrative costs have risen faster than any other form of revenue collection. On the whole Hill, concludes that a state lottery would be an inefficient and costly way to raise state revenues. 25pp.  CONTACT:  Alabama Family Alliance, P.O.

<b><i>City Journal </i></b><br>
Summer 96, Manhattan Institute<p>
This issue of <i>City Journal</i> features an article by Contributing Editor Sol Stern entitled "The Invisible Miracle of Catholic Schools." Stern illustrates how inner-city Catholic schools in New York have educated some the neediest and uneducable kids from the city's most troubled neighborhoods, for a third of what taxpayers spend per pupil for the city's public schools. Despite the proven success of Catholic schools, Stern notes that liberals have ignored them in their search for solutions to the problems of New York's ailing public schools. Other articles in this issue include: "Special Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," by Kay Hymowitz; "Why L.A. is Bouncing Back," by Joel Kotkin; and "Reinventing the Port Authority," by Dick Netzer.

Tom Arrandale, examines what one might expect with the transition from monopolies to competition in the power industry. Arrandale points out that although competition, by nature, brings lower prices, it may raise the price of power for less savvy purchasers. Other articles in this issue include: "Fish Tales," by Charles Mahtesian, which examines the aquarium building binge in several cities in recent years; "Ruckus Over Rating," by Penelope Lemov, which examines controversies in the bond rating system that could bring more government regulation; and "A Dollar's Worth of Government," by Jonathan Walters, which tries to determine exactly what one unit of government service costs.

<b><i>Headway</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
This issue of <i>Headway</i> features several articles on the issue of what is "authentically black." Joseph Brown, an Editorial Writer with the <i>Tampa Tribune,</i> tells about when his "blackness" was question when he came out on a different side of a policy issue than the civil rights establishment. Meanwhile, Sharon Brooks Hodge shares a story of when her "authenticity" as a black was questioned because she is "articulate." Ron Freeman, President of The Freedom Foundation in Summit, Missouri, argues that authentic blackness should mean being free and responsible to one's self and family, rather than shifting blame and avoiding responsibility. Finally, Jacqueline Gordon, founder and Director of the Christian Women's Forum, laments that too many African-Americans see black "authenticity" and "genuiness" linked to being politically liberal. These viewpoints show how broad generalizations about blacks are enforced within the black community itself and how this serves to work against the original ideals of the civil rights movement. 38 pp.  CONTACT: <i>Headway,</i> 13555 Bammel N.

<b><i>Carolina Journal</b></i><br>
April-May 1996, John Locke Foundation<p>
The April-May <i>Carolina Journal</i> centers on an articled entitled "Lemon and (Sub)Lime: Why We Must Re-engineer State Government." In this article, John Hood, President of the John Locke Foundation, compares state government to the U.S. auto industry to demonstrate the need for political leaders to take risks and be innovative. He finds that over the last 20 years the per-capita cost of state government in north Carolina and the price of a new car grew by about 70 percent in real terms. During the same period of time, however, the quality of these two products moved in separate directions. Concerning education and social services, increased state spending has not shown significant gains in education achievement and a key indicator in social well-being_the number of illegitimate births_has gotten worse. Meanwhile, during the same period of time, the struggling American automobile industry has dramatically improved and has reclaimed a competitive position in the world market. According to Hood, the comparison gives three lessons from the auto industry to state government: 1) competition is essential; 2) managerial flexibility is key; and 3) focus on results is crucial.

Spring 96, Foundation for Florida's Future<p>
This issue features articles on crime. Chuck Colson, former aid to President Nixon and Founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries, argues that returning to the basics of teaching children right and wrong will help lower future crime. Princeton's John Dilulio assesses the juvenile crime situation in Florida and shows that a future wave of "superpredators" is on its way. He calls for punishing juveniles as adults and to build on community-based, faith-based private programs. CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<b> CIR Wins Reversal in Fourth Circuit in Smith v VCU</b><p>

In <i>Smith, et al v. Fourth Commonwealth University,</i> CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the court obtained the support of six judges with three concurring and five dissenting.
<p>
The en banc decision rejected the VCU attempt to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's study_like performance, productivity and merit_ skewed the results and permitted a false finding of "gender disparity." In separate concurrences, Judge Wilkinson wrote that the "search for knowledge is too important to sacrifice to the spirit of separatism"; and Judge Luttig hailed the importance of merit and performance in salary decisions at VCU and declared the study performed there to be inadmissible evidence of a pay disparity.
<p>
<b>Texas Filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari</i> in <i>Hopwood</i></b><p>
In <i>State of Texas, et al. v. Hopwood, et al.</i>, CIR and the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represent Cheryl J. Hopwood and Douglas Wade Carvell, two white applicants to the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission despite credentials that would have led to their admission had they been African-American or Mexican-American. In March, the Fifth Circuit held that the school's use of racial preferences in student admissions was unconstitutional and ruled that the Law School could not continue to consider race in its admission process. On April 30, 1996, defendants filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari </I> asking the United States Supreme Court to take the case.
<p>
Defendants provided no less than six separate questions for review. They argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that: 1) Justice Powell's view in <i>Regents of California v. Bakke</i> that "diversity" constituted a compelling state interest is the law of the land: 2) the law school was permitted to rely upon discrimination in some of Texas' public elementary and high schools in adopting a race-based admissions policy, despite clear statements in Supreme Court opinions to the contrary, and :3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is unconstitutional to the extent that it permits damage claims against states. The Clinton Administration filed an <i>amicus </I> brief on defendants' behalf agreeing with the first two contentions, and, indeed, going further to assert that the law school had a compelling interest in <i>racial diversity</i> (as opposed to the more limited notion of diversity in Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</I> opinion). Even the Clinton Administration, however, could not adopt defendants' argument that the Title VI is unconstitutional.
<p>
The plaintiffs-respondents Hopwood and Carvell filed papers in May in opposition to Texas' petition  refuting these and other even less-plausible arguments. On July 1, 1996 the Supreme Court denied the petition for <i>Certiorari.</i> The case now returns to the District court for the issue of damages.

<b>Developments in the Milwaukee School Choice Litigation:</b><p>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the state's motion to reconsider its ruling dismissing its original jurisdiction over the litigation. That means IJ will be in Dane County Circuit Court. 
<p>
The chief judge of the Dane County Court denied the state's motion to substitute Judge Paul Higginbotham. The judge has a liberal reputation, but seems committed to a prompt resolution of the case. Contrary to press reports, Judge Higginbotham has never issued any substantive ruling in this case_the injunction was issued by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and remains in effect pending a ruling by Judge Higginbotham.
<p>
Following these two rulings, IJ promptly filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and to schedule an evidentiary hearing. Although IJ asked the court to dissolve the injunction in its entirety, they asked the alternative that it dissolve the injunction as to nonsectarian schools, because only one of the remaining legal issues affects them.
<p>
<b><i>Black v. Village of Park Forest</i></b><p>
The Institute challenges a housing inspection ordinance in a southern Chicago suburb that allows local officials to conduct warrant-less, non-consensus inspections of single-family rental homes. On June 25, IJ filed briefs in support of cross-motions for summary judgment in the case. Briefs will be filed throughout the summer and a decision could come as early as September. The Institute represents tenants who reside in rental homes in Park Forest. The objective of the lawsuit is to establish that if government inspectors wish to enter rental homes, they must first ask for and receive a tenant's explicit consent. If tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable belief (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.
<p>
<b>Davis Bacon Act Challenge</b><p>
Representing four black construction contractors and three public housing organizations, the Institute for Justice amassed historical and economic research showing that the Davis-Bacon Act was originally intended to discriminate against black construction workers and that it is still having that effect today. The Institute has submitted six briefs and three large appendices. A decision could come anywhere between the next moth or sometime next year.
<p>
<b>New Jersey Welfare Case</b><p>
The Third Circuit heard oral arguments on June 10 in the appeal of the district court's decision upholding New Jersey's welfare reform program. The district court held that freezing welfare benefits and refusing to give additional benefits for additional children does not violate the rights of AFDC recipients. Legal Services of New Jersey, with the assistance of the ACLU and NOW, appealed the decision. Representing three New Jersey AFDC recipients and three public interest organizations, the Institute for Justice submitted briefs in the district court and the appeals court. IJ's briefs showed how the New Jersey case fits into a carefully-planned welfare rights agenda, orchestrated by Legal Services attorneys. A decision is expected in the next few months.
<p>
<b>Inter-racial Adoption Case</b>
<p>
<i>Matthew O. and Joseph I. v. Texas Dept. of Protective and Regulatory Services,</i> the Institute's attack on barriers to interracial adoptions, a state trial court recently denied class certification. Judge F. Scott McCown Found that Lou Ann and Scott Mullen, acting as next friends to the proposed class of minority children, cannot adequately represent the class because neither is Mexican or African American, while most of the class members are. Thus, the court found the Mullens "lack the identity of interest necessity."
<p>
The court further found that the Institute's argument that the use of race in adoption is unconstitutional_combined with its overall efforts challenging racial classifications and the regulatory welfare state_create a "very serious conflict of interest" with the proposed class. Such a conflict also precluded class certification.

Devils Tower Triumph_Climbers in Business</b><p>
A landmark challenge brought by users of Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming has ensured that all may use the nation's first monument pending a trial. An order from Wyoming federal district court prevents the National Park Service (NPS) from closing the site for religious observances by a number of Native Americans. The Wyoming court granted MSLF's motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the NPS from closing Devils Tower to commercial climbing to conform their conduct in furtherance of those American Indians' religious necessities (which) amounts to "impermissible governmental entanglement with religion."
<p>
<b>Victory in Crooked Lake II</b><p>
Property owners on Crooked Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan won a second victory when a federal district court ruled in their favor in another challenge to the attempt by the U.S. Forest Service to regulate private property due to its adjacency to a federal wilderness area. On May 16, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan barred the Forest Service from enforcing regulations denying MSLF clients motorboats access to Crooked Lake. The court agreed with MSLF on all counts, ruling: only Congress may use the Property Clause; only federal land was designated as part of the wilderness; private land could become part of the wilderness only with the consent of the owner; buffer zones could not be created around the wilderness; and wilderness designation is "subject to valid existing rights."
<p>
<b>Gasoline Tax: Unconstitutional?</b><p>
As the national debate heats up on the controversial fuel tax that was part of the 1993 Clinton tax package, MSLF has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the tax was unconstitutional on the day President Clinton signed it into law. MSLF believes the tax violates the Constitution's Origination Clause since it failed to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association before federal district court in Wyoming where the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court ruled that, by act of Congress, any challenge to a federal tax must first be heard by the Internal Revenue Service. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court, while expressing concern as to whether the Origination Clause was violated, agreed with the district court that Congress had prohibited suits such as the one filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
Punitive Damages Case</b><p>
In a case that has generated much publicity, the U.S. Supreme Court has, for the first time ever, reversed a state court award of punitive damages on the grounds that the damages were so excessive as to offend constitutional due process. This case may induce lower courts to begin to rein in spiraling punitive awards which have made some state courts into virtual litigation lotteries.
<p>
<i>Gore v. BMW </i>was an Alabama case awarding $2 million in punitive damages to a doctor whose BMW was repainted without his knowledge before he bought it. The case was a paradigm of the absurdities that occur under the current system which allows juries virtually complete discretion to award punitive damages. NWLF's <i>amicus</i> brief, filed on behalf of the  New England Council, argued for constitutional guidelines to restrain such awards. This decision begins that process.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Employment Case</b><p>
After Ms. O' Brien, who had no written employment contract with the company, was detected making anonymous calls to her supervisor, she was fired. She sued for breach of contract in Superior Court and in <i>O'Brien v. NYNEX</I> she won a total judgment of $500,000. That award included, in addition to a large breach of contract award against the company, $100,000 against her supervisor for his malicious interference with her employment.
<p>
NELF argued to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court had erred in finding that Ms. O'Brien could base a breach of contract action on the company's Personnel Manual. While the SJC did allow the contract action, it held, as NELF and NYNEX had argued, that if the Manual constituted a "contract," O'Brien had to follow all the rules in the contract including the grievance process. Since she never filed a grievance, the court held that she forfeited any "contract" right she may have had.
<p>
The court, however, did uphold the award against the supervisor personally. In a decision that may reflect the unusual facts of this case, the court held that a jury could find that the supervisor was so personally antagonistic to Ms. O'Brien that he forfeited future cases to ensure that this ruling does not create a loophole allowing fired employees to recover tort damages in employment cases. 
<p>
<b>Retroactive Property Tax Case</b>
<p>NELF will represent the Connecticut Business & Industry association in a Connecticut tax case involving Southern Connecticut Gas Company in which the primary issue is whether a town can reassess a taxpayer's listed property years after the tax was levied and paid.
Connecticut law requires owners of property to file an annual list of all real and personal property with the town in which the property is located. The town has a period to review the data and then it publishes a "Grand List" which includes all property in the town and its taxable values. In this case, a town seeking additional revenue reassessed the company's property years after the tax was paid.
<p>
Connecticut law permits the Grand List to be revised to include "omitted" property. The Superior Court rejected the town's effort to stretch that provision to cover a dispute over the property's value. If the town is successful, all Connecticut property owners will face a dramatically higher risk of retroactive property tax bills.
<p>
<b>NELF Fights Unemployment Compensation Award</b><p>
On behalf of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, NELF will file an <i>amicus</I> brief in the SJC in a Massachusetts unemployment compensation appeal which involves whether an employee who was fired knowingly violating a reasonable and uniformly enforced company policy can still receive unemployment compensation. The employee, a nursing aide, was fired for cursing an elderly patient in violation of a policy against verbal or physical patient abuse.
<p>
The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed a lower court's denial of benefits, adding a "deliberate" glass to the statute. NGLF's brief will argue that that decision is legally wrong and would undermine laws and rules prohibiting patient and elderly abuse and, more generally, it would lower the already low threshold for receiving unemployment benefits, raising costs for Massachusetts employers and employees.
<p>
<b>Veteran's Tax Case Reaches End of the line</b><p>
After four years of litigation and a supporting brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, the U.S. Supreme Court has designed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>in NELF's effort to stop Massachusetts' policy of taxing federal military retirement benefits.

<B>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.<P>
Union Scheme Against New Employees</b><p>
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys have filed unfair labor practice charges with the Washington State Personnel Board on behalf of a Tocoma hospital employee after a state agency and its union concealed information from newly hired workers detailing their rights to cut off the use of compulsory union dues for politics.
<p>
Western State Hospital social worker Jennie Stephenson brought charges which describe how the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) union, in new employee orientation programs routinely withhold details on the limits of union-mandated forced-dues payments.
<p>
Foundation attorneys charge that the failure of an employer to provide such information violated regulations concerning employment relations.
<p>
In her charges, Ms. Stephenson seeks an order to restore the constitutional rights of workers by requiring that DSHS immediately begin informing new employees of their rights to withhold forced dues for politics. She also is asking for a refund of nonchargeable fees, plus interest, collected in the last six months, the removal of barriers to challenging forced-dues amounts, and the full disclosure of the right to withhold forced dues to all members of the bargaining unit.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
<i>BMW v. Gore</i>: Punitive Damages</b><p>
In a major victory for civil justice reform, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion on May 20, 1996, that a $2 million punitive damage award for minor paint damage to a BMW automobile was "grossly excessive" under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The landmark decision came only a few weeks after president Clinton, at the insistence of plaintiffs' lawyers, vetoed a measure that would have placed limits on the award of punitive damages in product liability case. WLF argued that the $ 2 million punitive damages, 500 times the amount of the compensatory damages, was clearly excessive in light of BMW's good faith effort to comply with applicable disclosure laws and reasonable industry standards.
<p>
<b><i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>: Endangered Species Act</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WLF filed a brief in U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of persons affected by federal decisions taken under the Endangered Species Act to sue under the citizen suit provision of the ESA in order to challenge those decisions. WLF's clients include Senator Dick Kempthorne of Idaho, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Chairman of the Resources Committee Task Force on Endangered Species, and Representatives Bill Baker, Helen Chenoweth and Gerald Solomon and the Fairness to Land Owners Committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that only environmentalists who wish to protect endangered species have standing to challenge agency decisions in court. WLF argued that businesses, ranchers, property owners and others who are directly affected by decisions under the ESA should also have a standing to challenge the excessiveness of agency decision making under the ESA.
<p>
<b><i>Habeas Corpus </i>Reform Measure</b><p>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, in this expedited case to hear a challenge to the recently enacted <i>habeas corpus</i> reform measure. A hearing in the case was held on June 3, 1996. The death row defendant in this case challenged the constitutionality of the new law enacted earlier this year that limits the ability of death row inmates to file second and successive <i>habeas corpus </i>petitions. The law has a "gatekeeper" provision that requires that such petitions be first approved by a three judge panel of the respective U.S. Court of Appeals and that decisions granting or denying the filing of the petition cannot be reviewed in the Supreme Court. The oral argument centered around the question of whether Congress could deprive the Supreme Court of original jurisdiction to hear <i>habeas corpus </i>petition filed with the High Court. The last time such a petition was granted was over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b><i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona</i>: Official English</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WFL filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting a provision in the Arizona Constitution that requires state employees to speak English while on the job. In its brief, WLF represented 34 Members of Congress, the State of Nebraska, and the Claremont Institute, and argued that the First Amendment rights of government employed are not infringed by a state law requiring that official business of the state be transacted in English. In this case, a government employee argued that the First Amendment protected her right to settle damage claims against the State of Arizona in Spanish rather than in English.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government -- and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called the Right to Know Payroll Form.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The "Right to Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look money-wise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out -- in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right to Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee.	Then, all the rest is taken out -- Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government -- much of it before they even know about it -- they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And many in Michigan already have. The largest, and most notable, is the State of Michigan. That's right, all 60,000 State of Michigan employees will receive a list of what the state -- the taxpayers, really -- must pay for their Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although the state will not provide employees with the costs of workers' compensation or unemployment insurance, this is a great first step. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the Right to Know Payroll Form is a great idea. Imagine a country where every employee knew how much government <I>really</I> cost him or her in the form of lost wages. I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1079, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that, America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, if concrete guidelines for military intervention are not adopted. Hillen lists five criteria for military intervention: 1) it should defend national security interests; 2) it should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments; 3) it should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable; 4) it should enjoy congressional and public support; and 5) the armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success. Congress should also require, according to Hillen, that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain: a prioritization of national interests and national security interests; a listing of criteria, such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions; a set of criteria for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures; an unequivocal guarantee that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and a declaration that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine. 19 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: 
A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism, </b>
by Joshua Muravchik <p>
The American Enterprise Institute<p>
Joshua Muravchik, a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calls for an active, interventionist American post-cold war foreign policy. Muravchik argues that at times "America must be the policeman -- at others, the mediator, teacher, or benefactor." Only America, as the sole superpower, can provide leadership in upholding world peace. Muravchik uses the case of Bosnia to illustrate his argument. He asserts that Europe's and the United Nations' unimpressive response to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia revealed the decay of the United Nations and remains as the saddest example America leaving leadership to others. He claims that the current "great divide" over American foreign policy "is no longer between hawks and doves but between 'Washingtonians' (isolationists and so-called 'realists' who want above all to 'avoid entangling alliances') and 'Wilsonians' (activists prepared to spend treasure and even blood to defend world peace)." He also believes that America's domestic problems -- both economic and social -- arise more from weakness of character than from lack of money or presidential attention. He believes that addressing domestic problems and conducting an active foreign policy go hand in hand. 261 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20036, 202/862-5800, fax 202/862-7178.

<b>The World Bank and Economic Growth: 50 Years of Failure,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1082.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1082,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Bryan Johnson, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, examines the unsuccessful efforts of the World Bank to promote economic growth in less developed countries. In light of President Clinton's recommendation that the United States give more money to institutions like the World Bank, Johnson shows that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Concerning the World Bank, Johnson says Congress should: 1) phase out financial support for it; 2) seek a General Accounting Office audit of its lending practices; 3) make remaining funding contingent on public access to its records and information; and 4) require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries. Johnson provides a detailed history of the bank, and illustrates its failed policies. In his conclusion, Johnson points out that although the World Bank played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, it has drifted from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>A Miasma of Corruption: The United Nations
at 50,</b> by Stefan Halper<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 253, Cato Institute<p>
According to Stefan Halper, a former White House and State Department official, the United Nations' lack of accountability to its member-nations has led to corruption, mismanagement and a disconnect between costs and benefits. Halper presents a detailed analysis of mismanagement at the U.N., citing such evidence of corruption as: "secretive budget practices; an ever-growing army of irresponsible, unaccountable bureaucrats; and a massive duplication of effort." Overall, he calls for a comprehensive, independent audit of the United Nations, followed by drastic downsizing and reform, including privatization of many agencies. If such steps are not taken, Halper recommends the United States consider terminating U.N. membership. 24 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Wages, Profits, and Income: Politics vs. Reality,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi97.html"><I>F.Y.I</I>. No. 97,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, The Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at the Heritage Foundation, examines the conventional American wisdom that says that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Wilson shows conventional wisdom to be wrong. For example, while there has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. He also shows that higher profits benefit workers, while falling profits limit compensation growth. Wilson, concludes that to the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, more government programs, restrictions on trade, and increasing the minimum wage will not bring a solution. Policies that focus on the primary problems -- high taxes and slow productivity growth -- need to be implemented. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</b> by Clyde Wayne Crews<p>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project,</I> Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow in Regulatory Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how Americans live under a regime of "Regulation Without Representation," noting that much of today's regulatory rulemaking is done by agency bureaucrats not accountable to voters. He also points out that the amount of <I>non-tax</I> dollars government requires to be spent on regulation is equivalent to over one-third of the level of government spending. Crews proposes a "regulatory budget" that would enforce greater accountability by limiting the regulatory costs that agencies can impose on the private sector. Ideally, a full-scale budget paralleling the fiscal budget could be implemented. This would require Congress to divide a total budget among agencies. Crews argues that the real innovation of regulatory budgeting is its potential to make regulatory agencies feel the consequences of regulatory decision making, rather than the regulated parties alone. There are, however, some pitfalls to regulatory budgeting according to Crews. For example, under a budget, agencies have an incentive to underestimate compliance costs while regulated parties have the opposite incentive. Crews concludes that a regulatory budget is not a magic device that alone can reduce the current $647 billion cost of regulatory compliance. But, while burdens continue to increase and the benefits of regulation seems more ambiguous, it is necessary to make institutional changes that specify the purpose and reach of delegated regulatory power.  28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C., 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.<p>

<b>Broken Promises: What's Gone Wrong with the Economy in the 1990's</b>, by Stephen Moore <p>
<I>IPI Policy Report</I> No. 136, The Institute for 
Policy Innovation<p>
Stephen Moore, IPI Research Fellow, examines the sluggish economic growth of recent years, illustrating the distinct and deliberate change in fiscal policy that has taken place under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Moore shows that compared to the supply-side fiscal policies of President Reagan, the tax-and-spend polices of the 1990's raised the overall tax burden by 1.25 percent of GDP, real federal non-defense spending rose by 30 percent, median family income has fallen by 5 percent (or $2,100 per household) and that tax hikes have failed to deliver the promised revenue. Moore concludes that if the tax-and-spend policies of Bush and Clinton continue, the 1990's will produce the largest budget deficits and the slowest economic growth rate of any decade in the past half century. 29 pp.  CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 250 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX 75057, 214/219-0811, fax 214/219-2625, e-mail <a href="mailto: ipi@I-link.net">ipi@i-link.net</a>, Internet http://www.ipi.org.

<b>Market Opening or Corporate Welfare?<br>
"Results-Oriented" Trade Policy Toward Japan,</b> by Scott Latham<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 252, Cato Institute<p>
Under President Clinton, the United States has become progressively more protectionist in trade policy according to Scott Latham, an international trade consultant. He argues that in trade disputes with Japan over cars, semiconductors and photographic film, the Administration policy constitutes "corporate welfare in the international arena." The trade disputes, according to Latham, are a result of American firms' enlisting intervention in trade by the government to make up for their previous neglect of the Japanese market. These firms seek "bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat managed trade, not free trade." This study reveals the biggest beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's protectionist trade policy toward Japan, and concludes that American charges of closed Japanese markets for the disputed products are groundless. Overall, according to Latham, results-based trade policy is not about opening markets, but instead about granting special favors to policitally powerful U.S. industries. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>The Decline of the Nation-State in International Trade and Investment: Is the United States Losing Its Grip?</b> by William H. Lash, III<p>
<I>Policy Brief,</I> No. 168, Center for the 
Study of American Business<p>
William Lash, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, examines whether United States sovereignty and the concept of a nation state have been diminished with the expansion of trade agreements and the dominance of transnational corporations. He finds that the nation-state is alive and well in today's freer market place, as well as American sovereignty, arguing that what was widely perceived as a threat to U.S. sovereignty, the World Trade Organization (WTO), by law cannot usurp national sovereignty. Furthermore, 94 percent of U.S. investors have their portfolios limited to U.S. firms, while foreign investors still face many restrictions in the U.S. in industries such as nuclear energy, broadcasting, coastal and inland shipping, and domestic air transportation. Another reason nation states remain strong is cultural identity. Lash predicts that consumers and corporations clinging to cultural identity will fortify the notion of a nation-state and continue to support trade. Lash gives the examples of Canada excluding the U.S. operated Country Music Television and the EU restricting the import of non-European television programming and film. Efficiency, the concept that experts believed would lead to the demise of the nation-state by multilateralism, may not always be what the population desires, concludes Lash. 15 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Federal Estate and Gift Taxes: Are They Worth the Cost? </b><p>
The Center for the Study of Taxation<p>
This report was published by The Center for the Study of Taxation to illustrate the effect of estate and gift taxes on family businesses, federal revenues and the national economy. Many people presume that the estate tax will not affect them unless they have a large estate. However, a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and/or business property can easily qualify as an estate in the taxable range. Ironically, the report notes that the tax does not even raise very much revenue for the federal government. The federal government spends the equivalent of 65 percent of the revenue raised by estate taxes just to enforce compliance with the tax. Overall, this report shows that estate and gift taxes cost people jobs by presenting a huge obstacle to business continuity and business growth as well as limiting the creation of new jobs and increasing the cost of capital accumulation. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Center for the Study of Taxation, 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1460, Costa Mesa, CA 92626-1924, 714/641-8067, fax 714/641-3128.

<b>The Flat Tax and Small Business,</b> by Scott Moody<p>
<I>Issue Analysis,</I> No. 26, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Scott Moody, Flat Tax Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, examines the effect of the proposed Shelby/Armey flat tax on small business. He finds that the flat tax simplifies the current income tax by dramatically downsizing the 600 different tax forms into just two, each the size of a postcard. This simplification would reduce the cost of complying with the current tax code for all businesses by 94 percent-from $150.6 billion per year to $9.4 billion a year. Moody also illustrates how small businesses bare a much higher compliance cost in relation to their total revenue than larger businesses The flat tax allows for higher capital spending by small businesses, and eliminates the double taxation that occurs when there is a capital gains tax. Investments in small businesses gain profits nearly exclusively as capital gains. So eliminating the capital gains tax would help small businesses immensely. 13 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet http://www.cse.org/cse.

<b>New Jersey Income Tax Cut Led to Savings, 
Not Rise in Local Taxes,</b> by Timothy Goodspeed and Peter Salins<p>
<I>Civic Report</I> No. 1, The Manhattan Institute<p>
Timothy Goodspeed, Professor of Economics at Hunter College, and Peter Salins, Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College and a Senior Fellow at the Manhanttan Institute, illustrate that Governor Whitman's income tax cut in New Jersey lead to savings in local taxes. They found that historically, "there has been little or no relationship between income tax rates, which have varied significantly, and property tax rates, which have increased consistently but moderately." In 1995, the first year of the Whitman tax cuts, there was virtually no change in real property taxes relative to 1994. Goodspeed and Salins also point to an economic phenomenon called "the flypaper" effect. The flypaper effect says that localities are more likely to spend lump sum grants from the state than they are to spend money raised by local revenues. This means, for example, that local school boards are more efficient with their funds when they have to answer directly to the local community. 10 pp. CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000, fax 212/599-3494. <p>

<b>What Medicare's Advisers are Telling Congress About Medicare Reform,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi99.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 99,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, reports that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) have called on Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending. PROPAC and PPRC are official panels that were established to advise Congress on Medicare reimbursement and physician payment reform. The panels gave Congress the following significant recommendations and opinions on general Medicare reform: 1) Medicare spending urgently needs to be controlled; 2) beneficiaries of Medicare need to be given more choices; 3) neither panel opposes Medical Savings Accounts; and 4) today's Medicare price controls cause limitations and heavy costs. Overall, Moffit concludes, the reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Establishment Strikes Back: Medical Savings Accounts and Adverse Selection,</b> by Peter Ferrara<p>
<I>Briefing Paper</I> No. 26, The Cato Institute<p>
Peter Ferrara, Associate Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, challenges the criticism directed toward Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as a component of proposed structural reforms of Medicare. Critics of MSAs argue that they would appeal only to the healthy while traditional Medicare would be left to serve the sick. Ferrara, however, shows that recent studies that argue this point are seriously flawed. Based on actuarial studies and experience in the private sector, MSAs will appeal to a wide cross section of the elderly, regardless of their health status. Overall, Ferrara concludes that MSAs remain the best hope for reforming the Medicare system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href="mailt:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org,</a>Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Perspectives on the Continuing Debate Over School Choice</b><p>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 13, Pioneer Institute<p>
In the November 1995 issue of <I>Dialogue, "Responses to a Harvard Study on School Choice: Is It a Study at All?"</I> The Pioneer Institute gathered nine school choice experts to critique a draft manuscript of <I>Who Chooses, Who Loses? Culture, Institutions, and the Unequal Effects of School Choice,</I>edited by Harvard Professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield, and Bruce Fuller. Professor Fuller requested the opportunity to respond to Pioneer's critique. In this response, Fuller defends the impartiality of the research compiled by him and his colleagues. He also welcomes the stimulation to the debate that the Pioneer study contributes, but criticizes the fact that only advocates of school choice were invited for the critique. Fuller maintains that the empirical evidence shows that school choice is not the panacea that advocates proclaim. Terry Moe, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and participant in the Pioneer critique, responds to Fuller's defense of his study. Moe points out that the Harvard study was not undertaken by impartial researchers either. Furthermore, the Harvard study is, in reality, not a real "study" as its authors proclaim. The Harvard report was merely a collection of separate papers presented at a conference and complied into one volume. Moe writes that on the brute facts, the Harvard report and the Pioneer critique do not differ too much. The difference is in the interpretation. The Harvard report is negative and Moe thinks that this is unjustified. 8 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Decline of Academic Standards in California Public Education: The Story Behind the Student Testing Fiasco,</b> by Ben Boychuk<p>
<I>Briefings</I> No. 1996-49, The Claremont Institute<p>
Ben Boychuk, Research Associate at the Claremont Institute, examines the issue of educational standards and educational reform. The essential question, asks Boychuk, is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is a more fundamental overhaul needed? To answer this, he looks at the state of California and their well-documented attempts at education reform by raising standards. "Back-to-basics" reforms in the early eighties, which refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, brought slow but steady improvement in student exam score. Later in the 1980's, however, state education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and implemented policies popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists. In 1987, these abstract educational theories were implemented on a much more ambitious scale with the result being that verbal and math SAT scores dropped dramatically. Boychuk  urges parents to stress a "basics-first" philosophy in their local schools and not to just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Parents should monitor homework and/or classroom assignments for academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus. For, districts, he suggests a review of current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence. Districts should also eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Finally, collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions should be re-examined to see if they interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 25 pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com"> 2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet http://www.claremont.org

<b>Superfund: The Shortcut that Failed,</b> by Richard L. Stroup<p>
<I>Policy Series</I> No. PS-5, Political Economy Research Center<p>
According to Richard Stroup, Senior Associate at PERC, Superfund, the federal program to clean up hazardous waste sites, was supposed to be a shortcut. The Environmental Protection Agency was given authority by Congress to clean up waste sites immediately and then bill the responsible parties. Stroup argues that Superfund has failed to achieve the desired results and that it should be scrapped. Superfund has replaced common-law procedures with nearly unchecked bureaucratic control. Overall, Stroup calls for Congress to allow both citizens who feel harmed (or at risk) and those accused of wrongdoing access to judicial review. This would curb the tendency by EPA, according to Stroup,  to create unsubstantiated and exaggerated fears in order to justify expensive cleanups. 28 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b>Property Rights, Regulatory Takings, and Environmental Protection,</b> by Jonathan Adler<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges the notion that property rights undermine sound environmental conservation. Instead, he argues, they lie at its foundation. Under current environmental laws the federal government can, through regulation, take private land without just compensation. This directly contradicts the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The government pays the owner the value of his land when it takes the owner's property to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife preserve. However, when the government forces a property owner to alone bear a public burden on his land through regulation, the government rarely pays anything. For the last two decades, federal land-use control has been the most utilized way of achieving environmental objectives. Adler calls for Congress to ensure compensation for regulatory takings to restore Constitutionally guaranteed property rights and to lead toward the development of a new generation of environmental protection. Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings argue that requiring compensation would impose an extreme financial burden upon the federal government. Adler argues that such claims are overstated and that requiring federal agencies to pay compensation would make them "more aware of the financial risks of over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals." Other approaches, notes Adler such as incentive-based wetland conservation programs, present a possible way to achieve statutory goals on a far more cost-effective basis. Furthermore, forcing agencies to pay for the private property right they revoke through regulatory takings will encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to protecting the environment. Adler concludes that compensating landowners eliminates the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations. 30 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connect

<b>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife,</b>
by Robert Smith<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center
for Private Conservation<p>
Robert Smith, Senior Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that where human activity has contributed to species decline, the problem of overexplotation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than private ownership. According to Smith, wherever there is public ownership one finds overuse, waste, and extinction. Private ownership, however, results in sustained-yield use and preservation. He uses the case of salmon to illustrate his point. Because no one owns the rights to salmon, each user of this common property resource is pitted against one another. This has lead to rapid depletion of the stock. Meanwhile, in some European countries, salmon fisheries are healthy because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Game ranches, hunting preserves and safari parks also add support to the argument. Overexplotation and extinction of wildlife appears to stem from their treatment as a common property resource. The proper method for wildlife conservation, argues Smith, is creating private property rights. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Private Conservation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640, e-mail <a href="mailto: cpc@cei.org">cpc@cei.org.</a>

<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 4, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<p>
John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton, and George Mitchell, a member of the Governor's Task Force on Corrections, challenge arguments that American prisons are overflowing with low-level drug offenders and first-time non-violent criminals who can be safely released into the community. This study examined the portfolios of Wisconsin prisoners now serving sentences. This allowed DiIulio and Mitchell to trace the prisoner's criminal histories back to the juvenille justice system. They found that 91% of the inmates had current or prior conviction for a violent crime, the recidivism rate is approximately 90%, the majority had violated their probation or parole. The authors conclude that the people who really go to prison in Wisconsin are violent criminals and criminals with long records. 37 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html"><I>Backgrounder Update</I></a> No. 276, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Kenneth Boehm, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, calls for the abolishment of federal funding for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders reduced a fraction of the funding for the LSC with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. However, during the 1980s supporters and employees of LSC grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation. They mounted a massive lobbying campaign, financed in part by federal funds, and devised loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. With renewed pressure to reform in 1995, LSC fought back with strategies designed to ensure that their spending habits and politicized activities would continue-business as usual. Therefore, according to Boehm, it is imperative that Congress reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998. 7 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org"> Insider@heritage.org.</a>

The group issues papers that usually stress two points: 1) locking up criminals does not reduce crime; and 2) the criminal justice system is rigged against minorities. Instead of focusing on the finding of guilt and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, TSP examines the sociology of the "root causes" of crime. Among the groups that TSP has great influence over are liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law professors. Because their papers tend to blame criminal activity on the failures of society, their answer to crime is more government money for Social programs. TSP illustrates, according to the paper, why legislation should be passed preventing federal funds for groups to lobby for more federal funds.  4 pp. </ul>

<b>American Orphanages: How We Used to Care for Children,</b> by Marvin Olasky<p>
<I>Philanthropy, Culture & Society,</I> Capital Research Center<p>
Marvin Olasky, Senior Fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, presents a short history of the American orphanage. This research comes in light of the search for alternatives of failed welfare programs and alternatives to government as the cure for societal ills. Much of his findings contradict the conventional history of American orphanages that is filled with images of child abuse and neglect due to the absence of close government oversight. For the most part, Olasky finds that the accepted history of orphanages is biased towards accentuating the negative aspects while preventing us from seeing the positive role that they have played in the past. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>CENTER  FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</b><p>
<b>CIR Sues Delaware State Bar Association</b><p>

CIR represents three white students who were rejected from the Louis L. Redding Fellowship Program for first year law students in the State of Delaware because of their race. The Redding Program is operated by the Delaware State Bar Association and provides internships for first year law students from across the nation who want to spend a summer in Delaware. Virtually every significant law firm, various corporations, the Legal Aid Society, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and various state officials in Delaware participate in the Program by contributing money and/or offering internships to successful applicants. Successful applicants spend half the summer at another sponsoring employer, and receive approximately $8000 for the summer. This upcoming summer will be the second year of operation for the Redding Program. To date, no white students have been chosen for the Program. CIR has sued the United States, the Department of Justice, Gregory M. Sleet (the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware), the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of Finance of the State of Delaware, and various private entities. The lawsuit commenced in early April.
<p>
<b>CIR Sues College for Discriminatory Hiring Practices</b><p>

Dr. Ronald L. Reisner, a white male, was employed as a part-time Adjunct Professor of Government at John Jay College from 1987 to 1993. During that time, Dr. Reisner, who holds a law degree from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. from Columbia, received excellent teaching evaluations from students and outstanding performance ratings from his faculty peers.
<p>
In 1993, John Jay advertised for a permanent tenure track faculty position in public administration. The hiring committee selected a black candidate as its first choice and Reisner, who is white, as its "alternate." When the committee's first choice candidate turned down the school's offer of employment, Provost Basil Wilson, citing an inadequate "affirmative action" search, decided to leave the position open rather than offer it to Reisner, who taught the classes on a temporary one year contract.
<p>
The following year, Reisner reapplied and was one of three finalists for the position, the other two being black males. It turned out that one of the other finalists did not meet the minimum qualifications for the position and the other withdrew his application after questions were raised about his credentials. Once again, John Jay decided to extend the candidate search for a third year. Soon thereafter, when the candidate who had withdrawn from consideration announced that he was available again, the Department of Public Management immediately hired him and the other black finalist as part-time adjuncts for the 1994-95 academic year. The firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and the Center for Individual Rights filed a discrimination suit on Dr. Reisner's behalf in September, 1995. Discovery is proceeding and trial is scheduled to begin in January, 1997.

<b>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE</b><P>
<B>Battle for Choice in Ohio: Round I</b><p>

On May 15, the Institute for Justice filed its opening brief in the Ohio trial court in support of the school choice plan enacted last year. IJ worked closely with the state attorney general's office and clients and allies in Cleveland to compile necessary data. The Institute also took the lead in coordinating <I>amicus</I> briefs in this case. The Center for Education Reform hired Mark Snyderman of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher to draft a brief that was joined by a substantial number of choice supporters. The final brief is due June 20, and oral argument is scheduled for June 24 in Columbus. The Institute is working with Hope for Cleveland's Children and Councilwoman Fannie Lewis to transport parents and children to Columbus for the argument.
<p>
<b>IJ Files Cert. Petition in <I>Immediato v. Rye Neck School District</I></b><p>
On May 15, the Institute -- on behalf of the Immediato family of Mamaroneck, New York -- filed a petition for <I>certiorari</I> with the U.S. Supreme Court in a challenge to a "mandatory volunteering" program for public high school students. Such programs require that students perform community service in the manner prescribed by school officials or they will not graduate.
<p>
The centerpiece of the petition is the issue of parental liberty. The Institute will ask the Court to affirm the right of parents to direct their children's education as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment, and to restore much needed balance between public school authority and parental rights. Ironically, the Friday before the filing, President Clinton in a major policy address urged all public middle and high schools to mandate volunteering as a condition of graduation.

<b>	NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION</b><p>

<b>Union's Arbitration Scheme Violated Teachers' Rights</b><p>
 
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys recently announced a victory for employee rights as a federal appeals court refused to defer to a teacher's union "arbitration" scheme designed to deny Michigan educators their right to cut off the use of their compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit came in a challenge by Michigan educators to the Michigan Educators Association (MEA) and National Education Association (NEA) teacher unions. The decision struck down the unions' attempt to use internal "arbitration" proceedings to preclude judicial consideration of the educators' claims that the unions' forced-dues exactions violated their Constitutional rights.

<b>	NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><P>

<B>NELF and NAM Help Win Health Care Case</B><P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans has ruled in favor of the New England Legal Foundation and the National Association of Manufacturers in the fight against laws that threaten businesses' power to control health costs. The case, <I>Cigna Heath Plan v. Louisiana,</I> involved Louisiana's "any willing provider" law which allows any doctor to join the staff of a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization.
<P>These laws, which are supported by doctors and other health care providers, eliminate the economies of scale which HMOs and PPOs use to control medical care costs. If HMOs and PPOs cannot guarantee a certain volume of patients, they cannot negotiate lower prices. In turn, those groups will be unable to set their rates as low as they otherwise could, and an important brake on the health care cost spiral will be lost.
<P>
The Louisiana law was challenged by Cigna, a major insurer which operates PPOs in that state. On behalf of NAM, NELF filed a brief arguing that the law is preempted by the federal ERISA law, which bars states from enacting laws which "relates to" employee benefit plans. Since almost all group health plans are provided by employers, the court agreed with NELF that ERISA applies and states cannot interfere.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Capital Gains Controversy</b><p>
In 1994, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a major tax reform aimed at encouraging investors to hold onto capital assets longer by adopting a tax which declined depending upon the length of time they were held. That law was promptly challenged by a group supported by public employee unions which argued that the law violates a state constitutional provision which requires a uniform rate of taxation on income derived from the same "class of property."
<p>
NELF will represent Associated Industries of Massachusetts in supporting the law. The constitutional issue depends upon analysis of just what is being taxed upon the sale of a capital asset. Plaintiffs' simplistic position is that "sales are sales" and the length of time an asset was held does not change its "class." NELF, supported by economists and venture capitalists, will instead argue that what is being taxed on sale of a capital asset is the seller's personal exercise of discretion in choosing an asset and the time at which to sell it. Affidavits in this case show that in the real world of investments, assets with different holding periods are valued differently. The new law thus accords better with actual financial practice as well as providing a spur to longer-term, stable investments that benefit the state's economy and its people.

<b>THE RUTHERFORD INSTITUTE</b><p>
<b>Supreme Court to Hear Free Speech Case</b><p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a "friend of the court" brief in a case before the Supreme Court dealing with the rights of pro-life protesters. The brief argues that the injunction against protesting in a "floating" bubble zone, which pro-lifers in <I>Schenk v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York</I>  face, is an unconstitutional, prior restraint on free speech.
<p>
The injunction provides for a 15-foot floating bubble zone around clinic clients. If anyone in the zone objects to a pro-lifer speaking to them from outside the zone, they can ask pro-lifers to be silent-on pain of being held in contempt of court. Under this injunction, clinic escorts can demand that the pro-lifers not speak to the clients whether the clients desire it or not. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the concept of a bubble zone (see <I>Madsen</I>), but the "floating" bubble zone goes beyond what was permitted.

<b>SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION</b><p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Appeal in Voting Rights Act Case on Course</b><p>
SLF's attempt to intervene on behalf of Georgia voters in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against the State of Georgia, which was denied, gets another shot at judicial scrutiny-this time, from the U.S. Supreme Court. SLF Chairman Robert J. Proctor and General Counsel Henry D. Granberry, III, are preparing briefs on the critical legal question of intervenor status of voters in Voting Rights Act cases. SLF has argued that the State did not adequately represent the interests of Georgia voters in the lawsuit because the State was focused on defending specific voting district changes enacted by the legislature last year. SLF's potential intervenors include a sitting State Representative, a candidate for the State Senate, and a registered Georgia voter. Appeals under the Voting Rights Act are direct to the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore do not require application for <I>certiorari.</I>

<b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</b>
<p>
<b>Deportation Supported in Fraud Case</b><p>
WLF filed an <I>amicus curiae</I> brief in the U.S. Supreme Court asking for the reversal of an appeals court decision that would require the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to overlook flagrant immigration fraud. In the case, <I>INS v. Yang,</I> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INS cannot deport an alien based on the alien's fraudulent acts and misrepresentations, no matter how many or how long maintained, as long as the alien's motive for the misconduct is to enter and stay in this country. WLF argues that federal immigration law clearly gives the INS discretion to deport an alien for committing immigration fraud.
<p>
The case involves a Taiwanese couple who perpetrated a lengthy course of fraud beginning in 1978. The fraud was discovered by the INS during an investigation of immigration fraud committed by their children. In January of 1992, the INS issued the couple an order to show cause why they should not be deported. Overruling the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Ninth Circuit held that the INS could not consider the fraudulent acts. The court ruled that the INS had adopted a policy of forgiving an alien's "initial fraud" employed "to secure entry into the country" and that all of the subsequent fraudulent acts were "inextricably intertwined" with the initial fraud.
<p>
In its brief, WLF argues the statute involved commits the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion. WLF further argues that even if Congress had not expressly committed the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion, the Supreme Court's <I>Chevron</I> doctrine requires that INS's reasonable interpretation of the statute be given deference.
<p>
<b>FDA Chief David Kessler Refuses to Appear for Deposition</b><p>
David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), refused to appear for questioning in response to a notice of deposition served by WLF in <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Kessler</I>. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of FDA's restrictions on peer-reviewed journal articles, excerpts of medical textbooks, and other information about off-label uses distributed to doctors by pharmaceutical companies. FDA has maintained in the suit that it has no policy of restricting such materials. Documents obtained by WLF, however, indicate that the agency has threatened enforcement actions against firms that distributed such materials. WLF seeks to depose Commissioner Kessler to give the agency an opportunity to clarify its position with Kessler's own prior statements.
<p>
<b>Supreme Court Urged to Hear Property Rights Case</b><p>
In <I>Mock v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Resources,</I> WLF asked the Supreme Court to review a Pennsylvania state court decision holding that a land owner could not obtain compensation under the Fifth Amendment for a denial of a permit to fill "wetlands" for development. Conrad and Barbara Mock sought a permit to fill eight-tenths of an acre out of four acres of wetlands. The property, surrounded by a cement factory, a tire store, and other commercial development, was rendered valueless by the lower court decision. WLF argues that compensation is required under the Supreme Court's landmark 1992 decision in <I>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission.</I>

<head><title>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition - Heritage</title></head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size=4>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition</font></b></center>
<hr><p><font size=3>
I have just returned from the Nineteenth Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago, April 25-26, and I am encouraged. Despite frustrating wheel-spinning in Washington, the conservative movement is not sitting around, grumbling, waiting for the political leadership to get its act together.  We are taking matters into our own hands through an amazing variety of nonprofit and grassroots adventures around the country.  We need this kind of responsible citizenship and creative self-government to put America back on track.  If the people will lead, the leaders will follow.<p>
As you may know, the Resource Bank -- the Heritage department responsible for publishing <i>The Insider</i> -- is Heritage's information clearinghouse, strategy forum, and coalition builder for leading policy groups, scholars, and activists.  At this year's annual meeting, entitled "The States and The People: Setting the Agenda for Devolution," 290 conservative leaders, representing 180 national think tanks, state think tanks, public interest legal groups, grassroots and pro-family groups, ministries and volunteer service organizations, academic institutions, corporations and business groups, and state and local government offices, assembled to discuss methods for returning federally usurped powers to the states and the people.<p>
	At 1995's Resource Bank meeting, entitled "A Time for Leading," we celebrated an exciting new political environment where ideas thought unrealistic just months before were being discussed as serious options.  Bob Dole had called for the abolition of four federal agencies, the flat tax was miraculously on the table, Joycelyn Elders had been run out of office, and Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards were selling Doritos corn chips. <p> 
	Well, no one said it would be easy, but, in retrospect, perhaps the conservative movement was a bit overly optimistic.  We may have turned the corner in our fight against liberalism, but we have a long way to go. We do have new intellectual ammunition at our disposal, though.  The emergence of the idea of devolution, of returning powers to the states and the people, presents the conservative movement a great opportunity to go on the offensive against big centralized government. <p>
The concept of devolution, and the related concepts of federalism, subsidiarity, and decentralization, have long been standards in the pantheon of conservative principles.  But when federalism and devolution recently re-emerged in the national policy debate -- initially in the context of unfunded federal  mandates -- conservatives were not yet ready with a lot of practical ideas to exploit the opportunity.  Moreover, as Heritage's welfare analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> points out, there is "federalism," and then there is "federalism."  Having the federal government collect taxes and hand them over to ultra-liberal state welfare agencies without a few, principled, conservative "strings" is not true federalism.<p>
The purpose of this year's Resource Bank meeting, then, was to help set the conservative agenda for devolution -- devolution from the federal government to the states, from state governments to local governments, and from all spheres of government to the people.  We plan to publish proceedings of the conference.  Watch <i>The Insider</i> for the announcement.<p>
I cannot do justice in this space to all the marvelous speakers, but here is a sample.  Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith spoke of the challenges he has faced in reforming entrenched bureaucracy whose highest priority is its own survival.  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton Dunlop described how Virginia fought EPA dictates concerning emission testing systems, proving that states <i>can</i> successfully resist federal micromanagement.  California Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson recounted her struggles to fashion a welfare system that promotes individual self-sufficiency in family and community, rather than dependency on the morally bankrupt welfare state.  Activist Susan Mitchell described how she and other Wisconsin school choice advocates led a diverse coalition in a sophisticated campaign to devolve control over education to parents and communities.  Kids Hope USA Executive Director Virgil Gulker spoke movingly of his work leading individual believers in evangelical churches to minister personally to at-risk kids. National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship President Steve Mariotti outlined his program's success at launching inner-city children on enterpreneurial careers, by teaching them how to start and run their own businesses.<p>
These are the people and programs that will make devolution happen.  State-friendly partners in the federal government are necessary allies, but we will be waiting a long time for Washington to decentralize itself.  The Enumerated Powers and Tenth Amendment Enforcement Acts currently before Congress, for example, will have much better chances for passage if our friends in Congress hear from the heartland. Indeed, true devolution, true federalism, a truly free and responsible society will not occur unless we the people and the states demand it, step up to our own responsibilities, and lead the way.
It was, after all, the people and the states who authorized the federal government, not the other way around.  Moreover, the federal leviathan grew not only as a result of federal usurpation but also as a result of abdication by the states and the people -- in exchange for phantom perks and promises. If the new citizenship movement is any sign, perhaps Americans are finally learning -- the hard way --  that every time we abdicate a little piece of responsibility that is rightfully ours, we lose a little piece of freedom too.<p>
	It will take an historic coalition, The States and The People, to return America to her constitutional principles of federalism, limited government, and accountability in government. "The states" and "the people" are the two parties to whom the Tenth Amendment reserves the "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution." It is up to us to rein in government.  We have our work cut out for us—and worthy work it is.

<p><font size=3>
Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., President of The Heritage Foundation, outlines a conservative internationalist foreign policy that is anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. In his introduction, Dr. Feulner defines those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and its citizens immediately. Feulner discusses specific failures of President Clinton's interventionist strategy and points out that humanitarian interventions and other experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda, including: bilateral relations with Russia; China and its increasing hostility in East Asia; Iran, which has engaged in clandestine nuclear efforts as well as terrorism exportation; NATO, whose future has become entangled with Bosnia; missile defense, which has been dismissed as unnecessary by the administration; and the promotion of free trade, most notably the failure to expand NAFTA to include Chile. Overall, Feulner argues that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide. He lists the following as America's most vital interests: 1) safeguarding U.S. national security; 2) preventing a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf; 3) maintaining access to foreign trade; 4) protecting Americans against threats to their lives and well-being; and 5) maintaining access to resources. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Baker Spring, Senior Defense Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, surveys the decades-long effort to ban chemical weapons in anticipation of an extensive chemical weapons convention soon to be considered by the world powers. He argues that in order for any convention to deserve the support of the Senate, the agreement, as with all other arms control agreement, must pass a five part test: 1) will the convention reduce the risk of war?; 2) are the convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?; 3) is the convention adequately verifiable?; 4) are the provisions of the convention enforceable?; and 5) does the convention enhance U.S. national security? Spring lays out three principles for effective counter-proliferation of chemical weapons, including the need to deter a chemical attack,  the need for defenses against chemical weapons, and the need for offensive capabilities. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Jonathan Clarke, Research Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that the Administration's failure to address vital interests has created a vacuum in U.S. foreign policy. He writes that while the Administration has strived to change conditions in Haiti, Ulster and Bosnia, it has ignored enhancing relations with Russia, China, Western Europe, and Japan. The recent bombings by the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, according to Clarke, have proven the instability of the peace that the administration claims to have secured in the respective regions of Northern Ireland and the Middle East. And even if the administration's claims are accepted at face value, continues Clarke, regions such as Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Haiti have little relevance to America's vital interests. Interests that include relations with crucial nations such as Russia, China, Japan, and the West European powers and are in disarray. Clarke concludes by writing that the vacuum created by ignoring what should be the epicenter of foreign policy cannot be compensated by miscellaneous policy successes on peripheral foreign policy matters. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">E-mail cato@cato.org</a>, Internet

The International Republican Institute sponsored a 22-member delegation to observe Russia's State Duma elections held December 17, 1995. This report relays the findings and observations of the delegation and their recommendations for future improvement in Russia's electoral process. First, they recommend that the secret ballot be practiced even though open voting (voting outside of the booth) is customary for Russians. In general, they recommend that the counting process become more secure. Counters should be better trained and tabulation process should be better organized to close opportunities for vote manipulation. Finally, the military involvement at some voting sites had the potential to create military influence over voting. The report also contains a survey of the major political parties, delegate observations on electoral environment and administration, delegate reports from the 10 cities monitored, exit poll results, and lists of new State Duma deputies. 121 pp.  CONTACT: International Republican Institute, Suite 900, 1212 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-3987, 202/408-9450, fax 202/408-9462, <a href="mailto:IRI@access.digex.net">e-mail IRI@access.digex.net</a>.

Is There a "Clinton Crunch"?: How the 1993 Budget Plan Affected the Economy</a>,

<p><font size=3>
This recent paper, by Heritage analysts William Beach, Scott Hodge, John Barry, Joe Cobb, and Mark Wilson, helps show why there is widespread dissatifaction among Americans about the nation's economic performance, despite relatively good economic figures such as low interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)-a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many Fortune 500 companies-economists at the Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession. According to their analysis, the 1993 tax hike, supported by the President, did produce what has come to be known as the "Clinton Crunch." The "Clinton Crunch" is the economic situation in which there is a larger tax bill for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy that is performing well below its potential. They found that the 1993 Budget had the following effects on the U.S. economy: 1) economic growth has been slowed by $208 billion; 2) the pace of business formation has been slowed by over 40,000 new businesses; 3) job growth has been slowed by 1.2 million jobs; 4) the growth in household income and savings has been cut; and 5) the reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. Removing the effect of the 1993 budget, using WUMM, shows that the economy would have been performing significantly better today had the legislation not been enacted. 23 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<b><font size=3>Private Cures for Public Ills: The Promise of Privatization, </font></b><br>

<p><font size=3>
In his introduction, Lawrence Reed, President of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, praises the retreat of statism in American public policy. However, he points out the ravages of its influence are still with us: "bloated, overbearing bureaucracies; crushing tax burdens; deficits and debt swallowing huge chunks of public budgets." Reed argues that privatization is the cure for public sector waste, fraud and inefficiency. With a foreword by Michigan Governor John Engler, this collection of twenty-six  essays supporting privatization includes contributions from: Hans Sennholz, President of The Foundation for Economic Education; Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute; Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow at the Mackinac Center; Clint Bolick, Director of Litigation at the Institute for Justice; and several other authors. The essays are grouped into six sections; 1) the privatizing idea; 2) downsizing the federal bureaucracy; 3) transportation and highways; 4) private property and environmentalism; 5) rethinking "public" services; and 6) the challenge ahead.  202 pp. CONTACT: The Foundation for Economic Education, 30 South Broadway, Irvington-on-Hudson, NY  10533, 914/591-7230, fax 914/591-8910.

This issue centers on the topic of privatization. In the first article, Editor Kerry Jackson illustrates how several states have implemented privatization programs. Some of the most notable include: the proposed privatization of the new international arrival building and the cargo facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; the privatization of state daycare centers and some Department of Motor Vehicle functions in New Jersey; and the outsourcing of student loan processing operations in Indiana. Jackson also reports on how New Zealand used privatization to return from the brink of economic collapse and the success of prison privatization efforts in Texas. In another article the Reason Foundation puts forth a case for governments to sell off underutilized assets to offset budgetary shortfalls. 7 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th Floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Vague and complicated prevailing wage laws are important to potential government contractors because they effect who will bid on government contracts and how competitive those contracts will be. Greg Smith, Task Force Director at the American Legislative Exchange Council, explains that prevailing wage laws require government contractors to pay minimal administratively determined wages and fringe benefits to employees working on public works projects. Moreover, Smith writes that the U.S Department of Labor determines the wage on the federal level in a way that usually reflects union wages and benefits rather than market rate. State prevailing wage laws are modeled after the federal law which was enacted with the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. Davis-Bacon was passed in order to exclude black and immigrant workers from providing cheaper labor in the place of higher paying white union labor. 5 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Heritage Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson presents and then disproves the major myths concerning free trade expansion. Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial. Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. And Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

Daniel Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at The Heritage Foundation, illustrates the ins and outs of the flat tax. He begins by explaining what the flat tax is, then moves on to discuss its advantages. Mitchell also provides an easy model from which the reader may calculate their tax bill and then illustrates how today's tax system is anti-growth and anti-family. A state-by-state summary of a flat tax's potential impact is included, which shows how the flat tax would renew the American job creation machine and help homeowners-despite the warnings of skeptics. Mitchell also illustrates how a flat tax would positively control the deficit, how it would help seniors, and how it would save social security. He concedes in his conclusion that the one question that the book does not answer about the flat tax is how it will be achieved. The reader is reminded of how much power politicians wield as a result of their ability to tinker with the tax code to benefit special interests. The book includes a preface by Jack Kemp and an introduction by Senator Richard Shelby. 60 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

This line-by-line analysis of Michigan's 1995-96 state budget reflects a principled vision for Michigan culture, according to the authors, by asking this question about each budget item: Should this program or activity be done by the authority of the state and financed by taxation, or should it be done by its individual citizens acting in voluntary cooperation and private contract with one another? The study recommends over $2 billion in spending reductions (over 7% of the state budget) achieved by eliminating unnecessary and counterproductive programs, rolling back unjustified program growth, and contracting out for services that can be handled more efficiently by the private sector.  97 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

The new Congress took charge in January of 1995 and promised to close and consolidate redundant and obsolete government agencies. Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines the progress that has been made on these promises. Overall, he finds that in a sharp contrast to past years, Congress actually followed through on its promises and achieved more than expected. They shut down 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. Utt points out that while Congress has done its part to reduce government waste, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President. He concludes that it is obvious that tremendous progress has been made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs, however, he urges that Congress and the President revisit many of the independent agencies that survived and make additional cuts as appropriate.  20 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

<b><font size=3>The Decline of Welfare in Wisconsin, <br></font></b>

<i><font size=3>Report</font></i><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman"> 
Vol. 9, No. 3, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute</font>
<p><font size=3>
Lawrence Mead, Visiting Professor in Public Policy at Princeton, examines the decline of welfare in Wisconsin. Between 1987, when Governor Tommy Thompson came into office, and 1994, the state of Wisconsin cut its welfare rolls (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) by 23 percent, much more than any other state. Liberals claim the drop in the caseload has to do with Wisconsin's thriving economy, not necessarily the efforts by the Thompson administration to reform welfare. Mead's paper shows otherwise. He says that the economy played a part, but that it was the welfare reforms, especially the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) that greatly influenced the shrinking of Wisconsin's welfare rolls. On the issue of whether the state has gained or lost money on welfare reform, Mead shows that although it has spent much more on administration and support services than before, due to the drop in the caseload, Wisconsin has saved an estimated $68 million overall.  44 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53221, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<p><font size=3>

Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, illustrates how advocates for government-controlled health care have reformulated their strategy by sneaking their agenda through state capitals and into schoolhouses. She reports on a recent investigation sponsored by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to see how the state's public school system was being used to provide health programs for students and their families. The investigation found that several district's school based-health clinics were already providing extensive health services. The Pennsylvania General Assembly had no previous knowledge of, nor had it given consent to, the establishment and funding of such services. Young shows that legislatures are also discovering that programs and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children actually represent a renewed assault on private health care. Further investigation into the issue has revealed that state education reform programs have become the road to health reform, and that state agencies and private foundations have been the forces behind enacting Clinton Administration health care proposals through a back door. Young calls for Congress and legislatures to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles over power and money, and how healthcare reform, defeated in Congress, is being implemented under the guise of "education reform." 7 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

According to this paper, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current form is inefficient and a "prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency." Furthermore, the most significant cost of FDA's inefficiency is human, as America's outmoded medical regulatory process directly results in jobs being exported abroad and denies new medical technology to patients that need them much sooner than unnecessary delays allow. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has developed a replacement model for medical technology regulation that is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments. The Progress and Freedom proposal offers competitive forces in order to eliminate the "regulatory creep" inherent in monopolies such as the FDA. While maintaining the existing legal requirements for safety and effectiveness and even the FDA stamp of approval, the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies to review and certify new medical products. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 1301 K Street, N.W.

Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Education, and Christine Olson, Heritage Policy Analyst, write that, the only overriding federal responsibility in education is to guarantee the constitutional right of all Americans, while acknowledging that Washington is also better equipped than the states to collect and display educational data than all the states and localities. However, as far as management of classroom instruction and curriculum, the federal government is suitable for little more than offering advice. Doyle and Olson outline The Back to Basics Education Reform Act (H.R. 1883), which seeks to eliminate the Department of Education within one year of enactment. They also look at another proposal to merge DOE with the Department of Labor and the EEOC. Overall, they conclude that Americans no longer support major federal solutions to quintessentially local problems. This report includes a detailed appendix that lists several unneeded programs administered by DOE as well as their budgets, their negative effects, and specific reasons for their termination. 44 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Charles Sykes, Senior Fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, illustrates the current crisis in American schools: Americans rank at the bottom of international tests in math and science; national reading scores continue to fall; and despite massive increases in spending, American schools continue to produce students who lack basic skills and knowledge. Sykes writes that the reaction within the education establishment to the decline in test scores has been to lower standards, and that what has triumphed is a "mediocre, feel good education that is more concerned with pumping self-esteem than it is with passing on knowledge." Sykes traces the roots of these educational fads to their current state today. He also discusses the following: why American students test poorly in language, math and science when compared with peers from other countries; why "self-esteem" has supplanted grades and genuine achievements in American schools; how the education teachers' unions and school boards lower standards while continuing to raise budgets and taxes; and how curriculum and standard tests are being dumbed down so everyone can pass but no one can excel. Sykes concludes the book with a checklist for parents, teachers and students who want to evaluate their schools, and a series of recommendations to restore the quality standards for learning. 339 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

Sheldon Richman, Vice President of Policy Affairs at the Future of Freedom Foundation, calls for South Carolina to drop out of Goals 2000. He examines each of Goals 2000's "goals" and shows how they will lead to more federal government intrusion, and ultimately federal control of curriculum, teaching practices, and even facilities. Richman warns that non-compliance with "voluntary" Goals 2000 directives could lead to litigation against states and local school districts. Significantly, some states-Montana, Alabama, California, Virginia, and New Hampshire-have already dropped out or refused funding because of "too many strings" attached to the funding and participation. In illustrating South Carolina's experience with Goals 2000, Richman notes that local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to set agendas, to teach in the way they find effective, and to monitor their own progress. Richman concludes that Goals 2000 is: based on the flawed belief that all children and teachers are interchangeable; based on an unsound model of education looking at schools as factories; and based on the flawed view that bureaucratic government monopoly is public spirited and benign. 16 pp. CONTACT: South Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation, 1419 Pendleton Street, Columbia, SC  29201, 803/779-5022, fax 803/779-4953.

<p><font size=3>
If the state of Michigan takes from a land owner some, but not all, of the use or value of his land, the owner is not entitled to any compensation. This forces a few land owners to bear the entire cost of these "takings" that are intended to benefit the public as a whole. Many states have initiated reforms that would permit land owners to be more fairly compensated. This study outlines the practice of takings jurisprudence in Michigan, reviews the legislative responses in Michigan and other states, and makes specific recommendations for reform. 34 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b><font size=3>Finding Fault with No-Fault Divorce Laws:
A Policy Paper from Focus on the Family, <br></font></b>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Glenn Stanton<p>
Focus on the Family</font>
<p><font size=3>
Glenn Stanton, Social Research Analyst at Focus on the Family, illustrates that the no-fault divorce revolution-once touted by the women's liberation movement-has proven to be a failure. Starting with a brief history of divorce law in the United States, Stanton moves into a history of the no-fault movement, which started in California in 1969 and brought some form of no-fault law to the other forty-nine states by 1985. According to Stanton, the no-fault reformers had four goals: 1) to lower the already increasing divorce rate; 2) to foster greater equality between men and women; 3) to improve the lives of women and children; and 4) to expand individual choice and happiness. Stanton examines each one of these goals and shows that no-fault has had the exact opposite of the intended effects. The study concludes with policy recommendations. First, divorce laws should work to preserve the institution of marriage, and should give more balance to the rights of the party that desires to preserve the marriage. Next, couples who both agree they want to dissolve their marriages without having to show fault should face a substantial waiting period  before the divorce is granted. Also, division of property should be tied to fault. To change the current overwhelming disregard for the effects that divorce has on children, Stanton argues that the needs and desires of the parent should not override those of the children, which are, as a rule, the participation of both parents in their upbringing. Overall, Stanton believes that, divorce laws should make it more attractive to invest in marriage instead of divorce.  12 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400, fax 719/548-4525.

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in <i>Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University 
</i></b><br><font size=3>
CIR represents Jerry Henry, the white owner of Henry Painting Co., who, until 1986, regularly contracted with Ohio State University ("OSU") to perform painting contracts. However, since 1986, Henry Painting has been excluded from the bidding process because OSU has reserved all painting contracts for minority-owned businesses pursuant to a 100% set-aside program. That set aside program, in turn, was OSU's implementation of the Ohio State Minority Business Act, a state law requiring all state agencies to set aside 15% of all contracts for minority-owned businesses. Because OSU could not locate any minority bidders in other areas, it contrived to reach its 15% goal by reserving all of its painting contracts exclusively for minorities.<p>
In 1994, CIR, on behalf of Henry, brought suit against OSU challenging the constitutionality of OSU's set-aside practices. The lawsuit ended when the parties signed a binding judicial consent decree.  Under the consent decree, the State of Ohio agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in awarding painting contracts at [OSU]."  OSU also agreed to pay the plaintiff $368,000 in damages and attorneys fees.
<p><b>CIR Challenges the Constitutionality of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act</b><br>
CIR is assisting in the defense of Antonio Morrison, a Virginia Tech student-athlete. Mr. Morrison, along with two other individuals and Virginia Tech, is named in a lawsuit filed by Christy Brzonkala, a student at the University. The lawsuit contains state and federal claims stemming from her alleged rape by Mr. Morrison and a codefendant in September 1994. Of importance to CIR is Brzonkala's attempt to impose civil and criminal liability upon Mr. Morrison under the so-called Violence Against Women Act ("VAWA").  CIR is arguing that VAWA represents an illegitimate exercise of Congressional power.<p>
Congress purported to pass VAWA pursuant to its authority under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  CIR contends that VAWA exceeds Congressional power under the Commerce Clause as defined by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Lopez</i>.<p>
A grand jury, after hearing testimony by the police, refused to indict Mr. Morrison for any criminal violation.<br><p>

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in<i> Doe v. United States</i></b>
<br>
CIR represents Michelle Doe, a young white high school student who wanted to attend Camp Planet Earth, a summer science camp which, based upon conditions set forth by the National Science Foundation to those receiving funds through its Summer Science Camp program, was open exclusively to minority students. Although Doe possessed strong academic credentials, Camp Planet Earth rejected her simply because of race. CIR brought suit against various state entities, including Texas A&M University, which operated the racially discriminatory summer science camp program, and the National Science Foundation. Doe has settled with the state entities and the federal government.  In addition to paying damages and attorneys' fees: 1) the state defendants agreed to discontinue any discriminatory practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, or ethnicity in selecting applicants for Camp Planet Earth; and 2) the federal defendants agreed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination by any summer science camp receiving funds from the National Science Foundation. Recent correspondence from Texas A&M indicates that it no longer wishes to operate Camp Planet Earth.<br></font><p>

<b><font size=4>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</font></b>
<p>
<b>Endangered Species Act is Before the Supreme Court </b>
<br>
Defenders of Property Rights is preparing a brief <i>amicus curiae</i>in the case of <i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>, requesting that the United States Supreme Court reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in that case. At issue is whether plaintiffs asserting an interest other than preservation of endangered species may sue the government for violating the procedures established by the Endangered Species Act ("ESA").<p> 

Plaintiffs in this case are two individual ranchers and two irrigation districts located in the state of Oregon. They filed a "citizens suit" challenging a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion that concluded that the preservation of the endangered Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker (species of fish) requires that the water level in two reservoirs be maintained at a designated minimum level.  The plaintiffs who use the reservoirs' water for commercial and recreational purposes, claim the government violated certain provisions of the ESA by neglecting to consider the economic impact caused by its finding that the reservoirs were critical habitats for the fish.<p>
	
In affirming the lower court's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, the Ninth Circuit Court astonishingly held that "only plaintiffs who allege an interest in the preservation of endangered species" may bring citizen suits under the ESA.  The ranchers and irrigation districts, the court held, did not fall within this category. "To the contrary," the court wrote, "they claim a competing interest—an interest in using the very water that the government believes is necessary for the preservation of the species."  Because the ranchers' and irrigation districts' interests in the water were solely economic and recreational, the court held that they could not sue to force the government to comply with the ESA.  The court held thus, notwithstanding that it was "aware that the ESA specifically provides that the government should consider a variety of factors—including economic ones—in designing critical habitat for a species."<p>
	
This Ninth Circuit opinion is the legacy of the last term's <i>Sweet Home </i> case, where the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the ESA's citizen suit provision was designed to further the goal of species protection by allowing "interested persons" to sue to enforce the ESA."  As well as quoting from the Sweet Home case, the Ninth Circuit also cited with approval the 1978 Supreme Court case <i>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill</i>, wherein the Court had earlier concluded "[T]he plain intent of Congress in enacting [the ESA] was to halt and reverse the trend toward extinction, whatever the cost."

<b><i>Terry L. and Gayle E. Beardslee v. Crawford County Road Commission</i></b>
<br>
On July 19, 1994, Terry and Gayle Beardslee awoke to find a bulldozer belonging to the Crawford County Road Commission on their forty acres of woodlands in upstate Michigan. Without notice, public hearing, or offer of compensation, the county bulldozer proceeded to destroy hundreds of the Beardslee's trees, shrubs, and other landscaping to clear an abandoned and overgrown logging trail that the county decided to claim as public highway.<p>

When the Beardslee's bought the property in 1989, neither the title insurance policy nor a survey of the land indicated a claim to the trail that diagonally traversed their property.  Impassable in many places, they erected barriers and posted no trespassing signs at both ends of the trail.<p>

In the process of improving this proposed road, the county expanded the eight-to-ten foot wide trail to fifteen feet. An attorney retained by the Beardslees advised them that no documents of record give the county any public right-of-way across their property.
<p>
The Beardslees are now telling their story in state court.  They are seeking compensation from the Road Commission for the damage already done to their property, and to have the road moved elsewhere.  Defenders of Property Rights is standing by the Bedraggles' request to make sure that the Road Commission is obedient to the Fifth Amendment.

<b>Milwaukee School Choice</b><br>
On March 29, 1996, the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3 to 3 on the Milwaukee school choice case, and sent the case back to the trial court for a decision.  Three justices decided against the program because of a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution, including the state establishment clause.  They did not reach a decision on whether the program violated the Establishment Clause under the U.S. Constitution or the First Amendment issue. The other three justices believe the program is constitutional in all respects.  Of the three justices against the program, one is retiring and a new justice was recently elected to replace him.

<b>Property Rights in Michigan's Upper Peninsula</b>
<br>
In a nationally-significant case regarding the ability of the U.S. Forest Service to manage private property as wilderness, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted MSLF's petition for a rehearing en banc. The Court also vacated an earlier decision by a three judge panel upholding the authority of the Forest Service.
<p>
Lake front property owners in the Upper Penisula of Michigan have been denied their right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake—a right recognized by Michigan Law—by U.S. Forest Service regulation. The Forest Service asserts that since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake, it may regulate the Lake. The Forest Servie claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property even though Congress specifically excluded private property from wilderness designation or management.

Despite SCC's submittal of the lowest bid, the contract was awarded to the next higher bidder because of Mr. Keritsis' race. The next highest bid was more than half a million dollars greater than that submitted by SCC.

<b>Air Force Base Converison Victory Upheld</b><br>

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has affirmed a lower court decision allowing continued leasing at the site of the former Pease Air Force Base.  This decision keeps New Hampshire's largest source of new civilian jobs on track. NELF has represented the Greater Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce and two other business groups since 1992 when an environmental group brought suit to block the federal government's sale of Pease to a state agency set up to convert the base to commercial use. NELF and the New Hampshire business community strongly support Pease as a key element in the state's ongoing return to economic health. Some national environmental groups had proposed using litigation threats to block conversion of military bases in order to coerce concesssions from state and federal governments.  By rejecting their case here, the court struck a blow against the plan.

<b>Brown University Title IX Case Argued in Court of Appeals</b><br>
Brown University has argued its appeal of use of Title IX to micromanage the university's athletic programs.  The case is a key test of how willing courts will be to use anti-discrimination laws as the basis for strict quotas.  On behalf of several national associations of coaches and athletes, NELF argued that Brown has provided equal athletic opportunities for both sexes and the different number of male and female intercollegiate athletes reflects student interests beyond the schools control.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Decides <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin</i>Case</b>
<br>
In a defeat for the business community, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that virtually any worker over 40 years of age, replaced by a younger person, can bring a "prima facie" age discrimination claim, even if a replacement is also over 40. The Court reversed a lower court decision NELF had supported, which held that a plaintiff could only take advantage of "prima facie" inference if the replacement came from outside the protected class. The decision did leave open a ray of hope, noting the case might have come out differently if age difference had been "insignificant."
<br><p>
<b>Certiorari Denied in <i>Leger</i> and <i>NARPO</i></b><br>
The U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for certiorari in <i>NARPO v. ICC</i> and <i>Leger v.

While denial of certiorari has no precedential significance, it means that these cases are at an end.

<b>Court Says 'No' To Arbitrary Fees For Landowners</b>
<br>
For several years, Richard Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts. They also demanded that he pay over $33,000 for public art.
<p>
PLF argued that the fees are unconstitutional for failing the "rough proportionality" test laid down in <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>. Conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exations must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community. The <i>Ehrlich</i> case differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with cash instead of land.<p>

Citing PLF's victories in <i>Dolan</i> and <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, the state Supreme Court held that local bureaucrats cannot arbitrarily and capriciously shift the cost of public projects on private landowners in the form of development fees. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the court did not go far enough. Under the court's equivical reasoning, the tough standards established in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> now apply to some, but not all, fees imposed on land use approvals. In other words, bureaucrats are subject to scrutiny only when property owners have to individually "negotiate" over terms of their particular permits.
<p>
Applying the "new" standard to Mr. Ehrlich, the state justices nevertheless ruled that he must still pay $33,220 for public art and that he must go back to the city so that the bureaucrats can have a second shot at justifying their $280,000 recreational fee.
<br><p>

<b>Bureaucrats Force Landowners To Sustain Economic Losses</b>
<br>
Leon Scharf is the principle owner of a 70-year-old apartment building in New York. In February 1994, the building was ravaged by fire. What was not burned was damaged by water used to fight the blaze. Consequently, the building was no longer safe for its tenants who had to relocate. Repairing the building to habitable condition would have far exceeded its fair market value, and yet the former tenants (also beneficiaries of New York's rent control law at Mr. Scharf's expense) filed suit demanding that the building be rebuilt so that their protected tenancies may be resumed.
<p>
New York's special Housing Court agreed that repairs would cost more than the market value of the building after restoration. However, the court ruled that this fact "was not dispositive." Instead, it held that Mr. Scharf had a "duty" to restore the property and that the tenants were "entitled" to have "their" apartment building restored. According to the court, it is Mr. Scharf—not the public as a whole—who must satisfy the city's need for affordable housing. 
<p>
In short, Mr. Scharf is being forced into a course of action guaranteed to cause a substantial loss of economically viable use of his property, not simply because the cost of restoration exceeds the fair market value itself has been severly depressed in the first place by the regulatory regime on New York's rent control laws. Pacific Legal Foundation argued to a New York appellate court that the government's demand that he repair this uninhabitable building is an unconstitutional regulatory "taking" of his property.

<b>SLF Attempts Intervention in Voting Rights Act Lawsuit Against State of Georgia</b>
<br>
On behalf of an elected member of the Georgia General Assembly, a candidate for office, and a Georgia voter, SLF has waded into the legislative redistricting battle underway in Georgia. SLF contends that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which empowers the U.S. Department of Justice to "pre-clear" any voting district changes in 16, mostly Southern, states is an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial power by the executive branch.
<p>
In its effort to challenge the outdated pre-clearance section of the Act, SLF attempted to intervene in a pending lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the State of Georgia for its most recent state redistricting efforts, which demanded that Georgia instead use its 1992 legislative map. The 1992 map has come under intense scrutiny by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate but related action underway since 1994 for its use of race as a sole criteria for legislative redistricting.
<p>
Attempting to intervene before the same three-judge court which is hearing the legislative redistricting case, SLF asked the court to enter its clients as co-defendants in the action, arguing that the citizens of Georgia have standing to raise constitutional questions not raised by the State defendants. In early April, the three-judge court in Atlanta granted provisional intervention status to SLF's clients. Within a week the Court had withdrawn the status, reasoning that SLF's claims were "too remote." SLF is currently preparing a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court under the Voting Rights Act on the issue of intervention status of citizens to challenge the pre-clearance section of the Voting Rights Act.

Such self-audits are a tool that companies use to strengthen their compliance with federal securities laws. WLF argued that SEC policy should reflect that self-audits by companies are indispensable to the SEC's efforts in maintaining compliance with those laws.
<p>
WLF argued that the SEC should insititute a broad privilege of confidentiality for firms' self-critical evaluations or audits that lead to the correction of improper activity. According to commentators, the SEC "is increasingly requesting production in its investigations of routine internal audit reports and reports of special investigations." The petition states that the SEC has created a powerful barrier to self-critical initiatives by failing to recognize such a privilege.

WLF Asks Supreme Court to Reject State Suits on FDA-Approved Medical Devices
In <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</i>, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that state-law suits claiming injuries caused by FDA-approved medical devices are impermissible because they are pre-empted by federal law. WLF argued that, given the extensive regulation of medical device design and marketing by the FDA, permitting still more regulation at the state level (in the form of lawsuits) would discourage development of new and useful medical devices. WLF further argued that the plain language of the 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act indicates that Congress intended to preempt state product liability suits against a medical device manufacturer that has complied with FDA labeling and manufacturing requirements. The <i>Medtronic</i> case is being watched closely by the business community, because it will provide a strong indication of the High Court's willingness to bar state-law suits against manufacturers whose products are already subject to significant federal regulation. 
<br><p>
<b>Regulators Must Prove Knowledge of Clean Water Act Violations</b>
<br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <i>United States v. Ahmad</i>, urging the court to overturn a criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act because the district court refused to instruct the jury that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of all the elements of the offense. Alternatively, WLF asked the court to set aside the unduly harsh 21-month prison sentence for the first offender because the Sentencing Guidelines for environmental infractions were unlawfully promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and are otherwise flawed.
<p>
WLF argued in its brief that Congress intended that "knowing" violations require the government to prove knowledge of all the elements of the offense. WLF urged the Court to follow the Fourth Circuit which requires a higher intent standard than the Ninth Circuit's lower standard recently enunciated in <i>United States v. Weitzenhoff</i>.

<h2>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h2>
<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
</center><p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i><br>
by Ronald Steel, Cambridge University Press 1995
<hr>
<p>
In his latest work, <i>Temptations of a Superpower</i>, Ronald Steel scores against what he views as a U.S. foreign policy that has outlived its usefulness, taking a brief, but well-targeted, stab at the present foreign policy dilemma of the United States.  What role should America play in the post-Cold War international arena?  Should the U.S. move toward an interventionist strategy, or pull back into an isolationist position?  Mr. Steel, Professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California and author of <i>Walter Lippman and the American Century</i>, skillfully dissects the underlying principles that served as the pillars of American Cold War foreign policy, while pointing out that new ones are needed.<p>

He begins by undermining the widely accepted notion that the United States "won" the Cold War, questioning whether the United States has come to a position as world leader by its own design or purely by default. With the absence of a great power as an opponent,  Steel argues that the U.S. role as superpower has lost its onus.  With global conflicts changing from quarrels between nation-states to intra-state ethnic and religious disputes, the former policies aimed at containment are becoming increasingly outdated.  He states: "Now we are alone:  a superpower without a challenger, a crusader without a mission."  The rules of the game are changing, but the United States continues to dance singly to the tune of the Cold War, at the risk of sacrificing significant domestic concerns and endangering the nation's pocketbook.
<p>
Wilsonian ideas, such as collective security and self-determination, combined with an entrenched, elitist bureaucracy are competing with Cold War goals, methods, and attitudes, writes Steel. Though alliance-building can serve well in situations involving only nation-states, Steel believes that collective security will only escalate today's smaller, yet complex, intra-state conflicts into regional problems. Furthermore, Steel asserts that the idea of self-determination is so impossibly open-ended that, even after years of debate, it cannot translate into practical foreign policy.  However well-intentioned it may be, it is rooted in the basic assumption that differing people cannot live together, an idea completely contrary to the American experience.  
<p>
The foreign policy "establishment" must also be addressed, according to Steel.  These estranged bureaucrats, hidden away from public scrutiny, have agendas and perspectives all their own.  They make their livings off of a bureaucratic organism that gorged itself on tax dollars (and continues to do so) during the Cold War, and now, even without the need for such monstrous budgets, they strive to maintain this behemoth in a symbiotic effort to preserve their own jobs. Steel believes that these "experts" have become ends unto themselves, and no longer the means for creating sound foreign policy.  
<p>
Steel advises a new direction for foreign policy based principally on self-interest, without the moral baggage that has so characterized many U.S. international policies.  Promoting democracy, confronting "hostile" ideologies, or acting as moral guardian should play a lesser role in American foreign policy.  He pushes the ideas of selective engagement and benign spheres of influence.  With specific guidelines set by a principle of selective engagement, the United States would intervene globally only when its vital interests are threatened. He then relinquishes the responsibility of "conflict management" to the regions in which the conflicts occur.  For example, just as Vietnam once halted the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, so would European states themselves supervise the present situation in Bosnia. Steel believes that this regional self-accountability will more easily provide global stability than an ever-widening U.S. umbrella.
<p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i> is a clearly and concisely written critique, but this published lecture is a bit brief, and lacks detail in many areas.  In addition, it is purely academic, and focuses only on description, by-passing the much needed element of prescription.  Despite this,  Steel has written a quite enjoyable and provocative work, and is well worth the few hours required to read it.

<P>
<h3>April 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Justice, Freedom, the Flat Tax, 
and the Tithe</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> The last thing you should worry about when you study the matter of various flat tax 
proposals is whether it will take a 17 percent or 21 percent rate to work. From a biblical 
perspective, two far higher priorities on taxes should be the issues of justice and freedom. 
Both are recurring biblical themes, and both are terribly jeopardized by the present tax 
system in the United States. By contrast, both would be remarkably enhanced with almost 
any flat tax approach. <p>
	Complexity, almost always, is the enemy of justice. Simplicity is its friend. As soon as 
matters get complex, in virtually any venue, the opportunity for corruption takes over. When 
people can’t understand a tax code, they get either cynical or opportunistic, and neither 
attitude is congenial to evenhanded justice.<p> 
	It’s pretty hard, for example, to beat the simplicity of the tithe. No one can ever come to 
God’s court of appeals arguing that calculating 10 percent was just too difficult, or that he 
couldn’t find a tithe consultant smart enough to figure it out.<p> 
	By the same token, it’s noteworthy that God never established one tithe for the wealthy and 
another for the poor and common folk. The rate was the same, and we can assume that God 
considers that arrangement just. The book of Proverbs reminds us bluntly that we’re not to 
use two sets of standards in any financial dealings. <p>
	To be sure, almost none of the flat tax proposals now being suggested for our country is even 
yet really equal in its application. To exempt the first $36,000 (or thereabouts) of everyone’s 
income before starting to apply a 17 percent tax clearly favors the poor, who under such a 
plan would pay no tax at all. And I’m not persuaded yet that individual income from interest 
and dividends should be exempted from taxation—an idea that will appear to many to favor 
the rich, despite the argument that this income is already taxed at the corporate level. But 
that’s why I say we shouldn’t get hung up—up least yet—in the details. The simplicity of the 
proposals tends radically toward justice, and that should be appealing to biblically minded 
folks. <p>
	The other important reason for favoring a flat tax rate is that it would promote freedom. In 
one fell swoop, the flat tax minimizes the role of government in all its attempts to 
micromanage society and culture. For far too long now have we allowed great segments of 
our public life to be driven by tax considerations. The big government social engineers tinker 
constantly with the tax code: tax incentives here, tax deductions there, write-offs for this 
desirable goal, and five-year forgiveness clauses if you take on some other cause the 
government happens to like.<p> 
	The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy, but by extension it is also the power to 
shape a society’s values and ideals—and in doing so to establish which freedoms will be 
promoted and which will be restricted. So it is a wise people who place simple but strong 
restraints on their government’s ability to drill a million holes in the tax code.<p> 
	I say all this fully aware that my employer, World magazine, gets part of its lifeblood from 
tax-deductible gifts from readers—and that such revenue might be at least a little jeopardized 
if charitable contributions are no longer tax deductible. <p>
	Not to worry! For that is the very point. As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, 
primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately 
important to them, both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. 
Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizations—but in the end, both we and 
they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade.<p> 
	I have no idea whether a 17 percent flat tax or one at 21 percent will be needed to sustain our 
government through the transition that is coming. Either way, it’s a great bargain—not 
because of the rate, but because of where the idea ultimately takes us. <p>

<font size=3>In 1995, The Heritage Foundation created a Missile Defense Study Team, 
“Team B”, to look at the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass 
destruction and  produced a report that recommended timely, affordable and technically
sound responses to a missile threat in the form of a missile defense system. This update
offers several new recommendations to adjust to the delays and negative developments
that have characterized the missile defense program in the past year including: <br>
<ol><li>the U.S. Senate should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile
defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty; <li>
Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile 
defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses; <li>Congress
should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness 
of both theater and national missile defense; <li>Congress should direct the Air Force 
to develop follow-on space-based defenses to begin deployment early in the next decade; 
<li>Congress should ensure that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated,
but open, architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to 
support missile defense systems.</ol>14 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain, The Heritage

Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, believes that deterring conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait is the most important challenge for American foreign policy in early 1996. China has 
militarily intimidated the emerging democratic system of Taiwan ever since the Republic of China’s 
President, Lee Tenghui, visited the United States in June of 1995. According to Fisher, what is at stake in 
Taiwan is not only peace and stability in the region, but the viability of democracy in Taiwan. Since 1987 
the Republic of China has sought democratic political reforms that will soon make Taiwan a democracy.

the history of government regulation of the electromagnetic wireless spectrum and how it relates

have been used to justify continued government regulation and infringement of First Amendment 
rights. Thierer calls for the following steps to be taken to ensure meaningful free market reforms:
<br><ol><li>provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum; <li>government agencies 
responsible for managing the spectrum should be required to allocate and auction off as much of 
the spectrum as possible;<li>redefine (or define for the first time) the &quot;public interest&quot;

transfer all remaining spectrum authority from the governing federal agencies to the courts, private

This report by Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of Labor Economics and Public Policy at 
the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. GDP today might be 20 percent higher 
if the regulatory buildup that began in the Johnson Administration had not occured. According to his 
analysis, if regulatory activity remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. GDP would have been about $7.6 
trillion instead of $6.3 trillion. Vedder notes that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to 
commit resources to implement governmental mandates. He concludes by writing that while some 
regulations are necessary, such as those on food and drugs, other regualtions have expanded without fully 
considering the costs and consequences of such action. 13 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of

<P>
Chairman of Center for the Study of American Business Murray Weidenbaum argues that nearly all of the 
attention in public policy discussions and legislation aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on business is 
focused on either very large enterprises or very small businesses. According to Weidenbaum, medium 
sized firms do not benefit from the protections provided to small businesses or the economies of scale 
generated by large businesses. Fortune 500 companies fill out basically the same forms and meet the same 
requirements as medium-sized firms. Therefore, the cost of complying with regulation is a higher percent 
of sales for the medium-sized firms than for larger ones. Weidenbaum shows that Congress has responded 
to the issue of uneven distribution of regulatory burdens in the predictable manner. Instead of reducing the 
burden of regulation, it has arbitrarily exempted companies of different sizes. He gives as an example, a 
series of federal regulations that take effect when a company hires its 50th employee. Because of this, some 
small firms are reluctant to expand. Weidenbaum concludes by recommending that Congress significantly 
reform and reduce regulation on business. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
Reason Foundation</FONT>
<P>
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the five power marketing administrations (PMAs) are the 
entities that make the federal government the nation’s largest producer of electric power. According to 
Douglas Houston, Professor of Business Economics at the University of Kansas, these electricity 
businesses, along with other federally subsidized cooperatives and municipal utilities, are inefficient, 
poorly managed and at risk in the environment of electricity competition. Houston argues that privatizing 
federal electricity and ending current subsidies would have the following benefits:<br><ol><li>
the sale of federal power enterprises would raise $15-30 billion to reduce the national debt; <li>$7-10 billion in direct subsidies 
to government-owned utilities and cooperatives would end; <li> privatization would lead to improved 
performance and efficiency and eliminate the political interference in management and investment 
decisions that government owned utilities have to face; and <li> putting the transmission grids of the TVA 
and the PMAs into the emerging competitive market would promote efficiency and lower prices for 
consumers.</ol> Overall, Houston concludes that ending electricity subsidies and privatizing is a win-win 
situation. 36 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA

<P>
Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation, writes that although Wisconsin has an excellent 
highway system, the majority of the state’s major highways will require reconstruction during the next 25 
years. Complicating matters, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation projects that current funding 
sources will fall $8.9 billion short of paying for the needed maintenance. As a solution to the shortfall, 
Poole proposes a public-private partnership to build toll roads in the state highway system. Poole believes 
that such a partnership has many benefits, including: highway innovations, new funding sources, risk 
transfer, new tax revenue, reduced operating costs, better-maintained roads, greater safety levels, 
congestion relief. Potential problems include: loss of public control, bankruptcy, labor issues and higher 
financing costs. Poole concludes with a description of what steps should be taken to bring about toll roads 
as a solution to Wisconsin’s highway maintenance problems including: a detailed feasability study and 
state and federal legislation to provide the adequate legal framework. 27 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy

According Transportation expert Peter Samuel, taxpayers are the biggest losers in American transportation 
policy. Samuel writes that although transportation policy is in need of reform in order to pay for its massive 
costs and to best serve the interests of commuters, entrenched interests stand in the way of meaningful 
reform. Those interests that directly influence transportation policy in Washington include: highway 
construction companies seeking more federally funded projects; social engineers seeking transit systems 
that conform to their ideals; and automobile organizations, such as AAA, who fight against such policy 
innovations as private toll roads that they feel threaten travel and commerce. Samuel illustrates the 
historical development of the transportation lobbies into what they are today and provides a history of 
government highway and transportation policy. Samuel concludes his report by saying that the first step of 
achieving reform is to realize that government monopoly in roads is not the solution. New technology and 
privatization are the answer, although it will entail taking on the entrench transportation lobbying forces 
inside the Beltway. 5 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th St., NW, 8th Floor, Washington,

<P>
Jerry Bowyer, President of the Allegheny Institute, criticizes a study prepared last year in the University of 
Pittsburgh’s &quot;Economic Benchmark’s&quot; report, as well as other studies that suggest that racial prejudice is 
doing severe harm to the economic conditions of blacks, and that the city of Pittsburgh is worse in this 
regard than the rest of the nation. Bowyer provides evidence that economic disparity can almost entirely be 
attributed to a combination of distinct demographic patterns and behavioral factors within the black 
community and not racial prejudice. He notes that the University of Pittsburgh study does not take into 
account such factors as family structure and high school and college drop out rates. The researchers instead 
just measure disparity, and on this issue it is not even complete. Bowyer argues that it is irresponsible to 
report racial income disparity figures in a racially charged urban atmosphere, where the figures are likely to 
be misinterpreted, unless steps are taken to make sure that the results are properly understood. Bowyer 
concludes that these studies, because of their omissions, are more likely to further economic disparities 
than promote problemsolving. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway

Michael Cox and Beverly Fox, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, explore why media reports paint a 
bleak picture of the average American worker’s prospects today, despite very positive economic indicators 
suggesting that the economy is thriving. After examining several different economic trends, the authors 
conclude that they are no cause for alarm. An examination of the data—an increase in employee benefits, a 
decline in median household or family size, and a shortening in the average workweek—provides a fairly 
bright picture of American’s improving living standards. According to Fox and Cox, from the perspective 
of the most long term and broadest economic aggregates, per capita real GDP and consumption, recent 
gains for Americans are on par with overall historical gains. 11 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

John Sweeney, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the Clinton Administration has 
retreated from promoting the expansion of free trade in the Western hemisphere. Sweeney points out that 
during the past year the President has reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996, and the 
that Administration has violated key provisions of the treaty. Sweeney calls for several steps to be taken by 
the President to correct the current drift away from free trade:<br><ol><li>the U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA 
obligations on schedule; <li> NAFTA should be expanded; <li> Mexico should be encouraged to adopt a 
currency board; <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico’s public sector 
foreign debt; and <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with 
Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking.</ol> Sweeney 
also proposes a free-market solution for Mexican monetary troubles, writing that Clinton’s $50 billion 
bailout of Mexico has not only failed to stop the trend of devaluation, depression and eventual default, it 
also ignored principles of free-trade. 14 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, suggests a strategy for Congress to get its budget 
and policy goals back on track. He argues that if Congress hopes to enact its legislative agenda this year, it 
should adopt a two-year budget and break down appropriations bills into more manageable pieces of 
legislation, noting that Clinton’s 1997 budget is already out, even though all the appropriations for 1996 
have yet to be passed. Utt also argues that Congress should not use last year’s strategy of waiting until the 
end of the year to present the president with an all-or-nothing appropriations bill. This strategy backfired 
and allowed President Clinton to avoid an open debate on the issue. If the appropriations process is broken 
down into smaller bills, contends Utt, Congress can directly debate policy on a program-by-program basis. 
This would expose the negative aspects of the President’s defense of the status quo. Utt points out that the 
same strategy can be used on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare. Reforms in 
these programs were vetoed at once when combined in one huge reconciliation bill. If they were free 
standing measures, however, there would be a better chance of conducting a substantive policy debate. 7

Scott Hodge, Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at The Heritage Foundation, 
illustrates that the Clinton Administration is still for big government, despite claims to the contrary. Hodge 
finds that the FY 1997 Clinton budget continues the era of big government in several ways: it increases 
federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenue by $526 billion; it spends 
a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balance Budget 
Act of 1995—$3,155 more for every household in America; it raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues 
over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in 
America; it allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to 
passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of America workers; it fails to eliminate a 
single program of any significance; it fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency; it increases 
entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from 
bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from exploding costs of Medicaid; and it spends 
$111 billion more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or 
that should be transferred to state and local government control. 13 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain,

The 17 percent flat tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader, Dick Armey, and Sen. Richard Shelby, 
shows “no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with 
their current tax burden,” according to William Beach, Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and Dan Mitchell, 
Heritage McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy. In fact, a 17percent  flat tax, on average, would 
lower taxes on all income groups. Based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, under a 17 percent flat tax, 
households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in 
their tax burden. Moreover, “About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no 
federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax,” the analysts say, “and nearly 
everyone else below $30,000 in taxable income will see their taxes fall.” According to Beach and Mitchell, 
lower taxes will not mean higher deficits. The loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-
Shelby plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. 7 pp. CONTACT:

Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at the Heritage Foundation, points out that 
polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly 
are among the groups of Americans drawn to the flat-tax because they feel that they will pay less. He then 
gives and elaborates on eight reasons why another group, liberals, should support the flat tax:<br><ol><li>the key 
philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality; <li> lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the 
tax burden; <li>current deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit 
loopholes; <li>radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax 
lobbyists; <li>because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax 
burden; <li>the flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers; <li>a 
pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit; and <li>lower-income and middle-income taxpayers 
will enjoy a more financially secure retirement.</ol> Mitchell ends by including several quotes supporting a flat 
tax from unlikely sources, such as The Washington Post, The Nation, Leon Panetta, and The New York

Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, illustrates how the mortgage interest 
deduction has become the untouchable &quot;third rail&quot; in any discussion of a flat tax. This is despite the fact 
that homeowners would gain more from a flat-rate tax than they would lose if the mortgage deduction was 
taken away. Nonetheless, Bartlett points out, realtors have declared &quot;war&quot; against the flat tax. He 
dismantles the key study issued by the National Association of Realtors by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a private 
economic consulting firm, that concludes the Armey flat tax proposal would cause housing prices to 
collapse from the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction. According to Bartlett, not only would 
mortgage rates fall by about 18 percent as soon as the flat tax takes effect,  in the unlikely event that a flat 
tax caused housing prices to fall, the decline would only be temporary. Furthermore, the flat tax would benefit homeowners by eliminating the capital 
gains tax. 9 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N. Central Expy., Suite 720,

Professor of Economics at George Mason University, looks at the National Cancer Institute’s illegal use of 
federal funds to promote a Colorado ballot initiative to raise the state’s tobacco tax. He unveils front 
groups created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats using state offices to facilitate 
lobbying; and the selling of positions of authority. In the other article Thomas DiLorenzo, Senior Fellow at 
the Capital Research Center, shows that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is heavily involved in 
funding political advocacy. He centers on a $30,000 grant the CDC awarded to the American Lung 
Association’s (ALA) May 1993 conference, “Seize the Initiative: A National Training Conference for 
Increasing Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts.” DiLorenzo states that CDC diverted from its 
mission of conducting disease research and educating the public about health issues to teaching political 
organizing and lobbying techniques, a blatantly illegal use of tax money. 8 pp. CONTACT: Capital

Richard Vedder, Professor of Economics at Ohio University, argues that capital cities in the United States 
are &quot;parasite economies&quot; which drain resources from surrounding areas. According to Vedder, lawyers, 
lobbyists, legislators, bureaucrats, and government contractors take productive resources from the average 
taxpayer to fill their own pockets. Vedder uses statistical comparisons of factors such as income, 
population change, unemployment, and working conditions to illustrate how capital cities &quot;siphon&quot;wealth 
from other areas. He shows that the average annual pay for workers in the Washington D.C. area exceeds 
the national average by 48 percent. Furthermore, the per capita income in the capital cities of the poorest 
states are about 17 percent above the state averages. Vedder concludes by saying that it is not a coincidence 
that a majority of the state capitals that have gained the most in relative affluence are in the poorest states. 
According to Vedder, this shows that the taxes that finance affluent capitals crowd out private-sector 
activity that is usually more efficient and productive than government activity. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato

Charles Griffin, former Deputy Director of the Government Integrity Project at the Heritage Foundation, 
examines slush funds in the federal government budget that can be used to subsidize the lobbying and 
political activities of special-interest groups. He shows that the agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend 
toward bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Griffin calls for the elimination of 
such slush funds. He examines each one and illustrates how they use the millions in federal funding to 
lobby for their special interests. Griffin concludes by calling for an end to federally subsidized political

According to Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst John Lui, the National Governors’ Association’s 
Medicaid reform plan ignores many of the biggest problems of the current system. He writes that the 
highly touted Medicaid reform plan drafted by the governors contains many needed reforms, but unless a 
final bill differs sharply in some critical details, the plan will be a disaster. The governors’ plan claims to 
scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor of a system of block grants to the states, yet preserves a long list of 
benefits that must be provided to a large, entitled population. In addition, since the governors’ decision to 
guarentee Medicaid coverage to so many people will impose heavy burdens on state budgets, they also 
included an &quot;umbrella insurance&quot; provision that, in effect, &quot;entitles&quot; states to federal money. If states 
experience an unanticipated rise in the number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government 
would bear the cost, which almost certainly would increase the federal deficit. Liu recommends that 
Congress make the following changes to the governors’ plan:<br><ol><li>sharply limit the guaranteed populations 
and benefits of the entitlement; and <li>the umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not 
an entitlement to states.</ol> 3 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, criticizes the National Governors’ 
Association’s welfare reform proposal for entirely ignoring the No. 1 problem that experts say perpetuates 
the welfare culture, illegitimacy. He also points out that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements 
of the Contract with America. The Contract’s welfare reform was based on three themes: a national goal of 
reducing illegitimacy; national work requirements; and greater flexibility to state governments. The NGA 
plan, according to Rector, does not contain the first two principles of reform. Rector argues that the NGA 
plan is flawed in four aspects: <li>it abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy; <li>it 
eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients; <li>it has a pervasive anti-marriage bias; and <li>it 
embodies the Clinton Administration’s &quot;reform&quot; structure, which penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.</ul> Rector concludes that bogus reforms, such as the NGA proposal, reduce public pressure for change 
and thereby helps encourage the existing system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain, The Heritage

William Beach, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, warns that the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid has not paid enough attention to the effect of the 
program on state finances. He writes that if significant reforms in Medicaid are not enacted, state 
governments will face a major increase in spending and a heavy increase in the proportion of their 
projected revenues that they must dedicate to the program. Beach shows that the cost of Medicaid to the 
federal government has grown at double-digit rates in recent years. Congressional Budget Office 
projections show annual federal Medicaid costs doubling by the year 2002. According to Beach there will 
be an estimated shift of $47.4 billion in mandated Medicaid spending from the federal government to state 
governments over the next seven years. He believes that states will respond in one of three ways:<br><ol><li>by 
enacting dramatic tax increases; <li>by reducing state spending on education, infrastructure, law 
enforcement, and other important state functions; or <li>by some combination of the first two.</ol> The National 
Association of State Budget Officers claims that Medicaid spending has already doubled from 
approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall state spending since 1987. 5 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
David Tuerck, Executive Director of the Beacon Hill Institute, James Angelini, Professor of Accounting 
and Taxation at Suffolk University, and William O’Brien, Resident Scholar at the Beacon Hill Institute, 
argue that the method by which the government funds welfare programs causes the taxpayer to have no 
incentive to take interest in how his money is spent. The taxpayer (who is a potential donor to charitable, 
nonprofit organizations) has no clear idea of how much of his tax money makes it to a welfare recipient, so 
he has no control over the tax dollar and therefore, argue Angelini, O’Brien, and Tuerck, over the behavior 
of the welfare recipient. The authors propose that the same funds that now directly flow into government 
offices can instead flow into private charitable organizations. The tax credit they propose will allow 
taxpayers to deduct 100% of their contributions to eligible charities to up to 25% of their federal tax 
liability. This gives the taxpayer/donor control over where his dollar is spent. Angelini, O’Brien, and 
Tuerck predict that such a tax credit will cause new organizations to respond to the increased opportunities 
presented to them. They conclude that competition will lead to efficiency and charitable organizations will 
be more innovative and successful than government in providing social services. 165 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
This study, by John Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, reveals that if every 
item in the National Education Association’s (NEA) Legislative Program for the 104th Congress were 
enacted, federal spending would increase by at least $702 billion annually. The study uses data on 
legislative proposals compiled by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in their BillTally tracking 
system. The spending estimates for the different proposals come from non-partisan sources such as the 
Congressional Budget Office. One of the findings in this report is that the NEA’s spending priorities are 
heavily skewed towards elderly Americans, despite NEA’s claim that it is an educational organization with 
a primary focus on schools and children. The study finds that for each dollar in new spending on children 
and education that the NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually), it advocates $5.24 in new spending on 
Social Security. The report also claims that the taxes to fund the NEA agenda are probably politically 
impractical. According to the report, the NEA would need over thirteen times as much in taxes as was 
raised by the 1993 budget package. Berthoud points out, &quot;no organization that advocates this massive 
expansion of federal spending and probably massive increase in deficits can claim to be helping children. 
This agenda will break the financial back of America’s future generations.&quot; 31 pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis

Chester Finn, John M. Olin Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and Bruno Manno, Senior Fellow in the 
Education Policy Studies Program at the Hudson Institute, examine the state of American higher education. 
They point out that although American education has grown in the last fifty years in scale, wealth, allure, 
and stature, it is encountering public disapproval and consumer resistance. Productivity concerns, 
according to Finn and Manno, had been ignored because a college education use to pay off so well in the 
job market. Today, however, that payoff appears to be decreasing while the costs of higher education are 
increasing more quickly than inflation. Furthermore, funding is decreasing, consumers are becoming more 
conscious of costs, and the number of students available for enrollment is less. Finn and Manno claim that 
in order to solve these problems,  higher education must have a greater concern for productivity and a 
willingness to serve customers. They argue that administrators should cut costs, establish tougher entry 
requirements, and concentrate on serious academic subjects. However, they concede, the public will have 
to push them to do so. 16 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O. Box 26-919,

bargaining. Myron Lieberman, Senior Research Scholar, and Charlene Haar, Research Associate at the 
Social Philosophy & Policy Center, examine the issue of education union contracts requiring school 
districts to pay for the pensions of union officials. They center on a case in the state of Rhode Island where 
officials of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers 
benefited from legislation enacted in 1987 which extended the benefits of the state’s retirement system to 
“full-time employees of organizations representing employees of the state and/or any political subdivision 
thereof for the purpose of collective bargaining.” Lieberman and Haar also cover the ensuing legal battle 
since the details of the legislation were exposed in the press and subsequently repealed in the Rhode Island 
legislature. They conclude by calling for the prohibition of this practice in other states and encourage 
school boards and state legislatures to adopt safeguards. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist at SBSC, criticizes the federal government Superfund program by 
documenting the massive costs and inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which was designed to help 
clean up hazardous waste sites across the country. Keating illustrates how only 18 percent of the worst 
waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/private sector cost of roughly $90 million. 
According to Keating, Superfund turned essentially local or state problems into national problems and 
granted the inefficient federal bureaucracy jurisdiction over them. Keating offers a three-step reform 
process for Superfund:<br><ol><li> repeal the retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, use science-
based risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the 
number of Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; <li> to bring fairness and common sense, repeal 
the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether, and only assign liability to 
individuals and businesses who broke the law, and <li> eventually abolish Superfund entirely—waste sites 
are a local problem, not federal.</ol>  28 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th

<P>
This issue of EPA Watch features an article on the conflict between EPA and industry over EPA’s efforts to 
expand the breadth and depth of the toxic release inventory (TRI) and the controversial issue of “material 
accounting.” The TRI is the list of chemicals whose emissions certain industries must report annually to 
EPA. EPA is proposing to nearly double the size of this list. “Material accounting” would require industries 
to report not only emissions, but also the amounts of a certain chemical used at key intervals in the 
manufacturing process. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce led a group of forty companies and trade 
associations in blasting the proposal in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. They claimed the goal 
of TRI is to provide information to the public so that they can make informed decisions about risk. 
Chemical use is not relative information because it is not a good indicator of risk. On top of that, EPA does 
not have the legislative authority to collect and make public chemical use information. This issue is even 
controversial in the agency itself, as many EPA scientists argue that better use can be made of resources by 
concentrating on more serious risks. 8 pp.  CONTACT: EPA Watch, 14140-L Parke Long Court, Chantilly,

<P>
Increasing incarceration rates since 1980 have led to a projected 294 percent increase in the prison 
population of the state of Pennsylvania. The funding for the state’s corrections department has grown at a 
similar rate. In order to afford new prison construction costs, The Commonwealth Foundation calls for 
privatizing the state’s prisons. According to this report, privatization saves money because government is 
simply not capable of delivering, running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as effectively as 
private firms. Various studies show that prison privatization would likely save at least 10 percent per year 
in operations costs. This report illustrates how private prisons save operational funds and construction 
costs. It is also shown that private prisons are constitutionally sound. The report concludes that 
privatization of the construction and operation of the new prisons needed in Pennsylvania as of the year 
2000, as well at the operations of existing prisons, is exceptionally attractive financially, and maybe even a 
necessity in times of financial belt-tightening. 20 pp. CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation, 600 N.

<I><font size=3>Briefing, Pacific Research Institute</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">

<P> 
Vice-President of Research at the Pacific Research Institute Steven Hayward looks at the effects of punitive 
damages  in civil litigation, which are demanded in 27 percent of all cases where they are conceivably 
recoverable. Hayward uses lawsuit filing data to show that business and government defendants are four 
times as likely as an individual defendant to face a lawsuit that demands punitive damages. Lawsuits with 
punitive damage demands take one-third longer to resolve than suits without them. Punitive damages tilt 
the playing field towards the demanding parties, according to Hayward, and increase out-of-court 
settlement amounts. Hayward provides evidence against studies that claim the risk of receiving an adverse 
punitive damage judgment is remote. Closer scrutiny of data shows that the probability of punitive damage 
awards is vastly understated by such studies, partly because the data has been improperly qualified and 
mostly because the vast majority of lawsuites are settled out of court where punitive damage demands play 
a significant role. 14 pp. CONTACT: Pacific Research Institute, 755 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines what has been accomplished by 
Congress this session in closing unneeded and obsolete government agencies. He finds that Congress has 
done a respectable job—especially in relation to past Congresses—but that there is much more to be done. 
They did better than most observers expected, closing over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs 
of various areas of the federal government. Utt also looks at what actions Congress took in 41 specific 
agencies recommended for termination by the Heritage Foundation. Excluding the five independent 
agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, Utt found that Congress’s record of the 
remaining 36 was: 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years; funding for 12 
agencies substantially reduced by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years; and no 
change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million 
saved over the next five years. Utt also shows that of the 11 agencies not significantly reduced in funding 
terminated, all but one—the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was 
tripled—saw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. Despite Congress’s proven 
effort to reduce government waste, Utt points out, President Clinton opposed many of these efforts by 
vetoing five of the appropriations bills put forth by Congress. He concludes by outlining termination and 
consolidation objectives for the FY 1997 budget. 20 pp. CONTACT: Chris O’Scannlain, The Heritage

Paul Grant, an attorney in Parker, Colorado, examines the importance of citizen initiatives in that state. He 
reports recent instances of Colorado’s elected and appointed government officials retaliating against 
initiatives that they are not happy with, and argues that Colorado’s Secretary of State, General Assembly 
and Supreme Court have combined to weaken the power of initiative. According to Grant, this has been 
done through burdensome new regulations, petty and substantial interference from the Secretary of State, 
legislative attacks on the initiative process, and Colorado Supreme Court interferences. Overall the 
initiative process has been made more difficult, expensive and less effective. Grant looks at the methods 
and motives of attackers of the initiative process, and he considers legal analysis which might be useful in 
resisting and reversing damage caused to this &quot;vital check on runaway government power.&quot; 10 pp.

In this comprehensive study, Austin Fulk, Research Associate, and Stuart Nolan, Visiting Fellow at Capital 
Research Center, surveyed 1993 corporate contributions from the 250 largest American corporations to 
cover 300 nonprofit public interest and special interest advocacy groups. Using available corporate and IRS 
data, Fulk and Nolan were able to identify over $36 million in contributions by 166 corporations to groups 
across the political spectrum. They found that for every $1.00 that corporations gave to conservative and 
free market policy groups, $4.07 was given to liberal groups favoring increased government spending and 
regulation. The book also uncovers a development in public affairs during the Clinton Administration: 
Although many corporations are downsizing their operations, some of them are supporting nonprofit 
advocacy groups whose lobbying activities promote big government and undermine the free enterprise 
system. The guide also lists specific grants made by Forbes 250 companies, and includes a cross-reference 
to easily check which companies fund which advocacy groups. 193 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research

<b>CIR Wins Appeal Challenging Racial Preferences</b><p> CIR won a major victory in March when an unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held 
that the university of Texas Law School’s use of racial preferences in student admissions is unconstitutional. CIR represents Cheryl Hopwood and Douglas Carvell, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class of the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit declared that “diversity” is not a 
“compelling state interest” that would justify the use of racial preferences. The Court stated that “[w]ithin the general principles of the fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than 
minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals.” The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powell’s opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race 
to achieve “diversity,” never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court and, in light of more recent Supreme Court rulings, did not justify the law school race-based admissions program. The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only as a means of redressing past 
discrimination by a particular government unit—in this case, UT Law School. Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire educational systems.  <p>
 
<b>Update on CIR's Case Against HUD Officials</b><p>CIR is representing the “Berkeley 3,” residents of Berkeley, CA who were targets of a prolonged 
investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In response to an administrative complaint filed by a so-called “fair housing” organization that the residents’ exercise of their First Amendment rights to protest the government’s proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter constituted discrimination, HUD conducted a lengthy investigation of the residents’ activities.  CIR filed suit on behalf of the Berkeley 3 against various HUD officers, in both their official and individual capacities, last May.  <p>
 
The Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a violation of the First Amendment and that the individual defendants are protected by qualified immunity.  The Court found the defendants’ arguments that no investigation can violate the First Amendment “striking 
in its audacity,” and concluded that it would be premature to resolve the issue of qualified immunity solely on the allegations of the complaint.  The Court did grant defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ injunctive relief claims, but granted plaintiffs leave to replead (which they have done). <p>

<b>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS 
</b><p> 
<b>Defenders Tells State It Cannot "Have Its Cake and Eat It Too."</b><p>
Defenders has argued its Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to the State’s Motion to Dismiss 
before Judge Preece of the Ninth Judicial District in Clearwater County, Minnesota.  James Peternell owns 
2/3rd interest in an 112-acre Rice Slough, which the state, pursuant to legislation passed in 1979, classified 
as a “public water.”  That classification did not, in an of itself, however, change the rights of the property 
owner.  In 1994, the state had criminally prosecuted James Peternell for attempting to exclude from his 
portion of the Rice Slough an uninvited member of the public (who later turned out to be an undercover 
DNR agent) and for leaving duck decoys out overnight on “public water.”  Although the jury acquitted Mr. 
Peternell of both criminal counts in 1995, Defenders brought its lawsuit alleging that as a result of the 
prosecution, Peternell has lost his right to exclude others from his property in violation of the Fifth 
Amendment.  In response to this lawsuit for compensation, the state has now changed its position.  During 
oral arguments, the state agreed with Defenders that Peternell can exclude members of the public from his 
property.  Defenders is seeking a court order so holding which will force the state to obey the Constitution 
and prevent any further unwarranted criminal prosecutions of Mr. Peternell.   <p>

<b>Sixth Circuit Asks Feds to Respond to MSLF Rehearing Petition</b><p> 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has ordered the U.S. Forest Service to respond to a petition 
by MSLF fro a rehearing en banc.  MSLF’s petition follows the decision by a three judge panel that private 
property in Michigan may be regulated by the Forest Service as a “wilderness” despite the provision of the 
Wilderness Act of 1964 that only federal land may be classified as wilderness. 
<p> 
Lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have been told by the U.S. Forest Service 
that their rights to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake—a right recognized by Michigan Law—can be 
denied by the Forest Service since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake. The Forest 
Service claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property. 
<p> 
<b>Appeals Court Hears MSLF Challenge to Clinton Tax</b><p> 
A potentially precedent-setting challenge to President Clinton’s 1993 tax legislation, contending that the 
tax on transportation fuels violates the U.S. Constitution, was heard recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Tenth Circuit.  In oral arguments before the three-judge panel, the Wyoming Trucking Association 
asserted that because the transportation fuel tax increase failed to originate in the House of Representatives 
(the House has passed a BTU tax), it violates the Constitution’s Origination Clause. 
<p> 
The case is on appeal from federal district court in Wyoming where the Wyoming Trucking Association’s 
lawsuit was dismissed when the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case.  The district court 
ruled that any challenge to federal tax liability must first be heard by the Commissioner of the Internal 
Revenue Service.  The Association claims a hearing before the IRS would be “futile” since it cannot rule 
on challenges to the constitutionality of a tax.

<b>NELF Brief Aids in Major Win For Massachusetts CPAs.</b><p> 
In a case with national implications, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that the state can 
constitutionally prohibit unlicensed accountants (non-CPAs) from using any language that might mislead 
the public as to their qualifications. The court also held that the state can bar such unlicensed accountants 
from preparing and distributing audits and financial reports to clients or third parties. 
<p> 
The decision involved Mr. Volin, an unlicensed accountant supported by a national association of such 
people.  Volin argued that the First Amendment prohibited the state from preventing non-CPAs from 
claiming the title “accountant.”  He also claimed the right to use adjectives such as “qualified”, 
“experienced” and “independent”, although he was not licensed by any state or recognized national 
accrediting organization. 
<p> 
But the court agreed with an amicus brief filed by NELF which argued that the state’s rules promote the 
public interest by protecting clients, financial institutions, suppliers and others from the consequences of 
inaccurate or misleading financial data.  NELF’s brief pointed out that every state in the nation has had 
such regulations on the books for decades and that a decision in Volin’s favor would cause financial 
institutions and suppliers to raise questions about the reliability of financial data regarding the state’s 
businesses which would harm their ability to engage in interstate and international trade. 
<p> 
The court held that Volin could use the bare word “accountant” to describe himself, but it barred use of 
modifiers which might imply licensure or special qualifica-tions, and it barred him from distributing 
financial reports.  By upholding the state’s rules, the court set back national efforts to weaken regulation of 
the accounting profession. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Supreme Court Brief Challenges Expansion of Corporate Liability Under 
Federal Pension Law.</b><p> 
Spink v. Lockheed Corporation involves Lockheed’s effort to reduce its defense workforce as a result of 
post-Cold War cutbacks in the defense budget.  One element of Lockheed’s effort was to offer workers a 
generous package of additional pension benefits if they agreed to take voluntary early retirement.  Sensibly 
enough, Lockheed coupled that offer with a requirement that workers who accepted enhanced retirement 
benefits must wave possible claims against Lockheed arising from termination of employment.  Lockheed 
added this proviso to protect itself against the increasingly common practice of workers accepting 
enhanced retirement benefits and then suing their former employer claiming violations of the age 
discrimination or other employment-related laws. 
<p> 
Spink refused to sign the waiver and so did not take early retirement. Instead he sued Lockheed, claiming 
that coupling enhanced benefits with a required waiver violated ERISA, the federal pension protection law. 
Spink argued that Lockheed was a fiduciary with respect to assets held under its retirement plan and could 
not use the promise of increased benefits to induce recipients to grant waivers that would protect it. While a 
District Court dismissed Spink’s claim, the Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed. 
<p> 
The case raises two key issues: 1) was the decision to award increased benefits in return for a waiver a 
“prohibited transaction” in violation of ERISA; and 2) is a corporate plan sponsor an ERISA “fiduciary.” 
Since Lockheed fully addressed the first issue, NELF only discussed the fiduciary issue. That issue matters, 
because, under ERISA, fiduciaries are subject to civil suits for compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees, 
while non-fiduciaries are generally subject only to regulatory orders to undo improper actions. 
<p> 
NELF’s brief argued that it is irrational to treat plan sponsors as fiduciaries. Corporations are responsible to 
shareholders, not to retirees. While they must obey ERISA and other laws, they cannot put retirees’ 
interests above their own, as fiduciaries must. The history of ERISA recognizes that plan sponsors and 
fiduciaries, i.e. fund trustees, have different responsibilities. Consistent with pre-existing trust law, under 
ERISA fiduciaries are fully subject to civil suit, while corporations and those that aid them, such as 
accountants and third party benefit administrators, are subject only to regulatory constraints. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Files Amicus Brief in First Circuit Superfund Case.</b><p> 
NELF has filed an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals in a case in which the government seeks to make 
a company pay millions of dollars in Superfund cleanup costs without a chance to defend itself. United 
States v. Cooper Industries involves a Massachusetts site polluted 50 years ago. The Friedlands later 
bought the land and leased it to Cooper Industries. As part of a standard lease, Cooper promised to 
indemnify the Friedlands for costs which they might incur from its activities. Later, after passage of 
CERCLA, the Superfund law, the government sued the Fried lands and Cooper because they owned or 
worked on polluted land. The cleanup estimate was $42 million, with Cooper 22% responsible and the 
Friedlands 29% responsible. 
Then the government hit upon the idea of having the Friedlands use the indemnity provision to pass 
through cleanup costs. Although the clause predated passage of CERCLA, a judge held that it applied to 
CERCLA-related costs. The government then made the Friedlands the proverbial offer they could not 
refuse. If the Friedlands stipulated they were liable for the full $42 million in damages, the government 
would collect the money from “indemnity proceeds,” i.e., from Cooper. Thus the Friedlands agreed to an 
enormous fine so long as someone else would pay it.  Furthermore, since Cooper had to pay the money 
under the indemnity, not under CERCLA, it could not use any CERCLA defenses or argue that the costs 
were unreasonable or unnecessary. 
<p> 
Obviously, this is grossly unfair to Cooper which must pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs without a 
chance to protect itself. It will also lead to waste in administering CERCLA cleanups. By using the back 
door of indemnity, government can avoid having to prove its costs are reasonable.  Without that check, 
costs will continue to spiral.  A decision on Cooper’s appeal is likely by summer.

<b>PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION </b>
<p> 
<b>First Amendment Right to Language Diversity?</b><p> 
As a taxpayer, and ultimately the “employer” of government workers, do you have the right to set 
reasonable rules concerning the operation of the agencies you underwrite with tax dollars?  Conversely, do 
government workers have a “constitutional right” to promote their individual agenda by disregarding 
reasonable workplace policies?  More specifically, should state employees be allowed to drag their bosses 
into federal court because they are required to carry out their responsibilities in English?  These 
fundamental questions are at issue in a case in which Pacific Legal Foundation recently asked the U.S. 
Supreme Court to strike down a U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Yniguez v. Arizonans for 
Official Language that the free speech right of the public employees are offended by requiring them to 
conduct their jobs in the nation’s predominant language—English. Should the U.S. Supreme Court accept 
this case, PLF will argue, among other things, that government bureaucrats have no right to turn every 
workplace disagreement into a federal case.  
 <p>
Last October the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional Arizona’s Official Language 
amendment to the state constitution.  Enacted by Arizona voters in 1988, it declared English the state’s 
official language and requires “the state and all political subdivisions to act in English and in no other 
language.”  The amendment applies to all state government employees during the performance of their 
government business.  It is not and outright ban against conversing in a language other than English. 
<p> 
<b>Malibu Declares Moratorium on Constitution</b><p> 
In 1988, Diana Merritt-Shriner and her husband bought 16 acres in Malibu, California, with the intent of 
dividing the lot into three parcels.  They spent three years paying off the loans and formulating their plans 
to build one house on each of the lots.  The county granted tentative parcel approval of the plan in June 
1990, and they subsequently were granted permits buy the Coastal Commission. 
<p> 
All was going well until the creation off the City of Malibu in 1991, when the new city leaders passed a 
law imposing a moratorium on all new development so that it could create and adopt a general plan and 
zoning ordinances.  This turn of events left the Shriners with about $75,000 of incurred expenses and a 16-
acre plot on which no development would be allowed under the terms of the moratorium. 
<p> 
Hard-nosed city bureaucrats denied the Shriners’ permit request despite state and county rules that would 
have allowed for an exception under unfortunate circumstances.  Although the Shriners’ land was located 
in a residential neighborhood, the city designated the area as potential open space or parkland even though 
it had no funds with which to purchase the property for those uses!  Furthermore, the county placed a 
“Road and Water Assessment Bond” against the property in the amount of $279,000 for which the 
Shriners’ are liable, even though there have not been any water or road impacts since no homes exist on the 
property. 
<p> 
PLF argued to the California Court of Appeal that under circumstances like these, city bureaucrats must not 
abuse their powers in a way that imposes economic hardship on property owners when it is clear that no 
public health, safety, and welfare concerns are being advanced.

<b>36 Members of Congress Support Florida Suit on Immigration Costs</b><p> 
On behalf of itself and a bipartisan group of five United States Senators (Mack, Graham, D’Amato, 
Hutchison, and Feinstein) and 34 Representatives, WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear 
the State of Florida’s lawsuit against the federal government in Chiles v. United States.  Florida brought the 
suit to compel the federal government to compensate Florida for the fiscal burdens resulting from the 
federal government’s failure to enforce its own immigration laws adequately. 
<p> 
WLF’s brief focuses on the fiscal effects of federal mandates upon states to provide education of illegal 
aliens without federal assistance to offset those expenses.  According to WLF’s brief, if the federal 
government fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is a massive unfunded mandate 
imposed upon the states to provide for the immigrants’ education and medical care.  Based on the Supreme 
Court’s 1992 decision in New York v. United States, WLF argues that although the federal government can 
create incentives for a state to provide such services, it lacks the power to hijack state resources unilaterally 
in this manner. The constitutionality of the federal government’s failure to provide reimbursement is not 
just the subject of Florida’s suit but of pending litigation brought by other states across the country:  
<p> 
<b>Miranda Decision Superseded by Statute, 
WLF Contends</b><p> 
WLF filed a brief in a Utah bank robbery case, United States v. Nafka, arguing that incriminating 
statements by defendants must be admitted into evidence even if their Miranda right were technically 
violated. WLF pointed out the Miranda has been superseded in federal prosecutions by 18 U.S.C. 3501, 
which provides that statements shall be admissible as evidence if the confession was otherwise voluntary.  
In such cases, according to 3501, the totality of the circumstances should be examined by the trial court.  
Although the U.S. Justice Department has generally failed to invoke 3501 since its enactment in 1968, the 
United States Attorney prosecuting the Utah case has asked the court to consider WLF’s arguments.

<b>Apple Growers Ask Supreme Court to 
Hear Appeal</b><p> 
On seventh anniversary of a controversial “60 Minutes” broadcast that portrayed apples treated with Alar 
as carcinogenic, a group of Washington State apple growers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their 
suit against CBS for falsity of the broadcast.  The growers, represented by WLF, suffered losses of over 
$75 million from the broadcast, which called Alar “ the most potent cancer-causing agent in the food 
supply.”  Alar is an EPA-approved growth regulator for apples; according to eminent scientists, there is no 
reliable evidence that Alar causes cancer in humans. In fact, because fruits and vegetables contain 
anticarcinogens, eating them - including those treated with pesticides - is a good way to reduce cancer risk.

<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isn’t the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business community’s pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted us—so far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolution—focus and closure are critical.<p>

Beware of Deploying U.S. Peacekeepers on the Golan Heights,

No. 1066, The Heritage Foundation</FONT>
<P>
Thomas Moore, Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and
Defense Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and James Phillips,
Heritage Senior Policy Analyst, warn against the possibility that
the Clinton Administration might bridge the peace negotiation
gap between Israel and Syria by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces
to monitor compliance with any agreement that might come about.
Moore and Phillips offer several reasons why such a deployment
of U.S. forces should not occur, among them:
<ol><li> the Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping
challenge than the existingU.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula;
<li> terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops; 
<li> U.S.-Israel relations may be adversely affected;
<li> the cost to, and  drain on, U.S. forces.
</ol>
They call for Congress to press the Clinton Administration to rule out foreign aid
to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement and to maintain pressure on Syria
to halt its support of terrorism. Moore and Phillips conclude that Congress should
open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another
<I>fait accompli</I> like Haiti or Bosnia. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris

The Cuba Transition Commitee, chaired by Jeb Bush
and composed of 44 Cuban American and U.S.-Cuba policy experts,
has produced a resource guide that provides recommended initiatives
for a three phase process for a Cuban transition to democracy
and suggests what the U.S. might do to encourage such a transition.
The guide, which also lists 66 non-governmental organizations
and 37 foundations that could play a role in the process, will
be distributed to Cuban dissidents on the island, exiles in the
U.S. and abroad, U.S. government officials, and others. 90 pp.

<B>Unfunded Federal Mandates in Transportation: The
Case for Unilateral Devolution, <BR>
</B>by Tom McClintock
<P>
The Claremont Institute
<P>
Tom McClintock, Director, Economic and Regulatory
Affairs, at the Golden State Center for Policy Studies of the
Claremont Institute, illustrates the burden that unfunded federal
mandates have on the State of California.  McClintock suggests
that California might consider forgoing federal funds and not
be obligated to the mandates attached to them, pointing out that
while the federal assistance for programs is massive-so are the
costs of the mandates. McClintock argues that although the state
would forfeit revenues far beyond the unfunded cost of federal
mandates, there would be enormous savings from the more efficient
application of remaining revenues toward truly high-priority public
objectives. For example, McClintock concludes that if California
kicked the federal government out of state transportation policy,
it would lose $2.3 billion in federal funds. However, California
would save $1.9 billion in unnecessary mandated expenditures.
By recouping a portion of federal highway taxes, the missing $400,000
could be transferred from the federal government to the state
without an increase in the total tax burden. 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<B>Restructuring America's Water Industry: Comparing
Investor-Owned and Government-Owned Water Systems, </B>
by Kathy Neal, <BR>
Patrick Maloney, Jonas Marson &amp; Tamer Francis
</font><P>
Reason Foundation
<P>
The performance of investor-owned water companies
is compared with government-owned water companies in California
in order to gauge the potential benefits of restructuring the
industry. The study focuses on tax subsidization, the cost of
capital, water charges, operating costs, investment income, and
capital expenditures. Among the results of an analysis of the
data are: investor-owned water companies provide comparable water
services to consumers at the same price as government-owned water
companies even though they pay taxes and do not receive extra
income; government-owned water companies receive generous tax
subsidies that otherwise could be used to lower taxes or fund
other government projects with higher priorities; the net cost
of capital is higher for government-owned water companies than
for investor-owned water companies; investor-owned companies are
substantially more efficient in their operation than government-owned
water companies; and government-owned water companies receive
a substantial amount of non-operating income from excess cash
balances and investments. The authors conclude that the decision
to have government entities provide water to consumers should
be reconsidered, since investor-owned companies can provide this
same function at the same cost without subsidies or tax-exemptions.

Washington Institute Senior Research Fellow Elaine
Ramel Davis updates the status of regulatory reform in Washington
State. Davis summarizes the accomplishments of the Regulatory
Reform Act and compares them with the Institute's earlier recommendations.
Davis believes that the RRA was a good start to the process of
reducing the amount of government regulation in Washington state.
However she also illustrates that while the RRA &quot;slows the
flow&quot; of new and increasingly onerous state regulations,
more needs to be done to end overburdensome regulations. 5 pp.

enterprises  to the incentives of a sound legal system;<br><li>allowing
manufacturers to distribute information regarding off-label uses
of drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles;<br><li>
annual congressional scrutiny of the federal agency's enforcement
powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining
what products fall under its jurisdiction;<br><li>negotiating and

<B>Hazardous to our Health? FDA Regulation of Health
Care Products, </B>edited

The Independent Institute


<P>
Robert Higgs, Research Director, The Independent
Institute, Ronald Hansen, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
at the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration,
and  Paul Rubin, Professor of Economics at Emory University, examine
FDA's regulation of health care products. The book's introduction
and afterword place the activities of FDA into a larger perspective
by illustrating how the agency acquired its vast powers, how it
uses those powers, and what harm caused by FDA could be diminished
by abolishing the agency. Other chapters argue that FDA, largely
regarded as a scientific body devoted to protecting public health,
is in fact a highly politicized body, often harming the public
health. Another chapter focuses on the restrictions that FDA places
on the marketing of drugs. According to the authors, these advertising
restrictions assume that consumers should be treated as if they
are unsophisticated and easily misled, and that doctors are not
reliable judges of medicines. The authors conclude that the root
cause of the harm caused by FDA regulations arise from the enormous
discretion Congress has given the agency. 113 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>The Truth About Income Inequality,</B>
<BR>
by John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson
<P>
Center for the American Experiment
<P>
John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson, attorneys in Minneapolis,
examine liberal claims that there is a widening income inequality
and a disappearing middle class in America. They illustrate that
these claims have been based, almost universally, on biased analyses
which manipulate and distort the underlying economic facts. Overall,
they conclude that basic economic data does not support the gloomy
picture promoted by liberals. Furthermore, Hinderaker and Johnson
write that the data shows that the last 25 years does not represent
an upward or downward trend for middle-and lower-income Americans.
The data also does not suggest that higher taxes, increased government
spending, or hyper-regulation of the economy will benefit middle-income
or lower-income citizens. 18 pp. CONTACT: Center for the American

<B>The Value of Fringe Benefits and Tenure in Wisconsin:
Public Versus Private, <BR>

<P>
Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
In this study, Richard Cebula, an economist at Georgia
Tech, examines the differentials in the levels of fringe benefits
provided to full-time workers between the public and private sectors
in Wisconsin. He also examines the value of tenure or its equivalent
in the Wisconsin public school system at the primary and secondary
levels. Cebula examines each major category of fringe benefits
and then all benefits combined, concluding that the overall fringe-benefit
value appears to be 36% higher in the public sector than in the
private sector. 16 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,

No. 552, The Heritage Foundation

Steve Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns
Hopkins University and an advisor to Argentina's Minister of Economy,
compares the currency policies of Mexico and Argentina. Argentina,
according to Hanke, appears to have committed itself to maintaining
a stable currency. Mexico's monetary policy, on the other hand,
is in disarray. Hanke points out that Mexicans have called for
a sound peso, but that politicians from the three major parties
and their technocrat advisors have not been able to agree on an
exchange rate policy. So far Argentina's currency reforms seem
to be working. Hanke lays out several specific areas where Mexico
can learn and benefit from Argentina's experience. 11 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Why Colorado Should Drop out of Goals 2000, <BR>
</B>by Sheldon Richman
<P>
<I>Issue Paper</I>
No. 2-96, The Independence Institute

<P>
Sheldon Richman, Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute,
examines each of Goals 2000's &quot;goals.&quot; He finds that
each goal will lead to more intrusion by the federal government,
and ultimately to federal control of curriculum, teaching practices,
and even facilities. Although Goals 2000 supposedly has &quot;no
power,&quot; and purports to build upon existing local efforts
to improve education, Richman argues that achievement of its goals
will require a drastic expansion of federal control. Richman also
shows that non-compliance with &quot;voluntary&quot; Goals 2000
directives could lead to litigation by the federal government
against states and local school districts. Richman focuses his
attention on Colorado's experience with Goals 2000 and the ominous
trends that followed its entry into the program. He found that
local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to
set agendas, teach in ways they find effective, and monitor their
own progress. Richman concludes that although Goals 2000 is supposed
to bring excellence to schools, in reality it enacts increased
federal intrusion into families, communities, local school boards,
and state legislatures. 17 pp. CONTACT: Independence Institute,

public education system. Izumi and Williams find that Goals 2000
threatens to dominate and control state and local school leaders

No. 138, Goldwater Institute

<P>
Tara Ellman, Education Consultant,
disputes some of the most widespread claims of those that oppose
school choice in this survey of participants in the Arizona School
Choice Trust (ASCT). ASCT is an organization that provides half-tuition
grants to low income parents who wish to send their children to
private schools. The survey found: low-income parents are willing
to subsidize the cost of their child's education; academics, not
religion, is the most frequently cited reason parents give for
choosing private schools; family structure  does not necessarily
dictate level of involvement in a child's education (about half
of the children participating in this program come from single
parent families); school choice programs do not result in &quot;white
flight&quot; (sixty-five percent of the participants are from
minority households); and school choice programs are not necessarily
expensive to administer (disbursement of funds for the ASCT is
done solely by volunteers, so that 100 percent of the money raised
can go to scholarships). 15 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute,

<B>Restoring School Board Options on <BR>
Contracting Out, </B>by
Myron Lieberman
<P>
<I>Briefings </I>No.
1995-48, The Claremont Institute


<P>
Myron Lieberman, Chairman of the Education Policy
Institute, examines the issue of &quot;contracting out&quot; or
&quot;competitive contracting&quot; concerning school boards'
decisions on how to provide certain school services. For example,
a school board might have to make a decision whether to hire school
bus drivers and buy school buses, or to make a contract with a
transportation company to transport its students to and from school.
Lieberman shows that school boards and school board organizations
are unprepared to deal with such decisions because there has been
a massive union effort to restrict or eliminate school board freedom
to contract services. He illustrates this point by outliningthe
efforts that the National Education Association, the American
Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO have put forth to prevent
school boards from using the option to contract out school services,
in an effort to protect their own self interests. Lieberman concludes
that school boards &quot;should make every effort to retain or
to expand their authority to utilize contracting out.&quot; 17

<B>Are Michigan History Textbooks Reliable? <BR>
</B>by Burton Folsom
<P>
<I>Mackinac Center Report</I>,
Mackinac Center
<P>
Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow in Economic Education
with the Mackinac Center, reviews four grade school textbooks
on Michigan state history. The first two texts are written for
junior high or high school students; the other two are for fourth
graders. Folsom argues that a major problem in Michigan education
today is that the textbooks used to teach Michigan history are

<B>How to Dismantle the Interior Department, <BR>
</B>by Robert Nelson
<P>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies
at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, proposes a radical reorganization
of the Interior Department and its functions, based on the following
four principles: 1) activities that can reasonably be carried
out in the private sector should be done privately; 2) activities
that mostly involve state and local concerns should be administered
by state and local governments; 3) the federal government should
limit its role to activities and concerns that involve major federal
interests and responsibilities; 4) administrative organization
at the federal level should place similar functions at the same
agency. According to Nelson, the result of applying these principles
would be the abolition of six of the ten current agencies located
within the Department of the Interior, and a sharp reduction in
the size of three others. Nelson estimates that the proposed reorganization
would save roughly $3.8 billion annually. 19 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>How and Why to Transfer BLM Lands to the States,
</B>by Robert Nelson
<P>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies at the Competitive
Enterprise Institute, calls for the transfer of Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) lands to the states. He argues that such a transfer
would improve rangeland management and restore local autonomy
in Western states. Nelson comments on current legislation on the
subject and  concludes his study by offering a series of principles
that could provide the basis for a formal transfer arrangement.

<I>Policy Analysis </I>No.
249, The Cato Institute
<P>
Daniel Klein, Assistant Professor of Economics at
the University of California at Irvine, and Pia Maria Koskenoja,
a doctoral student of transportation economics at UC Irvine, argue
that existing technology can make unpopular and burdensome vehicle
emission tests obsolete with no reduction in environmental protection.
Remote-sensing-mobile, roadside, emission sensing devices-would
prove more effective and less costly than current inspection-based
emission programs. Klein and Koskenoja point out that 20 percent
of cars on the road generate 88 percent of automobile air pollution,
and contend that current state inspection and maintenance programs
are inefficient in reducing emissions. Remote-sensing technology,
on the other hand can target the small percentage of polluting
motorists for citation by mail. The study, which is based on several
implementation plans of Los Angeles, notes that the costs of a
remote sensing system would be far less than current programs.
Klein and Koskenoja conclude by calling for amending the Clean
Air Act to allow localities to implement remote-sensing programs.

Hugh Ellsaesser, a retired scientist from the Lawrence

when managing environmental problems. Ellsaesser illustrates such
misuse in the debates concerning air pollution, stratospheric
ozone, and global warming. Ellsaesser concludes that government
bureaucrats and small cliques of politically active scientists
are helping to implement public policies that are not based on
sound science, that impose huge financial costs on hundreds of
millions of people, and that may endanger the lives of billions
of people around the world. 31 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute,

<B>The State of Violent Crime in America</B>
<P>
The Council on Crime in America 
<P>
Despite a decline in crime rates in certain American
cities, according to this report the likelihood that Americans
will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report illustrates a &quot;revolving door&quot; criminal justice
system in which one in three criminals are under the &quot;supervision&quot;
of the justice system when they commit their criminal act. It
is also shown that violent crime accounted for one-fourth of the
43.6 million criminal victimizations in America in 1993, and that
America potentially faces an explosion of juvenile crime that
will be more violent and random than anything Americans have experienced
to date. Within the next ten years the number of males aged 14-17
will increase by 23 percent, and according to the report, these
juveniles will be more crime prone than their predecessors; commit
more crimes with guns; and commit more crimes against strangers.

<B>Crime and Punishment in Texas: Update, <BR>

<P>
<I>Policy Report </I>No. 202, National Center <BR>
for Policy Analysis
<P>
According to this study by Morgan Reynolds, National
Center for Policy Analysis Senior Fellow, the reason behind the
sharp drop in the Texas crime rate is due to the increase in prisons
in which more criminals are serving more time. Reynolds points
out that the increased prison capacity in Texas means that criminals
imprisoned for serious crimes can now expect to be in jail for
a longer period of time. Reynolds finds that the overall rate
of crime in Texas has been cut by 30 percent since 1988, and compared
to 1991, the lower crime rate means that 1,140 fewer Texans will
be murdered in 1996 and 450,000 fewer serious crimes against persons
and property will be reported to police. Reynolds argues that
there is a direct link between expected punishment and the crime
rate. According to Reynolds, Texas can reduce crime even further
by continuing to raise expected punishment. 33 pp.  CONTACT: National

Michael Hartmann, Research Fellow at the Wisconsin

framework, including Wisconsin's new &quot;W-2&quot; welfare-replacement
program. He uses the ideas of  Edgar Cahn and Marvin Olasky, to
introduce the concept of volunteerism. Both Cahn and Olasky believe
that volunteerism is one of the keys to rebuilding the welfare
system and inner city decay. Hartmann concludes that Cahn's concept
of Time Dollars is something that should be used to help bring
people off of welfare rolls and into the workforce and that solutions
to social problems no longer revolve around traditional liberal
or conservative stances, but around new ideas. 35 pp.  CONTACT:

This paper examines the issue of no-fault divorce

that divorced women and men suffer, to a significantly greater
degree than married persons, early death from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, strokes, pneumonia, hypertension, and suicide. The report
concludes that the divorce problem has its roots in both culture
and law, so finding solutions to the current divorce epidemic
needs to encompass both areas. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Michigan Family

Defenders of Property Rights has argued the case
of <I>Gayle Butcher v. Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals of
Highland Beach</I> before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
This appeal raises the issue of whether local government can,
through zoning reclassification, deprive an owner of the use of
a lot to build a single-family home in a fully developed subdivision.
The Butchers and another family bought adjoining lots, one with
a house and the other vacant but developable. The Butchers later
sold the developed parcel and assumed the undeveloped lot with
the intention of building a new home there. The city, however,
said that a zoning ordinance enacted after the lots were originally
purchased precluded them from building on the lot. A decision
is expected to be handed down from the court this Spring.<B>

hurdle on February 5, 1996. Interpreting a Minnesota statute that
appeared to give the public access to privately owned wetlands,
Anoka County District Judge Edward W. Bearse ruled that &quot;it
appears that the plaintiffs would be justified in posting their
land 'no trespassing' and/or 'no hunting,' in seeking the removal
and prosecution of any trespassers, and in actively enforcing
all of their rights as owners of private property.&quot; The judge
granted the defendant Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) motion
for summary judgement to dismiss the case, but on the grounds
that the DNR made concessions during the lawsuit that brought
the agency into agreement with the Bronczyks, thus eliminating
the controversy.<BR>

<B>National Right to Work Defends Against Compulsory Union Dues

<P>
After more than ten years of delay, the National
Labor Relations Board announced a key ruling in . <I>California
Saw and Knife </I>which undermines employees' legal protections
against the use of compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling
completes NLRB deliberation on over 100 charges filed by employees
against the International Association of Machinists (IAM). <BR>

<P>
The employees, some of whom initiated legal action
in October, 1985, objected to the union's use of their compulsory
union dues for politics and other activity unrelated to collective
bargaining. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys
challenged IAM's forced unionism policy. Despite clear precedents
such as the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in <I>Communications
Workers v. Beck</I>, which allows employees to cut off the use
of their forced dues for activity unrelated to collective bargaining,
contract administration, and grievance adjustment, the NLRB developed
new legal standards governing employees in forced-unionism situations.
<BR>

<P>
Specifically, the NLRB ruled that IAM union officials'
annual &quot;notice&quot; in their internal propaganda magazine
was sufficient to satisfy an employee's right to have notice before
compulsory dues were extracted from a paycheck. In addition, the
Board held that the union can force workers to pay for activities
outside the workers' collective bargaining unit, in direct contradiction
to Supreme Court rulings in <I>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association</I>
and <I>Ellis v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship

<B>Of Spanish Land Grants and Federal Government Takings</B>

SLF has appeared this month as <I>amicus curiae</I>
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case
that combines unique historical perspective with potential landmark
legal significance. In <I>Beggerly v. United States</I>, the appellate
court will consider the question of the validity of a Spanish
land grant predating the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the U.S
Department of Interior's failure to disclose the existence of
the grant during its 20-year attempt to take the land in question
<BR>

<P>
Pursuant to 1971 congressional authorization to acquire
the land as a federal park, and the Department of Interior's subsequent
below-market price offer, the federal government filed suit in
1979, claiming that Mr. Beggerly's title to the land was void
because of the alleged absence of a valid patent. Over the next
ten years, Mr. Beggerly attempted to locate evidence of title
ownership, discovering at the National Archives an 1871 Spanish
land grant conveying the property to a private landowner filed
with the U.S. Land Commissioners in 1816. His appeal, based on
the recently discovered evidence of title, challenges the lower
court ruling that no such evidence existed, and that the federal
government therefore owed Mr. Beggerly nothing for his land. An
appellate decision is expected in early Fall.<BR>

WLF, joined by 21 Members of Congress, filed a brief asking the
Supreme Court to review the appeals court ruling in <I>Yniguez
v. Arizonans for Official English</I> that struck down Arizona's
&quot;official English&quot; law, which requires that the state
and local governments of Arizona must act in English. The law
contains exceptions allowing a government to act in a language
other than English to protect public health or safety, to protect
the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply
with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual
education. The appeals court held that the law was not justified
by the goal of encouraging unity and political stability, encouraging
a common language, and protecting public confidence in government
operations. WLF's brief before the Supreme Court argued that the
issue is of national significance and that states have the authority

<B>HUD Opposed in Attempt to Regulate Homeowner's Insurance</B>
<P>
In <I>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Cisneros</I>,
WLF filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lacks the authority
to regulate homeowner's insurance under the fair Housing Act.
WLF noted that HUD's interpretation would undermine long-standing
and legitimate insurance practices, and force consumers to bear
higher costs, by exposing insurance companies to liability for
employing standards that are not intentionally discriminatory
but that have a disparate impact on minorities. For example, many
insurers refuse to insure a property for more than its market
value; a policy that disproportionately limits insurance availability
in low-income areas where the replacement value of a home is often
more than its market value. According to WLF's brief, Congress
never intended for federal regulators to intrude on this traditional
area of state regulation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Loitering Law Defended</B>

On behalf of itself, Representatives Henry Hyde and

down a Chicago ordinance that prohibits members of a criminal
street gang from loitering on city streets after being directed
to &quot;move on.&quot; The ordinance was adopted in response
to strong community pressure to reduce the presence of gang members
of city streets. WLF's brief rejected the defendants' arguments
that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it is overly vague,
violates the right to freedom of assembly, and criminalizes one's
status as a gang member.<BR>

bar. There are Practice Groups dealing with the following subjects:
Administrative Law and Regulation; Corporations, Securities, and
Antitrust; Civil Rights; Constitutional Structure; Federalism
and Separation of Powers; Criminal Law and Procedure; Environmental
Law and Property Rights; Financial Institutions; Free Speech and
Election Law; Intellectual Property; International and National
Security Law; Labor and Employment; Litigation; Professional Responsibility,
Legal Ethics, and Legal Education; Religious Liberties; and Telecommunications

eliminated? How much real relief can states and localities expect?
How will regulators be affected? On March 6-7, 1996, the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental relations will hold a Conference
on federal mandates at the Washington Hilton to address these
questions. Speakers will survey the current state of mandate reform
and recent relief measures, Congressional proposals, key issues
that will shape the course of future debate, and the real effects
of change on states, municipalities, and federal agencies. CONTACT:

<h3>February 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Environmental
Establishment: A Status Report</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>In 1996, Washington's environmental groups have reason
to congratulate themselves: they are large and influential &quot;inside-the-beltway&quot;
political organizations with very large budgets: 1994 revenues
for the Wilderness Society were over $15 million, National Audobon
Society-$36 million, Sierra Club-$43 million, National Wildlife
Federation<I>-</I>$101 million, Nature Conservancy-$307 million.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite setbacks in Congress, the environmental movement
remains a powerful force in American politics. The organizations
that lobby and litigate receive respectful hearings in the executive
branch, the courts and in the federal bureaucracy. Environmental
groups retain the power to frustrate industrial and commercial
development and slow economic growth. As author Marek Dowie notes,
&quot;It has become virtually impossible to build a dam, open
a landfill, fire up an incinerator, drill a deep injection well,
or store nuclear waste&quot; without prompting an environmentalist
objection.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>But environmental groups have seen their membership
levels stabilize or fall in the 1990s. Losing grassroots support,
they are diversifying their sources of revenue. Individual membership
dues and contributions have been supplemented by corporate and
foundation grants and by commercial sales. Increasingly, green
groups are also relying on government support.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government funding has created a vicious circle:
Taxpayer dollars fund environmental groups that lobby government
for more programs that will fund more enviromental groups with
taxpayer dollars. Consider some environmental advocacy groups
that received federal grants in 1993, as reported in the Federal
Assistance Awards Data System: The Enviromental Defense Fund received
$236,000 from the EPA to support a national print and television
advertising campaign to promote recycling. The ad series slogan:
&quot;Buy Recycled and Save.&quot; The National Audubon Society
was awarded $75,998 by the EPA to run source reduction public
service announcements on television; The Natural Resource Defense
Council recieved $75,000 from the Department of the Interior to
support its Clean Water television and print advertising campaign,
which was timed to coincide with Congress's reauthorization of
the Clean Water Act; and The Nature Conservancy recieved $44,100
from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
for a &quot;cooperative volunteer as outreach program&quot; to
build support for the proposed Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
Some of the funds were used to draft congressional testimony and
to pay for campaigns to block a local public referendum on whether
to establish the sanctuary.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government legal fees and land sales are another
lucrative source of funds: Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund recently
was granted over $1 million in tax money to cover legal costs
for successful lawsuits it filed against the </FONT><font size=3>federal
government over management of public lands; and The Nature Conservancy
received over $476 million in 1993 from land sales to government
agencies. In past cases, lands have been sold at prices above
their appraised value. Such practices recently prompted property
rights activists in New York state to file a lawsuit against The
Nature Conservancy and the Adirondack Land Trust, charging that
both sold land to the state Department of Enviromental Conservation
at more than double its appraised value. </FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Federal law prohibits use of government funds for
lobbying. But money is fungible: when tax dollars go to nonprofit
enviromental groups; more private dollars can be shifted to lobbying.
Unfortunately, efforts to halt this practice were stalled in the
last session of Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>The modern enviromental movement that has grown up
since Earth Day in 1970 has little in common with what it once
was. Groups of hunters and outdoors people once determined what
local conservation societies would do. Now Washington professionals
and full-time activists funded by government agencies and private
philanthropies set the agenda. Groups dedicated to<I> conservation
</I>and the wise use of natural resources have been replaced by
environmental groups dominated by an ideology of <I>preservation</I>.
And conservationists who saw themselves as stewards of both the
natural environment and builders of a modern industrial society
have given way to environmental activists who often disdain technology,
industrial organization, and private sector initiatives.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Still, the price of the movement's success has been
high and the likelihood of failure increases. One critic observed,
&quot;Most of these Washington organizations are paper-issue people.
They don't ask the grass roots, and they don't educate. They are
not accountable.&quot; Radical grassroots activists who are impatient
with Washington deal making are breaking away. Local property
owners are organizing their own groups to defend their rights
and fight harmful policies. Some in the media have grown skeptical
of environmentalist claims. And political candidates are running
and winning campaigns against evironmental extremism.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>An energetic advocacy for free market environmental
ideas offers the best answer to the bloated organizations and
failed polices of the current establishment. Americans want environmental
protection, but they also want a growing economy, secure property
rights, and a clear sense that they are in control of their lives.

<i>Land Rights: The 1990's Property Rights Rebellion</i><BR>
Edited by Bruce Yandle, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995, 333 pp.
<HR>

<P>
&quot;Upon the sacredness of property, civilization itself depends.&quot; -- Andrew
Carnegie
<P>
 In <I>Land Rights:  The 1990s' Property Rights Rebellion</I>,
the authors remind us of the primary role of private property
in a democracy.  This nine essay collection describes how excessive
environmental regulation can infringe private property rights
and effectively violate the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that &quot;nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;
 In the first chapter, &quot;The Property Rights Movement:  How
It Began and Where It Is Headed,&quot; by Nancie G. Marzulla,
President of Defenders of Property Rights, the author presents
an interesting history of the modern property rights movement.
 Marzulla contends that the modern assault on private property
rights began in 1970 with two events:  the first celebration of
Earth Day and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 These two events helped spawn a regulatory nightmare for many
innocent property owners.  Marzulla recalls the story of a Florida
man, Ocie Mills, who was imprisoned for 21-months for dumping
sand on his <I>own</I> property.  The sand filled a wetland and
thereby violated the Clean Water Act -- even though a federal judge
later ruled that Mills' land was &quot;probably not&quot; a wetland
under the Act.
<P>
 Marzulla's most interesting point, however, is the following.
The property rights movement is not seeking less environmental
protection -- it merely asks that the few unfortunate landowners
who do lose their property to regulation will no longer be forced
to bear an unfair share of the burden.  Marzulla persuasively
argues that private property is not only not inconsistent with
environmental protection but can actually enhance respect for
the environment by avoiding the tragedy of the commons phenomena
that often accompanies public lands.  
<P>
 In the essay, &quot;The Lucas Case and the Conflict over Property
Rights&quot; James R. Rinehart and Jeffrey J. Pompe explain how
an obscure developer became a poster child for the property rights
movement.  In 1986, David Lucas bought two oceanfront lots near
Charleston, S.C. for approximately $1 million.  At the time, there
were no regulations or laws that would have prevented Lucas from
building a single-family home on the property.  However, in 1988,
South Carolina passed the Beachfront Management Act.  The Act
created a new building setback line that completely prevented
Lucas from developing his property.  In sum, the Act, which did
not contain a grandfather clause, made the two lots worthless.
 Although the state did not officially seize title to Lucas' land,
like so many environmental regulations, it restricted the owner's
ability to use the land to such an extent as to constitute a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment.  Finally, after four years of tortuous
litigation, $500,000 in legal fees, and an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Lucas won the case.  The state of South Carolina
was forced to buy the land for market value.  
<P>
 The Lucas case, the authors remind us, represents the key issue
in the environment movement.  When excessive government regulation
inflicts pain on some individuals while benefiting others, who
should bear the costs of the regulation?  The authors argue that
from an equitable perspective, a property owner like Lucas should
not be forced to bear the total cost of a regulation that benefits
everyone, even if the aggregate benefits exceed the property owner's
costs.  Ironically, when the state of South Carolina was forced
to buy Lucas' land, it was faced with a dilemma:  Either develop
the property and protect its expensive investment, or do not develop
property and own two worthless lots.  The state tried to force
the latter option on David Lucas.  Once it owned the property,
however, it hypocritically sold the lots to the highest bidder
for development-an option it denied David Lucas. 
<P>
 The book reminds readers of the importance of a Chief Executive
who is committed to balancing environmental protection with property
rights.  The authors recall how President Reagan appointed officials
who brought a cooperative, common sense attitude toward industry
and property owners.  In the authors view, Reagan officials such
as James Watt as Secretary of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch as
the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator maintained a
proper balance between environmental protection and property rights
that benefited all Americans.  The authors contrast the Reagan
Administration with the heavily regulatory and bureaucratic Bush
and Clinton Administrations.  For example, the book points out
that under Bush appointee William Reilly, the EPA broadened the
definition of &quot;navigable waters.&quot;  This regulatory change
redefined land that held water for only short periods of time
each year as &quot;wetlands&quot; -- doubling the land over which
the federal government exercises control from 100 to 200 million
acres.  This regulatory change vastly expanded the federal government's
control over private property under the Clean Water Act.

 For serious students of public policy, <I>Land Rights: The 1990s'
Property Rights Rebellion </I>is well worth the read.

<font size=3>Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen writes that NATO's
involvement in the peace operation in Bosnia is a clear signal
that the Atlantic Alliance has strayed far from its original mission
of preventing the domination of Europe by a hostile power. Hillen
argues that NATO should not reinvent itself to serve as a pan-European
alliance of collective security, and calls for a NATO Revitalization
Act to refocus the alliance and preserve American support for
the U.S. role in Europe. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<font size=3>This issue features a series of articles on the subject
of foreign policy in the '96 presidential race. The first, <I>The
U.S. Electoral Cycle since 1944</I> by David Eisenhower, argues
that U.S. foreign policy will not be a major issue in the 1996
presidential race. In <I>The Populist Revival and Foreign Affairs</I>
by A.J. Bacevich, it is argued that the political realignment
established in the 1994 elections, though not caused by foreign
policy issues, will have substantial implications for future American
diplomacy. Bacevich believes that a populist tide will oppose
a global agenda. In <I>Even Foreign Policy Is a Local Affair</I>,
author Patrick Lloyd Hatcher believes that foreign policy issues,
will indeed, play a large role in the 1996 campaign, as the free
trade/isolationism and downsizing/defense contracts issues will
be of interest to local constituencies. 52 pp.  CONTACT: Foreign

<font size=3>Alvin Rabushka, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution
and Director of the Division for Economic Policy Research at IASPS,
calls for Israel to give up U.S. aid so that it may establish
its economic independence. He argues that Israel's apparent economic
success is only a facade. The real story, according to Rabushka,
is that &quot;Israel is besieged by one economic crisis after
another: power failures, bankrupt kibbutzim, a perpetual housing
crisis, confiscatory taxation, trade restrictions, a massive trade
deficit in both goods and services, budget deficits, high interest
rates, one failed attempt after another at privatization, and
so on.&quot; Despite these chronic problems,  Rabushka notes that
Israel has been able to sustain unparalleled growth for one simple
reason, Israelis live off the money of others-totaling $9 billion
and equaling one-eighth of all goods and services that Israelis
consume. 8 pp. CONTACT: Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political

<font size=3>Allan Meltzer, Visiting Scholar at AEI, comments
on recent financial troubles in Mexico and reviews the chain of
events that have lead to Mexico's unstable economy. Despite positive
economic forecasts in 1994 with the approval of NAFTA, the year
ended with a damaged political structure, major devaluation of
the peso and an overall policy failure. According to Meltzer,
the major players in the tragic events in Mexico were high officials
in the Mexican and U.S. governments and the International Monetary
Fund. Meltzer outlines what Mexico should have done as well as
lessons to be learned from the events of 1994-1995. He concludes
that the role of governments and international agencies in international
finance should be reduced. &quot;Governments that know they must
bear the consequences of their mistaken policies will be more
inclined to moderate those policies.&quot;  6 pp.  CONTACT: American

would cost American consumers billions of dollars. According to
Wayne Leighton, Regulatory Economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy,
this analysis is faulty and based on a misunderstanding of the
legislation and the effects of regulatory reform in telecommunications.
Leighton argues that deregulation and competition would save consumers

<P>
<font size=3>The American Legislative Exchange Council proposes
four principles for free market reform in telecommunications 
that should be adapted by each state to fit its own unique statutes,
circumstances and time frames: 1) competition, not regulation,
should shape the telecommunications industry; 2) where regulation
is necessary, it should be competitively neutral and equally applied
to all providers; 3) universal service should be preserved; and
4) all providers should be permitted to compete in all markets.
ALEC belivieves that these four principles are a way to ensure
that consumers get the greatest benefit from telecommunications
innovations by encouraging competition and opening markets. 8

<P>
<font size=3>This study looks at the strategy employed by labor
unions known as a &quot;corporate campaign.&quot; Capital Research
Center Senior Fellow Thomas DiLorenzo illustrates how a &quot;corporate
campaign&quot; organized by a group calling itself Consumers United
with Employees (CUE) was really a public relations ploy against
Food Lion backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).
 A tactic used by CUE to smear the reputation of Food Lion was
to use headline grabbing press releases that claimed that a &quot;study&quot;
of Food Lion had &quot;discovered&quot; instances of health violations
within the chain. The reports attempted to mislead the media by
only citing Food Lion errors-some legitimate, some questionable-while
omitting the fact that other grocery chains have similar lapses
in procedures. DiLorenzo writes that the tactics used by the UFCW
do not help the consumer as they claim, instead, they cause the
price of groceries to climb by running the low-price, non-union
chains out of business. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center,

<font size=3>Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of
Labor Economics at CSAB, and Lowell Gallaway, Distinguished Professor
of Economics at Ohio University, illustrate the racial implications
of the Davis-Bacon Act (which requires contractors of federally
funded projects to pay union scale, or &quot;prevailing&quot;
wages). Vedder and Galloway write that the bill was originally
crafted to protect northern white labor against cheaper black
labor from other regions. In addition, they suggest that the legislation
was not race-neutral in its impact, and very likely has caused
a lack of minority participation in the construction industry.
Vedder and Gallaway give a full historical background on the enactment
of the legislation, including the fact that in the two decades
before the passage of Davis-Bacon there was a significant  growth
in the number of black employees outside the South in major construction
crafts. The study concludes that Davis-Bacon, like other minimum
wage laws, has increased unemployment for all groups; but its
negative impact has affected black construction workers disproportionately.

<font size=3>Mackinac Center for Public Policy</FONT>


<P>
<font size=3>In the state of Michigan, the worker's compensation
system was developed as a way for workers who suffer on-the-job
physical injuries to be quickly and fairly compensated for medical
costs and lost income. In recent years, however, an ambiguous
new area of law has developed under workman's compensation that
allows workers to claim injuries due to alleged on-the-job mental
stress. This has lead to complications in Michigan as how to judge
properly whether a claimant is worthy of compensation. This report
illustrates how the worker's compensation system works, its problems
with claims for mental stress injuries, the history of case and
statutory law regarding mental stress, and where the issue stands
today after a crucial 1994 Michigan Supreme Court decision. 36

<P>
<font size=3>Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation,
argues that cities could save millions of dollars and improve
response times to 911 emergency calls by privatizing Emergency
Medical Service. In Los Angeles alone, the cost to the taxpayer
for these services is $45.6 million a year. Reason estimates that
contracting with a private provider for certain EMS/paramedic
services would reduce the cost to taxpayers by two-thirds. Poole
concludes that cities and counties should reorganize their EMS
systems by creating a public-private partnership in which the
fire department provides first response service and private ambulance
firms provide all paramedic treatment and transport for all 911
medical calls. The results, according to Poole, would be reduction
of cost to the taxpayer, greater accountability, and quicker response
times. 18 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,

<font size=3>This report is the transcript of testimony given
to the Senate Budget Committee by Reason Foundation President
Robert Poole. In his testimony, Poole advocates two forms of privatization
for the federal government, asset divestiture and infrastructure
partnerships. Poole illustrates how such federal enterprises as
the U.S. Postal Service and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
can be privatized, and lists federal assets, such as commodity
lands, defense reserves, the strategic petroleum reserve, and
government buildings and land that could be utilized better under
private ownership. Poole also discusses the subject of infrastructure
partnership and how the federal government can promote private
ownership and operation of infrastructure. He concludes his testimony
with five general principles for privatization and summarizes
the issues associated with implementing a privatization agenda.

<P>
<font size=3>Progressive intellectuals, according to trade attorney
Brink Lindsey, corrupted capitalism by convincing Americans that
bigger is best for labor, business, and government. However, Lindsay
argues that the triumvirate of Big Government, Big Business, and
Big Labor is collapsing. Big Labor has seen this change first,
as unionization of the private sector labor force decline from
36 percent in 1953 to only 11 percent today. Meanwhile, large
American corporations, argued to be immune from market forces
by intellectuals in the 1960s, have been &quot;restructured&quot;
or &quot;reengineered&quot; in the form of middle-management layoffs.
Now, writes Lindsey, it is Big Government's turn. 10 pp. CONTACT:

the effects, fiscal and economic, of eliminating the tax relief

the following: the congressional plan vetoed by the President
would add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over
the next seven years than the same plan would without tax cuts;
furthermore, the cuts in taxes on capital (including the capital
gains tax cut) accounts for $66 billion of this additional GDP
and leads to a stronger economy in the long run. This report also
details the benefits of reducing taxes on family income. 5 pp.

<font size=3>Citizens for a Sound Economy Analyst Rebbeca Schaefer
argues that a flat tax would not negatively affect the housing
market. While real estate lobbyists claim that the housing market
would be hurt by a  flat tax because it eliminates the mortgage
interest deduction, Schaefer illustrates that families and individuals
do not buy homes because of the tax incentive of a mortgage interest
deduction. Instead, people buy homes for many other reasons: to
relocate, to have more living space, to downsize living space,
to find a better community, etc. Schaefer presents economic evidence
suggesting that a flat tax would bring a drop in mortgage interest
rates by at least 2 percentage points, more than compensating
for the loss of the interest deduction. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens

<font size=3>Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at the

incentives, among the strongest being marginal tax rates on capital
and the way policy treats consumption and savings. Reynolds writes
that high, progressive taxes suppress capital formation, increase
inequality, and reduce real tax receipts. He calls for an increase
in the incentives to save and invest, with time and money, in
education and training. A low flat tax, according to Reynolds,
would increase the economy's stock of economic and human capital,
which would enlarge national wealth, decrease economic inequality,
and increase tax revenues. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

of administration, cost-overrun reserves, social services, and
subsidies to bankrupt firms. He warns against the type of growth
that Israel had between 1993 and 1995, which according to Klein,
was due to excess consumption-driven largely by the government's
ever-increasing budgets. The results of this increase in government
spending has been a large trade deficit and foreign debt, high
inflation, and declining productivity, savings and competitiveness.

<font size=3>In this article, New York University Professor Lawrence
Mead examines why Wisconsin's welfare caseload declined 26% since
reforms and new programs were enacted in 1987. According to state
figures, welfare in the average Wisconsin county fell 42%, while
some small counties recorded decreases of as much as 66%. Mead
found that the decline in welfare recipients was due less to Wisconsin's
now thriving economy and more to the priority that reforms placed
on self reliance. Furthermore, Mead writes that Governor Thompson's
conservative, but not necessarily anti-government, policy was
successful in changing the attitudes of most welfare personnel.
Indeed, most welfare officials, according to Mead, appreciated
that the Governor challenged them with the responsibility of getting
recipients to work, rather than just handing out aid. 8 pp.  CONTACT:

<P>
<font size=3>Unintended consequences of environmental laws, especially
the federal Superfund law, has led to the proliferation of so-called
brownfield sites in American cities. Brownfield sites are &quot;abandoned
or vacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of containing
at least low levels of environmental contamination.&quot; Such
sites have lost potential developers to fears that a consequence
of owning and cleaning up a site will be state or federal liability
and regulation. Therefore, &quot;lenders will not lend, developers
will not develop, and buyers will not buy.&quot; Citizens for

liability and cleanup standards to be fundamentally reformed.
Until then, concludes Harrold, neither the states and EPA, nor
developers and lenders, will have the assurances or authority

decentralized programs. Ozone requirements increase costs to individuals
via higher prices and taxes, and impact small businesses more
than large firms. Chilton and Boerner recommend that Congress
revisit the Clean Air Act and allow cost and benefits to be considered
in setting the ozone standard. They conclude: &quot;Unless chronic
effects of prolonged exposures to elevated ozone can be demonstrated
(and after two-and-a-half decades of research, they have not been),
the United States is already spending more taxpayer and consumer
dollars on reducing ozone than the public considers worthwhile.&quot;

<P>
<font size=3>Patrick Fagan, William H.G. FitzGerald Fellow at
Heritage, has found that nearly every major study on the impact
of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social
problems. He gives evidence that religious practice strengthens
the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people
move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal
moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social
problems as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime
and divorce. According to Fagan, Washington policy-makers should
consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving
America's major social problems. Fagan offers several steps that
Congress and the President can take to encourage religious practice,
including: the initiation of a national discussion on the need
to restore the role of religion in American life; passage of a
resolution affirming the census data on the extent of religious
practice; and the appointment of judges who are at least more
sensitive to the role of religion in public life. 29 pp.  CONTACT:

the concerns and opinions of African-Americans in Florida. According
to the report, the ultimate intention of the survey was to take
the first step in the process of building bridges between whites
and blacks. The survey had three major findings: 1) to date, conservatives
have failed to communicate their message to the black community;
2) the political labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;
are meaningless in the dialogue, because action is what counts;
and 3) language and perception account for most differences, while
position on most issues are similar. 20 pp. CONTACT: Foundation

<font size=3>Former Ohio State Solicitor Richard Cordray describes
the Supreme Court's role in the uniquely American system of federalism.
He writes that the Supreme Court has been a reluctant and relatively

of the federal government</FONT><I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">-</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">so
state officials should not rely too heavily on the Court as the
ultimate guardian of state interests. Those interested in reviving

reconsider whether institutional changes could be made to strengthen
the authority of the states and establish a more balanced partnership
with the federal government. 23 pp. CONTACT: Council of State

<font size=3>Philip Burgess, President of the Center for the New

1) the recent American experience with federalism; 2) the forces
at work reviving federalism; and 3) a potential framework for
considering ideas about where the federalsim debate should go
from here. He concludes by writing that restoring federalism requires
at least major legislation, if not a constitutional amendment
to restore power and relationships destroyed by the seventeenth
amendment, which removed state legislatures' authority to elect
U.S. Senators. Burgess warns that whatever approach is taken,
the pursuit of principle-centered remedies and not quick fixes
is key. 10 pp.  CONTACT: Council of State Governments, 444 North

<font size=3>Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutioanl
Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that it is time to start
returning power to the states and the people, to relimit federal
power in fundamental law, and to restore constitutional government.
Pilon recommends that Congress take the following actions to achieve
this end: 1) declare that the Constitution remains a document
of limited federal powers; 2) declare that most of what the federal
government does today is done without constitutional authority;
3) identify the precise constitutional authority for doing so
before enacting any new legislation; 4) restore the Commerce Clause
to its original purpose; 5) restore the General Welfare Clause
to its original purpose; 6) restore the Necessary and Proper clause
to its orignal purpose; and 7)  restore those provisions of the
Bill of Rights and the Civil War Amendments that have fallen into
disregard-privileges and immunities, property rights, and economic
liberties. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In the 1993 book <I>Suedosclerosis</I>,
The Swedish economists Ingemar St&aring;hl and Kurt Wickman discuss
the factors that have contributed to the crisis in the Swedish
economy and introduce the terms &quot;relative price shock&quot;
and &quot;relative interest shock.&quot; In 1994's <I>Suedosclerosis
II</I>, St&aring;hl and Wickman argue that the Swedish crisis
is deeper and the adjustments slower than in comparable countries.
They conclude that political responsibility must be transfered
from the public sector to the private sector, and fundamental
changes in the welfare systems are necessary in order to abolish
the politics of high taxation. This particular publication contains

Clinton's Executive Order that bars federal agencies from doing
business with companies which hire permanent striker replacements.
Through the brief, the two  Senators take the position that the
Executive Order violates the principle of separation of powers
in that the question of striker replacements involves labor policy
which is the prerogative of Congress to establish. In fact, Congress
years ago established such a policy in the National Labor Relations
Act in an effort to counter-balance the power of the labor unions

<font size=3>The Center and co-counsels, representing the Florida
ACLU and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, are representing Gerald
Gee, a professor at Florida A&amp;M University who was suspended
without pay for an in-class remark allegedly constituting discrimination
and harassment. In illustrating a point, the professor used the
term &quot;nigger&quot; although he did not direct the term at
any individual. At issue in this case is whether Gee's remark
to his students is protected under the scope of academic freedom.
After CIR brought a lawsuit in early 1995, asserting claims under
both the Equal Protection and Free Speech clauses of the U.S.
Constitution, and sought a preliminary injunction revoking the
suspension, Florida A&amp;M agreed to rescind the remaining portions

<B>Defenders Seeks to Protect Landowners</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For over a hundred years, the boundaries for some
parcels of land owned in Kamiah, Idaho have been established and
respected. Yet, it turns out that the title descriptions in their
deeds do not reflect these boundaries. At the turn of the century,
a county surveyor believed the original title descriptions to
be erroneous. Based solely on his affidavit-and without conducting
an on-the-ground survey-the U.S. patent office unilaterally amended
the title descriptions in 1901. The property involved in this
dispute, however, has recently become highly desirable for development.
Moreover, it was once part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Last December, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) issued Trespass Notices to eight Idaho residents.
Many more stand to lose the land which they have maintained and
paid taxes on for a half century, for the heirs to the original
members of the Nez Perce Tribe are claiming that the error in
the fee patent means that they own the land-not the people (and
their predecessors on interest) who have owned it since 1953.
BIA agrees and is intervening on behalf of the Indian heirs, asserting
that the present owners are trespassing on Indian land.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">If BIA succeeds in removing
the current occupants, the Indians whose interests the government
claims to represent will not retain title. The land has already
been sold to a developer. If BIA does not remove the current owners,
however, the Indian Law unit of the Legal Services Corporation-which
is representing the Indians free of charge-will sue BIA for failure
to protect the Indian heirs' rights.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Defenders is asking Interior
Secretary Babbitt to exercise his discretion to amend the patents
to reflect the original and accurate 1873 descriptions, and the
actual use by all owners for an entire century.<BR>

<B>Defenders Attempts to Stop <BR>
Wetlands Witch Hunt</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Defenders has filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I>
on behalf of itself and two dozen grassroots property rights organizations
asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to dismiss criminal
charges against James L.Wilson and his company, Interstate General.
This case bears a remarkable resemblance to the criminal prosecution
of Bill Ellen, a wetlands consultant who spent six months in a
federal penitentiary in 1992 for filling wetlands without a permit.
Now, the same prosecutor is gunning for Mr. Wilson. Defenders
is working with the defendant's private criminal counsel to have
the prosecution thrown out on a variety of grounds. Defenders
argued that the criminal charges brought for the filling of isolated
wetlands in this case are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.

Inc. v. City of Burlington, Iowa</I>, arguing that a five-year
amortization period does not constitute &quot;just compensation&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment for the taking of private property.
At issue in this case is a 1988 city ordinance that outlawed the
construction of billboards within city limits. The city did not,
however, actually require Outdoor Graphics to take down its signs
until 1993. That grace (or &quot;amortization&quot;) period, the
city asserts, was the property owner's &quot;just compensation&quot;
for the destruction of the company's business.<BR>

<B>IJ Takes on Government Assault of Sanctity of the Home and
Right to Exclude</B>
<P>
<font size=3>The Institute for Justice has filed a lawsuit against
the Village of Park Forest (a suburb of Chicago), for allowing,
under its housing code, government inspectors to conduct warrantless
searches of single-family rental homes without tenant consent
or notice. The suit was filed on behalf of several Park Forest
tenants seeking to vindicate their private property rights under
the Fourth Amendment. The resulting decision from the case could
set a national precedent to bolster protection for the right of
property owners to exclude outsiders from their property. Government
inspectors, wishing to enter a tenant's home, will need to ask
for and receive either the explicit consent of tenants or, if
consent is denied, a search warrant based on some reasonable belief
that the housing code is being violated.<BR>

<b>Cleveland Becomes Second Battleground <BR>
for School Choice</b>

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The Ohio Federation of Teachers
filed a suit to secure an injunction against the nation's second
school choice program, due to commence this Fall, in Cleveland.
The program provides, among other features, vouchers of approximately
$2,250 for about 1,500 low-income children in grades K-3 to attend
private schools. The program has attracted more than 50 schools
and 6,550 applicants-1,500 of whom were selected through a lottery
system. The lawsuit, styled <I>Gatton v. Goff</I>, challenges
the program on state and federal constitutional grounds. The primary
focus is establishment of religion. The Institute worked closely
with Governor Voinovich as the plan was developed, and having
worked in the Cleveland low-income community since last summer,
is preparing to intervene on behalf of Hope for Cleveland's Children,
the Hough Academy of Higher Learning, and individual families.

the Federal Circuit has vacated and will now rehear the <I>Preseault</I>
case. This overturns a recent decision by two judges of that court
who had held that Paul and Patricia Preseault had no remedy for
the United States' action in converting an abandoned railroad
right of way across their land into a heavily traveled public
recreational trail. The now-vacated decision had severely undercut
landowners' rights to seek compensation from the federal government
for &quot;taking&quot; their property. The court held that a party
was required to sue the government immediately after passage of
any law that &quot;foreshadowed&quot; a future taking. In the
Preseaults'<I> </I>case, that meant that they would have had to
sue in 1920, 60 years before the trail was even built. The new
decision breaths life back into over a dozen takings cases which
are following in the Preseaults' tracks. It is a major setback
for the government's effort to obtain rights over private land
without having to pay for those rights.</FONT>

<B>NELF to File <I>Amicus </I>Brief in <BR>
<B>Unemployment Case</B></B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will file a friend of the court brief for the
Connecticut Business and Industry Association in support of Yankee
Gas System's appeal of a decision ordering it to pay unemployment
benefits to striking workers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The case involves a 1992 labor
dispute. Yankee offered workers a small raise and reserved the
right to change its medical insurance program in the future in
a manner the workers opposed. Negotiations broke down and workers
went on strike. During the strike the company kept operating,
using managers and some replacement workers. Three months later
the strike ended and the workers returned.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A state agency has now characterized
the strike as a &quot;lockout&quot; and ordered Yankee to pay
unemployment benefits for the duration of the strike. The agency
found that the company's final offer was inferior to the prior
contract under which the workers were willing to keep working.
Both points are dubious. The new contract offered a modest raise
as well as the health insurance change, Furthermore, the agreement
to keep working was illusory since Yankee's workers reserved the
right to strike at any time they found more tactically convenient.
NELF's brief will focus on the decision's impact in shifting the
balance in labor disputes toward labor.<BR>

<B>NELF Represents Maine Oil Dealer</B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will represent Conrad Thibeault, a Maine fuel
dealer who voluntarily cleaned up some spilled oil on his property
and now is being made to pay for his good deed. When he discovered
the spill, Mr. Thibeault notified the state Departmnet of Enviromental
Protection, negotiated a cleanup plan and then actually cleaned
up the site. Only then did DEP tell Mr. Thibeault that it would
not reimburse him for 70% of the cleanup costs which it now felt
had gone to improving the property as well as cleaning it up.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Maine has an Oil Clean-up
Fund which is derived from fees paid by oil dealers like Mr. Thibeault.
The Fund was created to reimburse people for &quot;any expenses
involved&quot; in oil spill cleanups. The law contains not a word
about denying reimbursement if a cleanup also has the incidental
benefit of improving the property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will appeal Mr. Thibeault's
case to the Fund Insurance Review Board and argue that when the
state approves the details of particular cleanup plans, it cannot
later renege and refuse to reimburse a person who in good faith
implemented the plan and cleaned up a spill. The state's policy
is shortsighted. It is not only unfair, but counterproductive.
If it becomes common practice, it will eliminate any incentive
for voluntary spill cleanups.<BR>

<P>
<B>NELF to Support Punitive Damages Appeal</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For decades it has been a common practice in the
telephone industry for field workers to carry their lunches to
the job site. Workers were given 30 minutes to eat lunch on the
site, but were not paid for that time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The U.S. Labor Department
sued Southern New England Telecommunications, a Connecticut phone
company, claiming that its failure to pay workers for lunch breaks
violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. A federal judge agreed
and ordered the company to end the practice and to pay workers
over $4 million in back pay and overtime. The judge also held
that the violation was &quot;willful&quot; and therefore he doubled
the amount of damages to $9 million as a penalty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will file an <I>amicus</I>
brief opposing the punitive double damages. The policy of not
providing paid lunches may not have been consistent with federal
law, but in light of the universal, decades-long practice in the
industry it cannot reasonably have been a &quot;willful&quot;
violation of the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York will
hear the case.<BR>

<B>Washington Supreme Court Gives Lip Service to Landowner's Rights</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's unequivocal ruling
last June in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, a Washington property
owner was unable to receive the benefits of that landmark decision
when the Washington Supreme Court applied <I>Dolan</I> in such
a manner as to render the precedent-setting decision meaningless.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Douglas County, Washington,
approved a 16-lot residential subdivision on the condition that
the owner dedicate various strips of land for future road widening.
Relying on the <I>Dolan </I>decision, the Court of Appeals found
the exaction to be an unconstitutional taking, since there was
no showing that the new homes would create any need to widen the
roads. The Washington Supreme Court thought otherwise.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Under <I>Dolan</I>, when government
requires the dedication of land in exchange for a permit, it must
<I>prove</I> that the particular land dedication at issue is &quot;roughly
proportional&quot; to any harm caused by the project being permitted.
Government has the burden of proof and must make an &quot;individualized
determination that the required dedication is related both in
nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">This case presented the first
opportunity for the Washington Supreme Court to consider this
&quot;rough proportionality&quot; test established in <I>Dolan</I>
and the type of information that is sufficient to justify an exaction
of land in return for a building permit. Unfortunately, the Washington
Supreme Court did not require any calculations of proportionality.
It simply upheld the land exactions based on the general increase
in traffic attributable to the development.<BR>

Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich as <I>amicus

on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing
development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A ruling in favor of Mr. Ehrlich
could substantially limit local government's exactions of so-called
&quot;mitigation&quot; or &quot;linkage&quot; fees from private
development to finance unrelated public programs. PLF is striving
to achieve a ruling that conforms to the U.S. Supreme Court's
landmark decision in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">For several years, Mr. Ehrlich
operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial
success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most
of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse
condominium project on the property. The City Council approved
the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which
the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis
courts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">PLF contends that the fee
is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality
test laid down in the <I>Dolan</I> case.  The <I>Ehrlich</I> case
differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with
cash instead of land.<BR>

<B>National Attention Focuses on Parental Rights Lawsuit</B>
<P>
<font size=3>SLF is proceeding with its parental rights lawsuit
in <I>Earles v. Stephens County School District, et. al., </I>which
is currently before the U.S. District Court. Filed on behalf of
the parents of two teenage sisters, the lawsuit challenges the
constitutionality of the school administration's actions in transporting
the minor girls during school hours to a local public health clinic,
where the girls received HIV/AIDS tests, PAP smear tests, condoms,
and prescription birth control pills-all without parental consent
or notification. The parents have been denied access to the results
of the tests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">National media attention has
focused on this case as a lightning rod for the parental rights
debate in this country. SLF attorneys testified before a joint
U.S. House and Senate committee, which is considering proposed
parental rights legislation, on the constitutional status of the
parental right to direct and control the education and upbringing
of children. SLF attorneys pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court
has established that parental rights are fundamental and, as such,
are entitled to the strongest legal protections against government
interference.<BR>

<B>Business Owner Liability Gets Helping Hand</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In a victory for Georgia businesses and property
owners, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned a state Court of
Appeals decision, which held that property owners were charged
with constructive knowledge of criminal acts previously committed
on their property as part of their duty of ordinary care. The
Court of Appeals decision had made businesses liable for every
criminal act committed on their property, whether reasonably foreseeable
or not.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In <I>Sun Trust Banks v. Killebrew</I>,
SLF argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> that any relaxation of the
doctrine of ordinary care would exacerbate the plight of those
property owners and businesses who are least able to protect their
own property, let alone their patrons. The Georgia Supreme Court
agreed, pointing out that imposing a greater burden on business
owners by the government is an abdication of its &quot;paramount&quot;
constitutional duty to &quot;protect person and property.&quot;

<B>Challenge to State's Intangibles Tax</B>
<P>
<font size=3>SLF is representing a Georgia corporation in a lawsuit
challenging Georgia's imposition of a tax on out-of-state intangible
personal property, including stocks and bonds, owned by Georgia
residents. The state currently collects about $40 million annually
from the tax, which is distributed to counties.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">At issue is the extent to
which the state can exempt the taxation of stocks and bonds of
Georgia corporations while it continues to tax the stocks and
bonds of out-of-state corporations. The U.S. Supreme Court is
currently considering a challenge to a similar tax in North Carolina,
which legal analysts believe will succeed. SLF attorneys point
out that Georgia's tax is a more egregious violation of the Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution than the North Carolina tax.

<B>New Jersey Welfare Reform Defended</B>

<font size=3>WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit supporting New Jersey's innovative welfare reform
program in <I>C.K. v. Shalala</I>, a suit brought by welfare recipients
who are represented by Legal Services of New Jersey, the ACLU
of New Jersey, and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Under
New Jersey's Aid to Families with Dependent Children system, a
single mother previously received an increase in her monthly cash
payment for each additional child born. New Jersey's reform program
eliminates the grant increase to mothers who have additional children
after joining the rolls. Seven AFDC recipients and their children
filed suit, alleging that the program violates the due process
and equal protection requirements of the United States and New
Jersey constitutions and that it violates federal statutes and
regulations governing AFDC, family planning services, and research
on human subjects. The case is before the Third Circuit following
the plaintiffs' appeal from their loss in the district court.

Clear Air Act of 1990 required the agency to file such a report
in November of 1991 and again in 1992 and 1994, but no report
has been filed-although businesses face civil and criminal penalties
if they fail to turn in timely reports to the EPA. The suit was

Coalition v. Wilson</I>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth

that the Ninth Circuit had overstepped its authority in requiring
federal prosecutors to compile massive reports concerning its
crack cocaine enforcement efforts because blacks are disproportionately
charged with crack offenses. The Appeals Court had dismissed charges
against five defendants after the prosecutors refused to compile
the reports.<BR>

<h3>December/January 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>: 

<h4><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h4>
</center>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, Vice President for Educational Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.<hr>
<p>
<I>Policy Review</I>, the magazine of The Heritage Foundation,
has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic
new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship
by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to
the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<P>
Our new name is <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html"><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></a>.
We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will
focus on the institutions of civil society-families, communities,
voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations,
business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments-that
are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized,
bureaucratic government.
<P>
We think of our mission as &quot;Applied Tocqueville,&quot; in
honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832
wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>, still the best book about our
country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that
was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most
prosperous, most charitable country on earth-with limited national
government and active citizen involvement in local government.
It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business
leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens
were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their
communities. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders
today who are carrying on this tradition.
<P>
We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the
most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism
over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left
America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block
of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's
poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities.
Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship
in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<P>
Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But
merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives
must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments,
and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills
left untreated by failed liberal programs. 
<P>
The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington
to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this
about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures
are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in
the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted
by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities
share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the
United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable
than government.
<P>
Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative
public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family
collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government
cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children
to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will
be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building
institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire
them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<P>
Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary
but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root
cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes
a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective
institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that
create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and
behaviors.
<P>
The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century
saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs,
and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened
character and addressed the failings of their communities. America
is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the
lead. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success
stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.

<i>Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution</i><br>
By Lee Edwards, Regnery Publishing 1995, 572 pp.<hr>

	Lee Edwards’ Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution is an insightful and important look at the man who is more responsible than any other for the growth and success of the conservative movement in America. This biography is all the more timely, given the conservative congressional sweep of November 1994. It portrays a Goldwater who is every bit as fiesty as legend tells, and quite a bit more complex.<P>
	Edwards, who was a veteran of the 1964 Goldwater campaign, provides a thorough examination of Goldwater’s life, starting with his childhood and his days at Staunton Military Academy. Special attention, of course, is paid to Goldwater’s career in the U.S. Senate, his Presidential campaign of 1964 (and the Draft Goldwater effort that drew him into it), his role in the “making and unmaking of presidents” from 1968 through 1976, and his more recent  pronouncements on social issues. <P>
	While Goldwater delivers a wealth of information, three particularly important and interesting points stand out. First, the reader is reminded that some things are so old that they seem new. The “negative campaigning” that journalists often decry today was pioneered by Lyndon Johnson’s reelection campaign—with the tacit approval of the major media. Indeed, in three decades of presidential elections since 1964, no campaign of any party has matched Johnson’s for sheer dishonesty, demagoguery, and meanness.  Edwards methodically reminds the reader of the infamous Daisy Girl advertisement, as well as the less-well-remembered but still devastating Ice Cream Girl and Social Security ads. Johnson’s whole “Anti-Campaign,” complete with political espionage and possible misuse of the FBI, not only set a sad precedent for CREEP but almost certainly exceeded it in scope and (needless to say) efficiency.<P> 
	Edwards also reminds us that the savage and unwarranted attacks on Goldwater in the fall of 1964 were made more plausible by the drubbing he received at the hands of fellow Republicans during the nomination contest. While Edwards concedes that no Republican could have defeated Johnson in 1964 (a fact Edwards maintains was well understood by Goldwater himself throughout the campaign), he makes a powerful argument that the attacks of liberal Republicans like Rockefeller, Romney, and Scranton, helped turn a mere defeat into a landslide.<P>
	Second, Edwards thoughtfully illuminates the complexity of Barry Goldwater. Edwards argues that, far from being a recent phenomenon, Goldwater has always been torn between a “traditionalist” side and a “libertarian” side, the side that today surprises conservatives with exclamations of pro-choice and pro-gay sentiment. This split could be seen even in Goldwater’s earliest political involvement: one of his first political acts was to urge the city of Phoenix to reject the “evils” of dog racing, yet one of his first votes after being elected to the Phoenix city council was to approve a liquor license for a supermarket 1200 feet from West Phoenix High School over the objections of local parents and religious leaders.    <P>
	Edwards argues that this complexity has been often intertwined with another factor: to Barry Goldwater, a personal connection often meant more than philosophical consistency. His lack of a deeply personal connection to Ronald Reagan, for example, may largely explain Goldwater’s often-cool relationship with his heir as leader of the conservative movement. His recent stand on social issues may have been influenced not only by his latent libertarianism but by his daughters’ abortions and the homosexuality of a grandson and grandniece. Barry Goldwater is an intensely human figure, and the human relationships of day to day life have almost certainly affected his politics to a greater degree than most conservatives have understood.  <P>
	Finally, and most importantly, Edwards succeeds in reminding his readers of the unpayable debt that conservatives owe to Barry Goldwater, regardless of the meanderings of his latter years. Edwards catalogues a fraction of the multitude of individuals who began their political lives inspired by Barry Goldwater and who went on to carry forward the conservative cause. He imagines, plausibly, all the good that would not have happened without a Senator Barry Goldwater and a campaign of 1964, and imagines equally plausibly all the good that might have happened had he won. <P>  
	As Edwards shows, sometimes Goldwater himself was unaware of the potential impact of his actions: he did not anticipate how his 1957 Senate speech criticizing the Eisenhower budget would catapult him to leadership of the conservative movement, nor did he anticipate that Conscience of a Conservative would have any appreciable effect on the nation’s politics. At other times, especially in 1964, Goldwater understood well that he carried on his shoulders the aspirations of millions of freedom-loving Americans. Always, however, he made a difference. As Edwards concludes, Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign “marked the true beginning of a tectonic shift in American politics— from East to West, from the cities to the suburbs, from big government to limited government, from containment to liberation, from liberal to conservative— that continues to shape the nation, as the historic elections of 1994 attest.”<P>

<P>
<B>Selected Foreign and Defense Policy Issues for the '96 Presidential
Campaign</B>, by Thomas Henriksen
<br>
<I>Briefing</I>, Pacific Research Institute

<P>
President Clinton has not only failed to craft a coherent international
mission for the United States, but he has also failed to resolve
a host of independent conflicts, according to Thomas Henriksen,
Senior Fellow &amp; Associate Director at the Hoover Institution.
This study surveys several foreign policy issues facing America
as it enters the 1996 national election campaign, including: the
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons; counter-terrorism;
the role of the United States in the new international order;
human rights; continuing trouble spots (e.g. North Korea &amp;
Bosnia); and defense cutbacks and pentagon reorganization. 22

<B>The Rising Threat of Revolutionary Islam <BR>
in Algeria</B>, by James Phillips 
<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1060, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
If the bloody civil war in Algeria is not halted, argues Heritage
Senior Policy Analyst James Phillips, the resulting political
chaos could destabilize the entire region. According to Phillips,
the only thing worse than the present situation would be victory
by Islamic radicals over the Algerian army. Such an outcome would
pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in North
Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. Phillips
provides a history of Algeria's political breakdown and a view
of the current stalemate and grim future. He then points out how
a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests and describes
a policy that he believes the Clinton administration should adopt.

<br>
<I>Heritage Lecture</I> No. 544, The Heritage Foundation

In a speech given at The Heritage Foundation, President &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
G&ouml;ncz asserted that Hungary must set off on the road to Euro-Atlantic
integration, including full-fledged membership in NATO and the
European Union. President G&ouml;ncz surveyed the history of his
country since the end of the Cold War, and concluded that Hungary's
speedy integration into a Euro-Atlantic alliance should continue
despite criticism that the change is occurring too fast.  The
President also stated that it is his country's responsibility
to avoid delays and &quot;to drop anchor as soon as possible,
and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven.&quot;

<B>Holbrooke Horror: The U.S. Plan for Bosnia,  <BR>
</B>by Ted Galen Carpenter 
<br>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 37, Cato Institute

<P>
Cato Institute's Director of Foreign Policy Studies, Ted Galen
Carpenter, contends that the Clinton administration foolishly
insists on maintaining the fiction of a united Bosnian state while
accepting a de facto ethnic partition.  Carpenter declares that
the inherent contradiction between those two objectives will doom
the peace agreement and pose a grave danger to the proposed U.S.-led
NATO peacekeeping force.  The author then lists specific problems
with <BR>
the peace plan and describes the multiple sources of danger  a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force will face. The paper concludes with
a recommended alternate plan of action advocating that the belligerents
themselves reach a durable agreement reflecting battlefield realities
and the balance of political and military forces.  Carpenter writes
that under no circumstances should the United States send troops
to enforce an inherently unworkable peace accord. 15 pp. CONTACT:

<B>How to Close Down the Department of Energy,</B> <BR>
by John Barry
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1061, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Barry calls for shutting
down the Department of Energy (DOE) and outlines the Heritage
proposal to do so. Among the provisions of the plans are: selling
off DOE assets such as the Strategic and Naval Petroleum Reserves;
terminating unnecessary DOE programs, privatizing government owned
laboratories, and transferring all defense-related nuclear weapons
functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. According
to Barry, closing down DOE and making the related reforms would
save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five
years, including $16 billion in asset sales. 21 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The Telecom Revolution: American Opportunity</B> 
<br>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation 

<P>
The United States should replace and modernize its existing telecommunications
regulatory policies, argue the authors of this comprehensive study.
The study notes that the telecommunications industry already constitutes
one-seventh of our economy and, by the early 21st century, the
global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion market.
Furthermore, in 1995, one-half of all capital investment in America,
broadly defined, will be in computers and telecommunications equipment.
Despite these facts, the telecommunications industry must comply
with a  statutory and regulatory system erected in the 1930's.
The study outlines recommendations that, according to the authors,
would provide for a modern and effective government to complement
market forces, speeding the development of new products and services
for Americans. 111 pp.  CONTACT: The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Human Cost of Regulation: the Case of Medical Devices and
the FDA, </B>by David Murray
<br>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper </I>No. 183, The Hudson Institute

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's current system for approving
medical devices has been marred by regulatory snags that unnecessarily
delay the introduction of lifesaving and life-enhancing products
to the market, according to Hudson Research Analyst David Murray.
Meanwhile, the European Community's medical device approval system
allows new products that are no less safe than in the United States
to reach the market far more quickly. The author suggests that
the U. S. should adopt a system similar to that used by the European
Community for medical device approvals. Such a system would terminate
FDA's monopoly on the premarket approval of medical devices and
establish a mainly privatized process, based on a quality systems
approach to evaluation. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman

<B>Regulatory Reform in the Electric <BR>
Power Industry,</B> by Vernon Smith
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 3, The Barry Goldwater Institute.

<P>
According to University of Arizona Professor Vernon L. Smith,
the public is finally challenging the notion that certain industries,
most specifically the electric power industry, are &quot;natural
monopolies.&quot; Smith looks at how various countries are seeking
to deregulate their electric power industries, and shows that
countries that only a few years ago were using a central planning
approach are now surpassing the United States in establishing
competitive electric power industries. The report concludes that
policy makers should begin thinking seriously about reforming
our approach to the electric power industry. 20 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Dangerous Excesses: A Look at the Food <BR>
and Drug Administration, </B>by Jeffrey J. Pierce
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 13, Citizens for a Sound <BR>
Economy Foundation

<P>
Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, shows that the Food and Drug Administration-originally
designed to protect the health of U.S. consumers-has increasingly
become an obstacle to providing consumers with potentially life-saving
drugs and medical devices. Pierce notes that delays in approvals
by the agency are ballooning, as the new drug approval process
now takes some 13-15 years. At the same time, the agency has been
growing, with a budget nearing the billion dollar mark. Peirce
illustrates how FDA has dramatically enlarged its authority, and
cites several instances where it has dramatically delayed the
development of new medical devices and medicines. The paper also
shows that FDA has been expanding its limits on the speech of
pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers. Pierce, concludes
with a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving FDA,
including: prioritizing functions, allowing private organizations
and laboratories to issue medical device approvals; and contracting
out testing to the private sector. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: Has Food Packaging Law Gone Too Far?</B>
<B>Part 1,</B> by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 196, Reason Foundation

<P>
According Alexander Volokh, Assistant Policy Analyst at the Reason
Foundation, food packaging regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration aimed at preventing contaminants from entering
our food may discourage the use of recycled materials. Volokh
writes that FDA operates under the assumption that all substances
diffuse over time, that everything that makes up your Coca-Cola
bottle will <I>eventually</I> become part of your Coke, and vice
versa. Therefore, FDA regulates the components of food packaging
as <I>indirect</I> food additives. Because FDA scrutinizes recycled
materials so closely, it usually takes a half a year or more and
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain FDA approval for
recycled packaging material. Volokh suggests that deregulation
of the approval process would be a way to expand recycling markets.

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: How RCRA has Recyclers Running Around
in CERCLAs, Part 2</B>, by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 197, Reason Foundation

<P>
Part 2 of &quot;The FDA vs. Recycling&quot; shows that federal
hazardous waste regulations, such as the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund, have burdened the hazardous
waste recycling industry, damaging the economic viability of recycled
products like lead batteries and used oil. For example, a company
that wants to get a permit to send their industrial waste, such
as car batteries or scrap metal, to be recycled faces a huge liability.
Under Superfund-which regulates the cleanup of toxic waste sites-if
a recycling facility is declared hazardous, whoever arranged for
the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance can be liable
for the cleanup of the entire site. The paper concludes that if
products are heavily regulated after they are thrown out or in
the process of recycling, it should not be a surprise that people
will prefer to use virgin materials rather than recycle. 24 pp.

<h2>TAXATION &AMP; BUDGET

<P>
<B>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to
the Economy,</B> by William Beach and John Barry
<br>
<I>F.Y.I. </I>No. 69, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead, over
the next seven years, to greater business investment, higher earnings
per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law, according
to William Beach, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and
John Barry, Heritage Research Assistant. Beach and Barry conducted
an interim analysis of Congress's balanced budget plan with tax
cuts using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer
&amp; Associates, the same model used by the Clinton administration's
OMB and the Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cause an economic
downturn as some critics of the plan believe, the Heritage analysis
predicts that the following economic boons to American families
and businesses would result over the next seven years: an additional
$32.1 billion in real disposable income; an additional $66.2 billion
in consumption expenditures; an additional $88.2 billion in real
non-residential fixed investment; and an additional 103,700 housing
starts. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<B>Direct Student Loans: Putting Taxpayers at Risk,</B> by Michael
Cannon
<br>
<I>Issues and Answers</I> No. 14, Citizens for a <BR>
Sound Economy
<P>
Through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), the
federal government insures against defaulted loans made to students
by private lending institutions. According to Michael Cannon,
Citizens for a Sound Economy Policy Analyst, this program has
proven costly, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for billions
of dollars in defaulted loans. The administration's response to
the problem has been to offer all loans directly to students-bypassing
traditional lending institutions. Cannon contends that government
control of student loans will not only cause default rates to
skyrocket but will also place all the risk on the shoulders of
taxpayers. The author suggests that the federal government limit
taxation and government spending so that students will have more
money to put toward college tuition and more private sector jobs
waiting for them upon graduation. Cannon concludes that Congress
must reject any plan to nationalize the student loan industry
if they are serious about protecting taxpayers from wasteful government
spending. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H

<B>Public vs. Private: Stadium Financing, <BR>
Operation and Development,</B> by Grant Gulibon
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
According to Grant Gulibon, Allegheny Institute Research Assistant,
the power that professional sports teams are able to wield over
their local governments comes from overrated economic and psychological
value to the given municipalities. Gulibon demonstrates that professional
sports' economic contribution to local communities is exaggerated
and that only privately financed and owned stadiums remain a profitable
investment. His study also shows that government owned and operated
stadiums are rarely run efficiently and remain a taxpayer burden.
This theory is applied to Pittsburgh's current stadium situation
and threats by team owners to leave town if a new stadium is not
built. Gulibon concludes that if a new stadium is built it should
be a private venture and not be financed by public money or owned
by the local government. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute

<B>Politics and the Power of the Purse,</B> by Dwight Lee

<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I> No. 75, Center for the Study
of American Business

<P>
In this essay, University of Georgia Economics Professor Dwight
Lee asks what the prospects of halting and then reversing federal
spending are. Lee points out that the problem of an excessive
and increasingly out-of-touch federal government is explained
by two interconnected problems. First, since the 1930's, political
power has become increasingly centralized in Washington, with
the federal government taking over more and more functions that
were not traditionally government responsibilities at any level.
Second, the federal tax system takes a large percentage of the
taxes paid by Americans. Lee writes that the type of reform necessary
to control the tax and spend power of the federal government cannot
be realized by congressional legislative fiat. This is serious
reform, according to the author, the type that has to be imposed
on reluctant politicians.  Lee calls for tax reform that is backed
by a constitutional amendment. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the

<B>The Allegheny Regional Asset District Tax,</B> <BR>
by Jake Haulk
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
This report analyzes the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD)
and the local option sales tax which funds it. RAD is a program
similiar to programs in large American cities that uses dedicated
tax revenue to subsidize cultural and recreational organizations,
usually stadiums for professional sports franchises. The report
details specific damage that the RAD tax has caused. Included
is evidence that the added sales tax will cause a shift of some
sales and jobs out of one county and into neighboring counties.
Furthermore, according to Allegheny Institute's Jake Haulk, a
supposed tax reform component of the RAD program is largely a
redistribution from better off suburbs to poorer municipalities.
By lumping this redistribution effort with the RAD program, the
opportunity for real tax reform as well as tax and expenditure
reductions by local governments has been largely foreclosed. 18

<B>Why Congress Must Reform Welfare, <BR>
</B>by Robert Rector
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1063, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
discusses why Congress must reform welfare. Rector begins by addressing
the claim often times presented to the public that the current
welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. Rector's
research shows that: 1) the 4.7 million families currently receiving
AFDC have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare;
2) when past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined,
the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families
currently receiving benefits, is 13 years; and 3) among the 4.7
million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will
spend more than two years on the AFDC caseload. Next, Rector shares
the results of recent research by Congressional Budget Office
Director June O'Neill, which shows that increasing the length
of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by
as much as 20 percent. Rector writes that the more welfare income
received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the
boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families
with identical non-welfare income. Furthermore, Rector demonstrates
how receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during
childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among
young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
Rector concludes by outlining the basic themes of the House/Senate

<B>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House <BR>
and Senate Legislation, </B>by John Liu
<br>
<I>Issue Bulletin </I>No. 220, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Liu illustrates why Medicare needs
serious reform if taxpayers are to be spared future tax increases
or deep cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly. Liu believes
the current reforms being proposed in Congress are only stop-gap
measures to ward off fiscal disaster when the &quot;Baby-Boom&quot;
generation qualifies for Medicare. This paper compares the components
of the House and Senate Medicare reform proposals and identifies
the best policy in each area. For example, while both bills establish
consumer choice in health plans, Lui believes that they should
also expand the options available to senior citizens. Liu also
describes how certain provisions within the current proposals
could have harmful consequences for the healthcare market and
the elderly if they are not modified and recommends provisions
that he thinks should be included in a final bill. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Charting Florida's Educational Future, <BR>
</B>by Jonathan Hage
<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 3, Foundation for Florida's Future


<P>
Director of Research for Foundation for Florida's Future, Jonathan
Hage, supports charter schools as a way to solve the problems
facing Florida public education. Charter schools are independent
public schools formed under a &quot;charter,&quot; or contract,
made between <I>organizers</I> (e.g., teachers, parents, colleges,
local organizations, or others) and <I>sponsors</I> (e.g., local
school boards, state boards of education or some other legislatively
approved and publicly accountable body). Hage provides examples
of successful charter schools in other states and addresses several
concerns that communities might have about them. Among the concerns
Hage addresses are: &quot;Charter schools won't be regulated and
children will be hurt&quot;; &quot;Charter schools are just another
passing fad&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will take money from
traditional public schools&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will open
the door to religious involvement&quot;; and &quot;Charter schools
will serve the 'elite' students, not the poor at-risk.&quot; Based
on his research, Hage concludes that charter schools will empower
parents to have more control over their children's education and
that schools will be held more accountable for their performance.

<B>How Much More do We Have to Spend to Achieve a Totally Illiterate
Society?</B> <BR>
by Dwight Williams 
<br>
<I>Independence Issue Paper</I> No. 9, Independence Institute


<P>
Dwight Williams, Research Associate at The Independence Institute,
sheds light on the perplexing question: &quot;Why has academic
achievement declined or stagnated in Colorado and the rest of
the United States despite the tremendous increase in education
spending in recent decades?&quot; Williams shows that there is
no correlation between more school spending and higher achievement.
For example, total spending on education in Colorado grew 1730
percent from 1964 to 1994, despite this, over the same period
of time, Colorado student's national test scores remained static.
Also, because so much school revenue is spent on social conditioning
and other non-academic pursuits, only 41 percent of school days
are devoted to core academic work. Williams details steps which
public schools could take to reduce overhead, improve efficiency,
and free up resources for actual teaching-without increasing the
burden on taxpayers. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute,

<B>Making Schools Work: Spending and Student Achievement, </B>by
Eric Hanushek
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 68, The Heartland Institute

<P>
Eric Hanushek, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the
University of Rochester, found that real spending on public education
in the U.S. is rising rapidly.  Despite this, student-teacher
and student-staff ratios have fallen, and student achievement
is either flat or falling. According to the study, three problems
largely explain the inefficiency of public education today: 1)
disregard for efficiency and productivity; 2) absence of performance
incentives; and 3) public schools don't learn from experience.
Hanushek concludes that only when public educators focus on making
efficiency and productivity a priority among educators and administrators
will student achievement improve. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The Heartland

<B>Natural Resource Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis,</B>
edited by Richard B. Stewart
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
This book addresses the emerging area of environmental law known
as &quot;natural resource damages&quot;(NRD), in a series of legal
and economic essays. Natural resource damages is a form of environmental
liability established by Superfund, the Oil Pollution Act, and
other federal and state statutes. These laws provide that public
(principally governmental) &quot;trustees&quot; can sue those
entities (principally private) held liable for damages to natural
resources.  As the monograph's Editor, Richard B. Stewart, former
head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Environment and Natural
Resources Division, points out that natural resource damages law
is an awakening &quot;sleeping giant.&quot; He writes that it
will become increasingly important for American businesses to
become aware of NRD's implications. According to Stewart, NRD
threatens U.S. business with potentially enormous liabilities
and massive transaction costs. This book attempts to identify
serious flaws in the existing system and suggests alternative
approaches that would protect natural resources without placing
an enormous liability upon U.S. businesses. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

Foundation of America

<P>
Land trusts were originally a perfect vehicle for privatized environmental
protection, according to retired civil and environmental engineer
Carol LaGrasse. Today, however, colossal environmental land brokerage
organizations are a channel for innocent, environmentally minded
citizen donors to unknowingly pool their resources with the taxing
power of state and federal governments to wrest land from private
ownership. LaGrasse writes that land trusts are exempt from the
possible subjection to demands by citizens for information under
the Freedom of Information laws. So, these groups can, in effect,
perform government functions without public scrutiny or responsibility.
LaGrasse points out that non-profit land trusts are serving primarily
as real estate brokers for government and asks the question: &quot;why
should local citizens, economically restricted by land preservation,
grant a tax exemption to land trusts to absorb a tax shift caused
by their wholesale land acquisitions, contrary to the community
interests?&quot; 16 pp.  CONTACT: The Property Rights Foundation

<B>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff: The Bipartisan
Assault on Local Law Enforcement, </B>by Edwin Meese, III &amp;
Rhett DeHart
<br>
<I>Policy Review </I>No. 75, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Edwin Meese, III, former Attorney General under President Reagan,
and Rhett DeHart, Special Counsel to Mr. Meese, show how Congress's
massive federalization of crimes has served to undermine local
law enforcement. According to the authors, the case against federalization
of crime includes the following: nationalizing crime contradicts
constitutional principles; violates double jeopardy; incurs unnecessary
expense; undermines state experimentation; and shifts accountability.
The proper role of the federal government, according to Meese
and DeHart, can best be described by the word &quot;limited.&quot;
There are only two broad areas of criminal jurisdiction where
the federal government should be involved. The first, crime against
the sovereignty of the United States, is concerned with clearly
federal issues such as treason, counterfeiting, and national security
violations. The second area of federal criminal jurisdiction is
limited to narrowly defined, significant interstate, or international,
crime. Furthermore, the federal government is best suite to provide
local officials with technological assistance and a database of
crime statistics as well as criminal histories and fingerprints.
Although both authors recognize that crime is a problem that affects
the entire nation, they write that &quot;both constitutional tradition
and practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively
fought at the state and local level.&quot; CONTACT: Brendan O'Scannlain,

Jackson Institute

<P>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, presents
a case for the policy known as &quot;Truth in Sentencing.&quot;
This policy seeks to fix the critical problem of early release
of violent offenders. Truth-in-Sentencing would abolish parole
and other early release programs for violent criminals and would
keep them incarcerated for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
Such an approach, similar to that in place in the federal prison
system, would greatly strengthen Tennessee's criminal justice
system by ending the current practice of allowing the majority
of violent offenders sentenced to prison to serve only a fraction
of their sentence, writes Wootton. The study illustrates that
the direct costs of allowing a violent criminal to remain on the
streets far outweigh the costs of keeping an offender in prison.

<P>
This paper evaluates the prison expansion program which has been
underway in Wisconsin since the late 1970's. Among its findings:
1) increased incarceration is a major reason for an 18% cut in
Wisconsin's crime rate between 1980 and the end of 1994; 2) while
prison costs are a growing share of the state's budget, on a per
capita basis they were a modest $46 a year in 1994; and 3) more
unskilled youths, a continuing increase in unstable, single parent
families, and an apparent departure from the state's successful
prison expansion policy, all portend an increase in crime in Wisconsin.
The study concludes that Wisconsin's prison policy has been effective
and that it warrants review as the state decides whether additional
prison space should remain a priority. 32 pp.  CONTACT: Wisconsin

<B>Three Years of the Americans With Disabilities Act: Lessons

National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
The broad and far-reaching language of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) left many employers uncertain and confused about its
requirements when it was first enacted five years ago, according
to former NLCPI staff member Mark Parenti. In order to determine
where the law has become more settled and clear, and where it
still presents employers with uncertainty, the first part of this
paper examines how the courts and the executive branch have applied
and enforced the ADA. The second part of the study addresses the
overlap and conflict between ADA provisions and other federal
laws governing the workplace. The paper concludes that the courts
are doing the job of staking out limits to the Act's uncertain
requirements and defining its vague language-a job that Congress
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission neglected. 67

David Forte, Professor at Cleveland State University, reflects
upon the past year in the Supreme Court, most notably, the emergence

developments during the 1994-95 term: 1) the constitutional rules
affecting race, free speech, religious expression, congressional
powers, and federalism were tilted sharply to the right; 2) Justice
Thomas's intellectual emergence was rooted in the thought of the
framers; 3) the four-justice liberal bloc looked wistfully to
the judicial activism that characterized the Court from 1937 on;
and 4) only 82 opinions were written last term, fewer than in
any year since 1956, but, comments Forte, they were among the
best-crafted in decades. 6 pp. CONTACT: <I>The World &amp; I</I>,

This report attempts to debunk the myths of gun control, offering
an overview of several pivotal issues in the gun control debate.
Several researchers reveal their findings that there is little
or no connection between gun control and crime and help explain
why the record on gun control is so poor. The paper concludes
that firearms are not the root of the problem of violence and
arguably are almost completely divorced from it. &quot;As long
as some people have little or nothing to lose by spending their
lives in crime, dispositions to violence will persist-and increasingly
strict gun controls will do little if anything to improve matters.&quot;

act to enhance the political safeguards of federalism and give
states more voice in congressional deliberations; 2) a mechanism
to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures,

national interest to restore democracy in Burma, because the ruling
regime facilitates the production of narcotics that make their
way to America. Also in this issue is a guest editorial by James

the electoral base behind each party is ethnically characterized.
By understanding the party systems, the author writes, the complicated

by Editor Ralph Goldman entitled &quot;The Electronic Campaign

<B>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: One Philanthropy's Web of State
Health Care Initiatives, </B>by Genevieve M. Young
<br>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, August 1995

<P>
State health reform proposals were especially prominent during
the 1992 election campaign and again in 1993. The effect of those
high profile proposals created an impression in the media and
among the public that rhetoric concerning a &quot;crisis&quot;
in health care had an objective, verifiable reality. However,
Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, demonstrates that
this &quot;crisis&quot; was the creation of a well-funded, highly
organized campaign by special interests bent on imposing their
vision of health care on the rest of us. Chief among these special
interests was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Young sheds
light on the Foundation's activities, particularly its efforts
at the state level. She exposes a complex web of relationships
between the Foundation and various government entities, working
groups, commissions, and contractors-all designed to further the
cause of government-run health care.<I> </I>6 pp. CONTACT: Capital

<B>Justice Department's Efforts at Social Engineering Defeated</B>
<P>
ALF represented New Jersey firefighter candidates who had taken
a 1995 physical performance test to determine which candidates
were eligible to be hired as firefighters and in what order. The
Justice Department, however, did not like the results of the test
because not enough minority candidates did well and instructed
Newark to ignore the 1995 list and continue to hire from a list
generated by a 1992 exam.
<P>
The United States District Court of New Jersey agreed with ALF's
position and pointed out to the Justice Department that a test
had been devised several years earlier based on the best technical
advice and that that test had been approved by the United States,
the State of New Jersey and 12 cities of New Jersey which were
subject to an earlier consent decree concerning &quot;goals&quot;
for hiring firefighters. He further pointed out that when the
test had been given in 1992, the Justice Department had not objected
to the results. The <I>same</I> test was given in 1995, but because
the Justice Department did not like the results, it objected even
though the test was the one that it helped set up and approve.
The judge ordered that the State of New Jersey certify the 1995
list for hiring and scrap the 1992 list.

<B>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</B>

<P>
<B>Defenders Bring Suit Against City of Pacific Grove and State
of California for Violating Constitution  </B>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has filed suit in United States District
Court on behalf of Pacific Grove property owner Stephen J.L. Page.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the City of Pacific
Grove, certain city officials, and the California Coastal Commission
denied him the approvals to build a home on residential property
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution
<P>
These constitutional violations stem from Mr. Page's 1989 decision
to purchase a 1.08-acre parcel of oceanfront property in a subdivided,
fully developed residential area of Pacific Grove.  He was forced
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours
attending duplicative hearings and responding to unnecessary conditions
imposed upon his attempt to use his land.  Yet-six years later
-he still lacks the necessary government approvals to build his
home.  
<P>
Pacific Grove's desire to keep the land as &quot;open space&quot;
was evident when Mr. Page first intended to purchase the land,
and voluntarily agreed to delay his purchase for an entire year
in order to allow the city time to collect money to buy the lot
itself.  Having failed to raise the requisite funds to legitimately
acquire the land, the city deliberately schemed to maintain the
land as open space without paying for it by refusing to grant
a building permit.
<P>
Chief among the tactics employed by both the city and the Coastal
Commission was the imposition of multiple, onerous, and costly
conditions that must be met to obtain a permit.  For example,
Mr. Page must set aside eighty-five percent of his land as &quot;open
space&quot; (while paying taxes on 100% of the land).  Even if
he is allowed to build a home, he will not be able to: erect any
fencing on his land, including fencing to exclude trespassers;
erect any exterior light or even a flagpole without prior government
approval; repair his septic system; or remove any hazardous substance
or diseased plants from his yard.

<B>Defenders in Face Off with FAA over Proposed Taking in Farmland</B>
<P>
Defenders helped win a victory in a recent dispute involving the
Federal Aviation Administration in New Bloomfield, Missouri. The
FAA, in attempting to purchase air rights for a new radar tower,
was taking more than the air space: property owners were told
that their continued use of the underlying property could interfere
with the radar's well, although the FAA was not going to compensate
them for the loss of those rights.
<P>
After intense media scrutiny and public opposition, the FAA decided
that it did not need to purchase the air rights after all, and
have assured the property owners that the present and intended
future use of their farmland will not be restricted due to the
radar.
<P>
<B>Defenders Obtains Day in Court for <BR>
Property Owner</B>
<P>
In <I>Sudarsky v. City of New York,</I> Defenders argued that
the City of New York unconstitutionally took Peter Sudarsky's
property through zoning regulation, and urged the court to hear
the merits of the case. In 1986, Mr. Sudarsky attempted to develop
a seventeen-story building on prime commercial real estate in
Manhattan. The City of New York held up the development under
the guise of needing an easement to expand the subway, and in
the meantime downzoned the property, foiling Mr. Sudarsky's development
plans.
<P>
After several years and several courts, including a petition to
the United States Supreme Court (which was denied), the case still
has not gone to trial. Nevertheless, the New York Supreme Court
has just reversed a grant of summary judgment for defendants and
reinstated the claim. Mr. Sudarsky will finally get his day in
court and a chance to prove his takings claim.

<B>Consent Decree Allows Teen Challenge to Continue Faith-based
Healing</B>

Through a negotiated settlement engineered by the Institute for
Justice, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)
removed licensing requirements from Teen Challenge in San Antonio;
allowing the nationally acclaimed program to continue its healing
work on behalf of those addicted to drugs and alcohol. The consent
decree expressly recognizes Teen Challenge's right to continue
its current method of operation without a license or other state
imposed requirements that would interfere with Teen Challenge
ministry. Teen Challenge, which has an outstanding track record
in assisting addiction through a Christian faith-based program
was forced by the State of Texas to comply with secular credentialling
and training requirements which treat addiction as a disease that
can never be fully cured and that requires extensive psychological
counseling and therapeutic treatment.

plaintiffs argue that the program violates the first amendment
and a variety of state constitutional provisions.

Last month the Institute successfully opposed the NAACP's motion
to intervene in the lawsuit, and has coordinated <I>amicus</I>
support for the program. Oral arguments are set for February 1996.

<B>Landmark Wins Key Education <BR>
Reform Victory</B>
<P>
In another victory for education reform, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has ruled in favor of Landmark's client, the Wilkinsburg
School District, and has allowed the continued private management
of the district's Turner Elementary School.
<P>
The school district is undertaking a remarkable effort to restructure
the education program at one small elementary school. Against
the backdrop of one of the most dismal educational achievement
records imaginable, the school board is allowing a private firm
to manage and operate the school.
<P>
Despite repeated attempts by the National Education Association
to prevent it, Turner Elementary School opened under private management
on September 5, 1995 pending review by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. This is believed to be the first time in the nation that
a public school has been totally privatized.
<P>
The state supreme court upheld the district's effort by dissolving
a preliminary injunction, dismissing contempt charges against
school board members and ordering the trial court to hold another
hearing on the union's pending motion for a permanent injunction.
However, in its remand to the trial court, the supreme court took
the unusual step of addressing certain constitutional issues prior
to the hearing. Agreeing with the position advanced by Landmark,
the majority stated that &quot;even if the School Code were to
be interpreted to prohibit subcontracting of teachers...there
may be other conditions, which the school district insists there
are, which would render this application of the Public School
Code unconstitutional.&quot;

<B>Court's Price of Admission too High</B>
<P>
In a petition for <I>writ of certiori </I>filed recently, MSLF
requested that the Supreme Court hear <I>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v.
Carol M. Browner, et al., </I>a case in which a New Mexico man
has been driven out of business by a cease and desist order issued
by EPA following its determination that the man's land is &quot;waters
of the United States&quot; under the Clean Water Act.
<P>
For years, Larry Squires used his land to dispose of waters produced
by southeastern New Mexico's important oil and gas industry. Although
EPA had told Squires previously that his lands were not &quot;waters
of the United States,&quot; in 1991 it changed its mind. In 1992,
EPA served Squires with a cease and desist order preventing him
from using his land. When his company was driven out of business,
Squires asked MSLF to represent him in suing EPA.
<P>
Squires contended that EPA's decision that his land fell under
the Clean Water Act was illegal. EPA asserted that Squires could
not sue until he violated the cease and desist order. If Squires
violated the EPA order, he would face penalties of $25,000 and
three years in prison, administrative fines of up to $125,000,
and a &quot;knowing&quot; penalty of $50,000 per day, plus three
years in prison.
<P>
A federal district court agreed with EPA. An appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded the following decision in June:
&quot;Laguna's policy argument that it should not be necessary
to violate an EPA order and risk civil and criminal penalties
to obtain judicial review is well taken. Nevertheless...we reject
Laguna's conclusion such a situation is constitutionally intolerable.&quot;
<P>
In asking the Supreme Court to hear Laguna's case, MSLF asserts
that the Tenth Circuit's decision conflicts with the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment requirement that &quot;[n]o person shall...be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law,&quot; as well as numerous Supreme Court decisions that &quot;individuals
must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Government deprives them of property.&quot;

<B>City of Tigard Rebuffs U.S. Supreme Court </B>
<P>
On August 29th, the Tigard City Council voted to reinstate the
same bikepath/greenway conditions on the Dolan's A-Boy plumbing
store building permit that the United States Supreme Court struck
down in the highly publicized landmark property rights case, <I>Dolan
v. City of Tigard</I>.
<P>
In June last year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the city had
failed to prove &quot;rough proportionality&quot; between the
impact of an expanded plumbing store building and the city's requirement
that the Dolans give up 10% of their land for a public bikepath
and greenway along Fanno Creek. Although the U.S. Supreme Court
was skeptical that Tigard could meet the proportionality test,
it remanded the case back to the city to give it an opportunity
to do so. During the months of inaction on the part of the city,
it did not withdraw the unconstitutional conditions, revise them,
or try to justify them. The Dolans then filed a legal action in
circuit court for damages caused by the city's unconstitutional
actions.
<P>
The city eventually instituted proceedings in which they attempted
to establish the required connection between impact of the building
and the bikepath/greenway conditions.
<P>
The Dolans have tried to settle with the city by agreeing to conditions
that would accommodate the city's bikepath and greenway needs
as well as the building. In fact, the city's staff proposed virtually
the same compromise, but later the city decided to reimpose essentially
what it had imposed four years before.

<B>Texas Immigration Suit Supported on Appeal</B>

Joined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jack
Fields, WLF filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit in support of Texas'
position in <I>Texas v. U.S.</I>, the lawsuit brought to compel
the federal government to enforce immigration laws adequately
or to compensate Texas for the fiscal burdens resulting from inadequate
enforcement. WLF argued in its brief that if the federal government

cannot impose without compensatory funding.

WLF filed a brief in the California Supreme Court in support of

a suit over the constitutionality of an injunction to stop gang
activity by the defendants.  The defendants were found to have
been part of two street gangs, the &quot;Varrio Surreno Treces&quot;
(VST) and &quot;Varrio Surreno Locos&quot; (VSL), that maintained
a reign of terror in the community of Rocksprings, a neighborhood
in San Jose. The City obtained an injunction to abate these activities
as a public nuisance. The state appellate court, however, struck
down many provisions of the injunction as a violation of the gang
members' First Amendment rights, WLF argued that the First Amendment
did not forbid an injunction to limit the congregating of known
gang members.

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi69.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #1</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,</b> by William Beach and John Barry. <BR>

<P>
<li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi76.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #2</a>: <b>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes? </b> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
Beach points out that there are three major reasons why adopting
capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balance Budget Act
of 1995 will benefit nearly every American. First, the benefits
of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income
tax-payers rather than to the wealthy. Second, economists who
have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget
while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains
tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread
economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy.
And third, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would
increase tax revenues from tax-payers who own most appreciated
assets. 4 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#76)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi77.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #3</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Family College Costs,</b>
by John Barry <BR>

<P>
Among Barry's findings, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress
would mean the following: American families, over time, could
save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund
college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax
credit; and an average student could save more than $414 over
the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest
rates. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #77)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi75.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #4</a>: <b>The $500-per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage For a Typical American Family</b>
by Scott Hodge <BR>

<P>
Scott Hodge, Heritage Foundation Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs,
points out that a $500 tax cut for each child in working families
is not an insignificant amount of money, as many liberals believe.
Hodge shows that this tax cut would pump over $22 billion per
year into family budgets across the country. According to Hodge
millions of families will benefit, and Congress's $500-per-child
tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5
million taxpayers caring for 8.7 children. 19 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi78.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #5</a>: <b>Clinton's $300-per-Child Tax Cut Plan Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children,</b> by Scott Hodge<BR>

<P>
Hodge shows that the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by President Clinton
on December 6th (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children
in families earning up to $110,000) compared with Clinton's budget
(with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent
children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000)
would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with
children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the
$300 child tax credit under the Clinton plan. 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi79.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #6</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Current and Future Retirees,</b>
by John Barry
<P>
Barry has found that under the congressional balanced budget plan
current retirees would gain additional after-tax income from a
reduction in the capital gains tax; and retirees have a significant
increase in real purchasing power over the next ten years due
to decreased inflation. Future retirees would benefit under the
Congressional proposal with the proposed &quot;super IRA&quot;
compared with saving the same amount in a conventional IRA; a
young couple raising one newborn child could save significantly
for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit,
while a young couple buying a home could save more for their retirement
from decreased monthly mortgage payments. 6 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi80.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #7</a>: <b>What Congress's Balanced Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Housing,</B> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
According to an econometric analysis by William Beach, adoption
of the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to: 104,000 additional housing
starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002; new
or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans; a drop in mortgage
interests rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about
$10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage
purchased under current budget and tax law; and a 4 percent drop
in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases
in the cost of capital and lower interests rates), with the value
of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the
growing demand for new homes. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #80)

<h2>November <i>Insider</i>: On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court</h2></center><p>
by Roger Clegg, Vice President, National Legal Center for the Public Interest  <br>
<hr>
<br>


Following its usual practice, the Supreme Court commenced its new term on the first Monday in October. Decisions in the cases argued before the Court should be handed down before the 1995-96 term is completed at the end of next June. Here is a brief overview of the cases to watch.
<P>
One of the most controversial cases is Romer v. Evans, where a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring protected status for homosexuals is being challenged as a denial of "equal protection of the laws," in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. When the case was argued last month, the Colorado official defending the law got a chilly reception from the Court. But it can be risky to predict a case's outcome based only on how the oral argument goes.
<P>
Another case that was recently argued is BMW of North America Incorporated v. Gore, which spotlights out-of-control jury damage awards. An Alabama jury awarded $4 million to a doctor who complained about his new car's paint job. The state supreme court cut it back to "only" $2 million, which understandably enough did not satisfy the defendant. The Court has taken a number of punitive damage cases in recent years, but has yet to offer clear guidance to the lower courts on how to tell when an award is unconstitutionally "excessive."
<P>
Last term the Court handed down a number of important civil rights cases, most of them conservative victories, as a slender majority of the justices insisted that racial preferences of all kinds be given strict scrutiny. This term's most important cases in this category_Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera_involve voting rights, and in particular the practice of drawing district boundaries with an eye toward "politically correct" racial outcomes. With the Clinton administration committed to racial preferences, and Congress so far unwilling to act, the Court appears to be the only branch of the federal government willing to resist racial balkanization.
Another important civil rights case, which the Court just recently 
agreed to hear, is United States v. Virginia. This is the "VMI case," challenging the constitutionality of single sex, state-run military academies, namely the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. This controversy drew a great deal of attention last summer when Shannon Faulkner briefly attended the Citadel.
<P>
Two other cases likely to generate publicity are Bennis v. Michigan, in which a wife is challenging the forfeiture of the family car when her husband used it to pick up a prostitute, and Lewis v. Casey, in which Arizona's state-prison libraries were ordered by a federal judge to provide inmates with a variety of amenities. Bennis is important because law-enforcement agencies have been very aggressive recently in using forfeiture laws, especially against drug dealers. Lewis provides the Court with a chance to cut back on the federal judiciary's micromanagement of state prison systems_just as it cut back on its micromanagement of school systems last term in Missouri v. Jenkins.
<P>
Other important cases which the Supreme Court will hear this year involve Indian gambling casinos, whether there is a jury-trial right in patent cases, claims against the manufacturers of Agent Orange, whether the federal census illegally undercounted members of minority groups, the First Amendment implication of limits on liquor advertising, the extent to which some computer software can be copyrighted, the sentencing in the Rodney King case, and whether telephone companies can be prevented by the federal government from getting into the cable television business.
<P>
Finally, keep in mind that the Court has so far scheduled relatively few cases to be heard this term, even considering the fact that its docket has shrunk dramatically from just a few years ago. Consequently, the Court is expected to add quite a few cases to its agenda over the next few weeks and months.

<b>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</b><br>
by David J. Armor, Oxford University Press (1995)
<P>
In his new book, <i>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</i> (Oxford University Press), David J. Armor, Research Professor at the Institute of Public Policy at George Mason University, offers his readers a thoroughly professional overview of one of the most controversial areas of public policies of the last forty years -- school desegregation. A conservative, Armor writes in a non-threatening, academic style that allows him to tread in controversial academic waters and reach conservative conclusions without scaring away the ideologically liberal reader. One suspects that even the most defiant apologist of forced busing and race-conscious education policies will, upon reading this book, be forced to admit that the world is a more complicated place than it appeared to be in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Brown undoubtedly contributed to the sea change in popular opinion on racial issues in this country, as illustrated by polling data that shows the steady upward movement in the percentage of whites who believe that black and white students should attend the same schools -- from about one-third in 1942 to 95 percent in 1990. But the decision also legitimized one of the most pernicious legal developments of our time, the judicial use of social science theory in deciding important constitutional law cases. In this case, the Court accepted the questionable "harm and benefit" thesis, which Armor defines as the notion that: 
<P><bq>
"school desegregation is harmful to the social, psychological, and educational development of children, both minority and white, and that school desegregation is beneficial for undoing or at least ameliorating the damages from segregation and discrimination." 

</bq><P>
Have the last four decades been kind to this thesis? After an exhaustive review of the research literature, Armor concludes that academic achievement among blacks is most strongly related, not to whether the student sits in a desegregated classroom, but to the "educational and economic characteristics" of his family and even to federal compensatory programs such as the Chapter 1 program. Armor also summarizes the research findings on the question of whether desegregation enhances black self-esteem, another key element of the harm and benefit thesis, and concludes: 
<P>
The research on black self-esteem over the past thirty years not only fails to support the harm and benefit thesis, then, but indeed seems to turn the thesis on its head. First, school segregation appears not to harm self-esteem of black students in the first place...and in many cases segregated black students have higher self-esteem than white students. Second, desegregation not only fails to improve black self-esteem but may in fact <b>lower it</b>. (emphasis added)
<P>
If, in 1954, the Court had resisted the temptation to substitute shaky social science for sound constitutional principles, how many young schoolchildren, both black and white, might have been spared those long and painful bus rides to distant schools to fulfill the social engineer's dream of perfect racial integration in the schools?  
<P>
What does the research literature tell us about whether whites abandon public school systems that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans, the so-called phenomena of "white flight"? As Armor describes it, in 1975 social scientists began to suspect that "desegregation was accelerating white flight above and beyond that caused by other demographic processes." Armor himself conducted a comprehensive study of fifty-four court-ordered plans and found:
<P><bq>
"In central-city school districts with higher percentages of black enrollment, I found mandatory busing to raise white loss rates by three to five times that due to underlying demographic processes...[T]his study estimated that over a five-year period about half of the total white enrollment loss was due to the busing plans and the other half was due to normal demographic processes such as declining birth rates and net out-migration rates."
</bq><P>
Armor suggests that inconvenience, rather than racial prejudice, may account for much of this result: "the highest no-show rate is for Los Angeles, which had the longest average busing distance of any of the plans [55 minutes for a one-way bus ride]." Elsewhere, he points to data that parents weigh the quality of the individual school, rather than race, most heavily before deciding to move their children to other schools.

Try as he might to present both sides of a rather complicated argument, Armor nonetheless leaves the reader feeling quite frustrated with the current state of affairs, both politically and in the courts.

The House-Senate Conference Should Agree to Rapid Deployment of Missle Defenses</b>, by Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder No. 1054, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Baker Spring, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, recommends that the members of the House and Senate military oversight committees who make up the conference committee should not settle for a weak bill that postpones deployment or takes the US ballistic missile defense program down a dead-end road. Spring recommends the committee adopt the following in order to send a clear message to the administration: deploy affordable and highly effective theater missile defense systems as soon as possible; deploy at the earliest possible date an affordable and highly effective national missile defense system that can be augmented to provide a layered defense; and improve existing cruise missile defense capabilities. This paper includes an appendix detailing recommended changes to the House and Senate versions of the bill as well as outling recommended goals for the conference committee, broken down into the following areas: statements of policy; theater missile defense; national missile defense; the future of the ABM Treay; interpreting the ABM Treaty; reporting requirements; and funding for missile defense. 11 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Mexico: Policy Failure, Moral Hazard, and Market Solutions, </b>by W. Lee Hoskins and James W. Coons<br>

Policy Analysis No. 243, Cato Institute
<P>
Lee Hoskins and James Coons, respectively the CEO and vice president of the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, point out that for the fourth time in the past 20 years, the Mexican economy is in financial distress, largely due to the poor monetary policies pursued by Mexican officials. The authors suggest that the consistent American practice of lending money to the Mexican government has created a set of perverse incentives which ensure the "crisis" will reappear on an even larger scale. Hoskins and Coons suggest that the best course for the future is to encourage market forces, stronger private property rights, price stability, and a floating exchange rate for the peso. The authors write, "The United States should pass legislation that eliminates the Treasury's ability to make foreign loans and that removes the ability of the Federal Reserve to extend credit to foreign central banks directly or indirectly by funding the Exchange Stabilization Fund." 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Ukraine: Back from the Brink, </b> by Taras Kuzio
<br>
European Security Study No. 23, Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<P>
Taras Kuzio, research fellow for the Centre for Russian and East European studies at the University of Birmingham, argues that Ukraine, more so than any other former Soviet Republic, was left with one of the most difficult legacies. According to the author, Ukraine is divided between an eastern region with a large population of Russian speakers and culture and a western area in which traditional Ukrainian language and culture predominate. Kuzio presents his analysis of the tenure of the Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk and describes his efforts to handle the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, stressing reconciliation and consensus and thus avoiding ethnic tension and social instability. The author then presents a look at how the new president, Leonid Kuchma, has been able to address the problems that Kravchuk did not deal with effectively: economic and social stagnation and an increasing drift in Ukrainian foreign policy. The latter half of this paper addresses three lingering problems for Ukraine: 1) the building of a truly democratic political system is still inhibited by electoral apathy and the weakness of political parties; 2) while regional tensions have abated, the evolution of a generally accepted Ukrainian identity will be necessary; and 3) progress towards the settlement of the Crimean issue and Ukraine's general security might  be threatened by a more aggressively nationalistic Russian leader in the future. Kuzio concludes, "Western support for an independent Ukraine confident within its borders will ensure European security and stability at a crucial moment in the post-soviet transition process." 37 pp. CONTACT: Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, W1P 3FP ENGLAND, 0171-637-2152, or fax 0171-637-2155.

America's Stake in Hong Kong, </b> by Brett C. Lippencott
<br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 137, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Brett Lippencott, policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that the strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's October legislative elections is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Lippencott demonstrates that Hong Kong is America's 12th largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion. The paper maintains that the US has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Lippencott suggests the following conditions of the Basic Law which Beijing must respect after 1997: continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity; the existence of a free market; commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press; preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service; the rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties; maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

How to Close Down the Department of Labor</b> by Mark Wilson
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1058, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Luken's Fellow in Labor Policy, reveals that the Department of Labor has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government.  Wilson advocates closing this Cabinet-level department and moving key national functions to sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Wilson recommends that Congress take the following steps: 1) devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance Services to the states; 2) consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant; 3) consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant; 4) reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 5) transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration; 6) repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations; 7) combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau in a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics; and 8) close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (striker replacement). Wilson writes, "The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. The primary objectives of this effort should be: reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety, and improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employee protections." 29 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Saying Goodbye When the Job is Done: The Coming Privatization of Government-Sponsored Enterprises, </b>by Thomas H. Stanton
<br>
IPI Policy Report No. 133, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Tom Stanton, a fellow of the Center for the Study of American Government at the Johns Hopkins University, states that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae pose a needless $1.5 trillion liability to taxpayers and should be privatized. Stanton writes, "Today, Farmer Mac is requesting changes to its charter that would increase taxpayer risk, and give it advantage over its private competitors. As proven by the Savings and Loan debacle, such massive taxpayer liabilities are not risk-free." The report addresses the individual situations of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and the Farm Credit System. Stanton concludes that, if the GSEs are not privatized, the taxpayer liability of GSEs will continue to grow at a rapid rate, and will only add to the total hidden taxpayer liability that lurks beyond the national debt. 22 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Archer Daniels Midland: A Case Study in Corporate Welfare</b>, by James Bovard
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 241, Cato Institute
<P>
James Bovard, an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, reveals that the Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been one of the most prominent recipients of corporate welfare in recent years, funding both political parties with millions of dollars of handouts in return for billion dollar windfalls from taxpayers and consumers. Bovard writes, "Thanks to federal protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies, subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period." This paper demonstrates how ADM has received at least 43 percent of its annual profits from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Bovard puts these figures in perspective with the current debate over corporate welfare, examining the dynamics of corporate welfare by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such "rent seeking," and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the political life of a nation. 48 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Constraints Upon Privatization: A Case Study of the Israeli Experience, </b> by Avi Naider
<br>
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
Avi Naider provides a short history of the rise of state-owned enterprises throughout the world in the post-World War II era, and the general trend of governments subsequently to divest themselves of those interests. Naider then presents a case study of privatization efforts in Israel, an example of an advanced industrial country which has generally failed to meet its own goals and standards, according to the author. This paper suggests that the most significant constraints on Israel's privatization program have been political and social, and, although technical constraints have contributed to delays, they are unable to account for the fact that despite the government's stated commitment to privatization, the number of state owned enterprises in the 1990s have actually increased. Naider probes several obstacles to reform: 1) Israel's fragmented and contentious political system; 2) the maneuvering of ministers and bureaucrats to "protect their turf;" 3) the power of the country's federated labor union; 4) the preoccupation with national security; and 5) the country's socialist legacy. To further illustrate Israel's unique experience, a chapter is dedicated to a case study of Israel Chemicals, Ltd., a pivotal divesture failure. 68 pp. CONTACT: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Beit Milken, 13 Tel Hal Street, Jerusalem  92107, ISRAEL, fax 972-2-619112.

Metropolitan Economic Development in Wisconsin</b>
<br>
Report Vol. 8, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
This report, developed by the Urban Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, examines the impact of the recent economic growth in Wisconsin's largest metropolitan areas. The report, which uses jobs data from the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, reveals several significant trends: Kenosha expands by creating jobs through small compaies, while its neighbor, Racine, remains stagnant; metropolitan Milwaukee continues to develop jobs, but at a slower rate than other large metropolitan areas; and smaller areas are experiencing a far more significant rate of job creation than the larger metropolitan areas. This report analyzes which industries grew most rapidly, whether single-site employers added more employment than establishments associated with multiple-site employers, whether existing employers are universally responsible for most employment gains in all regions, how important to overall growth employers are that added large numbers of employees, which size employer added the most employees, whether suburban areas are growing at the expense of the central cities, how much firm migration is occurring, and what are the earnings patterns. 32 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 N.

FDA Hazards: How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy, </b> by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<P>
Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Foundation, reveals that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has generally been held in high regard by Americans, has recently squandered much of this goodwill. At the cost of the consumer, the FDA, according to Keating, has stifled growth in many areas, including entrepreneurial medical devices, vitamins, and foods. Keating recommends bold reforms for the FDA: 1) the FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education; 2) efficacy should be left to the marketplace; 3) manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system; 4) FDA bans on information about off-label uses of drugs should be lifted; 5) the US should negatiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals; and 6) incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need to be enhanced. 25pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 Eighteenth Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238.

Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America? </b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1055, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, McKenna senior fellow in political economy at The Heritage Foundation, analyzes and grades the six current proposals for major tax reform: the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Specter flat tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax. Mitchell evaluates the tax proposals on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly. This paper concludes that the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution senior fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest; direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. 16 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Eating Out Our Substance: How Taxation Affects Saving, </b> by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<br>
Policy Report No. 131, The Institute for Policy Innovation in cooperation with Center for the New West
<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin senior research fellow at IPI, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley senior research fellow at IPI, find that in order to stimulate economic growth by increasing private savings, America's tax policy must be changed to remove the penalties on saving and investment. This report confirms that America's private saving rate has declined precipitously in recent years: between 1947 and 1994, private savings averaged 12.9 percent of aftertax income; today the savings rate hovers around 7 percent. The authors report that there is a significant historical relationship between the private saving rate and the tax treatment of capital: specifically, a 10 percent increase in the aftertax rate of return to capital will result in a 7-11 percent increase in saving. The authors conclude that reducing the difference between average and marginal tax rates will reduce the adverse effect of taxes on the economy, and moving to a system that ends the multiple taxation of capital will lead to higher rates of saving, labor productivity, and economic growth. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax, </b> by Stephen Moore and John Silvia
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 242, Cato Institute
<P>
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, and John Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, examine the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the finding of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. The authors conclude that a capital gains tax cut would: 1) substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich; 2) increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation throughout the year 2000; 3) unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital; and 4) expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities. Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient_because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment_that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Stephen Smith, an economist with the Institute for the Research on the Economics of Taxation, suggests that repealing or at least raising the Social Security earnings limit would produce important benefits, including simplifying the tax code, lowering administrative costs, and greater choices for the elderly. Smith explains that, "even if the impact on the federal budget is negative, this concern is overbalanced by the tredmendous benefits to be had from this reform and can be alleviatedby other minor adjustments to benefit computation rules." The author explains how the current limit and tax treatment impose disincentives to working and saving. 11pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, DC Office, 727 15th Street, NW, 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/628-6671.

John Liu, Heritage Foundation policy analyst for health care, and Robert Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies at Heritage, provide insight into the search for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program into a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. This report examines the inherent flaws in the current system, revealing that from its inception, the current Medicare system encouraged central planning and price controls, bureaucracy and red tape, and government standardized benefits. Liu and Moffitt offer readers ammunition to the complicated questions that result from reforming the Medicare system in terms of funding and benefits for the elderly.

Improving Medicare: Nine Ways the House Medicare Bill Does It, </b> by John S. Tottie
<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, writes, "The Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 proposed by the House leadership provides just what President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare program recently called for, `prompt, effective, and decisive action' to save Medicare." Tottie lists the following nine aspects of the House plan as major improvements in the Medicare plan: 1) the plan saves Medicare from bankruptcy by reducing the rate of spending increases; 2) it offers many private-sector alternatives, including medical savings accounts; 3) it would make it possible to provide more benefits at no extra cost; 4) it would allow beneficiaries to limit their out-of-pocket spending; 5) it allows insurers to offer beneficiaries financial incentives to spend wisely; 6) it  reduces fraud, waste, and abuse in several different ways; 7) it reduces government subsidies to Medicare recipients who do not need them; 8) it reduces unnecessary bureacracy and high administrative costs; and 9) it enable beneficiaries to escape the rationing in government-run Medicare. The author contends the House plan results in a "win-win" proposition: a better Medicare system for beneficiaries and increased savings for taxpayers. 9 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder, both professors at Ohio University, suggest that as the legislative conferees work out the differences on a welfare reform bill to send to the president, they should highlight a comparison between the House Republican plan and last year's plan from the Administration.

Restructuring Medicare: A Long-Term Plan to Save the Medicare Program, </b> by Mark E. Litow and Peter G. Hendee

Council for Affordable Health Insurance
<P>
Mark Litow, consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson, Inc., and Peter Hendee, consulting actuary for Odell and Associates, developed a plan that would save the Medicare program for those beneficiearies who want to remain in the system and, at the same time, offer an array of choices to those who want other choices. Under this plan, individuals would have to choose between the Medicare program and a private voucher system. For those who choose to opt out of the Medicare program, the voucher amounts could be used to purchase private health insurance coverage such as a managed care plan, a medical savings account (MSA), or any new product the market develops. Any remaining voucher balance would be deposited into an MSA and the balance could be withdrawn to pay for routine medical care, or saved for long-term care expenses. This plan would produce a savings of $297 billion over the next seven years and meets the FY 1996 Budget Resolution reducing Medicare spending growth by $270 billion over seven years. 30 pp. CONTACT: Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 112 S.

Thomas Lambert, adjunct research assistant at the Center for the Study of American Business, writes that without major reform of the Endangered Species Act, land use conflicts between regulators and property owners will only increase in frequency. Lambert finds the number of listed endangered domestic species will likely grow from 962 to more than 3,000 in the coming years_due to the listing of subspecies, or "bugs and slugs"_further restricting development on private land. Lambert proposes that regulators should: a) compensate landowners whose property is devalued through the Act's restrictions; b) mandate minimum scientific standards for endangered species listing decisions; and c) limit protection to "full-fledged" species. 24 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuses, </b> by Jonathan Tolman
<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Jonathan Tolman, environmental policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that environmentalists have overlooked one of the largest sources of water pollution: agricultural runoff. Tolman states that agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nation's rivers, streams, and lakes. The author argues that the farm programs, developed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers, and modern farming techniques, have had and continue to have detrimental effects on the environment. Tolman cites damage to the Everglades from the US sugar program and damage to peanut crops from the USDA peanut program. The author concludes, "Overall, consumers, taxpayers, and the environment would be better off under a free market agricultural policy. Direct and indirect payments to farmers should be eliminated and all supply control programs should be ended." 16 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 1250, Washington, DC  20036, 202/331-1010.

Going Against the Flow: The Case for Competition in Solid Waste Management, </b> by Angela Logomasini
<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Angela Logomasini, adjunct analyst with Citizens for a Sound Economy, asserts that local governments' imposition of solid waste flow control_the practice of mandating that trash haulers dispose of waste at government designated facilities_creates monopoly providers of waste disposal services within a community. Logomasini demonstrates how such economic protectionism in the waste management industry has imposed huge costs on consumers, taxpayers, and the economy in general, while reducing innovation and subsidizing inefficient enterprises. The paper states that despite evidnce to the contrary, Congress is considering legislation that would bolster such laws. Logomasini advocates, "promoting a competitive system that allows the industry to seek the lowest cost options and operate efficiently." 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

CIR Challenges Racial Quotas at UT Law School</b>
<br>
The Center is representing non-minority applicants to the University of Texas Law School in the first substantive constitutional challenge to racial preferences in student admission since Board of Regents v. Bakke (1978). In August 1994, a federal district judge in Austin, Texas held that certain aspects of the law school's admission process were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the consideration of minority applicants by a separate minority admissions subcommittee deprived the plaintiffs of equal protection of the law. The court also noted in dicta that separate cut-off scores for minority applicants violated the equal protection clause. However, the court failed to award meaningful monetary or injunctive relief and the case is now pending on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

After five days of hearings and months of deliberation, the college's Professional Ethics Committee branded Maas as a sexual harasser. The Center seeks just compensation for, inter alia, the university's breach of its promise of confidentiality by conducting an all-out publicity campaign smearing Maas' reputation and the University's violation of its duty (under Title IX) to provide a fair and equitable resolution of student harassment complaints.

CIR Sues HUD Officials for Violating First Amendment</b>

The Berkeley residents had exercised their First Amendment right by opposing the government's proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter. In response to the residents' constitutionally protected activities of publishing articles and circulating a newsletter explaining the problems with the project, HUD unleashed a lengthy investigation of the residents' activities. At one point, HUD offered to close the investigation in return for the residents' agreement not to engage in similar activities in the future. At issue in this case is whether the government's actions chilled the residents' First Amendment rights.

CIR Wins Sex Discrimination Appeal Before 4th Circuit</b>

The Center is representing five male professors at Virginia Commonwealth University who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave over $400,000 in raises to female professors in 1992. The school justified this special salary increase for women by pointing to the results of an internal "Salary Equity Study" which indicated that women made $1,900 per year less, on average, than men if one fails to take into account such factors as teaching performance, publications, teaching load, and service to the community. Last year, the U.S. District Court in Richmond granted summary judgment to VCU and dismissed the case in the eve of trial. However, on August 24, 1995, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision and ruled that the case should be heard by a jury.

Mr. Ryan's land, currently zoned for residential use, is sandwiched between a commercial property and a recently constructed highway that handles an average of 100,000 vehicles per day. Although this makes the property ideal for light commercial uses, the local planning board is sticking with its 1915 residential designation. The only purpose served by keeping the current zoning is to provide a cheap, uncompensated way to create a "buffer zone" between the surrounding residential area and a nearby commercial district.

In a case promising to be ultimately decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the validity of religious school participation in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The program, the nation's first court-approved school choice plan, was expanded earlier this year to include religious schools. Landmark Legal Foundation represents Wisconsin state representative Polly Williams, the Milwaukee program's architect, and a group of families and students wishing to attend religious schools.
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently remanded the Miller case back to the trial court with instruction to vacate its earlier decision against Landmark's families. The Seventh Circuit order noted Landmark's "victory in the legislative forum" gave Milwaukee families "exactly what they sought" in the litigation.

NELF to Help Immigrant Workers in New Hampshire</b>
<br>
NELF will represent a group of New Hampshire women who sew garments in their homes. The Department of Labor (DOL) says these women are "employees" not "independent contractors." If DOL wins, these women will lose their jobs.
The case involves Gale River Designs ("Gale River"), a small clothing maker, located in Franconia, N.H. which makes garments for catalogue retailers such as Orvis and Motherwear. Gale River employs about 20 to 25 people at its offices and factory. In addition to 8 to 10 in-house workers, it contracts out sewing to about 16 at-home "sewers" in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Gale River ships unassembled pieces to the sewers who finish the garments and ship them back to Gale River. Sewers are paid on a piece-work basis. They estimate that their compensation works out to $12-15 per hour spent sewing, well above minimum wage. Most are women, some refugees, who simply cannot work outside the home because they live in remote locations or care for small children or elderly relatives. Home work for Gale River is their only employment option.
After a lengthy investigation DOL charged Gale River with $38,000 in minimum wage and overtime violations. If DOL succeeds, Gale River's costs will increase and it will have to use only in-house sewers. That will mean unemployment and a return to poverty for the sewers.

 NELF Brief Supports WalMart's Right to Enter Vermont</b>
<br>
NELF is filing an amicus brief with the Vermont Supreme Court challenging the Vermont Environmental Board's rejection of an application to construct a new WalMart in St. Albans, Vermont. The Board overruled local approvals of the project in order to impose on St. Albans its view of how the local economy should grow.
WalMart has secured a site in St. Albans already zoned for commercial use. It has obtained all required state and local permits, except the one required by ACT 250, Vermont's strict land use law. The citizens of St. Albans voted 7-1 in favor of WalMart in a recent, non-binding referendum. Nonetheless the state Environmental Board denied WalMart the needed Act 250 permit. The Board's main objection to WalMart is that the new store would have a negative "net economic impact." The Board credited two economists' testimony that WalMart's superior service and prices would cause the failure of nearby retailers. WalMart vigorously contests that projection. Even if true, that kind of impact is not within the Board's mandate nor is it a decision a state-wide agency should be making.
The Environmental Board was created to weight traditional environmental issues like wetlands or endangered species. By rejecting WalMart, the Board is seeking to transform itself into a super economic planning agency. Without any statutory authority, the Board wants the power to decide a new business is "negative" and bar it. NELF's brief will rebut the Board's right to impose its views on the local community. The people of St. Albans can use their zoning and planning powers to select the mix of large and small stores they want in the town. They have decided in favor of WalMart and the Board has no business second-guessing that decision.

 Court of Appeals Decides Preseault Case</b>
<br>
After almost two years of deliberation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. decided Paul Preseault's precedent-setting "takings" case. By a 2-1 vote, with a very strong dissent, the court held that Mr. Preseault was not entitled to compensation from the United States for the federal approval of a bike trail over an abandoned railroad line across his Vermont property.
The court relied on a 1920 law which, it held, put purchasers on notice that federal law might "someday" be changed to allow such conversions. Since trains continued to run over the Preseaults' land for 55 years after the 1920 act, the court seems to be, as the dissent put it, attempting to duck the constitutional issue. When this case was last in the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Mr. Preseault was entitled to compensation. NELF is drafting a petition to return the case to the Court, the only forum where the appeals court's error can be corrected.

Tight Restrictions Sought on LSC-Funded Representation in Drug Evictions</b>
<br>
In one city after another, efforts by public housing managers to stop drug dealing and drug abuse in low-income housing projects have repeatedly been frustrated by federally-funded legal services attorneys, who have used the courts to prevent evictions of tenants engaged in drug activity. In response to a recent Legal Services Corporation proposal to restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to represent public housing tenants who are being evicted for drug activity, WLF argued that the LSC's proposal did not go nearly far enough. WLF pointed out that the proposal would prohibit such representations only in cases where (1) an actual criminal prosecution for drug activity has been initiated, (2) the particular drug activity forming the basis of the prosecution threatened the health or safety of public housing residents or workers, and (3) the leaseholder is the person being prosecuted, not another member of the leaseholder's household (such as a relative or boyfriend). WLF argued that these limitations should be removed from the proposed rule because they make the overall prohibition essentially toothless.

OSHA has created a powerful barrier to such initiatives by failing to recognize a privilege of confidentiality for employers' self-critical audits of workplace conditions. The petition also points out that OSHA has extensive record-keeping requirements and inspection powers with which to identify violations, without the need to deter self-evaluations.

<h2>October <i>Insider</i>: Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</h2></center><p>
by Rick Dearborn, Director of Congressional Relations, U.S. Senate at The Heritage Foundation<br>
<hr>
<br>

Last week the U.S. Senate passed a welfare reform package that was solid on creating strong work requirements, but was weaker than the House of Representatives' version on the debate over curtailing the rampant illegitimacy rate. Both bills will now go to a conference, possibly lasting well into November, between both houses in order to iron out the differences.
Unless the Senate accedes to the House on its provisions denying additional monies to teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children, the bill that comes out of conference is likely to do little to discourage illegitimacy. On the flip side of the coin, it will be in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer for the House to adopt the Senate's position on work requirements for able-bodied individuals on the public dole. <P>
The Senate provisions on work contain an important provision not currently found in the House bill, known as pay for performance.This provision states that welfare recipients may not receive their direct cash benefits until completing the work requirements. Under current law, if welfare recipients worked 80 percent of their required hours there would be no commensurate reduction in benefits. Special hearings to bring hours paid in line with hours worked nearly always favor the welfare recipients. The Senate bill does away with this problem by forcing welfare workers to do their work first and then be paid on the basis of how many hours they have completed. The House bill lacks the same commitment to stricter work requirements.<P>
Despite efforts by Senators Faircloth, Gramm, and Ashcroft, the Senate welfare reform package did not incorporate House reforms intended to ameliorate the problems of illegitimacy (many of which were first proposed by Heritage senior analyst Robert Rector). These three Senators fought hard for the inclusion of many of their bill's provisions. Among the amendments offered by the Faircloth/Gramm/Ashcroft team, expected to be issues in the conference committee, were policy proposals to cut off additional funds for teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children out-of-wedlock; provisions to deny only federal funds, not state funds, to minor mothers who are currently eligible to receive direct cash benefits in the mail or down at the social welfare center on the condition that they have children out-of-wedlock; a provision known as the illegitimacy ratio, that would provide an additional block grant to reward those states who curtail their ever-rising illegitimacy rate without increasing the rate of abortions within their state; and applying a four-day a-month work requirement to single, able-bodied males who currently receive food stamps and do not do any work.<P>
Although the illegitimacy ratio was adopted in the Senate bill, and a modified amendment regarding work requirements for food stamp recipients offered by Senator Jesse Helms was accepted, the denial of federal cash benefits to unwed teenagers, and the denial of federal cash benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have additional children (family cap) were not accepted by the U.S. Senate. <P>
The House conferees will be fighting to include their family cap provision. The Senate appointees appear unlikely to support the family cap but are likely to fight for stricter versions of workfare.<P>
 
Because of the many contentious items in both the House and Senate bills, the key to getting a strong reform proposal will be the appointment of conferees to the welfare Conference Committee. The House leadership plans to appoint members who are strong on both the work and illegitimacy issues. If Senator Dole places reform-minded individuals committed to solving America's welfare dilemma on the conference committee, he will help ensure that the end result will be a solid welfare reform package.

<h2>
October <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review<p>
</h2>
<i>By Corinne T. Coldwell</i><br>
<hr>

<b>Fatherless America</b>, by David Blankenhorn<br>
234 pp. BasicBooks, 1995
<P>
In <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn does not just list the repercussions of an ever-widening void of fathers in this country, he explains in frightening detail how society now regards fathers as superfluous. America  now has a society where the nuclear family is a rarity and divorce and single motherhood are commonplace. Now, children of fragmented families represent today's young generation. And unless this trend is reversed, nothing will repair the damage of fatherlessness. No amount of economic growth, welfare reform, prison construction, or school reform can cure the deeply rooted problems of male violence and lack of child well-being. Domestic policy reforms will fail when enacted upon a weak family structure. What can be done to restore and encourage strong two-parent families? Blankenhorn first discusses how the choices Americans made over the last few decades have denigrated traditional fatherhood. Then he elaborates on how these often selfish choices have not only affected society's perception of fatherhood, but have made them acceptable -- if not ideal. <P>

According to Blankenhorn, the fatherless crisis began during and after World War II when draft quotas could no longer be filled by only single men and married men without children. The Selective Service had to turn to fathers (approximately 6 million men) to fulfill their needs. During the war years,  fathers left home out of duty and loyalty to their country, and their memories were kept alive in a more positive light. Today's fathers, however, are largely absent from the home by choice. When fathers die due to illness or are killed at war their presence still looms over their children. The 1940s child could say: "My father had to leave for a while to do something important." The 1990s child must say: "My father left me permanently because he wanted to." This fatherless crisis did have  negative effects on the family, because many men came home feeling ill-prepared for fatherhood (in some cases the children were born while they were away) and many women had to find work in factories in order to survive. These circumstances sometimes led to tensions in the home, separation, or divorce. But this was only the first tier of problems that brought us to our situation today. The second fatherless crisis is more of "an unorganized dispersal of men for private purposes, regrettable but acceptable."<P>

Blankenhorn gives analysis of several types of fathers as viewed in academia and described by the media: the Deadbeat Dad, the Visiting Father, the Sperm Father, the Stepfather, and the Nearby Guy. Mr. Blankenhorn devotes the most insightful evaluation of the deadbeat dad in the wake of his notorious villain status in society that began in the late 1980s. Yet, as Blankenhorn points out, the deadbeat dad is really a caricature of the traditional male role. Even though he is absent, he is expected to be a provider. However, the new father (the cultural experts' ideal father) repudiates the traditional male role because he is more concerned about being a partner than worrying about monetary gain for his family. The descriptions of the new father and the deadbeat dad, as defined by the scholars and perpetuated in the media, obviously contradict one another. The distinct message coming from the "wanted: deadbeat dads" signs is that absent fathers can still be fathers as long as they write the checks. The deadbeat  dad is essentially the unnecessary father who refuses to pay. And "from the child's perspective, child-support payments, even if fully paid, do not replace a father's economic provision. More fundamentally, they do not replace a father." The necessity to hunt for deadbeat dads is tragic. What is even worse is the fact that we just want their money, not everything else that fatherhood provides for children. The money will allow for some things the children need and places they want to go, but only mothers and fathers can help shape children's character.<P>

 The danger in the status quo is making these lowered standards permanent. Mr. Blankenhorn illustrates that defeatist attempts to solve the problems of single motherhood lack an understanding of the root causes of fatherlessness in this country. The most important aspect of parenthood, "development of competence and character in children," needs to be understood first before any policy is initiated. One parent cannot do that alone: "If fatherhood has anything to say to men, it is that human completion is not a solo act."<P>

Blankenhorn offers a dozen initiatives to help inject the value of fatherhood back into communities. He suggests: the President should give an annual report on the state of fatherhood; communities should ask married fathers play a part in transforming public housing; Congress should pass a resolution stating that the first question of policymakers regarding all domestic legislation is whether it will strengthen or weaken the institution of marriage; well-known professional athletes could be drafted to promote the virtues of fatherhood; and prominent family scholars could write new textbooks for high school students about marriage and parenthood. Blankenhorn admits that his proposals are not answers, but attempts to ask a new question: "Does our society wish to recover the fatherhood idea?" If the answer is no, then proposals like his will go nowhere. But if the answer is yes, then his proposals will at the very least lead us  away from "a culture of fatherlessness" to a culture of fatherhood.<P>

<b>Dirty Tricks or Trump Card: US Covert Action and Counterintelligence</b><br>
 by Roy Godson<br>
National Strategy Information Center, Inc.<P>
Roy Godson, professor of government at Georgetown University, contends that covert operations are the missing element in the discussions about the future of US intelligence. Godson traces the history of US covert action and counterintelligence as well as its successes and failures. This volume suggests that the potential uses of covert action and counterintelligence amid new security challenges have rarely been discussed. Godson states that, although controversial, covert operations can be seen as simply one among many instruments of foreign policy_that they are neither "exceptional tools nor magic bullets." 342 pp. CONTACT: Kelley Beagher, Brassey's, 1313 Dolly Madison Blvd., Suite 401, McLean, VA 22101, 703/442-4535,  fax 703/442-9848.

<b>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</b><br>
 by Joe Cobb<br>
Backgrounder No. 1049, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Joe Cobb, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in economics, notes that the 1996 budget resolution's call for the elimination of the US Department of Commerce is both symbolic of the change in philosophy in Congress and a practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Cobb supports Congress's idea of closing the Department of Commerce, suggesting that the Department is "little more than a collection of disparate programs" which are beyond reinvention. This paper notes that the Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments. Cobb's recommendations include the following: a) close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration; b) consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistical Administration, within a single new independent agency; c) transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration; d) close the domestic offices of the US and Foreign Commercial Service; e) establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation; and f) privatize the National Technical Information Service. Cobb supports allowing the Department, which would be the first in history to be dismantled, three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property. 23 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>How to Privatize Orange County's Airports</b> by Robert W. Poole, Jr.<br>
Policy Study No. 194, Reason Foundation<p>

Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, cites two major problems with Orange County's decision to sell John Wayne Airport: 1) the potential of serious competition from a future airport at El Toro, which might prematurely draw traffic away from John Wayne; and 2) the likelihood of litigation by the airlines who contend that a municipality may not legally make use of the proceeds from the sale of an existing federally aided airport. This study identifies several different types of airport privatization, including contract management, lease, and sale, and outlines the legal status of each with respect to federal grants and constraints. Poole recommends two types of privatization, in a coordinated fashion, to solve Orange County's dilemma_the county should seek a single firm that will enter into two separate agreements: 1) a long-term contract to manage John Wayne airport and 2) a purchase or lease agreement under which the firm will develop a commercial airport at El Toro. The author notes that development of the latter will be closely coordinated with future activities at the former, to ensure the continued financial viability of John Wayne Airport through the years needed to retire its outstanding bonds. 15 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Designing a Comprehensive State-Level Privatization Program: How-To Guide #1</b><br>
 by William D. Eggers<br>
Washington Institute for Policy Studies<P>

William Eggers, director of the Reason Foundation's privatization center, presents this guide as the first in a series of seven  on the topic of state government privatization. Eggers recommends that states develop comprehensive, forward-looking privatization programs rather than adopting piecemeal approaches. This paper offers nine basic steps for designing a systematic, comprehensive program: 1) develop the institutional structure for privatization; 2) set up a program of adjustments and incentives for public employees; 3) identify privatization techniques; 4) identify state services and assets that offer opportunities for privatization; 5) determine the legislative and executive barriers to privatization and revise or rescind these; 6) consider introducing mandatory competitive incentives into the delivery of certain state and local services; 7) evaluate the feasibility of privatizing identified privatization opportunities; 8) determine the potential cost savings from privatizing services and assets selected for privatization; and 9) prepare a plan for implementation. 28 pp. CONTACT: Washington Institute for Policy Studies, 999 Third Ave., Suite 1060, Seattle, WA 98104, 206/467-9561.<P>


<b>A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal Immigration</b><br>
 by John J. Miller and Stephen Moore<br>
Policy Analysis No. 237, Cato Institute<p>

John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, and Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, describe the efforts by some legislators in the House and Senate to create a national computer registration system for all American workers as "Orwellian." Miller and Moore write, "The computer registry and national ID card, which would confer on the federal government vast new police-state powers, is highly incompatible with the Republican theme of expanding freedom and reducing government." This paper cites three major problems with the current proposals: 1) the identification system could be easily expanded to include other purposes beyond deterring illegal immigration, such as implementation of Clinton-style health security card, conducting background checks on individuals, and enforcing affirmative action laws and other government regulations; 2) the system would cost the federal government between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to administer; and 3) error rates that are commonplace for government databases would lead to hundreds of thousands of Americans being denied legal access to the workforce. The authors conclude that a computer registry would impose large costs on American citizens in terms of both dollars and lost liberties. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<b>How to Solve Mandatory Auto Insurance</B><br>
 by John Semmens<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 5, Goldwater Institute<P>

John Semmens, winner of the Goldwater Institute's Reinventing Government competition in 1994, proposes privatizing automobile registration and driver's licenses. In this plan, private insurance companies license drivers and register automobiles, allowing drivers to deal with a single, private agency. Semmens also proposes requiring full insurance for drivers that insurance companies choose to cover, stating that private registration, along with full coverage of drivers, is likely to do a better job of taking irresponsible drivers off the road and make those who cause accidents fully liable for the dollar damage they cause. The author criticizes the current system for allowing underinsured and uninsured motorists to escape liability for much of the damage they cause to others and their property. Semmens contends that uninsured motorists will be easy to identify since they will have no privately issued license tag. 10 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<b>Taxpayer Choice: A Common Sense Solution to the Crisis of the Welfare State</b><br>
 by John C. Goodman<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 4, Goldwater Institute<p>

John Goodman, the 1995 John M. Olin winter fellow at the Goldwater Institute, offers evidence that the only way to reform welfare is to end the federal government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars. In order to combat the perverse incentives inherent to the current welfare programs, Goodman recommends allowing individual taxpayers to give up to 40 percent of their personal income taxes (the amount currently spent on federal welfare programs) to any qualified charity, public or private. According to the author's plan, the government would then be required to subtract a dollar from public welfare programs for every dollar given. 51 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<B>Combatting Illegitimacy and Counseling Teen Abstinence: A Key Component of Welfare Reform</B><BR>
 by Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle<BR>
Backgrounder No. 1051, The Heritage Foundation<p>

Joseph Piccione and Robert Scholle, both former policy analysts in the Office of Population Affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, address the role of soaring illegitimacy rates in America's social fabric. The authors recommend abandoning the pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. Instead the authors support the "abstinence approach," which incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. Piccione and Scholle support a three-pronged approach for young people to avoiding poverty and dependency: complete high-school; get a job, even a low paying one; and have children only within marriage. The authors recommend funding education for such a program with $200 million in block grants to the states through the Maternal and Child Health Services. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>What Welfare Should Be</b><br>
 by Larry P. Arnn and Thomas G. West<br>
California Journal July 1995, The Claremont Institute<p>

Larry Arnn, president of The Claremont Institute, and Thomas West, a senior fellow at The Claremont Institute, posits the question, "What should be the welfare system of California 25 years from now?" The article answers the question with ideas that support family and work, respect for education and marriage, disdain for illegitimacy and compassion for the deserving poor. The authors write, "It [California's welfare system] must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and organizations; in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy. In short, it must be everything the current system is not." 4 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825.<P>

<b>Reforming Medicaid</b><BR>
 by James R. Cantwell<br>
Policy Report No. 197, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>
James Cantwell of the Congressional Budget Office argues that any attempt to balance the budget will be futile without reforming Medicaid. Cantwell presents six steps to achieve Medicaid savings of $185.4 billion over seven years without any reduction in benefits for needy people: 1) changing incentives for recipients through Medical Savings Accounts and/or managed care would produce a $37.2 billion savings in acute care programs and $64 billion in long term care; 2) enforcing estate recovery provisions would produce savings of $35 billion; 3) redirecting and capping disproportionate share hospital payments would produce savings of $13.9 billion; 4) reducing administrative costs would produce a savings of $3.7 billion; 5) making Medicaid the payer of last resort would produce savings of $31.5 billion; and 6) reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through greater state vigilance would produce savings of an unknown but substantial amount. This paper presents statistical evidence and analysis for each of the points, concluding that the savings for seven years would total at least $185.4 billion. 14 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>FDA Censorship Can Be Hazardous to Your Health</b><br>
 by David R. Henderson<br>
Policy Brief No. 158, Center for the Study of American Business<p>

David Henderson, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is censoring valuable information about drugs that could help doctors treat their patients more effectively. Henderson reports that the FDA routinely challenges drug companies that distribute articles from medical journals reporting positive, but not necessarily FDA-approved, uses of their drugs. According to the author, no matter how close the recommended off-label use is to an approved use, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing will stop a drug company from sending out medical journal articles that recommend, or even mention such an application. Henderson notes that 40 to 50 percent of all drugs are prescribed for off-label uses. This paper suggest that this new, expanded role of the FDA is the result of bureaucratic ingenuity, not congressional action, which could result in the loss of life. Henderson endorses eliminating the role of the FDA as a censor for advertising, returning this function to the Federal Trade Commission, which was responsible for this regulation before 1962. 17 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.<P>

<b>Outcome-Based Education: Miracle Cure or Plague?</b><br>
 by Brunno V. Manno<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Hudson Institute<P>
Brunno Manno, a senior fellow in Hudson's education policy studies program, attempts to explain why enormous conflicts over outcome-based education exist, suggesting that the original intent of outcome-based education was productive. Manno maintains that when states began efforts to institute these programs, they turned over the crucial task of defining outcomes over to the very education establishment figures threatened by the process. Having adopted in principle the focus on results (originally intended to be academic results), the educators presented lists of outcomes that emphasized values, attitudes and behavior, and often reflect quasi-political or ideologically correct positions. Dr. Manno shows how this process occurred in various states, then proposes a twofold policy strategy that provides a way out of the dilemma: establish high, uniform academic standards and a system of accountability with real consequences for success and failure; and create greater diversity in the kinds of schools we finance, how we pay for them, and the ways educators provide solid academic achievement, with parents free to choose the schools that best meet their needs. 24 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Teacher, Inc.: A Private-Practice Option for Educators</b><br>
 by Janet R. Beales<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Reason Foundation<P>
Janet Beales, policy analyst with the education studies program of the Reason Foundation, discusses private-practice teacher contracts as an option to schools and communities looking for new ways to provide education. Beales describes private-practice teachers as professional educators who provide their services to schools or other entities, on a contract basis, helping school officials strengthen accountability, cut costs, and increase flexibility. In turn, according to the author, the contract arrangement elevates the professional status of teachers, allowing teachers to take control of their own careers, negotiate their own compensation, and make their own decisions about how to use time, resources and methodologies. This study profiles the experiences of a number of private-practice educators and discusses the benefits that schools may realize by contracting for instruction. In addition, this study presents results from two national surveys about the legal authority of school boards to contract for instruction and also provides a chart to help administrators identify the fully allocated costs of in-house and contract service. 23 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Where the Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School</b><br>
 by Denis P. Doyle<br>
Hudson Briefing Paper No. 181, Hudson Institute<P>

Denis Doyle, president of his own education research organization, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation and formerly associated with the Hudson Institute, asserts that public school teachers and administrators are in a unique position to assess the quality of public education for their own children. Doyle writes, "The data is clear: in the largest urban areas, public school teachers are more likely than the population at large to enroll their children in private schools. By and large it is the poor and dispossessed, particularly in large, troubled urban areas, who are forced into the nation's public schools. But these schools are so unattractive that the teachers pay significant sums of money to send their children elsewhere. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>The Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195): Key Changes Will Improve Potential for Serious Agriculture Reform</b><br>
by John Frydenlund<br>
Issue Bulletin No. 211, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project, praises the Freedom to Farm Act as a good first step toward reforming agricultural policy. Frydenlund points out that the bill accomplishes several significant goals: replacing traditional payments for commodity programs with transition payments that decline over a period of seven years; eliminating supply controls; and extricating the federal bureaucracy from the decision-making process of planting requirements. Frydenlund, however, makes several recommendations to strengthen the Act and to dramatically reform the current system:1) specify an exact date when programs will end, preferably no later that the year 2001, by deauthorizing current law; 2) prevent transition payments from becoming an unjustified windfall by specifying a trigger or price level for each commodity that would reduce or eliminate transition payments for a given year; and 3) eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program or at least drastically reduce the number of acres in the program. He suggests two methods for assuring that reforms embodied in the Freedom to Farm Act and other proposals are not circumvented: cap annual Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) spending at levels provided in the budget resolution and reduce CCC borrowing authority from $30 billion to $15 billion. Frydenlund forecasts that these changes will greatly improve and provide long-term reform for the agricultural system in America. 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>A Contract with Rural America</b><br>
by Dennis T. Avery and Dave Juday<br>
Hudson Briefing Paper No. 182, Hudson Institute
<P>
Dennis Avery, director of Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, and Dave Juday, an agricultural businessman, observe that increasing budget restraints no longer allow Washington to hand prosperity to America's farmers by way of farm subsidies. The authors write, "Changes in US agricultural tax, trade, and regulatory policies could enhance the nation's rural prosperity quickly, not only for farmers but for off-farm rural residents who have too often been driven from their communities by cropland setasides." In order to correct the problems created by current agricultural policies, the authors  suggest that Congress broaden the focus of farm policy by passing an eleven point Contract with Rural America. The eleven points would focus on regulatory and tax relief and expanded trade opportunities. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

Donald Leal, senior associate at PERC, suggests that the Forest Service could save money by following policies similar to those those that govern the operation of county and state forests. Leal presents the findings from his studies of the economic and environmental performance of county and state foresters in Minnesota and Montana compared with that of Forest Service lands in the same region. Leal made comparisons between Superior National Forest and the St. Louis County forestlands and found that the county made more than $2 million from timber sales while Superior lost over $5 million on timber sales.

<b>Cleaning Up Superfund: The Case for State Environmental Leadership</b><br>
by J. Winston Porter<br>
Policy Study No. 195, Reason Foundation
<P>

Winston Porter, president of the Waste Policy Center, describes the Superfund program as one of the nation's most visible site remediation programs. Since the inception of Superfund in 1980, the program has received many criticisms, especially given that only 150 of the 1,300 designated sites have been cleaned in 15 years. According to the author, an undeservedly large portion of the funds have been used for legal proceedings. Porter examines an alternative approach to Superfund; the author recommends allowing the states to deal with the sites_at a fraction of the time and costs. Currently states are spending about $700 million annually working on about 11,000 sites, while the EPA spends approximately $1 billion annually dealing with about 1,000 sites. In this study, the author briefly reviews Superfund and the similar programs of the states; presents how-to steps to turn much of Superfund over to willing and able states; and recommends methods of state certification, funding provisions, EPA's continued role, and modification of the Superfund statute. 14 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Superfund Unplugged</b><br>
by Wayne T. Brough<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Wayne T. Brough, director of research for Citizens for a Sound Economy, contends that the Superfund program_created in the wake of public concerns over toxic wastes at Love Canal_imposes billions of dollars in costs on consumers and local communities while providing few benefits in return. Brough suggests that the program's liability rules delay the clean-up process and impose inequitable costs on businesses and communities. Brough states, "The Superfund program requires fundamental reforms that implement sound risk management practices and a more cost-effective allocation of resources. At the same time, liability rules should be changed to eliminate perverse incentives that divert resources from environmental cleanups." This paper outlines the basics of Superfund reform as follows: allow states to play a greater role; privatize as many sites as possible; repeal retroactive liability; reform joint and several liability; institute no new taxes for Superfund; utilize risk based management and sound science; and create new mechanisms of public finance. 19 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

<b>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory Reform</b><br>
by Kent Jeffreys<br>
Policy Report No. 194, National Center for Policy Analysis
<P>

Kent Jeffreys, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, argues that the solution for current environmental problems requires the government to act in accordance with certain pre-defined rules before enacting environmental legislation or approving any environmental regulations. The author suggests the following guidelines: 1) The Federalism Rule, which would require that all regulatory decisions be made by the smallest possible government entity; 2) The Cost-Benefit Rule, which requires that objective studies weigh the benefits against the costs of new regulations; and 3) The Compensation Rule, which requires the government to compensate innocent property owners for the loss of property rights or non-negligible losses of value. This study examines abuses of the three rules cited above in specific federal environmental programs and explores solutions that would bring the programs into compliance with the rules. 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Making Government Work: How Congress Can Really Reinvent Government</b><br> by Donald J. Devine<br>
Backgrounder No. 1050, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Donald Devine, former director of the US Office of Personnel Management and adjunct scholar at Heritage, recommends that the federal government should "return to the pre-Carter system of decentralized authority." Devine describes several problems with the administration's current proposals to reinvent government, writing that the plan: will weaken policies on hiring, promoting, and rewarding federal employees based on individual merit and performance; will eliminate presidential standards for job performance; will enhance federal agency and union control over setting salary levels; will weaken long-standing "veterans preference" standards; and will create a new role for federal unions that would undermine management authority for defining and assigning work. Devine makes specific recommendations for defining government's proper functions: devolve power to the states; define agency missions; privatize government functions; protect the merit system; establish responsibility; clarify rules; re-establish merit selection; make the hiring process rational; re-establish pay for performance; rationalize federal benefits; end duplication stop Clinton's devaluation of management responsibility; and consolidate the management of federal resources. 18 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences</B><br> by Bradley A. Smith<br>
Policy Analysis No. 238, Cato Institute<P>

Bradley Smith, assistant professor at Capital University Law School in Ohio, acknowledges that while efforts to limit political contributions and spending are extremely popular, no evidence exists that campaign finance regulation has achieved or will achieve its goals of reducing the influence of money, opening up the political system, and lowering the costs of campaigns. The author maintains that efforts to limit contributions and spending have been based on two faulty assumptions: that candidates spend too much per vote (total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible voter every two years) and that large donations are undemocratic (most challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements have been financed by wealthy donors). Smith argues that, "Our current campaign finance regulations favor incumbents, stifle grassroots activity, distort and constrict political debate, and infringe on traditional First Amendment freedoms. There is little reason to believe that still more regulation and public funding will yield positive results." 26 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

Danielle Fagre, research director of the US Term Limits Foundation, questions why municipal term limits are the least documented, yet most prevalent component of the term limit movement. The author uses municipal term limits, which date back to 1851, as an example of the longevity of the term limit movement, despite opponents claims that the movement is a fad. This paper examines the municipal term limits in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City, New Orleans, Denver, Cincinnati and suggests that these local limits are a microcosm of the national term limit movement. 16 pp. CONTACT: U.S. Term Limit Foundation, 1511 K St., NW, Suite 540, Washington, DC 20005, 800/733-6440, fax 202/393-6434.

<B>Only A Piece of Paper?: The Social Significance of the Marriage License and The Consequences of Cohabitation, Divorce and Stepfamilies</b><br> by Glenn T. Stanton<br>
Focus on the Family<P>

Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst for the public policy division of Focus on the Family, presents a compilation of statistical data, gathered since the 12th century, which reveals that marriage matters in the lives of children, adults, and societies. The results consistently show that marriage improves the physical and mental health as well as the  longevity of men and women. On the whole, this data shows that married people do better in every measure of specific and general well-being than their unmarried counterparts. The research reveals information about the benefits of marriage, the disadvantages of cohabitation, and the effects of remarriage and stepfamilies. Stanton concludes that, based on the statistical evidence, it is critical to rediscover a cultural norm for family life in America and hold it up as an ideal. Stanton writes, "The ideal should be the traditional two-parent family where mother and father strive for a healthy marriage and both participate in the daily care and nurturing of their biological or adopted children." 36 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400.<p>

<b>Multiculturalism and Economic Growth</b><br> by Gerald W. Scully<br>
Policy Report No. 196, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>

Gerald Scully, senior fellow of the National Center for Policy Analysis, contradicts conventional wisdom by acknowledging that the work of most anthropologists identifies cultural diversity as a universal source of social conflict and often as a barrier to economic progress as well as personal freedom. Scully finds that cultural relativism has made the study of the role of culture in human progress controversial, but he points out that intergroup enmity is widespread in culturally heterogeneous societies. This study shows that cultural diversity and a lack of economic freedom go hand in hand. Scully writes, "For all its problems, the West has managed cultural conflict better than the rest of the world because it has free economic, civil and political institutions...despite this success, we are moving away from the notion of individual freedom to that of group rights in the United States." Based on his study of cultural conflict and economic progress, Scully recommends that the Third World move towards freer economic institutions and a reduction of cultural heterogeneity to transform its economic progress. 19 pp., CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

The September issue of National Minority Politics offers its readers a series of articles by Gwen Richardson, Stanley Crouch, and Gary Bauer on how Hollywood portrays blacks, families, and Christians. Richardson cites the bias with which Hollywood portrays blacks, usually as crooks, pimps, informers, or persons needing assistance from the government. Furthermore, an examination of attempts to discredit the family finds that Hollywood usually puts a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect, and anti-Christian bigotry. Stanley Crouch examines the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the early 1900s to the present.

<h3>Defenders of Property Rights</h3>

<B>Defenders Moves Forward with an Aggressive Litigation Program</B><P>

Defenders has been engaged by the United Property Owners of Washington (UPOW) to serve as co-counsel in the case of United States v. Washington. At issue is an 1850s treaty between the then-territorial governor and sixteen Indian tribes regarding the harvesting of shellfish. Even though most of the tideland area of Washington is privately owned (it is one of only a few states with such private ownership) and has been tended and enhanced over the years by its owners, the tribes and the federal government believe that certain Indian tribes share the right to harvest the shellfish. In an interim order, a federal district judge awarded the tribes the ability to take half the harvest. The tribes and the government, however, are seeking a larger take of the shellfish and full access to the tidelands. UPOW has intervened in the hope of protecting their right of "exclusive possession and clear title" to their property.<P>

<b>Defenders Fights Charge of Hunter Harassment</B><P>

Defenders has also filed a complaint in a state court in Minnesota seeking just compensation on behalf of a property owner. In James F. Peternell v. State of Minnesota, the private property owner was criminally prosecuted for attempting to exclude state officials from his property. Mr. Peternell bought 160 acres of land in 1972, 140 of which are considered wetland. A 1984 state law designated the wetland area as a "protected water basin," making it "public waters." Although he had previously been told by the Department of Natural Resources that his land was still privately-owned, he was later indicted on charges of "hunter harassment" when he tried to remove uninvited hunters--including an undercover DNR official--from his land. While the criminal charges against Mr. Peternell were dismissed by a jury, a court did find that his land can now be considered public domain under the 1984 law.<P>

<B>Defenders Supports Rights of Hog Farmer</B><P>

In City of Chesapeake v. Earl Warren, Defenders represents a hog farmer in Virginia. The city officials have now decided that his hog farm constitutes a "public nuisance", even though his land has been used for over 120 years and he follows sound industry practices on his farm. At stake in this case is the extent to which local governments can characterize historically typical and productive uses of land as a "nuisance" (as the city has in this case by passage of an ordinance directed at his activities) and thereby destroy that use of land without incurring the constitutional duty to pay the owner just compensation for that taking. On September 8, 1995, the court rejected the government's request for a permanent injunction that would have shut down the hog farm and instead offered to work with the property owner in an attempt to remedy the situation short of closing down the farm. Another hearing has been set for December 7, 1995.<P>

<B>Defenders Challenges Gas Company</B><P>

In Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation v. Deana Wingfield Drain, Defenders is challenging in federal court the utility company's practice of unilaterally expanding its right-of-way from 8 inches to 50 feet without compensating property owners for that taking. In this case, Columbia Gas forced the property owners to move their mobile home and shed (both of which were anchored to cement foundations) out of the newly-claimed right-of-way, at their own expense. Moreover, the enforcement of the right-of-way has been selective; in fact, one home actually sits atop the gas line but those home owners have not been asked to move the house. Discovery is underway in the case.
On September 20, 1995, Defenders will be filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the court to review the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court. At issue in the case, United Employer Benefit Corporation v. Department of Insurance and Finance (Oregon), is whether personal property is protected to the same degree as is land against uncompensated takings and also whether threats which have the effect of destroying an ongoing business trigger the duty of government to pay for the taking.
Defenders will also file a brief on behalf of itself and other co-amici curiae in the case of Stubblefield v. City of Sand Bernardino on September 20, 1995, in the United States Supreme Court. At issue in this case is whether government actions which were clearly arbitrary and designed to target a small developers project violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

<h3>Institute for Justice</H3>

<B>Runstrom, et al. V. City of Kalamazoo</B><P>

On September 7, 1995, the Institute filed a constitutional challenge to the City of Kalamazoo's housing inspection law that allows government inspectors to enter apartments without tenant consent or a validly-executed search warrant. The Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit on behalf of 13 Kalamazoo apartment tenants. The case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice when landlord Jerry Speedy was brought up on criminal charges for refusing to provide access to rented apartments unless the tenants consented to the building code inspections.
The constitutional rule that the Institute for Justice seeks to establish in this lawsuit is: If government inspectors wish to enter tenants' homes, they must ask for and receive their explicit consent. If the tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable suspicion (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.<P>

<B>Teen Challenge of San Antonio Wins Battle Against Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)</B><P>

The Institute represents Teen Challenge of San Antonio, in its effort to continue its faith-based drug and alcohol treatment program, which was threatened with the secular requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse licensing requirements.
Teen Challenge, a thirty-five year old program with an excellent track record of success, believes the key to solving chemical dependency problems lies in the spiritual dimension of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It accepts no government funding for treatment and all participants come to this program voluntarily.
TCADA views addiction as a disease of the body that can be treated, but never cured. TCADA's secularized, disease-based model for addiction and treatment--and the regulations that implement this model--did not allow Teen Challenge to carry out its salvation, Christ-centered model of treatment. Based on this incompatibility, Teen Challenge objected to being forced to meet the licensing and regulatory requirements of TCADA. The Institute for Justice, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is providing legal representation to Teen Challenge in ongoing negotiations with Texas and is prepared for litigation if necessary.<P>

<B>Battle for Expanded Choice Continues in Milwaukee</B><P>

Despite substantial disruption as a result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's injunction of the recently expanded school choice program, most students have received privately funded scholarships through Parents Acquiring Values in Education (PAVE) to allow them to enroll in their chosen private schools. This resulted from the generous contributions made by caring individuals, parents, schools, and the business and philanthropic communities.
Over the next month, the lawyers in this case will meet to determine whether there are factual issues in dispute. Assuming the Wisconsin Supreme Court does not remand the case to the trial court, the Court could (a) rule in favor of the IJ on all issues, (b) rule against the IJ, but decide that the religion clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution are the same as the First Amendment, (c) rule against the IJ, finding that the Wisconsin Constitution is more restrictive than the First Amendment, (d) rule against the IJ on the other grounds under the Wisconsin Constitution. Under the first two scenarios, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would be possible, but an appeal would be precluded under the third and fourth scenarios. The Institute was granted intervenor status on behalf of Parents for School Choice and eight individual families, and will continue to play an active role throughout the litigation.

<B>Boston Taxi Medallion Fight Returns to State Court</B><P>

Nine years after beginning a seemingly quixotic struggle to drive his own taxi in Boston and four years after his precedent-setting victory in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Robert Lynch, represented by NELF, has returned to the Massachusetts courts in order to try to reap the fruits of his struggle.
Robert Lynch is a partially disable man who has supported himself for years by driving taxi cabs in Boston. Ten years ago, he tried to acquire a taxi "medallion", the legal right to operate his own cab, rather than just drive cabs owned by others. Since World War II, the number of Boston medallions had been fixed at 1525 and their price had risen over $50,000, far in excess of his resources. The resulting shortage of taxis led to higher fares and reduced taxi availability, particularly in minority and low income areas which are more dependent upon taxi service than other parts of the city.
Mr. Lynch went to the public library and found a 1934 law, never before use, which gave a state agency the power to require Boston to issue new medallions and he appealed to the agency. In 1990, it ordered Boston to issue hundreds of new medallions "immediately." The order was appealed by taxi owners to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court, but Mr. Lynch, represented by NELF, prevailed in 1991.
Since then, NELF and Mr. Lynch have negotiated with Boston in an effort establish reasonable ground rules for issuance of the 300 new medallions called for by the agency's order on remand. Gradually, Boston hardened its position and finally decided that it could legally ignore the state agency order.
NELF has now filed a mandamus action on Mr. Lynch's behalf. While Mr. Lynch concedes that Boston has the right to establish reasonable rules as to who shall be permitted to operate taxis in the city, it cannot simply flout its legal obligation to issue new medallions. Issuing the new medallions is not only required to comply with the city's legal duty but also it will begin the opening of a rigid and inefficient system to competition and free enterprise, which will benefit the taxi-using public.<P>

<b>NELF Supports High-Tech Manufacturer</b><P>

The New England Legal Foundation has filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, supporting Houghton-Mifflin Company's effort to retain its status as a "manufacturing" company for purposes of state tax law. The basic issue in the case is whether a state should use its tax law to encourage or discourage a business' effort to move away from traditional labor intensive "manufacturing" in the direction of more modern high-technology, knowledge-intensive operations.
For over thirty years, Massachusetts has classified Houghton-Mifflin Corporation, a nationally-known book publisher, as a "manufacturing corporation," which entitles it to a tax credit for new equipment purchases and other tax benefits. In 1991, the state Department of Revenue notified Houghton-Mifflin that this classification had been revoked, retroactive to 1986. The basis for that action was that Houghton-Mifflin no longer printed its textbooks in the state, having shifted that aspect of its business to independent contractors while retaining in Massachusetts its more intellectual activities including writing, editing, preparing art work, designing and preparing computer materials and compact discs.
Houghton-Mifflin appealed the Department's action. The state Appellate Tax Board ruled in Houghton-Mifflin's favor, holding that its operations in Massachusetts continued to meet the state's statutory tests for constituting "manufacturing" as well as the Department's own regulations on that subject. The Department appealed to Massachusetts' highest court, arguing that, as a matter of law, Houghton-Mifflin's operations could not constitute manufacturing.
NELF's amicus brief argued that the Board had been correct. When the legislature originally amended the state's tax laws to encourage "manufacturing", it had n o intention of binding business into a straightjacket irrevocably tied to then-current technology. Rather, its obvious goal was to use the tax laws creatively to encourage businesses to take actions that would benefit the wider community. In today's economy, Houghton-Mifflin's actions in shifting its operations in the direction of cleaner, high wage, high technology jobs are precisely the sort of positive transformation that Massachusetts should be encouraging.

<B>Bureaucratic Land Grab Averted</b><P>

State of California ex rel. State Lands Commission v. Superior Court (Lovelace). In a key victory for property rights, the California Supreme Court agreed with Pacific Legal Foundation arguments and thwarted a major land grab by the State Lands Commission. As a result, the private ownership, use, and enjoyment of properties along the banks of rivers, streams, or lake shores in the state have been preserved.
In California, as in all other states, new land that is formed by slow accretion to a shoreline or riverbank becomes the private property of the adjacent upland owner. Accretion is the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes. This process can occur either by the washing up of sand or soil from a body of water, such as the sea or a river, or by the gradual subsidence of water which leaves land uncovered. Thus, if a river gradually shifts its course by the accumulations of silt, sand, grave, and other sediment, and land is created where there was once only river bottom, the owner of the adjacent upland gains title to the newly formed land.
During the mid to late 1800s, hydraulic mining both enriched the economy of the state and wreaked havoc on the downstream reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watershed by depositing vast amounts of gravel, sand, and silt into the waterways. As this material worked its way downstream, it was deposited in the slower reaches of these waterways causing the river bottoms to gradually rise by many feet, creating dry land where there once was river bottom.
Richard Lovelace owns property which includes a 12-acre parcel that was created by accretion when the river bottom rose between 12 and 15 feet during the heyday of California's hydraulic gold mining era. The State Lands Commission tried to snatch that property from Mr. Lovelace on the theory that the accretion was the result of "artificial" rather than natural causes.
The California Supreme Court agreed with PLF's arguments and held that title to land formed in the last century as a partial result of the sediment washed downstream by hydraulic mining would be determined according to the rule of accretion. That is, if it was deposited slowly and imperceptibly over time, title would inure to the adjacent upland riparian owner onto whose land the accretion occurs. Had the state bureaucracy gotten its way, the settled status of thousand of acres in California would have been destroyed.<P>

<b>Defending Voters' Right to Cut Back Government Spending</b><P>

Atiyeh v. Oregon. In this case, PLF is defending Ballot Measure 8, enacted by Oregon voters to roll back lavish pension plans for state workers.
Oregon law has long required that public employees contribute 6% of their gross pay toward their retirement pension plan. However, in 1979, the state Legislature enacted a Pension Pick-Up Law requiring the government employer (i.e., the taxpayers) to "pick up" the 6% tab. Thus, since 1979 most Oregon government workers have not actually contributed to their annual pension premiums, although "on paper" they have been credited with making a 6% contribution! Under the Pension Pick-Up Law, Oregon taxpayers not only bear the full pension cost for public employees, but also guarantee a minimum 8% return on pension investments. In addition, pension benefits can be increased by unused sick leave.
Recognizing that this generous pension plan was not akin to most private sector pension plans, Oregon voters enacted Ballot Measure 8. A major objective of this initiative is to reverse the 1979 Pick-Up Law by amending the Oregon Constitution to require public employees to contribute 6% of their salary toward their pension plan. To ensure that taxpayers no longer pick up the 6% tab, Measure 8 prohibits government employers from contracting to relieve public employees of their contribution duty or to increase their salaries or benefits as an offset. Among other restrictions, Measure 8 also bars government contracts from guaranteeing the interest rate on public pensions funds.
The Pacific Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief in the Oregon Supreme Court opposing a lawsuit seeking to block Ballot Measure 8. The suit does not challenge the substance of the measure, but the legality of the whole initiative process as applied to Measure 8.

<h3>Washington Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Michigan Supported in Motor Voter Litigation</B><P>

Joined by three Members of the Michigan delegation to Congress (Representatives Richard R. Chrysler, Nick Smith, and Fred Upton), the Washington Legal Foundation filed an amici curiae brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in support of Michigan's position in ACORN v. Miller, a suit brought to force the state to carry out the unfunded mandates in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the "motor voter" law). WLF argued that the Act is not within the power of Congress to determine the "Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives." Among other mandates, the Act requires a state to offer assistance in completing a voter registration form to all clientele visiting welfare and unemployment agencies. <P>

<b>Supreme Court Urged To Limit Abusive Class Action Suits</B><P>

In a brief filed in the Supreme Court in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, WLF argued that a corporation should not have to defend against more than one class action suit based on alleged violations of securities law where the different lawsuits arise from the same transaction. When a corporation settles with one group of plaintiffs who purport to represent shareholders, another group of plaintiffs should not be permitted to extort additional settlement funds by claiming to represent the same shareholders, WLF argued.<P>

<b>Limits On Judicial Campaign Contributions Proposed</B><P>
WLF filed a petition with California Bar authorities recommending that trial lawyers be prohibited from making judicial campaign contributions. Studies cited by WLF show that in California and elsewhere, plaintiffs' trial lawyers have contributed enormous amounts to judges before whom they practice, creating the impression that justice can be bought. Fifteen top California trial lawyers gave almost $1 million to candidates for judicial office.<P>

<B>FDA Requested To Ease Rules on Direct-to-Consumer Ads</B><P>
A citizen petition filed by WLF with the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to adopt a policy recognizing that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs can play a helpful role in providing consumers with truthful information about prescription drugs and also recognizing that truthful, non-misleading advertising of prescription drugs receives significant protection under the First Amendment. WLF recommended that the agency replace its current case-by-case review of such advertising with rules setting out "a very limited, very clearly-defined" set of improper advertising practices, giving manufacturers fair notice of what advertising is impermissible.
