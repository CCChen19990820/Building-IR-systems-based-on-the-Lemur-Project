<P>
<P>We have settled our reverse discrimination lawsuit on behalf of &quot;Michelle Doe,&quot; a 14-year-old girl from 
Corpus Christi.  As reported, Michelle applied to an environmental study program called &quot;Planet Earth,&quot; a summer study 
camp financed in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and administered by a University Outreach Program 
sponsored by Texas A &amp; M University.  Being Caucasian, Michelle was denied admission because the NSF's funding 
guidelines specified that Planet Earth was to be reserved for selected minorities.
<P>
<P>The defendants have agreed to settle the case for $20,000 in damages and fees.  They have also promised not 
to discriminate in the future.  The feds will take steps to ensure that summer science camps that discriminate on the basis 
of race, sex etc. will no longer receive NSF funding.  Until 1999, the NSF will submit its program brochures to CIR 
for inspection and compliance review. 
<P>
<P>If this case serves as a precedent, we'll soon oversee the entire federal government:  a slew of departments 
and agencies, from Defense to Energy to Agriculture to the EPA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), still 
fund minorities only programs. 
<P>
<P>How do we know this?  Why, having been denied admission to Planet Earth, Michelle cast about for another 
summer program and stumbled upon a nifty six-week science apprenticeship program for high school students.  Run, like 
Planet Earth, by Texas A &amp; M, the program involves lab work in biochemistry.  It pays room and board scholarships, as well as 
a stipend.  The apprenticeship program is partially funded by the USDA and NIH.
<P>     
<P>This time around, Michelle was told she shouldn't even bother to apply:  the summer apprenticeship program 
is reserved for applicants who can identify themselves as Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or 
Pacific Islander/Asian. We're cloning our first 
<I>Doe</I> complaint as we speak.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, in Delaware, the United States Department of Justice is participating in the so-called Redding 
Fellowship, a summer clerkship program for first-year law students.  Run by the Delaware Bar Association, the program 
pays participants $600 per week for eleven weeks of work with various state and federal agencies and private law firms, plus 
a $2,000 payment upon successful completion.  Eligibility for the program is limited to members of selected minorities.  
<P>
<P>The program's namesake, Louis L. Redding, is familiar with such restrictions:  the first black (and highly 
distinguished) member of the Delaware Bar, he was the plaintiff's counsel in 
<I>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority</I>, an 
important 1961 civil rights case in which the Supreme Court ruled against the race-based exclusion of black customers from 
lunch counters.  As far as we're concerned, these games don't cease to be odious when they're being played 35 years later and 
in reverse.
<P>
<P>Yes, the Delaware Bar once discriminated against Blacks.  But this nefarious past fails to explain how Asians 
and Hispanics made it into the Redding program; why the program is targeted at law students who are not from Delaware; 
and why the feds think they can participate in a program that's plainly unlawful.  The Redding program doesn't even pretend 
to interest minority youngsters in the practice of law.  At best, it's an attempt to induce minorities to practice law in 
Delaware rather than someplace else; at worst, it's PC on autopilot.
<P> 
<P>We are challenging the program on behalf of three unsuccessful Caucasian applicants.  Something tells us the 
case won't go to trial.

<H3>INTERNAL AFFAIRS</H3></center>
<P>CIR's merry band of warriors increased in strength and numbers.  On April 1, 
<B>Hans Bader</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '94), joined CIR as Associate Counsel and third full-time litigator.  
<B>Kipp Coddington</B>, formerly of the firm of Ropes &amp; Gray, is CIR's new Counsel and Director of Communications; he will assume his new position on May 1.
<P>
<P>In December 1995, <B>Seung Baik</B> finished his internship with CIR, under the auspices of Cornell University's 
Washington program.  In January, <B>Curt Levey</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '98) spent a one-month, Harvard-paid 
clerkship with CIR.    <B>Robert Alt</B>, a student in political science at Azusa Pacific University, has been spending part of 
his Semester-in-Washington as a research assistant with Judge Robert Bork and is now with CIR.
<P>
<P>Over the summer, we'll be joined by <B>John 
Sheahan</B> (Chicago Law School) and by <B>Howard 
Nielson</B> (Chicago Law School).  Mr. Nielson's clerkship will be paid by the firm of 
<B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson</B>, whose generous support we 
gratefully acknowledge.
<p>
<B>GOTCHA</B>
<P><I>The Center for Individual Rights, which just won a reverse discrimination case against OSU, was described in 
the</I> Columbus Dispatch <I>as a &quot;nonprofit group that provides free legal assistance in free-speech and civil rights cases.&quot;  
Actually, it is a law firm dedicated to dismantling affirmative action, civil rights, and sexual harassment laws as well as 
attacking what they perceive as &quot;political correctness.&quot;  CIR's slogan is &quot;Better Living Through Lawsuits.&quot;
<P>
<P>Columbus Guardian</I>, March 28, 1996


<P><P><B>IN OTHER CASES</B>
<P>
<P>Ron Reisner's reverse discrimination lawsuit against John Jay College is proceeding apace.  The case arises 
over John Jay's repeated failure to appoint Reisner to a tenure-track faculty position, despite his excellent credentials 
and equally excellent faculty evaluations.  Memos and other materials obtained through discovery show that John 
Jay refused to hire Reisner because he isn't diverse but Caucasian.  The College administration viewed the faculty's 
painstaking search and evaluation process, under whose rules Reisner should and would have been hired, as a charade 
to disguise a minorities-only hiring policy.  The process was 
<I>supposed</I> to be a joke, and Reisner was supposed to be 
the clown in the diversity circus.  We predict he'll have the last laugh.
<P>
<P>CIR star litigator Michael Rosman schlepped to California on our First Amendment lawsuit on behalf of 
three Berkeley residents who were &quot;investigated&quot; for almost a full year by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.  Our clients ran a neighborhood association to oppose, through constitutionally protected speaking and 
petitioning, the conversion of a local motel for use by homeless, severely dysfunctional residents.  So HUD went 
after them, on the theory that peaceful opposition to HUD-favored housing projects violates the Fair Housing Act.  
HUD demanded our clients' membership lists, copies of newspaper articles and letters, and transcripts of public meetings.  
<P>
<P>In a January 5 decision, U.S. District Judge Patel denied the defendants' motion to dismiss our damage 
claims, calling HUD's argument that <I>no</I> investigation could run afoul of the First Amendment &quot;striking in its audacity.&quot;  
Mr. Rosman, on his West Coast trip, presented our clients' demand for injunctive relief, which is 
<I>sub judice</I>.  
<HR>
<P>In a long-running dispute, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, affectionately known as &quot;FAM 
YOU,&quot; disciplined assistant professor and CIR client Gerald Gee for a single controversial remark in his Public 
Relations class.  (The remark contained a racial epithet, but was in no way calculated to insult.)  When six students 
complained, characterizing the remark as &quot;derogatory,&quot; &quot;unethical,&quot; and &quot;most importantly, inappropriate,&quot; FAMU declared 
Gee guilty of &quot;racial harassment&quot; and imposed a two-week suspension.  After a court hearing on our motion for a 
preliminary injunction, FAMU agreed to revoke what remained of Gee's suspension.  We have filed for partial 
summary judgment.

<CENTER>
<B>By Harry V. Jaffa</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In their convention acceptance speeches, both Bob Dole and Jack Kemp declared that the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln. But just what is the connection between the Republican Party of 1860 and that of 1996?

<p>

The essence of slavery, Lincoln said, was expressed in the proposition &quot;You work; I'll eat.&quot; Upon his election as president, he was besieged by office seekers who drove him to distraction. Lincoln was blunt in his judgment of the great majority of them: They wanted to eat without working. Lincoln saw the demand for the protection of slavery and the demand for government sinecures to be at bottom one and the same. The origin of all constitutional rights, according to Lincoln, was the right that a man had to own himself, and therefore to own the product of his own labor. Government exists to protect that right, and to regulate property only to make it more valuable to its possessors. 

<p>
Today, the pro-slavery impulse still governs the Democratic Party, the party of government sinecures. It is the party that wants to use political power to tax us not for any common good, but to eat while we work. Consider the Great Society and its legacy.

<p>
In the fall of 1964, I was on the speech-writing staff of the Goldwater campaign. In September and October I went on a number of forays to college campuses, where I debated spokesmen for our opponents. My argument always started from here: In 1964 the economy--thanks to the Kennedy tax cuts--was growing at the remarkable annual rate of four percent. But federal revenues were growing at 20 percent: five times as fast. 

<p>
The real issue in the election, I said, was what was to happen to that cornucopia of revenue. Barry Goldwater would use it to reduce the deficit and to further reduce taxes; Lyndon Johnson would use it to start vast new federal programs. At that point I could not say what programs, but I knew that the real purpose of them would be to create a new class of dependents upon the Democratic Party. The ink was hardly dry on the election returns before Johnson invented the war on poverty--and proved my prediction correct.

<p>
One did not need to be cynical to see that the poor were not a reason for the expansion of bureaucracy; the expansion of bureaucracy was a reason for the poor. Every failure to reduce poverty was always represented as another reason to increase expenditures on the poor. The ultimate beneficiary was the Democratic Party. Every federal bureaucrat became in effect a precinct captain, delivering the votes of his constituents. His job was to enlarge the pool of constituents. But every increase in that pool meant a diminution of our property and our freedom.

<p>
The recently passed law to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; came about because a lethargic public has been aroused at last, not by the failure of the welfare system but by its success. The public indignation, however, would have been of no effect had we not elected a Republican Congress. No Democratic Congress would ever have passed such a law.

<p>
Just as welfare reform may help end the poverty industry, the California Civil Rights Initiative on the November ballot may lead to the demise of another 1960s product, the racism and sexism industry. The 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination based upon race, sex, color, religion or ethnic origin. The act was based on the premise that the only race to which a person must belong is the human race. With respect to God-given natural rights, &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;

<p>
The civil rights establishment, led by the NAACP, fought the good fight that led to the <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> decision in 1954 and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. They fought that fight under the banner of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which reflected the equality proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.

<p>
The classic statement of this principle is to be found in Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissenting opinion in <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous 1896 decision that enshrined "separate but equal" into constitutional law for more than half a century: &quot;In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;

<p>
Everyone knows that Hubert Humphrey, one of the chief authors and sponsors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, had declared that under Title VII no discrimination on the basis of race or color was to be lawful. He explicitly said that this meant no discrimination of white against black, and no discrimination of black against white.

<p>
Suddenly, however, remedies for something called &quot;racism&quot; became the order of the day. (The word itself--like &quot;sexism&quot;--is of recent coinage and will not be found in any older dictionaries.) The civil rights movement, premised upon individual rights, suddenly became the black power movement, premised upon group rights. &quot;Affirmative action&quot; became a euphemism for the baldest kind of racial discrimination. That whites had long enjoyed preference over blacks was now taken to be a justification for blacks having preference over whites. What was lost sight of was that the evil of the past--whether of slavery or of Jim Crow--was evil not because it was done by whites to blacks, but because it was done by some human beings to other human beings. The purpose of the law was to end evil acts, not continue them in the guise of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;

<p>
Affirmative action, rightly understood, would justify a wide variety of outreach programs for those whose lives have been stultified by poverty, broken families, bad schools, and neighborhoods filled with drugs, crime and gangs. One can heartily commend a program for tutoring young blacks, or young whites, who had never had a genuine teacher in a real classroom. One cannot, however, commend a program of raising the grades of young blacks--but not young whites--without having raised their skills. And what possible justification can there be there for giving scholarship assistance to the child of a black middle-class family, while denying it to a poor white? Can one imagine a more crass disregard for the genuine meaning of the Equal Protection Clause?

<p>
The priests of this new religion of &quot;affirmative action&quot; are not without material interests. Hundreds of millions of corporate dollars are spent annually on &quot;sensitivity training.&quot; Within the universities, centers for black, brown and women's (i.e., feminist) studies are being established, with vast amount of patronage bestowed upon them. Traditional courses in Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare and the Bible continue to appear in the catalogs, but they are increasingly taught by &quot;deconstructionists,&quot; who have no interest in the texts, but only in subjective reactions to the texts.

<p>
Abraham Lincoln was self-educated. His curriculum included Shakespeare, the Bible, Euclid and the Declaration of Independence--the monuments to the freedom of the human soul, the possession not of Western man, but of a humanity compounded of all colors and every condition. In Independence Hall on Feb. 22, 1861, Lincoln asked what it was, above all else, that went forth to the world on July 4, 1776. It was not, he said, the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland; but something in that Declaration giving hope to the world for all future time. The Declaration gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all would have an equal chance. These are the principles upon which the Republican Party must stand, in 1996 no less than in 1860.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A TALE OF TWO BUDGETS</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>





"[The Governor] was aided in his [budget] by the strength of California's economy, which gave him more new money to distribute than he had a year ago," reported one major newspaper.  Education was a big winner, said the state Finance Director, simply reflecting "that the budget is roomier this year…and that the Governor will devote more money to education whenever he can." There were expressions of bi-partisan support, with the Senate Democratic leader calling the budget "relatively generous in terms of funding for the status quo."<P>
Again of the state budget, a major newspaper said, "[it is] a big-spending document made possible by rising revenues from the state's recovering economy." Another crowed, "The biggest winner…was--as it should have been--education." More expressions of bi-partisan support heard. Said the Assembly Democratic leader, "When you look at this budget from the standpoint of working men and women, seniors and children, this budget does the best we can for them."<P>

Same show. Different years. The first observations were made eight years ago when George Deukmejian unveiled his 1988 spending plan; the second were made this week, when California's 1996 state budget was adopted. We have heard this song before.<P>

1987 and 1988 were fat years for Sacramento's budget-writers. In 1987, surging revenues--and polticians' eagerness to spend them--pushed the budget over the state's maximum spending limit for the first and only time. In 1988, state expenditures exploded 10.3 percent in a single year. A billion dollars of new funds for education produced a truce in the feud between Deukmejian and state schools superintendent Bill Honig (although test scores continued to decline).<P>

Everyone but a few conservative malcontents were effusive in praise for their mutual munificence. Sighed one Republican assemblyman as he surrendered to temptation, "I guess we'd better spend all this new money before the big spenders get hold of it."<P>

But in mid-1988, the economy began to turn downward, and within a year red ink was seeping onto the state's ledgers.<P>

California's experience was typical of the states that shopped til they dropped in the 1980's. Writing for the Cato Institute in 1991, budget analyst Stephen Moore summarized the fiscal wreckage of California and other high-spending states with words which should be haunting in 1996: "With few exceptions the states with the most severe deficits today are those that saw their economies and tax revenues grow rapidly over the past decade, but allowed spending to grow even faster."<P>

The growth of California spending, for example, had outpaced the national average by 15 percent during the 1980's. Beneath the "Iron Duke's" dour exterior, it turns out, there beat the heart of a party animal.<P>

According to Moore's study, the frugal states that had restrained their growth in the 1980's as a whole avoided crippling tax increases and massive budget deficits when boom turned to bust. Many ran surpluses.<P>

California, of course, was not one of them. As recession ravaged revenues could no longer maintain the bureaucracies in the style to which they had grown accustomed, lawmakers attempted to fill the widening budget gaps with unprecedented tax increases and borrowing. The record-shattering 1991 tax hike plunged the state's economy from recession to near-depression, while California's total debt skyrocketed from $18.2 billion to $28.6 billion between 1990 and 1994.<P>

Deukmejian at least maintained a three percent reserve until the last year of his administration, without which the state's fiscal plight would have been even worse. This year's budget provides about one third of that cushion.<P>

California's 1996 budget repeats the 1988 experience in almost every detail. State spending will leap nine percent in a single bound, and Sacramento's solons have been able to appease every bureaucrat in town. Three billion dollars more will go to California's public school system this year, although serious proposals to change performance incentives were abandoned.<P>

The old parable of the ant who stores a surplus in the summer to endure the winter while his cousin the grasshopper first feasts then starves is as true for governments as it is for families and businesses. Frugality in good years softens the bitter choices in the lean ones.<P>

Ironically, an administration which has grappled for six years with the harsh consequences of profligacy now sets in motion the same cycle for its successor when the economy turns downward again.<P>

It's the same old song, a familiar California medley: "Let the Good Times Roll," followed by "The Party's Over."<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE HIGH COST OF RACIAL AND GENDER PREFERENCES</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>



It is ironic that one of the hottest political controversies today revolves around an issue which the nation's founders declared a "self-evident" truth 11 generations ago: "that all men are created equal." <P>
The debate over the racial preferences inherent in modern "affirmative action" programs ultimately will turn on differing notions of justice and equality before the law. But there is a secondary issue which should also be noted. When arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. Sometimes they are the direct costs of preferential programs. More often, they are the indirect costs of inflated prices, bureaucratic delays, and overall inefficiencies which are inescapable consequences of restricting competition. <P>
Racial and gender quotas now permeate virtually every aspect of California's government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the appropriation of funds for school children. These laws cost California taxpayers and consumers at least $343 million annually, and quite probably several times this amount. <P>
The direct cost to state government alone for administering and implementing race and gender based programs exceeds $155 million each year. In virtually every office of California's bureaucracies, coordinators are paid to shuffle mountains of paperwork to administer racial and gender preferences. In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson, agencies which account for less than half of state spending estimated their administrative costs for racial and gender programs to be $12.8 million.  <P>
According to the Legislative Analyst, $47 million is spent annually for race-based programs in the state's two university systems and another $10 million in the public schools and community colleges. (According to other studies, the cost to the universities could be as high as $274 million annually). $82 million is spent annually on "voluntary desegregation" programs in the schools, even though no finding of past racial discrimination has been made. <P>
There are also significant indirect costs. California state government requires that fully one fifth of all state contracts must be set aside for companies owned by specific racial groups or women. As the bidding pool is reduced, prices rise, and California taxpayers must pay between $41 million and $48 million due to restricted competition. <P>
Another indirect expense is the cost of delays in awarding contracts because of the complexity of complying with quotas. In response to a survey by the Construction Industry Research Board in 1986, 78 percent of contractors reported delays in awarding affirmative action contracts. Furthermore, according to the Department of General Services, the time for submitting bids has increased an average of four weeks to allow bidders time to comply with these requirements. These delays cost taxpayers at least $15 million annually. <P>
Under this panoply of racial and gender laws, any business which wants to bid for a state contract must go to extraordinary lengths to recruit minority and woman businesses, including advertising in minority trade publications and meticulously documenting their recruitment efforts. According to the state's Little Hoover Commission, this costs each bidder an average of $1,000 per contract, or $240 million annually. Who pays? Ultimately, consumers pay through higher prices, taxpayers through higher government costs, employees through lower wages, and investors through lower earnings. <P>
Other costs are impossible to estimate. Perhaps the largest(and the most tragic(is the opportunity cost to society of racially discriminatory practices which divert resources from their most productive use. If a highly qualified young woman is denied admittance to the UCLA School of Medicine solely because of her Asian ancestry, how much have we detracted from the potential safety and prosperity of our society? <P>
The price tag for official discrimination in California runs from a low of $343 million to more than $677 million, strictly to maintain a system of racial and gender discrimination in state law. But this doesn't tell the whole story. There are a number of bureaucracies and businesses for which cost information is not readily available and some costs are simply incalculable. Finally, these estimates are for California state government only; they do not account for similar costs incurred by cities, counties and special districts, which would easily double the numbers. <P>
Official discrimination inflicts irreconcilable damage upon the founding principles of the nation; it poisons the social tolerance which is a necessary condition of a free people; it undermines respect for the law and for governmental institutions. These are social costs, and they are astronomical.   <P>
But it also costs money. A lot of it. <P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Diversity is Good--Discrimination Isn't</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#E6E8EA" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#008080" ALINK=000080>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DIVERSITY IS GOOD--DISCRIMINATION ISN'T</B></FONT><BR><B>By Paul Marshall</B></P>

Governments, universities and corporations are caught up in the same "diversity" craze. They routinely defend discrimination by relying on Justice Powell's commendation of "exposure...to students as diverse as this nation of many peoples" in the 1978 Supreme Court Bakke case.  <P>
Of course, as Shelby Steele has said, "No one really knows what diversity means." But that has not dampened the enthusiasm. Currently, three-quarters of the 50 largest U.S. firms have "Diversity Managers." The federal government grades for "promoting diversity" on its management appraisals. The San Francisco School Board adjusts admissions to produce "value-added diversity."<P>
The Clinton Administration defends this with monotonous regularity. On May 24, it urged the Supreme Court to overturn Texas vs. Hopwood, which outlaws discriminatory university admissions, on the grounds of "achieving meaningful educational diversity." 
However, the Clinton Administration has a narrow view of diversity. Hopwood has a blue-collar background, is married to a serviceman, raising a disabled child, and was too poor to take up a partial scholarship to Princeton. The Appeals Court in Hopwood said she "would bring a different perspective to the law school." <P>
For the administration, this is the wrong kind of difference. They want the law school to be able to exclude her because of racial quotas.  <P>
This plea for discrimination causes many conservatives to reject diversity entirely. That would be a mistake, since genuine diversity is marvelous. One of the wonderful things about America is that people have come here from all over the world. Our lives can be enriched by knowing men and women with different views and histories. At a more mundane level, imagine how boring life would be if we were all Puritans and could eat only English food. <P>
The problem is not real diversity, but the use of discrimination in service of a counterfeit "diversity." Real diversity grows when free and equal people make choices about their lives without government control or manipulation. Quotas and discrimination can never produce real variety. They only enforce an administrator's view of who people are and what they should do and think. The result is conformity.<P>
Our universities, corporations, politics and media don't need imposed sameness. In a country rent by "culture wars," we need the challenge of differing and well-formed ideas.
But our universities, are remarkably alike. In the humanities and social sciences, the faculty are routinely secular and liberal. What is desperately required is not more ethnically and sexually "diverse" liberal clones, but people with alternate political, cultural and religious views. <P>
Yet people with religious faith,for example,are often marginalized. Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that he would advise evangelical Christians looking for a career in the media to remove hints of their faith from their resume. "I would say leave it off, just as twenty years ago, if you were a member of a gay rights organization, I would have said leave it off."<P>
Commissioner Robert George noted that religion "doesn't seem to be treated as an issue in diversity, even among people...[responsible] for promoting diversity within their organizations." <P>
Instead, we are left with the dubious proposition that there is something called a "woman's voice" or a "black voice." But women who are conservative Catholics are not well represented by women who are radical feminists, and vice versa. Nor are African-American Pentecostals well represented by secular liberals. <P>
The solution is not some new, approved religious quota. This would only add to the disease. Individual believers are no more reducible than anyone else to a group identity. Instead we need free exchange and competition in place of liberal bias.<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court recently drove this point home. On June 13, in Bush vs. Vera and Shore vs. Hunt, it struck down bizarrely-shaped, racially-gerrymandered voting districts. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asserted, in the major opinion, that such "districts cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial." <P>
Real diversity is good. Discrimination isn't. As O'Connor said, government shouldn't encourage the assumption "that people will vote or think" according to skin color.<P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DON'T LOOK FOR THE TERRORISTS</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN=center><B>By Bruce Herschensohn</B></P>


President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation into who committed the terrorist act, and he said he would "make sure that those responsible for this hideous act are brought to justice." <P>

That was seven months ago, last November 13, when a terrorist attack killed five Americans and injured 60 others in Saudi Arabia.<P>

On June 25, 1996, after it was reported that another bomb blast killed 19 Americans and injured 105 more in Saudi Arabia, President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation to find out who committed the terrorist act and he said "those who did it must be brought to justice."<P>

Forget it.<P>

The Saudis captured and beheaded four terrorists who might have been involved in last November's attack, but it resulted in little if any deterrence. If we are serious about stopping terrorism against Americans we must fight terrorism as we fight a war. When a hand-grenade lands in a foxhole in a battle, there is no attempt to find who threw it because it's irrelevant. The enemy must be attacked as a whole.<P>

When President Franklin Roosevelt requested a declaration of war against the Empire of Japan, he did not say, "Yesterday we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, and we are going to do everything possible to find out who those individual pilots, navigators, and bombardiers were, and bring them to justice." That would have been a guarantee that we would have lost the war. Those individuals were nothing more than tools of a larger enemy.<P>

The larger enemy today is the Nation of Terrorism. It is irrelevant if an individual group responsible for a particular attack is called "The Movement for Islamic Change" or "The Tigers of the Gulf" or some other name. Upon which terrorist group should we retaliate? Any of them.<P>

President Clinton should call a Joint Session of the Congress to request a declaration of war against terrorism, and "that from this day forward, the United States of America will regard terrorism as a sovereign state--as a nation in itself. The Nation of Terrorism is a chain of bases, training camps, safe houses, and other facilities that dot portions of the map of the world, going into and out of other sovereign states. The non-contiguous configuration that the Nation of Terrorism has enjoyed has been a shield, since its citizens-by-choice have assumed that they would always be regarded as part of other sovereign states that surrounded them. That shield must be a thing of the past.<P>

"I am not requesting a declaration of war against Iran or Iraq or Libya or Syria or Cuba or North Korea or Sudan, but against the bases of terrorism within those countries and other countries, as long as those governments permit such bases to exist within their borders.<P>

"As Commander in Chief, I will see to it that if any American is terrorized--indeed, if one hair on the head of an American is touched in hostility--there will be an immediate retaliation by the Government of the United States of America. Our military will be directed to strike at an unannounced terrorist target we think appropriate within the archipelago of 'islands' that have been built and inhabited within the existing borders of other sovereign states.<P>

"This will be a clear edict that we are no longer searching for individual terrorists alone when we can find them, but instead, we are at war against Terrorism and we have found it.<P>

"We must recognize that the Nation of Terrorism has already declared war against the United States and our nation will not allow that to continue.<P>

"If terrorists feel that our retaliatory policy puts them at risk of being targeted for individual acts of terrorism that they did not commit, there is only one option for their future safety: get out of the terrorism business.<P>

"My fellow Americans, our policy of searching is done. A new policy of swift and sure and severe retaliation against the Nation of Terrorism will be in immediate effect after you in the Congress make such a formal declaration. Let that declaration be a warning, the only warning to be given, that the citizens of the United States are to be secure against violence on their person wherever they travel throughout the world.
"Thank you and goodnight."<P>

 INDEPENDENCE DAY</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Charles R. Kesler</B></P>

As the Fourth of July approaches, Americans can look forward once again to the rockets' red glare and bombs bursting in air, not to mention some tasty burgers and hotdogs. But the nation's 220th birthday is also an occasion to look back on the changes in American politics since the glory days of the Revolution.<P>
Americans still believe, as the Declaration of Independence proclaimed, that the purpose of government is "to secure these rights," but our understanding of what those rights are has shifted so dramatically that we may speak of two distinct eras in our politics--the era of natural rights and the era of entitlement rights.<P>
In 1776, America claimed its independence on the basis of certain "unalienable rights." Jefferson elsewhere called these "natural rights" or "the rights of man," meaning that human beings received them from nature--or from "nature's God"--and that they were prior to government and even to society. <P>
As Jefferson put it in his last letter, written shortly before July 4, 1826, the Declaration meant to show that "the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God." On the contrary, all men were created equal, and their Creator intended that this equality of rights be respected by all merely human governments.<P>
Government's job was to secure our rights for us better than we could on our own. The Founding Fathers disagreed among themselves as to how extensive the resulting governmental powers had to be, but these were disagreements about means, not ends. However great the national government's powers needed  to be, no one doubted that its proper purposes were limited to a few great objects.<P>
Alexander Hamilton specified them as "commerce, finance, negotiation, and war," though to his mind they also comprehended "implied powers" sufficient to allow for a national bank, the encouragement of manufactures, and related "internal improvements." 
Jefferson's list was even shorter. In his First Inaugural Address, after enumerating the blessings that made the Americans "a happy and prosperous people," he drew attention to "one thing more" that was "the sum of good government" and would "close the circle of our felicities"; namely, "a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned."<P>
Today, however, most of American politics revolves around new kinds of rights, which in turn have called into being new purposes and institutions of government. The Constitution of 1787 is still with us, of course, but it has been overlaid by what Franklin D. Roosevelt once called "an economic constitutional order" based on a new "economic Bill of Rights." These rights are familiar to us as welfare rights or "entitlements," and include everything from Social Security and unemployment benefits to Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and even certain kinks of affirmative action programs.<P>
These new rights are the very opposite of natural rights, insofar as natural rights precede--and therefore limit--all just government. The new social and economic rights flow <I>from</I> government. They are promises made by the government to the citizenry or to particular classes of citizens, designed generally to remedy their neediness or to satisfy their material wants. <P>
At the heart of today's social and economic rights is the notion that human dignity demands that society, acting through government, supply the defects of human nature. Rather than obeying or acting responsibly towards nature, as the Founders urged, the new rights attempt to overcome it. Health care, nutrition care, jobs, unemployment insurance, and old age benefits are not gifts of nature in the sense that, say, life and liberty are; we have no natural right to them, and hence Jefferson did not consider it the task of government to try to secure them for us. That was up to our own "industry and improvement," as he said.<P>
Of course, Jefferson would have agreed that jobs and proper health care are good things; he would have denied only that they were <I>rights</I>. For if they were rights, then it must be the duty of one's fellow citizens to supply them-and in principle, to remedy all the needs and wants of human nature. Since human desires are infinite, however, this would be a prescription for endless obligation, for a comprehensive servitude that would swallow up all freedom and individual responsibility. <P>
	This problem was apparent to the champions of the new kinds of rights. But statesmen like Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt argued that social and economic rights were necessary to relieve a new form of oppression that had emerged in American society after the Civil War and Reconstruction. The new oppressors were the large corporations and trusts that concentrated unprecedented wealth and political power in the hands of a few. <P>
Under these unprecedented conditions, the government had to intervene in order to restore economic opportunity for the little guy and to protect the working man's right to the fruits of his own labor. This economic analysis was dubious; and even if true, did not necessarily point to a revolution in the functions of government. But Wilson and Roosevelt insisted that new kinds of rights had to be added to the old forms of civil and natural rights--in order to protect American individualism from a threat the Founding Fathers could not have foreseen.<P>
In a crucial respect, however, the addition of social and economic rights did more than just pragmatically solve a novel problem: it promised to lift the nation to a higher moral plane. Wilson called this "the new freedom," meaning that it was not only different from the old but better, because it was supposedly less selfish. The bureaucrats who would be in charge of distributing benefits and opportunities to the people were supposed to be the least selfish of all, and their sense of disinterested moral superiority eventually set the tone of the era of entitlements: the condescension of governmental elites to the people they were presumably serving.<P>
Because they were "progressive" (not natural and unchangeable), the new rights could be implemented gradually and adapted constantly to the nation's changing economic and social conditions. The "economic constitutional order" was not implemented all at once, as in a political founding, but in stages, beginning modestly in the Progressive Era and accelerating in the New Deal and Great Society periods. <P>
Although presented as incremental reforms, the new agencies and departments created to carry out the new agenda were soon acknowledged to be so distinctive, so different in kind from the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of traditional American government, that they acquired a new name. Thus today we speak of "the welfare state," as though a new state or new form of government had been added to the one established by the Constitution.<P>
The chief business of the welfare state is to secure our new rights. This task involves, among other things, the large-scale redistribution of income through federal entitlement programs. Roosevelt, who launched the first and still most successful of these entitlements, defended them as affordable and just; but today, increasingly, they seem to be neither.<P>
Roosevelt claimed, even in the midst of the Great Depression, that American capitalism was phenomenally productive, that it was capable of producing "plenty" and that the redistribution of its "surplus" (a modest and fairly painless goal) was all that the welfare state required. But nowadays, the cost of American government, federal and state, exceeds 40 percent of the national income; and even at that high level, the federal budget is chronically unbalanced and all of the major entitlement programs, including Social Security, face impending bankruptcy in the next century. What's more, few Americans think they are undertaxed.<P>
Still, it proves difficult to cut or constrain entitlement spending because the second of Roosevelt's justifications remains powerful. The public remains convinced of the legitimacy or fairness of at least some parts of the contemporary welfare state. Many Americans have lost their enthusiasm for non-middle class entitlements (food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, etc.), which seem routinely to trap and corrupt their recipients; but the middle class programs remain popular, largely because of their resemblance to social insurance plans. <P>
Having been forced to contribute to them all of their working lives, at higher and higher rates of taxation, most people are loath to see their future benefits reduced. Yet surely the original proponents of the new rights would be chagrined to see their handiwork defended mainly on such self-interested grounds. And the rest of us should wonder whether the welfare state's corruptions have really been confined to the so-called underclass.<P>
In his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton proclaimed that "the era of big government is over." Neither he nor anyone else, however, knows what comes after it. Are Americans prepared to return to limited government? Is America on the verge of a revival of natural rights? On this Fourth of July, we need at least to begin to think through this possibility, if we are to make intelligent choices in the difficult years ahead.<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</B></FONT><BR><B> By Thomas G. West</B></P>

The problem in America today is not that we have too much equality, too many rights, or too much democracy, as some critics say. The problem is that we are well along in a process of <I>abandoning</I> equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood. On this 220th anniversary of America's independence, it is worth considering how those principles have been abandoned, and what can be done to restore them to their rightful and preeminent authority in our public life. <P>
America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated. We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<P>

The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<P>

In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings. On the one hand, they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration. On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy. Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much <I>they</I> care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<P>

Our liberties are contracting, not expanding. Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights. What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past 25 years.<P>

For example, the Founders regarded enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates in elections as the most important purpose of free speech. In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office. Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected. This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of the wealthy in elections. The idea behind the law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, rich people should be severely limited in what they can publish.<P>

What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest? This is what the Revolution was all about: government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who would be forbidden. That had been the law in Old England. Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic. John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<P>

The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers. What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws? Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government--in many cases, conservatives.<P>

No surprise, then, that government by the people has to a significant extent been replaced over the past century, especially in the past 30 years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate. Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<P>

This has happened in two ways. First, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments. Second, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (the president, governors, legislators) to unelected officials (bureaucrats, agents, and judges).<P>

Consider the rise of wetlands regulation. As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law. The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the United States. Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U.S. This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as few as 14 days a year.<P>

Wetlands regulation is but one example of how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people. This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent. It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<P>

So much for our rights, and government by consent.<P>

Finally, our liberties are contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom--namely, morality, family, and faith.<P>

The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare. In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly. <P>

James Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another." But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from? <P>

The Founders' answer: from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others. Thomas Jefferson(the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity-- was sensible enough to write in his <I>Notes on Virginia</I> that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<P>

The government today is anti-religious in a whole host of ways. When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational." In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools. Yet it is worth noting that the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<P>

This hostility toward religion raises an intriguing question: If we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on? If liberty is not the gift of <I>God</I>, it must be the gift of <I>government</I>. But what government gives, government may take away. As Jefferson said, without God, liberty will not last.<P>

The government's hostility to morality and religion has had a profound effect on the family. Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem. It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<P>

When the federal government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood. Government's generosity made it possible, for the first time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more. The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.
At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage. From sex education to easy abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message: just do it! <P>

Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<P>

The problems afflicting the health of the nation are vast indeed. It is easy to want to throw up one's hands in surrender. But Americans must devote themselves to the recovery of the healthy core of the older American tradition. On this Independence day, let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>REMEDIES FOR UC UNDERREPRESENTATION: RESIGNATIONS
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

</CENTER>

<P>

"Affirmative action" is a policy in search of a purpose. Recent attacks on the California Civil Rights Initiative and changes in University of California admissions procedures have produced a smokescreen of contradictory arguments in favor of racially discriminatory policies.

<P>

When opponents aren't patronizingly attacking the motives behind non-racial policies, or blurring the distinction between stopping discrimination and perpetuating discrimination, their most common justification has been "diversity," as if racially-charged criteria somehow lead to intellectual and cultural variety. However, as a goal, "diversity" has suffered major setbacks, in our courts.

<P>

When the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals outlawed in <I>Hopwood v. University of Texas</I> different admission standards for different races at the University of Texas last March, it ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's supposed defense of "diversity" in its famous <I>Bakke v. Regents</I> decision was not a "binding precedent" since it "is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion." 

<P>

The Appeals Court also noted that the Supreme Court itself had ruled last year in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I> that racial criteria must pass a "strict scrutiny" test and that "the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny...."

<P>

Given the problems of "diversity," affirmative action proponents have dusted off the goal of, as UC Berkeley puts it, preferring "historically under-represented" groups in admissions. Note that the focus is not even underrepresented groups, but purportedly "historically underrepresented" groups.

<P>

This hedge is necessary since the group presently "underrepresented" is white high school graduates. In a recent Claremont Institute study, Michael Lynch shows that in 1993 whites were 54 percent of Berkeley's potentially eligible applicant pool but accounted for only 32 percent of acceptances. 

<P>

Hence the focus shifts to groups alleged to have been short-changed in the past. Somehow present admissions policies are meant to compensate for alleged past discrimination. This is an awkward and perverse position. 

<P>

Let us assume for the moment that the implied allegations about the history of UC admitting policies might be true. But even if it were so, present discrimination would do nothing about it.  

<P>

People who were unfairly excluded from UC in the past receive nothing. They didn't get a UC education then, they don't have it now. People who were unfairly admitted in the past still maintain their advantage. Absolutely nothing has changed. The claimed injustice remains. No present policy affects it.  

<P>

Instead, what is offered is more discrimination, this time against high school students who were not born at the time of their group's "overrepresentation." 

<P>

In short, today's children suffer for the alleged sins of their elders while the elders continue to savor the fruits of their transgressions.

<P>

Not only does this accept supposed past iniquities, it adds new inequities. It also camouflages one possible, if unpalatable, remedy to past "under-representation."

<P>

After all, if it is true that people in the past benefited from unfair admissions, then these people are still around in banks, foundations, the media, government bureaucracies--and universities.

<P>

One place they surely are is among the faculty and administration of the University of California itself. The University administration and teaching faculty must be teeming with people who gained their present positions through a historical process which "affirmative action" proponents now denounce. 
 
<P>

Even apart from biased student admissions, these people presumably have also benefited unfairly from a process of faculty hiring in which minorities were "underrepresented." Yet most University administrators and, according to reports, most faculty are committed "affirmative action" proponents. 

<P>

The solution to this problem seems to be fairly straightforward. A large proportion of the present UC faculty--let us call them white liberals--should resign. They are, if academic proponents of "affirmative action" are to be believed, unfairly advantaged and putatively less qualified than others.

<P>

The UC faculty probably does not wish to pursue this course. This is not surprising, and is perhaps understandable. But what the proponents of racially weighted policies among them at least could do is stop pretending that sacrificing today's teenagers will somehow atone for their own historically-acquired advantages.

<P>

In truth, the argument for remedying "historical under-representation" is incoherent. Most Americans know this. And, unless we see a large number of resignations from the University of California, we can conclude that their affirmative action advocates know it, too. Otherwise, they would be hypocrites. But that surely couldn't be true, could it?

<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE TERMINAL SILLINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S <I>ROMER</I> DECISION</font></b>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ben Boychuk</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In a 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court recently lit the fuse on one of the most contentious issues in America. The Court struck down an amendment to Colorado's constitution which said that homosexuals could not be given special rights. Under Amendment 2, gays and lesbians could not claim favorable status with the courts. They had the same rights as every citizen in the Rocky Mountain state. But they would not be able to use their sexuality for "minority status, quota preferences, protected status, or claim[s] of discrimination."

<P>

In the Court's opinion, minorities are only "equal" when they are separate but special. <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a unique reading of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.

<P>

The Court's convoluted argument, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, confuses special preference for equality under the law, and mistakes sanction for tolerance. It is a clumsy act of political cowardice, shrouded in the majesty of law. 

<P>

"It is a fair...inference from the broad language of the amendment," Kennedy writes, to say "that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings." He concludes, "This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws." 

<P>

Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent characterizes this line of reasoning as "terminal silliness."  The Court, he writes, is arguing that "one who is accorded equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal protection of the laws." This is laughable, were it not so destructive. 

<P>

This decision is not an enlightened example of the court passing solid legal judgment. Rather, it is a symptom of America's overflowing, hubristic "rights talk," which can transform any misfortune or misconduct into an obligation for others to pay. 

<P>

This real issue at work in the Romer decision is not legal, but political. The people of Colorado were merely trying to prevent their children from being taught that homosexuality is deserving of special status under the law. Homosexuality may be legal in Colorado, but that makes it no less of a vice. 

<P>

With Amendment 2, Colorado's voters used the ballot to send the message that sex should be understood in its relation to bearing and raising children, the business of the family. But the Court in Romer disregards the long-cherished right of the people to enact religious and moral sentiment into law through the democratic process. 

<P>

Law is the expression of moral principles. We discriminate against incest and polygamy and drug-dealing because we believe these activities are a threat to society. We do not grant white, male heterosexuals3/4nor should we grant anyone else--special rights because we believe that this would threaten equality. Indeed, the Court makes a mockery of political self-determination. By striking down Amendment 2, the Court struck down a legitimate attempt by citizens to limit the unchecked granting of special rights.

<P>

Homosexuals in Colorado retained all of the rights guaranteed them under the state and federal bills of rights. The measure did not deprive them of the right to vote or to own property, nor did it strip away their protection from unreasonable searches and seizures or discrimination at the workplace.

<P>

As Scalia points out, Amendment 2 had no effect on a number of Colorado's laws, including the one governing pensions paid to retiring state employees. Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike are entitled to that benefit. The amendment would have simply prevented the state from making death-benefit payments to the "life partner" of a homosexual. The reasoning simply extends the logic that the state doesn't make such payments to the long-time roommate of a heterosexual employee. Nor would Amendment 2 have prevented assaults on homosexuals from being prosecuted, as the measure's opponents shamelessly argued. 

<P>

In essense, all Amendment 2 did--and this is what the Court didn't like but didn't have the temerity to say--was bar affirmative action for homosexuals. The Court has ruled in previous cases that homosexuality is not a "fundamental right"--states can, in fact, make homosexual acts punishible under the law. But the Court didn't overrule itself. The court stopped short of treating sexual orientation the same as race, age, or handicap. But the groundwork is there.

<P>

Activists wasted no time before playing this latest and possibly greatest legal trump in their political deck. A few days after the Court handed down its decision, an 18-year-old student in Hacienda Heights, California threatened to sue her high school after administrators refused to let her attend the senior prom with her 22-year-old lesbian lover. 

<P>

Cowed by the news of the Court's ruling, the school backed down. The girl's attorney, feminist agitator Gloria Allred, hailed the school's reversal as the first victory for homosexual rights under the Romer decision. Welcome to the gay '90s.

Hamas isn't waging a war against peace, it's waging a war against Israel. Hamas would welcome peace3/4after they have taken over Israel. All of it.<P>And from the outset, what is called the &quot;Peace Process&quot; has been a War Process. The government of Israel is resting its faith in Yasser Arafat who for most of his adult life had (and, we should safely assume, still has) the same objective as Hamas3/4to be done with Israel.<P>For decades, Arafat himself used terrorism to reach that objective, but it didn't work because Israel retaliated for every attack of the PLO with swiftness and severity. Does any reasonable person believe that Arafat has changed his ultimate objective rather than simply changing his transitory tactics?<P>Hamas wants peace to come about by terrorism while Arafat sees a smoother way3/4the gradual takeover of sections of Israel, under the short-range disguise of &quot;Land for Peace.&quot; That phrase should be recognized for what it is: a threat that land will be attempted to be seized by war if it isn't given away by peace. Why else would such a phrase have ever become part of the Mideast vocabulary?<P>But should any amount of land be granted under a threat? Would you give one room of your residence to an armed gang if it said it would give you peace in exchange? If Israel continues to give land for peace, it will have neither land nor peace.<P>But assume for a naïve moment that Arafat has changed; that he truly wants no territory beyond Gaza, Samaria, and Judea. Then can he bring peace? At best, he only has control of the fatah faction of the PLO and apparantly has no control of Hamas' military wing, Izzadin el-Quazzi. We should have little doubt that Arafat sincerely wants the Hamas terrorist attacks to stop, but we should have grave doubt as to his reasons why. Hamas terrorism undermines Arafat's power and his own course of action in the slower, but more certain, dismemberment of Israel.<P>If Israeli policy remains as it is, &quot;Land for War&quot; will be the unintentional outcome for Israel.<P>What should Israel do? Other than severe retaliations against Hamas for each attack, it must undo what can legally be undone in the process it signed in Oslo and on the South Lawn of the White House. Secondly, at a minimum, the Golan Heights must be kept under Israel's total control rather than negotiating any of its control to Syria. There is already a striking territorial resemblance between the area's maps of pre-June 1967, and scheduled maps of 1997. And all of that is being done in the name of peace, which in 1967 was a guarantee of war.<P>All of those decisions are, of course, Israel's to make. The question is what should the United States do?<P>On Sunday, February 25, two young Americans, both in their 20s, were killed by Hamas terrorists. Those Americans were doing nothing more provocative than riding in a bus in Jerusalem. <P>It isn't that Americans have already forgotten the names of Sarah Duker and Matt Eisenfeld. We never learned them. Hardly a word has been said by President Clinton about the murder of those American citizens. <P>We should have retaliated immediately. We know, with precision, the location of the headquarters, safe-houses, and training centers of Hamas' military wing. It is true that in such retaliation we may not kill or capture the individuals responsible for that particular attack--but that shouldn't be the vital goal any more than it is a vital goal to find the grenade-thrower on a conventional battlefield. Retaliation is done against the enemy as a whole.<P>Beyond retaliation, we should encourage Israel to take all the necessary steps needed for its survival. And celebrate the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu.<P>That support and celebration would come naturally if President Clinton would recognize that a person or a nation can only make peace with those who want the same objectives. If those objectives are not compatible and one side strives to make peace alone, the achievement will be the peace of the grave. Too bad, but that's just the way it is.<P>It may well be that Israel, with President Clinton's encouragement, has already gone so far that it will continue to give away land as though that will bring peace, and our government will continue to influence Israel in that direction, saying that &quot;the Peace Process must continue.&quot;<P>I'm not a man who frequently quotes Shakespeare, but one phrase of his is particularly appropriate when land for peace becomes a policy--&quot;what fools these mortals be. &quot;<P>______________________________________________<P><I>Bruce Herschensohn is a Distinguished Fellow with The Claremont Institute</I><P><B> (c) The Claremont Institute	          May 24, 1996</B></td></tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>ANNIVERSARIES FOR DISSENTERS: 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLESSY V. FERGUSON
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ken Masugi</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On May 18, we mark the 100th anniversary of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous Supreme Court decision which enfeebled the post-Civil War Amendments designed to give freed slaves the rights and duties of American citizenship. The <I>Plessy</I> case marked the formal beginning of an era of legalized discrimination on the basis of race--an era in which we are mired still today.

<P>

The Supreme Court held in <I>Plessy</I> that it was perfectly reasonable for a state to racially segregate persons within its jurisdiction. The Court razed all but the most modest constitutional barriers to racist behavior by state and local governments. By making the astounding assertion that black Americans should not take offense at state segregation laws, the Court weakened the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of &quot;equal protection of the laws. &quot; 

<P>

One hundred years ago, the American conscience was unburdened of any constitutional need to fight the degradation of segregation, and its separate but unequal treatment of black Americans.

<P>

Fifty years ago, baseball great Jackie Robinson's broke through the farce of a facade of segregation. An individual effort of excellence, encouraged by private business, shamed Americans into demolition of irrational discriminatory practices. 

<P>

It would be nice to report a happier ending: racial segregation dead and Jackie Robinson triumphant. But that would be too na&iuml;ve a gloss.

<P>

In 1954, just a few years after Robinson earned Rookie-of-the-Year honors for the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Supreme Court declared in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> that segregation laws violated the Constitution. Yet this opinion did not truly challenge the bad principle of the <I>Plessy</I> case. The <I>Brown</I> opinion rested its conclusions on highly dubious psychological testing evidence--segregation made blacks feel bad and therefore become inferior--and not principles of constitutionalism and human dignity.

<P>

Thus the reasonableness standard of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I> remains the law of the land: It is still constitutional for government to legislate upon the basis of race, as the vitality and range of racial preference programs, set-asides, and quotas throughout the land reflects. The century-old legacy of <I>Plessy</I> lives on, dividing Americans in as irrational ways as the segregation of baseball did 50 years ago. 

<P>

The fact remains, we have yet to embrace the famous &quot;color-blind Constitution&quot; standard defended by the sole dissenting justice in the <I>Plessy</I> case, John Marshall Harlan. To quote briefly from his thundering dissent:

<P>

<blockquote>
&quot;[I]n the eye of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant ruling class of citizens.  There is no caste here.  Our constitution is color-blind....In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved...&quot;
</blockquote>

<P>

Harlan was not being utopian. He argued that the equality of rights implicit in the rule of law can be a means of making us flawed creatures more reasonable, more civilized. But such rights can be beneficial only to the extent that they are exercised in a color-blind way, that is, devoid of the passion of racial preference.

<P>

Consider the example of abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass, America's greatest black thinker, who died just a few years before Harlan's declaration of principle. Douglass urged all Americans to renounce racial pride and taught the central significance of character for citizenship. &quot;The only excuse for pride in individuals or races is in the fact of their own achievement,&quot; he declared in 1889. To cultivate racial pride is &quot;a positive evil, &quot; Douglass said. &quot;It is building on a false foundation.&quot; 

<P>

As we continue to struggle with the flawed policies of racial preference, we need to benefit from the wisdom of dissenters of a century ago. It's hard to fathom that an equal period of time separates Jackie Robinson--that 20th Century embodiment of the lessons of Frederick Douglass--from the <I>Plessy</I> case and from Americans today. We still need to learn the lessons of Jackie Robinson and call forth and repeat that heroism in both high and modest circumstances today.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY: FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW BEST
</FONT></B>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Thomas G. West</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

Until the 1960s, the principle of religious liberty was thought to require the separation of church and state, but not the separation of religion from politics. The American tradition was full of examples of government-sponsored prayers, religious music, and religious instruction.

<P>

The Supreme Court has declared quite a few of the older practices unconstitutional. Liberals attack these traditions as relics of an earlier era of religious bigotry. Conservatives have resisted the expulsion of religion from public life, but they don't quite know how to explain or defend the older approach.

<P>

The problem with the conservative defense is that it is based on a notion of religious liberty that is totally opposed to the American Founders. In today's view, largely accepted by liberals and conservatives alike, a forbidden "establishment of religion" exists whenever government supports or promotes a particular teaching on God.

<P>

The strangeness of today's approach, from the earlier standpoint, can be seen most vividly by this fact: by today's logic, it is unconstitutional to teach the Declaration of Independence in public school.

<P>

The Declaration contains four distinct references to God: he is the author of the "laws of God"; the "Creator" who "endowed" us with our inalienable rights; "the Supreme Judge of the world"; and "Divine Providence." 

<P>

The Supreme Court has ruled that government may not teach or practice religion. It may not exert "subtle coercive pressure" on students by prayers or religious instruction.  If the Declaration were taught in a public school as the truth, the teacher would "teach religion." She would be exercising "subtle coercive pressure" on students. She would be promoting an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment.

<P>

But this is absurd. Or are we really willing to say that our principles, announced in the Declaration at the moment of the nation's founding, forbid the public teaching of the source of our principles? Without an eternal foundation in God and nature, our rights become the arbitrary gift of government. And what government gives, government may take away.

<P>

Of course, teaching the Declaration has not been declared unconstitutional. But that is only because the Court has been unwilling to admit the full consequences of its view of  establishment. To avoid the public outrage that would follow if the Declaration were banned from the classroom, the Court falsely asserts that the document is not really religious. "Reciting official documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity" bears "no true resemblance" to school prayer, says the Court. Such exercises, Justice William Brennan explains, "no longer have a religious purpose or meaning."

<P>

In other words, the Court will allow the theology of the Declaration to be taught in the classroom as long as it is understood that it belongs to a past that is dead and gone, that it has nothing to do with the world that we live in here and now, that it is not a living faith that holds God to be the source of our rights, the author of the laws of nature, and the protector and Supreme Judge of America.

<P>

The prevailing, incorrect view of religious liberty leads liberals to demand the elimination of the few remaining remnants of traditional morality and religious expression from public life. The limitation of marriage to a man and a woman, the lingering presence of Christmas holidays and songs in public schools, taxpayer support of legislative and military chaplains--all these holdovers of the repressive traditions of the past must go.

<P>

Conservatives, holding the same view of religious liberty, cannot defend themselves from these assaults. "Neutrality" between religion and irreligion necessarily results in a "naked public square." 

<P>

Liberals need to learn that although the right to free exercise of religion is indeed sacred, it is both appropriate and necessary for government to support sound religious convictions in a nation that means to remain free. They need to recover the Founders  understanding that a public life which allows no place for religious expression is not fit for human habitation. 

<P>

Conservatives need to learn not to be shy about their desire for public acknowledgment of the importance of God in our lives as long as every individual is protected in his natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>THE GREAT UC BERKELEY ADMISSIONS WHITEWASH
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Michael Lynch</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On March 21, two days after the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found the University of Texas Law School guilty of race discrimination, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released the results of its seven-year investigation into the undergraduate admissions process at University of California at Berkeley (UCB). In its 15-page Letter of Finding (LOF), the OCR concluded, among other things, that "UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black Hispanic or Filipino applicants" and that the "admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI" of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 

<P>

Proponents of racial preferences proclaimed the OCR's finding a vindication of UCB's affirmative action programs. Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of UCB's admissions process, called <I>Hopwood v. Texas</I> "profoundly radical" and the OCR finding "a model of prudence" in a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> op-ed. Karabel concluded, "At stake is nothing less than the future of the American dream3/4that the United States should be the land of opportunity for all of its citizens."

<P>

Karabel has the first two issues inverted. His conclusion is right for the wrong reason. 

<P>

Some things simply can't be improved on with age. Among these is the Declaration of Independence's cogent statement of the American dream, rooted in this country's founding creed of human equality under the law: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 

<P>

It was this creed that Lincoln called the "standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all: constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and the value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere."

<P>

Lincoln's conception of equality is driving the current effort to abolish preferential policies.

<P>

Recognizing that race cannot benefit some applicants without hindering other applicants, the Court ruling in Hopwood rejected that race could be used in a non-discriminatory manner. "Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection," the court ruled.

<P>

In contrast, the OCR based its decision on the diversity standard set forth in Justice Lewis Powell's decision in the infamous Bakke decision. Under this standard, race and ethnicity can be considered so as to add to the educational diversity of the institution. As a result, it is erroneous to conclude from the OCR vindication of UCB that race is not a critically important factor in its admissions process. 

<P>

The OCR's own report shows that for most applicants, race is the most important factor, outside of grades and test scores. UCB judges applicants by radically different standards depending on their race and ethnicity. These different standards, according to the OCR's report, included:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
Wealthy African American, American Indian, and Chicano students who were California residents were automatically admitted in three academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected, without even a file review.
<p>
Although UCB costs California's general fund more than $8,000 per student, wealthy, non-resident minorities were granted preferences over California residents who were not members of the right ethnic group. 
<P>
Wealthy, non-resident American Indian, African American and Chicano applicants were automatically accepted in two academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected without even a file review.
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
UCB's admissions process produces entering classes in which the only underrepresented students are white. This is perhaps why the school now targets "historically underrepresented" groups. The broader point is that by utilizing a race code, public officials are playing with dynamite in a state in which taxpayers can trace their roots back to 150 countries. 

<P>

Writing in a time in which race in America was primarily conceived as a Black/White issue, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, "the destinies of the two races, in this country, are indissolubly linked together and the interests of both requite that the common government of all shall not permit the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law." It was also Justice Harlan who wrote "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." This is a proposition to which we should all rededicate ourselves.

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>MRS. CLINTON'S VILLAGE</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Michael Warder</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps Hillary Clinton is right. Maybe it does take
a village to raise a child as she says in her new book by the
same name. On the other hand, it would take a village idiot to
regard this book as anything other than a 1996 presidential campaign
prop.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this widely publicized lite volume, not only does
Mrs. Clinton offer a series of Kodak moments in the life of the
Clinton family, she also sells hard the philosophy, programs,
and personnel of the Clinton administration. As if that is not
enough, Mrs. Clinton weighs in against &quot;the resurgence of
anti-government extremism&quot; in America and those who &quot;advance
narrow religious, political, and economic agendas.&quot; One gets
the impression that Mrs. Clinton is referring to the current crop
of Republican presidential candidates. Their &quot;narrow agendas&quot;
include, among other things, introducing a flat tax, raising the
exemption level for children, turning power back to the states,
closing several major departments of the federal government, and
returning prayer to schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have not yet seen a news story raising the question
of whether or not this book, published by Simon &amp; Schuster,
is really a soft contribution to the Clinton reelection campaign.
The book is little more than a lengthy propaganda tract recounting
the glorious government programs pushed through over the last
three years of the administration. When Mrs. Clinton writes of
the problem of poor nutrition for many children, she surely intends
no harm to the re-election effort when she offers that &quot;the
village [read: government] can help. The U.S. Department of Agriculture,
which oversees school lunch and breakfast programs, has started
Team Nutrition...&quot; She adds that &quot;the President's Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports is working hard to convince schools&quot;
about the wisdom of physical development. She then informs us
that, &quot;I can't understand the political opposition to programs
like midnight basketball and other recreational activities.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps I can help Mrs. Clinton understand, as one
member of the village to another. Many citizens who live near
community centers with gymnasiums do not like platoons of unemployed,
troubled youths walking and driving around their neighborhoods
after midnight. These citizens also wonder how these young men
manage getting up the next morning to look for a job after playing
basketball all night? They wonder why their federal tax dollars
go to fund these programs when they have to work hard to save
so they can make ends meet? Finally, they wonder if midnight basketball
is such a great thing, why couldn't their community fund it locally?
After all, local programs are always much more effective and efficient
than some federal program parachuted into the neighborhood from
Washington at about 25 cents worth of program for each dollar
of taxes. Besides, in Kenosha, Wisconsin they probably would want
midnight bowling. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It should come as no surprise, but the philosophy
of government espoused by Mrs. Clinton in her book is identical
to that of President Clinton in his recent State of the Union
address. His first of seven challenges that America faces &quot;is
to cherish our children and strengthen the American family.&quot;
Like Mrs. Clinton, the President sees a direct link between the
federal government and the love and care of all American children.
But the federal government is ill-suited to assume assume that
responsibility. That most intimate of duties resides in the family,
a father and a mother joined in marriage with children. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If a father and mother do not fulfill that role,
it is the children of that family that suffer the most and no
federal program can effectively step into the breach. Grandparents
and close relatives are by nature the next in line of responsibility.
When President Clinton challenges Congress to pass a &quot;bipartisan
welfare reform bill&quot; and &quot;do right by our children,&quot;
he puts the federal government in the position of surrogate parent
for children.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a true village, where life-long relations abound,
relatives are nearby, and people work and spend their leisure
time together, a couple would adopt an abandoned child. However,
America, a nation of 260 million people, is not a village and
the federal government is not a town meeting. When our nation
was founded more than 200 years ago, it was much smaller than
today. Yet it was unimaginable to our Founders to conceive that
the purpose of our newly established government was to &quot;support
families at work and at home, and to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families&quot; as asserted by Mrs. Clinton.
Union, justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, and
the blessings of liberty was their more limited intent. Perhaps
in Mrs. Clinton's village, the Founders were just another unenlightened
group of &quot;anti-government extremists.&quot;</FONT>

<CENTER>
<B>By Edward J. Erler</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
The Federal Government currently grants automatic citizenship
to children of illegal aliens born in the United States. This
practice is frequently abused. In Los Angeles County Hospitals,
for example, nearly two-thirds of births are now to women who
have entered the U.S. illegally.
<P>
Congress is considering a law that would deny citizenship to American-born
children of illegal immigrants. Patrisia Gonzales and Roberto
Rodriguez published a frantic and intemperate attack on that proposal
in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, the<I> Houston Chronicle</I>,
and other newspapers. They called it &quot;xenophobic extremism&quot;
and suggested that it was somehow reminiscent of &quot;Nazism&quot;
to refuse citizenship to any person born on American soil.
<P>
Gonzales and Rodriguez write-with remarkable ignorance of the
historical record-that if Congress succeeds in its attempts to
deny birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens,
&quot;for the first time since slavery, children born in the United
States will be denied the right to citizenship.&quot; They mistakenly
assume that birthright citizenship is a right of all who happen
to be born within the geographical limits of the United States.
The fourteenth amendment states that &quot;all persons born in
the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
But as the framers of the amendment made clear, not all persons
in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction. Senator
Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause, noted that
it &quot;will not, of course, include persons born in the United
States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families
of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&quot;
<P>
Is it reasonable to think that those who actively defy the laws
of the United States by illegal entry should have a constitutional
right to confer the boon of citizenship upon their children? It
is significant that the Supreme Court has never held that such
a right exists.
<P>
During the debate over passage of the fourteenth amendment, Indians
and blacks were the only substantial groups of non-citizens living
in America. The amendment conferred citizenship on blacks, who
were obviously not &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of
any other country. 
<P>
But it was widely agreed that the amendment would not confer citizenship
on Indians since they owed political allegiance to their tribes
and not to the United States. The Senate Judiciary Committee in
1870 reported that &quot;those who framed the fourteenth amendment
. . . understood that the Indian tribes were not made citizens,
but were excluded by the restricting phrase, 'and subject to the
jurisdiction,' and that such has been the universal understanding.&quot;
Indians were obviously born within the geographical limits of
the United States, and many were born outside of reservations.
Rodriguez and Gonzales ask us to believe that the fourteenth amendment
extends to the children of illegal aliens what it did not extend
to Native Americans!
<P>
In 1924 Congress extended the privilege of citizenship to all
Native Americans. The Supreme Court, however, has emphatically
ruled that becoming a citizen of the United States cannot be a
unilateral or self-selected act. As the Court rightly noted, the
jurisdiction requirement of the fourteenth amendment embodies
&quot;the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation
without its consent.&quot; In addition, once an individual consents
to subject himself to the jurisdiction of the United States, he
cannot be removed from that jurisdiction without his consent.
Thus the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment is based
on reciprocal consent-consent of the individual as well as that
of the nation.
<P>
As a result of hearings held in the House last December, key members
of Congress have rediscovered the fact that those &quot;subject
to the jurisdiction&quot; of the United States can be clarified
by legislation. Congress, through its power to enforce the fourteenth
amendment, can simply declare that the children of illegal aliens
are not within the jurisdiction of the United States and that
the citizenship of children follows that of their parents.
<P>
Congressional enactments specify the terms by which immigrants
are allowed into the country and the terms upon which citizenship
can be achieved. There can be reasonable disagreements about whether
immigration policies should be more or less generous in the numbers
admitted and the precise pre-conditions for citizenship. But who
can deny that it is a necessary attribute of a nation's sovereignty
to determine who are and are not citizens? 
<P>
Contrary to what Rodriguez and Gonzales would have us believe,
the denial of birth right citizenship to the children of illegal
aliens does not punish the children for the misdeeds of their
parents because the children do not have a &quot;right&quot; to
citizenship in the first place. Could it be that Rodriguez and
Gonzales have allowed their special interest ideology to dictate
historically inaccurate and unsound constitutional arguments?

<H1>Lessons of the Affirmative Action Campaign</H1>
<H2>A Look at the Future From California</H2>
<p>
  <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

As usual, the eccentricities of California, both good and bad, open a window on the future of the whole nation.  We entered the election holding our breath, took a beating, and came out glad it wasn't worse. Conservative losses were more severe here than in most places, but on the other hand they were offset by a grand, potentially decisive victory. 
<p>
That victory is the heavily debated Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative. Prop. 209 passed 54% to 46%. It ran sixteen points ahead of Bob Dole, who broadcast about $2 million worth of advertisements in its favor in the last ten days. It ran 3 points ahead of Bill Clinton, who opposed it throughout the campaign, actively at the end when his own victory was certain. The opposition campaign spent about as much as all proponents together, excluding the amount the CCRI campaign spent gathering signatures, mostly in 1995. 
<p>
The initiative was therefore very strong. Read its operative language to the voters today in any state, and more than 60% of them will support it. A good campaign on its behalf by the Republican Party would have helped them substantially in California even in this bad year.
<p>
The battle was at the end as stormy as its subject matter foretold. The opposition finally got some support from the president both in fundraising and in public statements. They used the money to show advertisements featuring David Duke, side by side with Newt Gingrich, as the key supporter of 209. Of course a cross burned brightly against a deep night in the background. In another ad, a male hand stripped a uniform off a police woman while a voice said, "take it off, take it all off." David Duke had in fact been invited into the state to speak for 209 by--naturally--the opposition, personified in this case by Blenda Wilson, administrator at California state university Northridge, who paid Duke $4,000 to come.
<p> 
This ranting was neither unexpected nor effective. Alas, the Republican campaign in favor of 209 was also crude, and much less heart felt, than these opposition ravings. In this failure is found the clearest lesson for the future. That lesson is easy to understand, and with a little virtue of the kind that statesmen must possess, easy to implement. 
<p> 
The lesson is clear from the history. The California Civil Rights initiative was conceived in 1992-93 by Glynn Custred and Tom Wood, who were driven by a commitment of principle, which led them to a brilliant practical insight. Their work began to get national press attention in late 1993-94; by early 1995 it was a highly celebrated cause. Polls showed right away that the language of the initiative was popular. This was no surprise, as race and gender preferences have never been liked by ordinary people.
<p>
In early 1995, Wood and Custred began the hard job of making the initiative happen. They recruited help, among those who came along was Arnie Steinberg, myself, and eventually Ward Connerly, who would carry heavy burdens very far. Gradually an excellent team was assembled.
<p>
It should be noted that these people favored the initiative for its own sake. They did not think it their job to make it a partisan matter. They sought to place it first upon the March 1996 primary ballot, which would give maximum possibility for bi-partisan support. They sought to make a coalition with the Democratic Leadership Council in California. They knew, of course, that Democrats would mostly oppose the initiative. They knew that the Democratic Party is deeply invested in the preferences and quotas that Proposition 209 will eliminate wherever it reaches. Therefore the Republican opportunity would be there, if the Republican Party were able to seize it. 
<p>
By the second quarter of 1995, CCRI was a national issue. In July 1995 President Clinton made a major address endorsing affirmative action: "mend it, don't end it." The following week Senator Dole put his name on a bill written in the House by Florida Congressman Charles Canady and his committee staffer William McGrath. Dole had called Canady to ask to be co-sponsor of the bill. Canady, who hoped to put that bill on the desk of Bill Clinton within a year, could not refuse the Senate majority leader. Dole thereby stole a march on Phil Gramm. He had the advantage and the power to use it to produce legislation, at least in the Senate. He could make the bill move. Would he? 
<p>
He did not. In both the House and the Senate, the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act was trapped in committee, and despite gallant efforts it never got out. Together with welfare and partial birth abortion (another Canady initiative), it could have formed the core of a national debate reaching to the fundamental differences between the parties. 
<p>
The Republicans in Congress needed this debate, even if they were not ready for it.  Our Constitution is not so arranged as to permit one branch of government to alter major policy by itself. The obvious conclusion is that Republicans, if they are in fact the party of change, must seek to control both houses of Congress and the presidency. The urgent work therefore is not partial solutions in Medicare. The urgent work is to demonstrate to the people where they differ in principle, upon central matters, from the president. If these differences are clear, then the people will be able to make an informed choice the next time they get to vote. This strategy was not followed generally, and it was not followed in particular upon civil rights.
<p>
Bill Clinton was ready. In his July 1995 speech he gave a ringing endorsement of "affirmative action," the useful term that means either outreach or preferences, depending upon the hearer and the speaker.  Consider these finely crafted phrases from the president:
<p>
<blockquote><I>Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean--and I don't favor--the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean--and I don't favor--numerical quotas. It doesn't mean - and I don't favor -- rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit.</I></blockquote>
<p>
With these words the president sets his limits upon race and sex preferences in government action. The first sentence means that favoring the unqualified over the qualified on account of race and sex can be justified. The second sentence means "quotas" that are not "numerical" are fine. The third means that race and sex can be a factor, even the main or overwhelming factor, even when they have nothing to do with the matter at hand, so long as they are not the "only" factor. 
<p>
President Clinton was then passionate and strong--and utterly equivocal. The surest way to clear up the equivocation was to present him with a bill and force him to sign it or veto it. That opportunity was lost by the inaction of the Congress, led of course by Senator/candidate Bob Dole.
<p>
Back in California, the CCRI struggled to qualify. Speaker Gingrich, resisted by his staff, did good anyway by signing a fundraising letter on its behalf.  Finally the resources of all the key participants came together to get the initiative qualified.  Ward Connerly, generous Californians such as Darrel Issa, Dusty Rhodes from New York and others across the country, joined the campaign team and the Republican Party to make qualification and a vigorous campaign possible.
<p>
But the party and Dole treated the initiative in just the same way that they treated the Dole-Canady bill in Congress. They made sure it was there, as a place holder. But they made no commitment to argue for it. 
Candidate Dole endorsed CCRI in late March 96. Shortly thereafter he published an article in its favor in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>. Then. . .nothing. The press began to notice that preferences had no place in Dole speeches. His California strategist, Ken Kachigian, stated at a press conference that the campaign might have little to do with the issue. On June 20, the <I>Times</I> wrote a front page story about Dole's moving away from it. This continued through the summer until past the convention, at which Connerly was not allowed to speak.  The accession of Kemp to the ticket brought his endorsement, but thereafter Dole was almost silent and Kemp was equivocal.
<p>
Throughout this long period, the Dole campaign had little money that it could spend legally on its own behalf. It tore its hair out trying to generate favorable media to offset the large advertising budgets of Clinton and his union friends. It failed, partly because the candidate had little to say. 
<p>
Dole might have spent the summer bringing up case after case of preferences.  He could have started with the wonderful case of Cheryl Hopwood in Texas, in which an appellate court ruled that the University of Texas had excluded her from law school admission because of her color. The Clinton Administration appealed the case, to attempt to get the Supreme Court to rule that race and gender preferences are lawful. Thus he took a plain and open position. Dole said nothing. 
<p>
The Hopwood case illustrates what is in fact happening in public bureaucracies all over America. In truth and in demonstrated fact, the government systematically categorizes and selects--and also necessarily excludes--on the basis of race and gender. It also hides what it does. When it is found out, its officials often lie. When they are confronted, they employ intimidation, then bribery, then finally compromise covered by the assertion that this particular case is an anomaly.  This is the behavior revealed in case after case arising when a stubborn and tough person sues against the system of official preference. This is the pattern of behavior that is proved by these cases to be common in government bodies in every part of the country. 
<p>
The pattern of action does not occur by any accident. Race preference today is a government practice built upon the idea that human beings are clay, molded by past experience into distorted shapes, needing some shaping up by government to put them right.  It is a despotic idea. It makes us objects to be acted upon. It destroys the idea of the citizen, inviolable in his rights, to be governed only by consent. It makes the officials of the government sovereign.
<p>
Dole might have spent some time, then, arguing in favor of his own position, which God bless him for having, but about which he was mute.  He might even have used his massive power to raise funds to help CCRI put up its own advertisements, which were made to argue the case on the highest ground. All of these steps would have won him news.  They would have shown voters he was serious about the issue.  They would have established an argument that he could pursue in the debates and during the heat of the campaign. 
<p>
Dole and the Republican Party squandered these months, which were rich with opportunity. The consequences were fatal. Having no strategy in Congress except to stall, no strategy in the public debate except to duck, they were driven at the end to film television spots with ten days to go. The work was ham fisted and had to be redone at least twice. The people of California had every right to think that this fundamental issue was being used out of desperation as a tool of low politics. 
<p>
We can draw a lesson from the election in California. In a bad year, when an able president of the left ran a splendid campaign to the right and got away with it, an issue of high principle was fought and won. This issue does not appear to the voters primarily as a question of money or interest. It raises in simple form the question what is government for, and what is the standing of the citizen before it. It has proved more useful than all the clever stunts and strategems, all the polls and focus groups that millions can purchase. 
<p>
 We should continue this debate. We should advance it in the Congress and in every state. We should not think of it or speak of it as a wedge issue, but rather as a matter of right and justice. We should build a great political movement upon this plain idea that we are equal before the law, that government is limited, and that the rights of all are to be protected by it equally. 
<p>
Finally, we should search until we find politicans who can speak up for it. The art of statesmanship is the application of principle to policy. Here is a chance to practice that art, difficult but decisively rewarding.

<P>
THE DEBATE OVER RACE AND gender-based quotas and preferences in
California law often assumes a clinical tone as lawyers, political
scientists, statisticians, and politicians present various sides
of the issue. Certainly all of these perspectives construct the
framework for rational discourse and provide a means by which
to weigh important concepts like fairness, equality before the
law, justice, and social welfare. But such a structure falls short
of offering a full understanding of the impact these race-based
preferences have on society at large. 
<P>
This debate, the unfortunate outgrowth of affirmative action policies,
cannot be reduced to mere statistics over who was excluded or
included because of these policies, or to narrow points of legal
interpretation. Far more accurately, the impact of quotas and
preferences is an indelible, often life-jarring experience in
the life of an aspiring, promising and innocent young person,
and it is their experience that must be explained for the issue
to be fully understood. 
<P>
The reason is simple. Almost never does the student come face
to face with the ostensibly well-meaning government bureaucrat,
responsible for enforcing affirmative action policies, who denied
his admission. Almost never does the aspiring fireman meet the
enforcement officer who decides that whites will be barred from
applying for new openings because of their race. And almost never
do we, as citizens, meet the people who are courageous enough
to stand up to the system.
<P>
The purpose of this paper is to explore a few of those lives,
and in a limited way, to understand the trauma, frustration, and
disappointment which have been deliberately, often systematically,
inflicted upon them by their own government. This is what the
debate over racial and gender programs is all about: not academic
discussions in lecture halls, but the sense of futility, injustice,
and frustration which is suffered often in silence by people whose
only offense is the color of their skin, and the policies which
are increasingly interrupting, derailing, scarring and sometimes
destroying the lives of innocent people. What do their experiences
tell about the true nature of these policies, the injury these
policies inflict, the tactics by which they are imposed, and the
damage which they do to the actual victims?
<P>
The victims of reverse discrimination studied and interviewed
here are involved in many areas of government including civil
service promotions, public contracting, university admissions
and college courses. There is no shortage of first-hand experience.
With nearly a fourth of public contracts set aside for special,
non-merit based preferences, with more than a third of university
admissions largely dependent upon the race of the applicants and
with promotions within agencies widely subject to racial quotas,
the only difficulty in focusing on individual instances is that
there are so many of them from which to choose. The following
cases offer an important insight into the tragic consequences
of affirmative action on the lives of everyday Californians.<BR>

<CENTER><I>The Story of Lydia McDonald, </I></CENTER>
<P>

</I></CENTER>
<P>
By any realistic measure of opportunity, Lydia McDonald should
not have come so far. It was the fall of 1995 and Lydia, like
thousands of other high school seniors, carefully polished her
application to one of the most prestigious schools in America:
the University of California at Berkeley. 
<P>
It seems cruelly implausible that she should have even entertained
such a dream. The product of a broken home, she lived with her
disabled mother and brother in a one-bedroom apartment in Los
Angeles. The family's entire annual income for the last two years
was roughly $15,000, mainly from her mother's SSI check and the
few odd jobs Lydia and her brother could find. Lydia's childhood
was a jumble of cross-country moves, charity hand-outs from local
churches and food stamps.
<P>
When her parents divorced, Lydia's mother knew she had to go back
to school to get a job which would pay for the family's needs.
Lydia remembers, &quot;She would go to school all day and work
all night and get her homework done in-between. She worked in
different jobs: data entry; McDonald's for a while. She got her
credential in architectural drafting and after that she got a
job for $12 an hour and I thought, 'wow.' That's more money than
we had ever imagined. She just loved that job because people treated
her with respect. She wanted me to get into a college. She said,
'You have to come home and do your homework. She was very strict
about when it was time to do homework. She knew it would end up
for the best. She showed us by example that if she could do it,
we could.&quot; When Lydia was 16, a back injury disabled her
mother, leaving the family destitute again.
<P>
What kept Lydia going? &quot;I don't know. I was just always thinking,
if I worked hard, just did the best in my classes; if I just did
the best that I could that I'd end up doing something good.&quot;
<P>
Whatever it was that drove Lydia McDonald, by the autumn of 1995,
she had arrived at the very gates of Cal Berkeley. Her transcripts
documented the near impossible GPA of 4.5, carried far beyond
a perfect 4.0 by the volume of advanced placement courses she
had mastered. Her Academic Index Score, the combination of various
tests required for admission, was 7,180 out of a perfect 8,000.
Hardly the bookish type, Lydia was also an accomplished athlete,
having placed fifth in her age group in the grueling Los Angeles
Marathon that year. 
<P>
Enter Allan Favish. Favish ran a small one-man law practice in
the San Fernando Valley and had developed a keen interest in racial
discrimination in California law. He had earned a reputation for
confronting the University of California with its obviously discriminatory
policies.
<P>
&quot;If you get any law or medical school application,&quot;
he explained, &quot;there's language in there somewhere that 'in
accord with federal civil rights laws, the University of California
does not discriminate on the basis of race.' Well, it's just a
lie.&quot; 
<P>
In 1993, Favish set out to prove the lie. In October, Favish requested
the GPAs, test scores, and races of all applicants to the UCLA
School of Law, which is public information as long as students'
names are omitted. He received a curt reply that the information
did not exist. &quot;I sent another letter and said, 'You just
admitted this class, and obviously that information was available
then. Why is it not available now?' I got no reply.&quot; In late
1993, Favish filed suit against the University under the California
Public Records Act. The information that had not been available
to him with a polite letter suddenly appeared on his desk under
threat of a court order. 
<P>
It took Favish eight months to enter the data from 5,000 applicants
into his home computer. &quot;I found that if you were white or
Asian, you had a very low chance of getting accepted if you were
not an &quot;A&quot; student; an &quot;A&quot; student with at
least a 3.5 GPA and at least a 90th percentile LSAT score. However,
your chances were a lot better if you were a &quot;B&quot; or
&quot;C&quot; student if you were black or Hispanic.&quot;
<P>
Favish caused a stir when he published his findings in the Los
Angeles Daily News in late 1994, followed by a unique lawsuit
against the University of California claiming consumer fraud.
Favish alleged that the University had engaged in fraudulent consumer
advertising by promising students that the University did not
discriminate on the basis of race, when in practice, clearly it
did. &quot;We took data and I made charts and tables that would
show very vividly that people's chances for admission depended
on what race they were and I asked the court to order that the
charts be published in the application material so applicants
could see whether it was worth 40 bucks just to apply to the school,&quot;
Favish explains.
<P>
One day, Favish was visiting at a friend's house. The friend's
daughter, a high school teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, knew Favish was involved in the affirmative action debate,
asked Favish if she could talk with him about a situation involving
racial preferences. She said, &quot;I have a very bright student
who applied to colleges and very, very much wanted to go to UC-Berkeley.
She just got a rejection letter mentioning race and was devastated.
Would you like to look into this and see what you can do?&quot;
<P>
Allan Favish called Lydia McDonald the next day. Lydia had been
so sure of her qualifications and so determined to get into UC-Berkeley
that she had only applied to a few schools. Strapped for cash,
Lydia could not afford to file many applications. Besides, Berkeley
was her dream. 
<P>
That dream had shattered in March, when she received a form letter
from Director of Admissions Bob Laird. The letter began by explaining
that the university had received 24,900 applications for 9,000
places, and &quot;I regret that we cannot offer you admission
for the fall semester, 1996.&quot; Lydia and the teachers who
were rooting for her were dumbfounded. It was inconceivable to
them that she would not have been welcomed at Cal Berkeley. More
than one third of all applicants had been accepted, but not this
extraordinary student who had overcome so much.
<P>
&quot;I went to school the next day and so many people I went
to school with had gotten in there and many of them weren't into
studying and doing their work,&quot; Lydia recalls. &quot;I just
cried.&quot;
<P>
She didn't tell her mother about the rejection. She kept it a
secret from her family while she waited to hear from the few other
schools to which she applied. 
<P>
Laird's letter gave a glimmer of insight into the reason for her
summary rejection. &quot;While giving preference to California
residents, we sought an academically strong freshman class which
includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic,
racial and socio-economic backgrounds, as well as one that represents
a broad array of talents and interests.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;When I first talked to her,&quot; says Favish, &quot;I explained
to her what I was doing with my fraud suit against the University
of California. She had actually read that boiler plate language
(regarding the University's non-discriminatory policy) in the
application. She had heard of affirmative action before, but it
never hit home as something that could affect her.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;She was really devastated,&quot; Favish recalls. &quot;Especially
after working so hard under very difficult socioeconomic conditions.
She was really crushed. Lydia's teacher said she was just a different
person after she got the rejection letter. The racial aspect to
the letter just totally shocked her.
<P>
&quot;I don't know why she didn't try to appeal the rejection.
She was just very sad. I said, 'Let me look into how an appeal
is filed. I will file it for you.'&quot;
<P>
Favish prepared a three-page protest to Laird, reiterating Lydia's
background, her struggle against adversity, and her stellar academic
and extracurricular record. He went on, &quot;Her rejection is
even more troubling given the professed concern by so many supporters
of race and sex preferences for the alleged plight of high school
females who are supposedly too intimidated to achieve their full
potential in math and science courses. In Lydia you have an applicant
who is female, socio-economically disadvantaged, excellent in
math and science and wants to be an engineer. I would have thought
that you would want to admit Lydia, if for no other reason than
to study her.&quot;
<P>
What Favish already knew, and stated quite bluntly in his protest,
is that there was no other &quot;reason for Lydia's rejection
other than the fact that she is not black, Chicano or Native American.&quot;
<P>
The University's first response was the same stone wall that so
many applicants encounter. Although Favish was acting pro bono
as Lydia's attorney, Laird simply dismissed his formal protest
as a &quot;third party inquiry.&quot; She could write directly,
Laird said, but he clearly implied it would do her no good. &quot;Although
we received over 500 decision appeals in our fall 1995 admissions
process, fewer than 30 were ultimately granted admission.&quot;
<P>
Amber Preshica had run into the same wall of silence at Cal Berkeley.
She had applied for admission to the same freshman class, with
a 4.5 GPA, and SAT scores almost identical to Lydia's. Amber had
been Senior Class President at her high school, and worked part
time jobs to save for her expected admission to Cal Berkeley.
The material she received promised that her test scores should
have summarily qualified her for the freshman class. She, too,
was baffled by her letter of rejection.
<P>
Amber simply wanted to know why she did not measure up. &quot;I
had (minority) friends who got in with lower GPAs.&quot; She wrote
letters. She filed an appeal. She even visited the campus. An
admissions counselor told her she should go to a two-year junior
college &quot;because it was easier to qualify.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;They never really told me why,&quot; Preshica lamented.
&quot;I kept asking, please answer why I was not accepted.&quot;
Her parents, and even a UC Regent, tried to get answers. &quot;Everybody
in the University we've talked to, they try not to talk to us
too long. They don't want to tell us.&quot;
<P>
Hayley Ulrich also applied for the same freshman class. She had
a GPA of 4.4 and SAT scores placing her in the 90th percentile
of California students. Like Preshica and McDonald, Ulrich had
a Hispanic friend who had been admitted to Cal Berkeley with only
average grades and test scores. Indeed, according to the University's
own statistics, about half the entering class had academic records
inferior to hers. Ulrich was valedictorian of her senior class
and competed on the varsity track team. She worked part time and
volunteered in a homeless-aid program. She received the same form
letter from Bob Laird. 
<P>
&quot;If some less-qualified students were admitted to UC-Berkeley
on the basis of their race and color...then my daughter's face
is the face of the entire affirmative action debate,&quot; Hayley's
father wrote to Governor Pete Wilson. Hayley applied instead to
West Point, and was immediately accepted.
<P>
Favish prepared a letter for Lydia McDonald to sign, formally
appealing her rejection and asking the precise reasons for it.
She asked specifically to know her Personal Characteristics and
Achievement Score, a number determined by a highly subjective
and secretive formula which the University assigns to applicants.
<P>
Faced with the imminent threat of a lawsuit, the University backed
down, but told Lydia that she would not be allowed to enter until
the spring semester, and could not enroll in any other four-year
institution in the meantime. This presented Lydia with an impossible
situation. After her rejection from Berkeley, she had half-heartedly
accepted admission to UC-Santa Cruz and had already made living
arrangements there. But there was more. The gutsy coed who had
overcome so much adversity in her lifetime had grown completely
disillusioned with the process. Cal Berkeley no longer shined
with the same luster and allure that had made it her best hope.
Lydia's dream had soured. When Lydia McDonald finally received
her letter of acceptance, she turned it down.
<P>
&quot;There were many reasons,&quot; Lydia reflects. &quot;Everybody
I knew who had gotten in were either white and rich or a minority.
I was white and poor. That left me nowhere. I doubt I would have
fit in. If that's the way they choose their students, just based
on what race they are or what culture they are, I didn't want
to go there. I lost all respect for what I thought was a good
school.
<P>
&quot;For me it didn't end at Berkeley. Even though I worked hard,
I'm still going to have a strong work ethic. Just because I don't
go to school with a big name doesn't mean I'm not going to learn
what I need to know.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Janine Jacinto<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janine Jacinto simply wanted to help less fortunate people through
a career in social work. Despite the demands of raising four children,
she had found time to serve for many years on her church's Board
of Social Ministry. She worked actively in &quot;Habitat for Humanity,&quot;
the organization devoted to providing housing for poor families,
whose boosters include former President Jimmy Carter. But she
wanted to do more.
<P>
In 1989, Janine decided to go back to school. She enrolled in
community college classes at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton,
earning an Associate of Arts Degree in June 1991. That fall, she
entered the California State University at Sacramento. The burdens
of raising her children, driving nearly an hour each way to classes
from the little town of Lodi, and struggling to pay the bills
with part-time work as a tutor and teaching assistant, weighed
heavily on her. Yet, through all her travail, she maintained a
GPA of 3.89. She developed a keen interest in cultural anthropology.
She conducted extensive field work with underprivileged groups,
including Mexican-American farm workers in Galt and Southeast
Asian women in Stockton.
<P>
Janine's professors saw tremendous potential in her work, and
encouraged her to apply to the University's Graduate Program for
Social Work to begin studying for her masters degree. As she read
the University's prospectus, she thought it seemed as if the program
had been developed with her in mind. The application promised
that students would be chosen for their intellectual capacity,
personal maturity, motivation, previous academic work, background
experiences and potential for successful professional practice.
Her professors told her she was a natural. She spent hours perfecting
her application.
<P>
In June 1994, with her children looking on, Janine received her
Bachelor of Arts Degree, magna cum laude, in anthropology. A few
months before, she had been inducted into the Gold Key National
Honor Society. 
<P>
Even more prestigious, though, was her induction into the honor
society of Phi Kappa Phi. The night of the installation dinner
was one of the proudest moments in Janine Jacinto's life. University
President Don Gerth told the small group of honorees that they
were &quot;the cream of the crop,&quot; and the &quot;best the
University had to offer.&quot; He challenged them to go forth
and to become leaders in the community.
<P>
Just a few days after that memorable evening, with President Gerth's
proud challenge still ringing in her ears, Janine received the
long-awaited letter from the graduate school. The form letter,
from program Director Juan D. Hernandez, explained that &quot;The
faculty evaluated applicants on the basis of the personal statement,
depth and breadth of experience in social work, personal references
and academic qualifications. Applicants were rated on the above
factors, and those with the highest ratings have been offered
positions in the entering class.&quot; 
<P>
Janine, however, would not be one of them. Because of so many
qualified applicants, &quot;we cannot offer you a position...We
trust that you will have other opportunities to realize your career
goals in the field of human services.&quot;
<P>
Janine was crushed and confused. &quot;It was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem. My initial reaction was, 'I'm not good enough.'
Then I began to think about some things I had been told, that
some of my professors said. One professor told me to 'Check the
Hispanic box. Your name sounds Hispanic.' But that wouldn't have
been true. Another professor told me, 'I'm glad you're going to
apply, but I want you to know that they're weighing ethnicity
heavily.' But I figured my own qualifications would compensate
for that.&quot; 
<P>
The next day, she waited until the end of her &quot;Poverty and
Homelessness&quot; class to speak with the professor who had been
so supportive of her application. The professor was incredulous.
&quot;Oh Janine,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm surprised. You're one
of the best students I've had.&quot; Janine had obviously fallen
short in some part of the admissions process, but the professor
said it would be difficult to pinpoint the precise reason. The
criteria used by the admissions committee to evaluate applicants
were &quot;extremely confidential,&quot; and known only to the
professors on the committee.
<P>
With no way of knowing why she had been rejected, Janine had no
hope of proceeding. The dream she had worked so hard to attain
had just crashed into a solid wall. How many other Janine Jacintos
have been forced at that point to abandon their plans is impossible
to speculate. An inconsolable sense of resignation would have
been the natural response.
<P>
The only reason we know of Janine Jacinto's case is because of
one of those extraordinary coincidences that happen perhaps once
in a lifetime. 
<P>
Another student who had been waiting to see the professor jumped
into the conversation. &quot;I know how they do the ratings.&quot;
<P>
&quot;How can you know?&quot; the professor asked dismissively.
&quot;I don't even know.&quot; 
<P>
The student was quite matter-of-fact as she rummaged through her
knapsack. &quot;Because I have the rating sheet.&quot;
<P>
The professor was appalled. &quot;How did you get hold of that?
That's highly confidential.&quot;
<P>
The student explained that as she had waited for an appointment
to see a faculty advisor earlier in the day, she had noticed a
photocopied rating sheet in a stack of admission material on a
table in the waiting area. Thinking it was an informational hand-out,
she had taken it. Now she realized what she had. In her knapsack
was the crumpled dream of Janine Jacinto. Janine intensely studied
the three pages of rating instructions. 
<P>
Each applicant was awarded points for various aspects of his or
her background and qualifications, with a perfect score being
38. Applicants were required to have a minimum GPA of 2.5, for
which they automatically received five points, leaving a discretionary
range of 33 points. The difference between the minimum GPA of
2.5 and a perfect GPA of 4.0 was three additional points. This,
obviously, wasn't the most important criterion. Although neither
the university admissions catalogue nor her letter of rejection
even hinted at it, the most important single quality the university
sought was not academic background, personal maturity, experience
or potential. Although the difference between the minimum and
maximum GPA was three points, the race of an applicant was worth
an automatic five points. Of the 33 discretionary points awarded
to applicants, all aspects of race and ethnicity accounted for
up to 13 points. Janine Jacinto had been born the wrong color.
<P>
Janine made another appointment to see Professor Lum, a faculty
advisor. She began the meeting by describing the irony and anguish
she felt when she received the letter of rejection, just days
after being inducted into Phi Kappa Phi. The advisor feigned sympathy
and puzzlement. &quot;I'd like to see my evaluation sheet,&quot;
she told him.
<P>
Prof. Lum frowned. &quot;No,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;That
is confidential.&quot; Instead, he asked her about her qualifications.
He asked her about her volunteer experience in social work. He
asked her about her language skills; did she speak a second language?
She replied that she not only spoke a second language fluently,
but that she tutored it. But it was the politically incorrect
language of Italian. That's worth extra points, he assured her.
&quot;No, I don't believe it is,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course
it is,&quot; soothed Prof. Lum.
<P>
Janine had finally heard one untruth too many. She informed Lum
that she had seen the rating instructions, and that it was her
race that was wrong. Janine was amazed at the look of shock which
suddenly crossed the advisor's face. &quot;That stopped him cold,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;That was the end of the questions about
my qualifications.&quot; Lum immediately directed her to the graduate
advisor or the school's director, Prof. Hernandez. &quot;I know
you'll be admitted to the program,&quot; he told her.
<P>
It was an ironic moment in Janine Jacinto's life. She had been
driven by a commitment to improve opportunity for the disadvantaged,
the underprivileged, those who had been victims of discrimination.
Now she was staring straight into the face of official discrimination,
with all its smarmy prevarication, rank hypocrisy and moral cowardice.
And she was the victim.
<P>
During the next several weeks, Janine pondered her options. The
demeanor of her &quot;Poverty and Home-lessness&quot; professor
changed. &quot;What are you going to do now, Janine?&quot; the
professor would repeatedly ask her. &quot;It's not like you to
make a lot of noise about something like this.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;I got the feeling she was being pressured to find out what
I was going to do,&quot; Janine said. Janine finally decided to
make another appointment, but not with the Department chair. One
spring day in 1994, Janine's sense of social conscience brought
her to a fledgling law firm in Sacramento, Diespenbrock and Costa,
which handled a growing caseload of civil litigation.
<P>
As her story unfolded, attorneys John Virga and Dan Costa knew
that Janine presented an opportunity to drive deep into the University's
darkest secret: systematic, deliberate and officially sanctioned
racial discrimination. Although she could certainly use the money,
Janine wasn't looking for the kind of multi-million dollar awards
which are routinely given to victims who suffer far less injustice
than had she. Janine wanted something far more important to a
woman with her sense of social duty: she wanted to stop the injustice.
<P>
Costa was excited as he thought of the coming trial. Subpoenaed
material and testimony would clearly reveal the nature of racial
discrimination within the University, its extent, and the way
it has been covered up. It would also help to discover other Janine
Jacintos whose dreams are killed every day by a process which
is hidden behind the sympathetic shrugs of faculty advisors and
the inertia of the bureaucracy.
<P>
Obviously the University sensed precisely the same outcome. Shortly
after the suit was filed, the University's legal counsel contacted
Janine's attorneys. The State of California was intensely interested
in settling the case immediately-and quietly. 
<P>
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the University's attorney asked
Costa at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the program?
She's in,&quot; he said.
<P>
The answer was simple. For herself, she only wanted to be made
whole for the time she had lost and the expenses she had incurred.
But for others who followed, she wanted the University to stop
the sham. 
<P>
The only thing the University wanted was to keep the entire affair
quiet. They wanted no discussion of the case in the press, no
publicity, no stories like this one to tell of Jacinto's experience.
Oddly, the University's motto is &quot;Vox, Veritas, Vita&quot;-Voice,
Truth, Life - but officials were insistent that the truth Janine
Jacinto had discovered within the University would be given no
voice. She quickly responded that there would be no negotiation
on this point: what the University was doing was wrong, and it
would not be covered up.
<P>
On April 29, 1996, California State University officials paid
Jacinto her expenses and legal fees. That day, the University
also signed a settlement agreeing that the CSUS graduate program
for social work would never again consider applicants on any grounds
other than merit, and under no circumstance allow &quot;ethnicity&quot;
to be considered. 
<P>
On that day, one injustice, in one program, at one public university,
had been abolished because of a remarkable chain of events and
an equally remarkable mother of four whose ambition had been to
help others and whose only sin had been to have been born the
wrong color. How many such programs remain at other Departments
of CSUS, and at other institutions across California, is anyone's
guess.<BR>

More than a century ago, a man named Plessy boarded a train in
New Orleans, announced he was a Negro, and boldly proceeded to
seat himself in the coach designated for white passengers. Upon
refusing to move to the &quot;colored coach,&quot; he was arrested.
<P>
The vestiges of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine laid
down in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 still pervade California in
1996. Three years ago, a group of construction firms put up the
best bid to build part of a new subway system in Los Angeles.
Like Plessy, they also were denied their place on the train because
of their race.

Just as Mr. Plessy confronted the segregationist philosophy of
the Jim Crow South then, so now the public challenge to separatist
racial policies is continued by Michael Cornelius of San Diego
in his battle against the Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority.
<P>
As Vice President of Operations for Wagner Construction of San
Diego in 1993, Cornelius believed the hard work he put in on a
subcontract bid had ensured his company a portion of the largest
public-works project in the nation: the $5.8 billion subway project
underneath the city of Los Angeles.
<P>
Cornelius successfully bid to a general contractor, PCL Construction
Services, for a contract to build a subway station at Western
and Vermont Avenues. Its share of the $38 million project, about
$7 million, represented a potential windfall to Wagner and its
60 employees, who did about $10 million in business each year.
<P>
The close of bidding brought celebration to the Wagner offices.
PCL Construction's bid had beaten all others by more than $3 million.
Employees at Wagner were in a &quot;euphoric mode,&quot; as Cornelius
describes it. In anticipation of the final award, they began planning
for the great challenge that lay before them.
<P>
They would never have the opportunity to meet that challenge.
The first bad news for Cornelius and his colleagues came soon
after the celebration began. The general contractor with the second-lowest
bid had filed a protest, charging PCL Construction with failure
to meet the goals for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises,&quot;
and demanding the company's disqualification. The Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority required 29 percent of all construction
work to go to &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot; (DBE's).
PCL Construction's bid included about 26.5 percent minority participation.
<P>
The MTA ruled in PCL's favor after a hearing. It found PCL indisputably
had the superior bid even though the minority participation was
technically below the goal. PCL Construction and Wagner now had
the issue settled. The award, they now believed, was finally theirs.
<P>
They were wrong. Unbeknownst to Cornelius or any of his colleagues
at the time, Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority had never before
accepted a bid that did not meet or surpass its &quot;goals&quot;,
and it did not intend to start. 
<P>
One month later, MTA bosses met behind closed doors and disqualified
PCL's bid, granting the contract instead to the bidder who had
filed the protest. MTA informed PCL that participation of minority-owned
businesses in their bid was unacceptably low. Nor, MTA continued,
had PCL and its subcontractors shown &quot;good faith&quot; in
working to meet those goals. 
<P>
Needless to say, the bid participants, white and minority alike,
were mystified as to how their recruitment efforts and their 26
percent level of minority participation constituted a lack of
good faith. Michael Cornelius, who had enlisted the help of minority
subcontractors for 35 percent of Wagner's subcontract without
the prodding of preferential regulations, wondered why the MTA
now seemed to enforce its &quot;goals&quot; as strict quotas.
<P>
PCL Construction brought legal action, charging MTA's preferential
policies were extreme-nearly three times the federal standard-and
discriminatory. However, the apparent discovery of an accounting
error soon after changed all of PCL's calculations. They determined
the bid of $38 million was too low to be profitable, and dropped
the case. 
<P>
It was obvious to those involved that political pressures had
more to do with PCL's decision than accounting errors. Wagner
Construction and the other subcontractors were also unwilling
to risk involvement in a high-profile case dealing with racial
politics. 
<P>
Cornelius, no longer with Wagner, was of a different mind. MTA
was enforcing racial quotas and that, he decided, was fundamentally
wrong. Now with little left to lose, Cornelius decided to fight
the burdensome and unfair system of racial quotas in the Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority. 
<P>
Since he represented none of the companies directly affected by
the MTA's decision, the first challenge was to establish Cornelius'
standing in court. He could have claimed his lost commission,
but Cornelius sought no personal compensation by pursuing the
case. He had a larger purpose in mind. 
<P>
For years, Cornelius saw the tremendous waste of public money,
in the hundreds of millions of dollars in California alone, that
resulted when agencies refused to accept the lowest bid for public
contracts. He had seen the most qualified bid passed over time
and again for the second, third, and even fourth-lowest bid. In
the case of the L.A. subway, a boondoggle of a project already
$2 billion over budget and three years behind schedule, MTA's
insistence on continuing its preferential policies cost taxpayers
an additional $3 million to build the Western Avenue station.
<P>
To make matters much worse, the contractor who had successfully
protested Cornelius' bid was involved in the most spectacular
disaster of the entire project. In 1994, the ground underneath
the site of a Hollywood Boulevard station gave way. Portions of
the Hollywood Walk of Fame were swallowed by a sinkhole, and businesses
along the strip were forced to close. Given their predicament,
MTA's emphasis on hiring the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; rather
than the most qualified contractors seemed particularly inappropriate.
<P>
With the overwhelming evidence of his own experience, Cornelius
filed suit not only on his own behalf, but on behalf of all taxpayers.
He asserted that the use of quotas by government agencies violated
the public trust in preventing taxpayers, the financiers and beneficiaries
of these projects, from getting the best work available at the
lowest price. After spending $32,000 out of his own pocket on
legal fees, attorneys Robert Corry of the Pacific Legal Foundation
and Paul Mahoney agreed to take on MTA's high-priced lawyers pro
bono.
<P>
The trial appeared at first to be a monumental mismatch-a $6 billion
government agency against a solitary citizen. But in 1995, the
lower court found in favor of Cornelius and the taxpayers, ruling
MTA's system of quotas unconstitutional. The court cited U.S.
Supreme Court rulings that policies of group preference must be
designed to remedy a proven pattern of past discrimination. MTA
had no basis on which to justify its 29 percent quota.
<P>
Proceedings for MTA's appeal begin this fall. With that, Cornelius
notes an additional waste of taxpayer money: local agencies are
required to take advantage of every legal channel available when
the court rules against standing law. As rulings against quotas
and preferences in public contracting increase, so do the costs
to taxpayers for those appeals. 
<P>
Cornelius hopes his case takes another step towards alleviating
this unfair burden to the nation's hard-working taxpayers, but
there is still a considerable legal fight ahead. The Clinton Administration
is now weighing-in on the side of MTA, as are the City and County
of San Francisco. The continuing legal battle also means Cornelius
must continue to bear the ridicule of the local press. &quot;I'm
their proverbial 'angry white male,'&quot; Cornelius shrugs; &quot;I
don't consider myself an angry person.&quot; 
<P>
All told, preferential treatment policies amount to billions of
dollars in inefficiency and waste nationwide. But the greater
iniquity, which Michael Cornelius so selflessly overlooks in his
public quest, is that which he has suffered because of his race.
And that injustice can never be undone. <BR>

<CENTER><B>&quot;Then We Can't Use You&quot;: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Fontana Steel<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Paul Ware grew up in the dusty little town of Fontana, California,
about 54 miles inland from Los Angeles. &quot;It was just a little
chicken town, population 6,000,&quot; his son, Don, remembers.
Paul and his wife, Dorothy, had taken over the small family farm
after the Second World War, raising chickens and selling a few
hundred boxes of produce each year. It was enough to get by, but
with a growing family of seven children, Paul and Dorothy knew
that the modest family farm would not be enough.
<P>
In 1946, Paul foresaw the coming of a post-war construction boom
in California. He lacked the start-up capital he needed for a
business, but he found he could make a little extra money by contracting
out labor on local steel projects. Little by little, his business
grew.
<P>
He worked 14-hour days and seven-day weeks to keep the farm running
and to build his backyard steel contracting business, helped sometimes
by friends he could hire on weekends. &quot;I remember the first
job I went out on,&quot; says his son Don, now the company president.
&quot;I was eight. Dad had a 1947 Chevy Woody that held nine people.
The guys would all show up at the house and drive all the way
to Tehachapi, about 140 miles, to the job.&quot; Everyone in the
family worked, and Dorothy's thriftiness became legendary, even
catching the attention of the Los Angeles Times in 1953.
<P>
The Ware family's sweat and sacrifice those years slowly amassed
the nest egg that Paul needed to buy steel directly, and become
a supplier himself. He bought a small yard in Fontana and devised
make-shift equipment to handle the steel. But when he tried to
place his first order, he was stopped dead. The steel mills' customers
didn't welcome the additional competition that the gritty upstart
promised, and Paul could not find anyone to sell him the steel
he needed to enter the market. &quot;He was just a little guy
getting too big for them,&quot; his son recalls.
<P>
Paul was getting desperate as payments on the idle yard mounted
and the prospect for expansion grew dimmer. But Paul Ware was
a fighter, and every time a door slammed in his face, he tried
another. Four hundred miles from Fontana, he knocked on the door
of Pacific State Steel of San Francisco. Within a few weeks, the
first delivery reached Paul Ware's backyard operation, which he
dubbed &quot;Fontana Steel.&quot;
<P>
In the years that followed, Fontana Steel grew into a thriving
enterprise that played a role in some of the biggest public works
projects in California's history: the California Water Project,
the Feather River Project, the Golden State Freeway, the Century
Freeway. At its zenith, Fontana Steel employed more than 500 employees.
<P>
Ware built his business on a solid reputation. Don Ware remembers,
&quot;He was one of these guys who always kept his word. He never
once reneged on making a payment. He was so sympathetic to the
small businesses that we bought things from, I saw him borrow
from the bank to pay his bills on time. He was never one to wait
till he got paid to take care of his commitments. He's 87 now,
and still comes to the office in the morning and if he finds a
bill that says 'SECOND REQUEST,' he circles it and writes something
like, 'How come?' on it and our accounts payable person gets called
on the carpet.&quot; 
<P>
Ware's workers are a mix of the surrounding communities, about
52 percent white and 48 percent from minority groups, mainly Hispanic
and African-American. &quot;This company's always felt that a
person's color is not important,&quot; Don says. &quot;If a person
can do the job, that's all that matters. We always looked at the
ability. If they had the ability, they had the job.&quot; 
<P>
The sense of family goes far beyond the management. &quot;We have
second generations working here. I know of a couple of guys who
worked here over 20 years. Their dads worked here and retired
from here.&quot; 
<P>
Don recounts times when Fontana workers got into minor scrapes
with the law. &quot;We got them job furloughs so they could keep
working. We picked them up in the morning and dropped them off
at night. They were family people; retired now. Guys who had wives
and kids. You know.&quot;
<P>
Today, Fontana steel is only a fraction of its former size. The
booming 500-employee company is now down to only 125 workers,
in large part because state law disqualified the Ware family from
bidding on public works contracts, which made up about 65 percent
of its business. It's not the fault of the company or the workers.
It's Paul Ware's fault. He is white.
<P>
In the 1980s the state of California enacted a series of laws
requiring that a fifth of all contracts be set aside for minority-
or women-owned companies. Despite the fact that half of Fontana's
employees are from minority groups, the fact that Paul is white
makes it impossible for the company to bid on Caltrans contracts
except as a supplier. The impact on Fontana Steel was devastating.
<P>
&quot;It started happening in the '80s,&quot; Don recalls. &quot;We
would bid jobs and the contractor taking our quotes would ask
us if we were an MBE (minority business enterprise) or a WBE (woman
business enterprise). When we said 'no,' they said, 'then we can't
use you.'&quot; 
<P>
Ten years ago, contractors across California sought out Fontana
Steel because of a rock-solid 50-year reputation for dependability,
reliability, and cost control. Now, a recent letter from Kasler
Corporation to Don Ware is commonplace:
<P>
&quot;We appreciate your quote for furnishing and installing the
rebar on the Chino Hills project...Although your quote was low,
we were unable to use it as we had to accept a higher price from
a certified minority in order to meet Caltrans' requirements.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The first time we were told that, we just couldn't hardly
believe it,&quot; Don says. &quot;We'd been in business and done
jobs for these contractors for years and suddenly we weren't going
to be eligible.&quot;
<P>
Fontana is now limited to being a material supplier on public
contracts; but that, too, has been fraught with peril for the
company. As minority firms with no previous business experience
suddenly flooded the vacuum, Fontana began selling steel to them.
&quot;Sixty percent of those guys went bust, owing us money,&quot;
Don recalls.
<P>
Although state laws require 23 percent of state contracts to be
set aside for minority, woman, or disabled veteran-owned businesses,
sub-contractors like Fontana have been shut out completely. Don
explains, &quot;Say you have a bridge [contract]. All they need
is to put a little dirt up there for a fill. The general contractor
does that. They do the dirt work and the concrete. They've always
done the concrete themselves, so where else can they get the minority
[business] except the rebar?&quot; Thus, a 23 percent set-aside
becomes a 100 percent quota for firms like Fontana.
<P>
The future of Fontana Steel is uncertain. &quot;We may end up
sooner or later becoming only a fabricator,&quot; Don worries.
&quot;If we closed out the installation part of our business,
it would leave at least another hundred people out of work.&quot;
<P>
Don grows solemn. &quot;I've done my best to take care of the
success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad has
given his whole life to the business. He had done without his
whole life and put all his money back in the company so that it
could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot; <BR>

<CENTER><B>Starting Out 10 Points Down:</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Jack Bras<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Jack Bras has been an architect in Northern California for 32
years. In that time he has worked with cities, counties and state
agencies, building his relationships with clients and a reputation
for quality work. The competitive nature of his profession demanded
such. Still, it was his solid reputation that made Jack most proud,
and enabled his small firm to prosper.
<P>
J. Jack Bras and Associates performed most of its contract services
with public utilities in California, like Pacific Bell. Bras first
worked with Pacific Bell in 1969, carefully cultivating that partnership
for many years. It was well worth the effort, as PacBell consistently
rewarded Bras' skill and hard work with new contracts. After Bras
added AT&amp;T to his clientele, the two utilities accounted for
more than half of his annual commerce.
<P>
The firm was enjoying its peak years in the late 1980's when the
rug was pulled out from under it. The California legislature passed
new requirements for state agencies to implement &quot;affirmative
action goals.&quot; These regulations required agencies to create
racial goals and timetables, including a minimum 23 percent participation
rate for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot;-any business
under at least 51 percent ownership of people from preferred racial,
ethnic and gender groups. As for many other white-owned firms,
the end of non-discriminatory competitive bidding meant turmoil
for Bras and Associates. 
<P>
In 1988, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the
governing body of the public utilities, began implementing its
policies to meet those demands. CPUC issued General Order #156,
ordering each of the utilities to create its own goals and timetables
for hiring minorities. Though state law specifically expressed
that goals were neither &quot;a requirement nor a quota&quot;
but merely a &quot;target,&quot; the order empowered the Commission
to sanction utilities for failing to make &quot;acceptable progress
in the hiring of minority businesses.&quot;
<P>
Naturally, the threat of sanction had a chilling effect on the
utilities. The pressure to meet the &quot;goals&quot; and avoid
regulatory penalties forced Pacific Bell to create whole new contracting
procedures. These procedures included a form for &quot;prequalification
criteria&quot; sent out to contractors in February 1991.
<P>
PacBell normally evaluated its partners every three years, but
for the first time, Bras had to apply for an &quot;improved business
partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell. Though advertised as a way
to improve PacBell's competitiveness, the whole procedure struck
Bras as very unusual, since PacBell had always contracted with
many firms across the state. Nonetheless, he filled out the form
for &quot;prequalification criteria&quot; confident that he was
indeed qualified to continue the work he had performed for 22
years. 
<P>
Several months after the application process, rumors circulated
that Bras' company had not been chosen among those firms to enjoy
an &quot;improved business partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell.
A disconcerted Bras immediately fired off a letter to PacBell
executives for an explanation.
<P>
Bras received a response in June that indeed his firm would no
longer have a working relationship with Pacific Bell. Of 13 firms
from the San Francisco Bay Area, PacBell had chosen to do business
with just three. The results of the prequalification forms showed
Bras and Associates placed sixth out of the 13. PacBell admitted
that race and gender had been a factor, but would not have affected
his standing. They then assured him that &quot;your firm was very
competitive and was not eliminated due to any unsatisfactory performance.&quot;
<P>
Bras requested a personal meeting with his former partners for
further explanation. Behind closed doors, PacBell officials acknowledged
they used race and gender criteria in their decisions. PacBell
had been forced to limit its partnerships, and set aside the lion's
share of architectural contracts for minority businesses. 
<P>
Shocked by the news, Bras left that meeting with plenty of incentive
to challenge those policies. PacBell's procedure of awarding contracts
based on the contractor's race seemed to him grossly unfair, even
immoral. In 1992, Bras filed suit against Pacific Bell and the
Public Utilities Commission alleging discrimination on the basis
of race and gender. 
<P>
The evidence that came out during trial proceedings told the whole
story of the discrimination which Jack Bras and the other white
contractors suffered under the policy. Despite PacBell's earlier
contention that he was not eliminated due to his racial status,
Bras discovered he would have taken the third and final partnership
offered had race not been a consideration.
<P>
Specifically, Question #10 on the form asked, &quot;Are you currently
certified through the Cordoba Corporation Clearing House process
for Minority/Women Business Enterprise Status?&quot; The wrong
answer on this question proved very costly: Bras answered that
question in the negative and lost 10 points to his &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
competitors, the difference between placing sixth and third. 
<P>
These revelations encouraged Pacific Bell to settle its case with
Bras, but he continued the fight for an injunction against the
discriminatory policies employed by the Public Utilities Commission.
A lower court dealt Bras an early setback, but an appeals court
reversal in 1995 reestablishing Bras' legal standing sent CPUC
to the bargaining table. The case was finally settled in April
of 1996, when the CPUC agreed to remove any provision that &quot;authorizes
or permits a utility to utilize set-asides, preferences or grant
preferential treatment to&quot; businesses owned by women or minorities.
<P>
The efforts of Jack Bras were truly a significant victory for
equal rights and equal treatment for Californians. The settlement,
however, was some matter of sacrifice for Bras personally: during
his suit against Pacific Bell he lost his contract with AT&amp;T,
also resulting from CPUC racial policies. 
<P>
In an attempt to reinvigorate his enterprise, Bras found other
instruments of California government also excluded him because
of his color. He received an offer to bid from the Lawrence Livermore
Lab, a prestigious prize for any contractor. Unfortunately, when
the contract was finally placed up for bid, Bras found it was
limited to &quot;small disadvantaged firms only.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;If that's not plain discrimination, I don't know what is,&quot;
Jack contends.
<P>
Bras assuredly does know what discrimination is, especially of
the sort that descends from his own government. Its persistent
abuse, combined with forces of economic recession, withered his
enterprise to the breaking point. Bras was forced to lay off all
of his employees. 
<P>
Though the legal battle is over, Jack Bras' fight for fairness
continues. The Public Utilities Commission is still deciding how
to create a fair system of contracting, and he attends every PUC
meeting where his demands are being deliberated. The fight for
his business, however, is over. At 66, Jack admits it is time
to retire, but his disappointment is unmistakable.
<P>
As the only remaining employee, he is preparing to close up what
is left of J. Jack Bras and Associates. &quot;I've decided to
let things just taper off, but it's sad. It was a practice of
considerable value, that could have succeeded into the future,
and now we've lost the clientele we worked so hard to build up
over the years.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><B>When White is Wrong: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Peter Schembri </I></CENTER>
<P>
Peter Schembri's life began with uncertain odds of survival, much
less success. He was born in Malta to poor parents, his father
was a blacksmith who earned four pennies a day. After burying
five of their twelve children in their homeland, the Schembris
moved their family to the United States in 1952, where Peter grew
up in the impoverished Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood of San
Francisco. 
<P>
Life in San Francisco was not immediately easier, as the Schembris
soon lost another child. Each of the surviving children went to
work when he was old enough. As it was, the family could only
scrape together enough money to send Peter and two of his sisters
to private school. Despite their desperate circumstances, the
Schembris instilled in their children the philosophy that hard
work and a good education would eventually enable them to succeed.
<P>
Peter Schembri took those words to heart. After a tour of duty
in Vietnam, he came home to work with the troubled youth of San
Francisco. In four years of college, Schembri amassed an impressive
college record, with degrees in psychology, sociology, and criminology,
and a minor in counseling. After five years with the Juvenile
Probation Division in San Mateo, California, Schembri found his
true calling to public service. In 1978, he became a San Francisco
firefighter. 
<P>
Now with a family of his own to support, Schembri looked to advance
through the fire department's ranks. &quot;I believed I should
try to give my children a better chance than I had.&quot; He devoted
himself to years of extra work, taking college courses and educating
himself in his field. He took numerous advanced training courses,
served on 15 different safety committees within the fire department,
and earned a degree in fire science. When promotional opportunities
arose, Schembri would often work 15-hour days months in advance
to study. 
<P>
So determined was he for a promotion that Schembri tested for
three different positions in 1984, including a lieutenant's position.
Testing procedures used by most local government agencies rank
all applicants by scores, then hire from the list in successive
order. He scored well on all three tests, but two of those were
thrown out by a federal circuit court judge as &quot;discriminatory&quot;
when analysis of the results showed &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
groups generally scoring lower than their white-male colleagues.
<P>
Under court order, the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) replaced
the lieutenant's exam with one designed by an outside firm with
consultation from groups representing protected classes. However,
the results were the same. In response, the department was ordered
to hire strictly by racial quota. Using scores from the first
test, the first 33 white males were hired, then the top 50 applicants
from protected classes. Though Schembri had a chance for promotion
if the list had been open, he was not in the running when racial
classifications were applied. When it was all over, Schembri was
passed over for promotion by minority candidates scoring as many
as 200 places below him. 
<P>
When the local firefighters' union informed its members about
the decision, Schembri and others in the department felt betrayed.
The game was already over, and someone was now changing the rules.
All of Peter Schembri's commitment, hard work, and study went
out the window with the stroke of a judge's pen.
<P>
The disappointment might have been too much for some, but Peter
Schembri had known heartache before. Still, the SFFD's wanton
disregard for fairness devastated Peter and his family. In an
eloquent letter to the city attorney, Schembri's wife Mary wrote,
<P>
&quot;This decision has affected me as a wife and mother... My
husband studied for three years for these tests. He made over
four thousand flash cards and several manuals. I quizzed him for
an hour every night...Four months before the test (I) hosted nightly
study group meetings in my living room for 6 to 8 firefighters...
My daughter missed her father for three years. That time will
never come again...
<P>
&quot;My husband says that regardless of how hard he studies for
another exam, the outcome will be fruitless because promotions
will be given based only on gender and race, and the numbers are
stacked against him.&quot;
<P>
In 1994, Schembri applied for two more lieutenants' positions.
He placed eighth on one test, and with eight positions opening
over the course of two years, Schembri should have been the last
hired. Unfortunately, three firefighters with lower scores were
selected in front of him, leaving him the top candidate remaining
as the promotions list expired in 1996. All three were listed
in protected classes. 
<P>
On the other test Schembri was passed over in favor of a minority
firefighter who scored significantly lower. That was Peter's last
chance at lieutenant. A superior officer sympathized with Schembri's
plight, &quot;I'm sorry, but you're white at the wrong time.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I feel I've been robbed of the promise of equal opportunity,&quot;
Schembri remarks, &quot;I don't think I'll be trying for another
promotion any time soon.&quot; Resigned to defeat, Schembri has
now obtained his teaching credential and hopes to find work at
a community college for additional income. Schembri also spends
more of his time serving his community as a volunteer. He works
for a number of local causes, including his neighborhood association,
Meals on Wheels, and fundraising for a program to aid needy children
and their families.
<P>
But Peter Schembri is not the only victim of discrimination here.
Not only were his dreams dimmed by the discriminatory policies
of the San Francisco Fire Department, but also those of two poor
immigrant parents from Malta who gave everything of themselves
for their children, and asked only that they be given their fair
chance in the land of opportunity. 
<P>
Just a few months ago Peter finally summoned the courage to tell
his parents, now in their 80s, that he again did not receive the
promotion to lieutenant he has sought for so long. 
<P>
&quot;All those years my parents never took time off, never took
a vacation. They never bought anything for themselves, they were
dedicated to their children. I would like to be able to go to
them some day and say, 'I've worked hard and look at what I've
done. Thank you for the opportunities you've given me.' It really
hurts to go back and tell them what has happened.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><B>A House Divided: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Janice Camarena Story</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janice Camarena is an unlikely crusader. She left an unstable
home at the age of 15. Within a year she was pregnant with the
first of two children she would have with a drifter. As her classmates
were graduating from high school, Janice was alone in San Diego
with a baby, no diploma, no husband, no home, and no job. 
<P>
One day Janice encountered a high school friend named Jeff Camarena,
and her careworn life suddenly brightened. She and Jeff fell in
love and were soon married. Little Jessica was born in August
of 1988, and the struggling couple looked ambitiously and optimistically
to the future. 
<P>
Jeff had just landed a job in their hometown of Crestline, in
neighboring San Bernardino County. Two weeks after Jessica's birth,
he set out to look for a small home for his young family. He would
stay with his parents in Crestline, and return on Saturday to
help Janice pack their few belongings. 
<P>
Jeff, however, would never make it home. Climbing the hill to
his parent's house, a climb he made thousands of times before,
he died of heart failure from an undiscovered heart defect. A
passer-by discovered Jeff's body, laying half-way up the hilly
path that led to the back door. He was 19 years old.
<P>
Because Jeff had died from natural causes, the couple's accident
insurance was useless. Janice was now 18-years old, a widow, penniless,
and without a high school diploma. She also had a two-week old
baby and a two-year old toddler who were now depending solely
on her.
<P>
The next three years would have crushed most people. Janice supplemented
her meager social security checks with baby-sitting jobs. She
made a vulnerable target when the father of her first child returned
in 1990. He stayed just long enough to leave her with a third
child; she was four months pregnant when he walked out for the
second and last time. 
<P>
&quot;The bills were piling up and I knew I had to do something,&quot;
Janice remembered. She knew that the future of her three young
children would be bleak if she didn't take dramatic steps to pull
herself together and improve her prospects for employment. In
the months of despair that followed, a childhood dream of becoming
a nurse flickered back to life. As a child, Janice had succored
pill-bugs in a cardboard hospital, dreaming of the day when she
could become a nurse. But in the years since Jeff's death she
hadn't dared to think about it. Now, necessity intervened. 
<P>
Janice obtained her high school proficiency certificate and in
the spring of 1993 enrolled in an English course at San Bernardino
Valley Community College. She discovered she couldn't balance
her time commitments, and dropped the course before it began.
That summer, she finally took the plunge, taking a single class
in speech. It was the first class she had taken in eight years;
but the plucky high school drop-out received her first &quot;A.&quot;
The next semester, Janice enrolled in an algebra and psychology
class, somehow managing to juggle the schedules of her three children,
her classes, and the few odd jobs she was able to do, including
baby-sitting and working in an arcade.
<P>
&quot;Christmas was always a stressful time for our family,&quot;
Janice recalled, but the Christmas of 1993-the sixth since Jeff
had died-offered the family its first real glimmer of hope. Janice
aced both of her classes, and now had every reason to believe
that a career in nursing was more than just a child's pipe-dream.
The fire department helped with toys that year for Janice's three
little girls. &quot;But we were getting further behind on bills
and I needed to graduate as quickly as possible,&quot; Janice
said. &quot;And to qualify for grants, I needed to take at least
12 units that semester.&quot;
<P>
Taking 12 units of college courses, continuing her odd jobs and
conforming to her children's needs meant that Janice needed to
piece together an intricate puzzle of a schedule. There was one
break: the English 101 course required for her degree offered
34 different time slots, and one of those fit perfectly.
<P>
On January 19, 1994, Janice Camarena took her seat in the classroom
and began fidgeting with her pen. According to Janice, something
didn't feel right: she sensed a restlessness and even hostility
around her. She began to feel very uncomfortable.
<P>
Instructor Diana Anderson glared at her, and Janice knew something
was terribly wrong. &quot;This class is for African-American students
only,&quot; Anderson said coldly. &quot;You'll have to leave.&quot;
The restlessness in the classroom suddenly erupted into jeers
and derisive laughter. Janice packed her things and quickly left
the class. 
<P>
She was between tears and anger as she hurried to the administration
building, groping for the words she would need to convey her experience
to college officials. &quot;I was shocked about it and I thought,
this can't be happening. Did I just get kicked out of this class
because I was white?&quot;
<P>
College administrators were unsympathetic. They explained the
class was for disadvantaged students and that Janice had no right
to be there. She thought of the obstacles she had surmounted.
Janice later talked to one of the students in the program. &quot;She
was telling me how great the program was. Her mom and dad were
both doctors.&quot;
<P>
Janice barely held her composure until she left the building.
&quot;I was standing by a tree, and I was really crying,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;The speech teacher I had the first semester
walked by just then. He saw me crying and asked what was wrong
and I told him. He said he would check into the program from his
side. He called me later that evening and said that he didn't
agree with it, but there wasn't anything he could do.&quot; 
<P>
The class Janice had intruded upon was part of a preferential
curriculum called the &quot;Bridge&quot; Program, and offered
qualifying students an inside track to the prestigious University
of California. Students who met the program's qualifications received
their own personal counselor, a professional off-campus mentor,
special computer services, and a stream of invitations to private
seminars and receptions with academic and professional leaders.
<P>
The qualification to enter this world of privilege was quite uncomplicated.
One had to be born a certain color, and Janice Camarena failed
the entrance exam.
<P>
As Janice scrambled to find another English class, she learned
that the college also operated a similar program for Hispanic
students, called the Puente Project. This hit Janice harder than
anything she had yet learned about the new, racially segregated
college society. She thought about her own three children. Jeff's
grandparents had immigrated from Mexico, so Jessica would qualify
for the program. Ashley and Kayla would be unceremoniously thrown
out, just as Janice had been. These college officials would drive
a racial wedge between the three little girls of Janice Camarena's
family.
<P>
Janice did not have the resources to fight the system. She just
wanted to be a nurse so she could better take care of her kids.
She tried to shrug off the incident, but it kept haunting her.
<P>
The following semester, Janice rearranged her life to fit into
a time slot for a non-preferential English 101 course. She received
straight-&quot;As&quot; on her papers. The final class assignment
was to prepare a research paper on a subject of the student's
choice. Janice quickly outlined her project for the instructor:
racially discriminatory programs. The professor was hostile. &quot;I
can't suggest you write this,&quot; he snapped. Janice decided
to try anyway.
<P>
Janice threw herself into the project. She interviewed students
who had come through the &quot;Black Bridge&quot; and &quot;Puente&quot;
programs. She interviewed Diana Anderson, the instructor who ejected
her from the class. (When Janice told Anderson that her own children
would be separated by the racial requirements, Anderson laughed.)
Janice devoured the few articles about the &quot;Black Bridge&quot;
program she could find. She learned of the landmark civil rights
cases of the 20th century, and her readings led her to George
LaNoue, a civil rights professor at the University of Maryland
at Baltimore. He, in turn, led her to Robert Corry, a young litigator
at the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento.
<P>
For all of his legal experience and success, Corry was not much
older than Janice Camarena. While still a student at Stanford
Law School, he had mounted a successful First Amendment legal
challenge to the University's politically correct speech code.
Since joining the Pacific Legal Foundation in 1994, he had made
national news by filing a legal challenge against racially discriminatory
practices in the largest public works program in the country,
the Los Angeles Metrorail. 
<P>
&quot;She wanted to know about the history of racial discrimination,
and I cited Brown v. Board of Education and other anti-segregation
cases,&quot; Corry remembered. &quot;We kept on talking, and she
mentioned her own experience. I asked her about filing a lawsuit.
She was reluctant to do so. She was frankly afraid there could
be retaliation from the school if there was a suit, and money
was a problem,&quot; Corry said. &quot;I told her I totally understood
her concerns by relating my own experience at Stanford to her,
having sued my own law school. I think she could have received
substantial monetary damages, but she wasn't interested in that.&quot;
For both of them it was a matter of principle that discrimination
be fought.
<P>
A few weeks later, Janice called the college to get her final
grades. She was anxious about keeping up her straight A's, and
was shocked to learn she had received a &quot;C&quot; in the English
class. Every grade she had received in the class had been an &quot;A.&quot;
How could that be? She made an appointment with the professor,
who informed her that she had failed her final paper, bringing
her &quot;A&quot; average in the class to a &quot;C.&quot; She
asked to see his comments on the paper, and found he had not made
any. He explained that poor grammar in several passages justified
her &quot;F.&quot; Janice explained that the poor grammar was
in direct quotations from English professor Diana Anderson. She
tape-recorded the interview with Anderson and could back the quotes
word for word. The professor replied that he would not change
her grade.
<P>
In March 1995, Corry filed suit in U.S. District Court against
the San Bernardino Community College District, the California
Community Colleges, and the University of California on Camarena's
behalf. The lawsuit received substantial media attention on evening
radio and television broadcasts, and was front page news in the
local paper the next morning.
<P>
College officials reacted immediately and viciously. San Bernardino
Valley College President David Singer called a campus assembly
the next day to discuss the lawsuit with faculty and students.
Janice was surprised to hear that the campus administration was
giving her case such public notice. &quot;I was in an anthropology
class when one of my friends came running over to me and said,
'I've been looking everywhere for you,'&quot; Janice recalls.
&quot;They're having an assembly about you.' I said 'Let's go.'&quot;
<P>
Janice and her friend took seats in the front row. President Singer
mounted the stage, played a video tape of Corry's press conference
and denied that the incident had occurred. He then opened Janice's
confidential student records, and in front of faculty and students,
announced that she had dropped out of one English class and had
just received a &quot;C&quot; in another. Janice Camarena was
obviously a disgruntled failure trying to blame the college for
her own problems.
<P>
Corry was dumbfounded. &quot;It was obviously a very uncomfortable
experience for her,&quot; he related. &quot;To be singled out
and talked about that way by the chief administrator of your school
and ridiculed...nothing like that happened to me [at Stanford].
But it backfired.&quot;
<P>
To Singer's amazement, the vast majority of the campus assembly
did not turn against Janice. They supported her. By the next morning,
several hundred students had signed a petition on her behalf.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts wrote of the lawsuit,
&quot;Unlike many plaintiffs who have turned civil rights litigation
into a multimillion-dollar racism racket for such slights as dilatory
service in restaurants, Janice Camarena wants no monetary damages
for the undisputed intentional racial discrimination committed
against her. She seeks the simple justice of an injunction eliminating
her school's racially segregated curriculum, and she is willing
to take her case to the Supreme Court to get it.&quot; 
<P>
The University of California General Counsel, a powerful law firm
hired by the California Community Colleges and the state Attorney
General all stood against the 25-year old widow and her 27-year
old lawyer. &quot;It was very difficult to obtain the documents
we needed,&quot; Corry said. &quot;At first, they put up road
blocks to turning over these documents, which are public records.
The whole point of discovery is to get at the truth and when a
lawyer puts up barriers to discovery they obscure the truth. I
think a lot of these programs are conducted outside the public
eye. If most people knew what was going on, these affirmative
action programs would not survive.&quot; 
<P>
When Corry threatened to file a motion to compel the college officials
to divulge their papers on the Bridge and Puente programs, their
resistance suddenly collapsed. Corry received a phone call. The
state of California wanted to settle.
<P>
A little over two years after she was thrown out of her classroom,
this remarkable single mother who just wanted to provide for her
three daughters, had forced the entire legal establishment of
the state of California to capitulate. 
<P>
In 1948, Topeka, Kansas officials turned a little girl away from
a classroom because of her race. The result was the landmark decision
that ended America's &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; public education
systems. Nearly a half century later, Janice Camarena forced the
106-campus California Community College system to renounce its
own segregated classes, and forbade it ever again to discourage
another student from entering a classroom based on that student's
race.
<P>
Lawyers in the field say that Camarena's is not an isolated case.
Whether this becomes the story of a single, transitory legal victory,
or the saga of a permanent constitutional prohibition upon all
racial discrimination in California, is a matter of intense debate
in the state today. Janice Camarena's experience, and the vision
she has for the world in which her three children will grow up,
is an important part of that debate. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
What do we conclude from these cases? Are they representative
of the wide body of experience with these programs? How do these
racial policies actually work in practice? How do they co-exist
with the strong societal consensus for equality? What harm ultimately
is done?<BR>
<P>
<B>Insights on Racial Discrimination</B>
<P>
No single story or selection of stories can faithfully represent
the experience of the broad population. Many of these stories
come to light only because of an extraordinary set of coincidences
or uncommon determination and courage on the part of victims.
Janice Camarena's story surfaced because a research paper for
an English class caught the attention of a top civil rights litigator.
Janine Jacinto would never have been sure racial discrimination
kept her out of California State University Sacramento's social
welfare program, except for a chance encounter with another student,
who, also by chance, had stumbled upon confidential instructions
for rating applicants. 
<P>
Contractors' stories are easier to obtain, since racial quotas
in contracting work are constantly at odds with older, merit-based
public contract laws that strictly require awards to the lowest
bidder. Those who administer these racial laws seem far more unabashed
in their pursuit. Nevertheless, for every contractor who chooses
to buck the system and incur ponderous legal expenses, how many
others meekly withdraw from the public contracts market, or close
their doors, or manipulate the system to meet quotas by sham arrangements
with minority fronts? One Bay-area contractor, denied WBE status
because her husband works for her company, told us of ordering
from her existing suppliers through minority-owned brokers who
merely add a mark-up passed on to taxpayers.
<P>
How many students face the embarrassment and trauma of rejection
with a simple shrug of the shoulders and the conclusion that &quot;I
just don't measure up?&quot; After her encounter with California
State University Sacramento officials, Janine Jacinto decided
to turn down admission to the graduate program for fear of retaliation.
As Janice Camarena discovered, those fears were well founded.
Her extensive essay on discriminatory practices at San Berardino
Valley Community College received a summary &quot;F,&quot; despite
an unbroken series of &quot;As&quot; on all her previous papers.
<P>
For every victim willing to tell his or her story, many others
shrink from the public eye, fearful of retaliation. The father
of one student whose case was particularly egregious pleaded with
us not to discuss the matter. &quot;My son has another year to
go [in school] and they can still get at him.&quot; A Los Angeles
city employee who filed a grievance action based on racial discrimination
in promotions said he was told &quot;'You've been labeled a trouble-maker'
and that I was basically stuck in my position for the rest of
my term (of employment).&quot;
<P>
Thus cases such as these offer just a glimpse of the public's
experience with these programs.<BR>
<P>
<B>Quotas in Theory and Practice<BR>
</B>
<P>
According to defenders of racial preferences, these policies are
not rigid quotas, but merely voluntary &quot;goals.&quot; Contractors
need only demonstrate &quot;good faith&quot; efforts to meet these
&quot;goals&quot; to qualify for public contracts. Students need
not despair; race is only one of many factors considered in university
admissions to ensure a &quot;diverse&quot; student body. 
<P>
The experience of Michael Cornelius, who lost to a much higher
bidder because he fell 2.5 percentage points below the MTA's &quot;goal&quot;
for minority participation, suggests a rigidity that is uncompromising.
So, too, does the experience of Hayley Ulrich, Amber Preshica
and Lydia McDonald, none of whom was among the 37 percent of all
applicants admitted to the University of California at Berkeley,
despite admissions scores which placed them in the top 10 percent
of high school seniors in the state, GPAs which far exceeded a
perfect 4.0, and extensive extracurricular achievements. The San
Francisco Fire Department denied promotion to Peter Schembri while
advancing candidates scoring 200 places below him, solely because
of his race.
<P>
We also learn that because of the way these quotas are often administered,
some groups face total exclusion from opportunity. For Don Ware
and Jack Bras, for example, it is more than just an unlevel playing
field; they have been locked out of the stadium. Although 23 percent
of state contracts are subject to set-asides, subcontractors like
Ware and Bras must absorb 100 percent of the burden to provide
mathematical balance with other sub-contractors who meet none
of the quota. (Abraham Lincoln once mused about the mystery of
a six foot man who drowned in a lake whose average depth was just
four feet.) Although quotas ostensibly apply to just 23 percent
of the state contracts, Bras and Ware have found themselves subject
to a 100 percent quota. These practices have pushed them completely
out of a market that they had earned a place in by offering reliable
service at competitive prices.
<P>
In Janice Camarena's case, the single criterion for entry to the
world of academic privilege through the &quot;Bridge&quot; and
&quot;Puente&quot; programs was the color of the student's skin.
<P>
Another theory is that these policies are carefully targeted to
assist disadvantaged individuals whose circumstances of birth
would otherwise deny them equal opportunity to compete. These
cases show us that the practice is altogether different, and that
racial quotas often victimize the very people they are supposed
to help. Nearly half of Don Ware's employees are African-American
or Hispanic. Yet because Fontana Steel's owner has white skin,
the jobs of all of the employees, regardless of race, are imperiled.
This is a particularly bitter experience for Ware and his employees:
they had struggled hard to earn a place in the market by offering
a better service at a lower cost than their competitors. What
they had earned by their hard work has now been denied them by
preference laws designed to &quot;help&quot; them.
<P>
These cases also teach us that these policies often heap greater
disadvantages on the disadvantaged and greater privileges upon
the privileged. How else does one explain the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program? At 25, Janice Camarena had already suffered the injuries
of a broken home, widowhood, abandonment, single-parenthood and
poverty. Yet she was brusquely turned away from a class that admitted
a student whose mother and father were both doctors. In 1990,
the same California taxpayer-funded program in San Diego was criticized
for admitting the son of physicist Walter Massey, an Illinois
resident and vice president for research at the University of
Chicago. Meanwhile, the academically qualified children of Vietnamese
refugees who were legal residents (and taxpayers) of California,
were turned away.
<P>
<B>The Tactics of Exclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
These cases highlight several inherent contradictions between
the stated aims and actual results of officially- sanctioned racial
discrimination. The contradictions are further highlighted when
exposed to a fundamental and widely held belief in our society
that individuals ought to be judged on their own talents, merit
and performance, and not on the circumstances of their birth.
This consensus dates to the nation's founding, and has been a
constant theme through the most momentous epochs of the nation's
history, the American Civil War and the 20th Century Civil Rights
Movement.
<P>
These programs are practiced, perpetuated and promoted despite
the obvious internal contradiction with their stated purpose,
and the external contravention of established and fundamental
principles of equality. Such a formidable undertaking requires
powerful stratagems. These cases shed some light on the tactics
employed by the bureaucracy in order to maintain racially discriminatory
policies on such a vast scale.
<P>
One tactic common to many of these cases is official denial. College
officials assured Janine Jacinto that her race was an inconsequential
issue for admission, when in fact it was weighted more than four
times heavier than the maximum spread for GPA. Officials at San
Bernardino Valley Community College called a school assembly to
deny the existence of a program for which they had widely disseminated
promotional material. 
<P>
When Don Ware wrote to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and U.S.
Senator Barbara Boxer for relief, Brown replied that these laws
merely established &quot;participation goals.&quot; According
to Brown, &quot;They create no 'Affirmative Action Quotas' or
'Affirmative Action Statutes.'&quot; Boxer replied that such programs
&quot;may be voluntary.&quot;
<P>
A second, common tactic is silence. When Allan Favish requested
simple statistical information on UCLA's law school applicants,
he was told it did not exist. Only after he filed a lawsuit under
the California Public Records Act was the material finally provided.
When Janice Camarena's attorney entered into discovery, college
officials stone-walled until a court order was imminent. California
State University officials seeking to settle Janine Jacinto's
lawsuit out of court wanted above all an agreement that she would
never discuss the case. 
<P>
Silence is what stopped Amber Preshica at the gates of Cal Berkeley:
University officials would never give her a straight answer as
to why her application had been rejected in favor of less qualified
applicants. CSUS officials jealously guarded their admissions
formula for the graduate program in social welfare until an unlikely
chain of events exposed it. 
<P>
A third tactic used to perpetuate these programs is intimidation,
often quite viciously applied. San Bernardino Valley Community
College President David Singer called a student assembly, ridiculed
Janice Camarena in front of her friends and faculty, and revealed
her confidential student records after she challenged the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program. Michael Cornelius endured withering ridicule when he
first challenged the contracting quotas of the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transit Authority. UC-Berkeley Admissions Director Bob Laird tried
to discourage Lydia McDonald from appealing her rejection, telling
her attorney that nearly 95 percent of admission appeals failed.
<P>
A fourth tactic is to co-opt complaints when they appear to be
resolute. When Janine Jacinto revealed she had seen the CSUS rating
instructions, college officials immediately guaranteed her admission.
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the CSU attorney asked Jacinto's
lawyer at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the
program? She's in.&quot; When Lydia McDonald obtained legal services
and litigation appeared imminent, UC-Berkeley officials suddenly
decided to admit her. When it was clear Janice Camarena's attorney
would obtain embarrassing material through discovery, the college
decided to cut its losses and settle out of court. <BR>
<P>
<B>What's the Harm?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Lawyers can argue the damage done to fundamental principles of
equality under law. Philosophers can ponder violence done to the
founding principles of a nation &quot;dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.&quot; Economists can assay the
impact of exclusionary policies in the marketplace. Sociologists
can fathom the implications of a nation divided along racial lines.
But in the final analysis, the harm done by racially discriminatory
policies cannot be understood in a macrocosm. 
<P>
There is a poignancy in these stories that cannot be glossed over
in clinical analysis if a true understanding is to be achieved.
The genuine impact of these policies can only be understood through
the tears of real people like Janice Camarena, Jack Bras, Lydia
McDonald, Janine Jacinto, Peter Schembri, Don Ware, and the countless
others like them. They are often Horatio Alger stories, ruined
by exclusionary racial discrimination that today is practiced
systematically by a government founded on the opposite principles
of equality, inclusion and fairness.
<P>
&quot;She really was not the same person after she got the letter,&quot;
Allan Favish was told by those who knew Lydia McDonald. 
<P>
It took all the courage that veteran fire fighter Peter Schembri
could summon to tell his elderly Maltese parents he had been passed
over again for promotion, despite every objective qualification.
&quot;I would like to be able to go to them some day and say,
'I've worked hard and look at what I've done. Thank you for the
opportunities you've given me.' It really hurts to go back and
tell them what has happened.&quot; 
<P>
When Don Ware reflects on the business his father started, he
talks about the responsibility he feels to preserve it for his
children and employees. &quot;I've done my best to take care of
the success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad
has given his whole life to the business. He had done without
his whole life and put all his money back in the company so that
it could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot;
<P>
Jack Bras has simply closed the doors on a once thriving firm.
&quot;I've decided to let things just taper off, but it's sad.
It was a practice of considerable value, and now we've lost the
clientele we worked so hard to build up over the years.&quot;
<P>
What harm is done? One of the seminal writings of the 20th Century
Civil Rights Movement, by Langston Hughes, perhaps answers it
best with another question:
<P>
&quot;What happens to a dream deferred?
<P>
Does it dry up
<P>
Like a raisin in the sun?
<P>
Or does it fester like a sore-
<P>
And then run?
<P>
Does it stink like rotten meat?
<P>
Or crust and sugar over-
<P>
Like a syrupy sweet?
<P>
Maybe it just sags
<P>
Like a heavy load
<P>
Or does it explode?&quot;

<P>
<font size=-1><I>&quot;Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor
tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights,
all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer
of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no
account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights
as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;</I>

<P>
BACK IN THE COLD WAR, when the United States and the Soviet Union
divided the power of the world between them, Americans referred
to their country and its allies as the Free World. Supporters
of the Soviet Union did not buy this: freedom as they understood
it could only be attained through communism. Indeed, they looked
on Americans and other citizens of capitalist democracies as slaves.
<P>
A visiting Martian watching a Crossfire debate between a pro-American
and a pro-Soviet about freedom could only have become confused.
He would need to understand the debaters' near-opposite definitions
of freedom before he could even hope to make sense of the argument
or form a reasonable opinion of his own. 
<P>
So it is today with the debate over &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
This debate, which has plagued American politics for over three
decades, has become especially contentious in 1996 due to Proposition
209, which would amend the California constitution to prohibit
state-sponsored &quot;preferential treatment&quot; on the basis
of race, ethnicity or gender. [*The key provision of Proposition
209 states: &quot;The state shall not discriminate against, or
grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the
operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.&quot;]
<P>
But as the affirmative action debate has grown in volume, it has
also grown increasingly muddled. There is a simple reason for
this: people on opposite sides use the same words, but mean different-indeed,
mutually exclusive-things by them. 
<P>
Below we will explain the different ways in which supporters and
opponents of Proposition 209 use four important terms: preferential
treatment, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil rights.
In doing so, we will not present a comprehensive account of the
history of affirmative action. This has been accomplished elsewhere,
and we will draw upon that history as needed.<sup>1</sup> Rather, in focusing
on definitions, we aim at enabling ordinary citizens to interpret
the debate over Proposition 209 and make a clear-minded decision
on November 5. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Senator Hubert Humphrey, an old-fashioned liberal who spearheaded
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defined &quot;discrimination&quot;
at the time as &quot;a distinction in treatment given to different
individuals because of their different race.&quot; This in a nutshell
is what supporters of Proposition 209 understand as &quot;preferential
treatment.&quot; 
<P>
Indeed, the authors of 209 purposefully wrote it to echo the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which outlawed &quot;preferential treatment
to any individual or group&quot; based on race. Likewise the antecedent
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1868, guaranteed &quot;equal protection
of the laws&quot; to every individual American. 
<P>
According to this traditional understanding, there are two essential
components of non-preferential treatment: color-blind law and
legal treatment of citizens as individuals. To the extent that
the law recognizes race or ethnicity, or to the extent that the
law recognizes citizens as members of groups rather than individuals,
the result is preferential treatment.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The &quot;Media Action Kit&quot; of Educators for Justice, a modern-liberal
group opposing Proposition 209, calls 209 an attempt to &quot;take
away a hard-won anti-discrimination program.&quot; This newer
understanding of discrimination arose in the early 1960s, when
a prominent civil rights group, the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), endorsed the idea of legally favoring blacks as a way
to remedy past discrimination. 
<P>
Other civil rights groups at the time, such as the National Urban
League, stuck to the traditional view that was enshrined in the
1964 Civil Rights Act. But by the 1970s, CORE's idea had become
universally embraced by the liberal establishment. And the idea
had grown in two important respects: (1) Policies favoring blacks
could be justified in three interrelated ways: they could be remedial
as described above; they could aim at achieving &quot;proportionality,&quot;
whereby the racial breakdown in society is mirrored in the workplace
or classroom; or they could aim at achieving cultural or intellectual
&quot;diversity.&quot; And (2) these policies were extended to
other designated minorities and to women. 
<P>
To put this newer understanding of &quot;discrimination&quot;
or &quot;preferential treatment&quot; in a nutshell: race- or
gender-based policies are only preferential if they are unjustified.
In other words, what Humphrey in 1964 and the authors of Proposition
209 in 1996 call discriminatory or preferential-&quot;a distinction
in treatment given to different individuals because of their different
race&quot;-is in fact not preferential as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. 
<P>
This newer view of non-preferential treatment has essential components
that are opposite those of the traditional view: color-consciousness
replaces color-blindness, and people are treated not as individuals
under the law, but according to their race, ethnicity and gender.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
The latest major court case involving preferential treatment was
decided in March 1996. The particulars are as follows: Four years
ago a woman named Cheryl Hopwood was rejected by the University
of Texas Law School, despite a high grade point average and impressive
scores on her Law School Admission Tests. As it turned out, Hopwood's
qualifications exceeded those of 24 of 25 black applicants and
47 of 50 Hispanic applicants who were admitted over her. At the
root of this was an admissions policy that had one set of standards
for white, Asian, and other applicants, and a different and lower
set of standards for blacks and Hispanics. 
<P>
Hopwood filed suit in a case known as Cheryl Hopwood v. State
of Texas. She argued that the law school's admissions policy amounted
to race-based preferential treatment that violated Title VI of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act. (Title VI prohibited racial discrimination
in colleges and universities receiving federal money.) 
<P>
In response, the university argued that its policy was not preferential,
but was rather aimed at achieving &quot;diversity.&quot; Here
is a good practical example of the divergent understandings of
preferential treatment: Hopwood believed such treatment had occurred,
because she had been treated as a member of a racial group rather
than as an individual, and her color alone had been the reason
for her rejection. For the University of Texas, on the other hand,
although it had admitted students based solely on their race,
this was not preferential treatment because it was justified by
a desired goal.
<P>
The University of Texas's admissions policy was ruled to be illegal
by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision that
was widely reported to have sent &quot;shock waves&quot; through
the academic world. Why shock waves? Because the decision included
a blanket statement that state colleges and universities &quot;may
not use race as a factor&quot; in admissions. 
<P>
Those who support Proposition 209 heralded the Hopwood decision,
considering it a knockout punch to preferential treatment. Opponents
of Proposition 209 took a fallback position: They admitted that
the University of Texas was wrong to have an admissions policy
where race was in many cases the sole decisive criterion. But
citing the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University
of California v. Bakke, they argued that race can and will remain
in effect as one of various admissions criteria. 
<P>
We will look at a more common example of race-based admissions-more
subtle than the Texas policy, but race-based nonetheless-in the
section on &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; below. For now we simply
note that what opponents of Proposition 209 consider non-preferential
(because justified) race-based policies are widely practiced in
American colleges and universities. Indeed, in 1994 the Journal
of Blacks in Higher Education reported that in universities nationwide,
the &quot;near universal&quot; pattern is white acceptance rates
running at less than half of black acceptance rates; the difference
is even greater at liberal arts colleges.<sup>2 </sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
A major bone of contention between the supporters and opponents
of Proposition 209 concerns whether the policies it would prohibit
amount to &quot;preferential treatment.&quot; At the heart of
this argument are very different understandings of the term.
<P>
By &quot;preferential treatment,&quot; the pro-209 side means
policies that take race into account and thereby give preference
to any one individual over any other individual on the basis of
race. They agree with the famous dissent of Justice John Paul
Harlan in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson. The Supreme Court
majority had upheld legally-sanctioned segregated seating on Louisiana
passenger trains. Harlan disagreed, writing: &quot;Our Constitution
is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
In the context of the Hopwood case or of admissions policies in
general, supporters of Proposition 209 believe the way to prevent
preferential treatment is to delete any mention of race from applications
and ensure that each applicant is judged on the basis of merit.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, believes that &quot;preferential
treatment&quot; results from a failure of government to use race
to achieve social goals-for instance, to achieve the same racial
proportions in classrooms as in society at large. Agreeing with
Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote in the Bakke decision that &quot;to
get beyond racism, we must first take account of race,&quot; opponents
of Proposition 209 hold that deleting race from admissions applications
would itself amount to preferential treatment.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
In a speech at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, Abraham Lincoln
championed the system of &quot;free labor,&quot; which today we
call &quot;free enterprise.&quot; Under this system, men are not
born into classes in which they remain throughout their lives.
<P>
Rather, said Lincoln, all men are free to rise as high as their
interests and talents will take them: &quot;The prudent, penniless
beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus
with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his
own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner
to help him. This...is free labor-the just and generous, and prosperous
system, which opens the way for all-gives hope to all, and energy,
and progress, and improvement of condition to all.&quot; 
<P>
This is obviously not to say that all are born under the same
circumstances, or with the same interests and talents. Nor is
it to say that bad fortune may not knock some down temporarily.
To the latter, Lincoln advised: &quot;Let them adopt the maxim,
'Better luck next time,' and then, by renewed exertion, make that
better luck for themselves.&quot; 
<P>
The following year, of course, Lincoln was elected president,
and went on to oversee the Civil War and the abolition of slavery.
His better known speeches on the evils of slavery, and his conduct
of the war, were at one with his understanding of free enterprise:
slavery was an extreme version of the class system of the old
world, which was based on the undemocratic principle that government
should impose artificial helps and barriers to maintain a predetermined
order in society.
<P>
Lincoln's doctrine of the free enterprise system encapsulates
the understanding of equal opportunity which animates Proposition
209. It has two essential components: Each individual should be
free to advance without any artificial barriers set before him.
And no one is guaranteed an outcome.
<P>
The Fourteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War to extend
the &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; to all Americans,
embodied this traditional understanding. But in practice, throughout
the country and especially in the South, many legal inequities
remained to hamper the opportunity of blacks. The 1964 Civil Rights
Act was intended to put teeth in the guarantees of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Supporters of Proposition 209 understand their initiative
to be a return to those guarantees.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
One of the arguments placed on the ballot by opponents of Proposition
209 says that its &quot;real purpose is to eliminate...equal opportunity
programs for qualified women and minorities.&quot; This newer
understanding of equal opportunity found one of its earliest expressions
in a speech by President Lyndon Johnson at Howard University in
1965: &quot;You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled
by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line
of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the
others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely
fair.... [I]t is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity....
We seek not just equality as a right and a theory but equality
as a fact and equality as a result.&quot; 
<P>
There is still a distinction in this passage between opportunity
and result. Johnson was proposing that it is not enough for government
to ensure the former-that it must attend to the latter as well.
But to grasp what opponents of Proposition 209 mean today by &quot;equal
opportunity,&quot; we must see that they no longer distinguish
opportunity from result. 
<P>
In a 1979 Supreme Court case which we will discuss below, Justice
William Brennan dismissed the argument that the 1964 Civil Rights
Act prohibited race-based job promotions. This argument, Brennan
wrote, reflects a &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of the law.
In other words, what opponents of Proposition 209 mean by &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; is figurative: in effect, they use &quot;opportunity&quot;
as a metaphor for result. 
<P>
The essential components of this understanding are opposite to
those of the traditional view: First, equal opportunity is measured
by results. So to ensure it, government must predetermine and
act to bring about a certain set of results. Second, in order
to acheive these results, government must erect artificial aids
for some individuals and artificial barriers for others. As Colin
Powell wrote in his autobiography, My American Journey, &quot;Discrimination
'for' one group means, inevitably, discrimination 'against' another....&quot;<sup>3</sup>
<P>
We should also note that since President Johnson's speech in 1965,
the number of groups considered to need a leg up in the name of
equal opportunity has expanded. Various other minority groups-including
new immigrants-as well as women, have joined blacks in the ranks
of those seen to need special government help. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings In Practice</B>
<P>
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin&quot; in the area of employment, engendered the greatest
controversy at the time. How could discrimination in hiring and
promotions be enforced without setting racial quotas? Senator
Humphrey responded that if the Act sanctioned quotas, he would
&quot;start eating the pages one after the other....&quot; &quot;Nothing
contained in [Title VII],&quot; Humphrey continued, &quot;shall
be interpreted to require any employer to grant preferential treatment
to any individual or to any group because of race...on account
of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number
or percentage of persons employed...in comparison with the available
work force.&quot;<sup>4</sup> 
<P>
Employment and promotions would be open to all, regardless of
race. But as far as obtaining jobs or promotions, government would
impose no artificial aids or barriers. This was in accordance
with the traditional understanding of free enterprise and equal
opportunity. 
<P>
As Title VII came to be administered and interpreted in the courts,
however, the newer understanding of equal opportunity came to
dominate. Consider a 1979 Supreme Court decision, United Steelworkers
of America v. Weber. The case arose when Brian Weber, a white
employee of Kaiser Aluminum, was bumped from a career-enhancing
training program. Assignment to this program was based on employee
seniority. But Kaiser maintained separate seniority lists for
white and black workers, and Weber was passed over by two junior
black employees. He argued in court that this policy violated
his rights under Title VII. But as cited above, Justice Brennan
dismissed Weber's take on Title VII as &quot;literal,&quot; and
the court upheld Kaiser's race-based policy as a means to a race-proportional
result.
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 209 support the literal understanding
of equal opportunity rejected in the Weber case. Opponents of
209 support the result-oriented, race-based employment policies
upheld in Weber. And indeed, while the history of Title VII over
the last 30 years is complex, with subtle shifts regarding what
test should be used to justify race-based employment policies,
such policies remain legal and widespread. 
<P>
For instance, when a 1988 report showed Hispanics were proportionally
under-represented by roughly 9 percent on the Los Angeles County
work force-while blacks were over-represented by about 17 percent-preferences
were tilted to the advantage of the former. Groups representing
blacks objected mightily, and Hispanics went to court to protect
their &quot;equal opportunity&quot; turf.<sup>5</sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
For both sides of the Proposition 209 debate, preventing preferential
treatment or discrimination is the means to the end of &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot; But as they differ on the meaning of &quot;discrimination,&quot;
as seen in the previous section, so they differ on &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;
<P>
To use President Johnson's footrace analogy, supporters of 209
believe that government may help prepare people to run the race-for
instance, by providing universal education, as well as a &quot;safety
net&quot; for those who need help to get to the starting line.
But when it comes to the order of finish, government must remain
neutral. Certainly it should not aid or hamper individuals based
on their skin color.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, measures equal opportunity
at the finish line. If the order of finish is not what the government
desires-for instance, if the racial breakdown of employees in
a given workplace differs from the breakdown in society at large-then
government must take a hand in &quot;fixing&quot; the race. If
it does not, it is derelict in its duty.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Even among supporters of Proposition 209, there seems to be a
semantic difference over the meaning of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
To some, it refers only to programs employing preferential or
discriminatory treatment as traditionally defined: programs that
treat individuals differently on the basis of their different
race, ethnicity or gender. This has been the prevalent conservative
understanding for some years. Thus, for instance, the title of
constitutional law scholar Terry Eastland's recent book, Ending
Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.
<P>
But to many other supporters of 209-including the campaign's leadership-&quot;affirmative
action&quot; has a broader meaning, encompassing also some non-discriminatory
programs. Commonly called &quot;outreach programs,&quot; these
aim to expand opportunity. For instance, to ensure that all high
school seniors have a fair shake at getting into the University
of California, the state might fund college-prep tutoring in schools
where SAT scores are historically below average, or an oversight
program to ensure that UC applicants are widely recruited. 
<P>
Thus Ward Connerly, a black businessman and University of California
trustee who chairs the pro-209 campaign, has labeled &quot;the
claim that Proposition 209 will eliminate all affirmative action&quot;
as &quot;preposterous.&quot;
<P>
Semantics aside, however, supporters of 209 agree on what the
initiative would allow and prohibit. Outreach programs would clearly
be allowed, as long as they are open to people of all races and
genders. As Connerly recently wrote, referring to an actual incident
of exclusion: &quot;No longer would people like Janice Camarena,
a white, widowed mother of three, be thrown out of outreach classes
because her color or racial background does not fit the template
of the institution.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 209 took California Attorney General
Dan Lungren to court in August, objecting to his official summary
of the initiative, which will appear on the November ballot. Lungren
summarized 209 as a &quot;prohibition against discrimination or
preferential treatment.&quot; Pat Ewing, head of the anti-209
campaign, called this an attempt to &quot;intentionally mislead
the public,&quot; arguing that the summary should state simply
that the initiative prohibits &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
<P>
A County Superior Court Judge agreed with Ewing. This decision
was overturned, though, by a state appeals panel, which described
the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; as &quot;amorphous.&quot;
<P>
We have seen that it is somewhat amorphous, even among supporters
of 209. But leaving that aside, opponents of 209 are united in
insisting that the initiative would prohibit all affirmative action.
This indicates that they agree with the narrower view of affirmative
action in the pro-209 camp: &quot;affirmative action&quot; describes
precisely those programs which do treat people differently on
the basis of their different race, ethnicity or gender. The difference,
as we have seen in previous sections, is that 209 opponents do
not consider such treatment discriminatory, as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. As Justice Blackmun wrote in defense
of affirmative action in the 1978 Bakke case, &quot;in order to
treat some people equally, we must treat them differently.&quot;
<P>
Related to this, the ballot arguments opposing 209 insist that
it would spell the end of &quot;outreach programs.&quot; As we
have seen, however, this could only be true insofar as access
to such programs is restricted by race, ethnicity or gender. And
indeed, opponents of 209 seem to understand &quot;outreach&quot;
to require such restrictions.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice<sup>6</sup></B> 
<P>
The following headline appeared last spring in the Los Angeles
Times: &quot;Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies
do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality.&quot;
It referred to a seven-year investigation of the admissions policy
at the University of California at Berkeley by the U.S. Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR). A Berkeley sociologist
who had a hand in designing this policy called the OCR's report
&quot;an historical vindication of one of the stronger and most
scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country.&quot;
<P>
But the report only concluded that Berkeley didn't &quot;maintain
illegal [racial or ethnic] quotas&quot;-implying that legal quotas
were maintained. In effect, OCR vindicated Berkeley's policy under
the terms of Bakke, which held that race could not be the sole
criterion in admissions, but could be one of several criteria.
<P>
The facts are these: Berkeley's admissions policy was designed
to achieve the goal of &quot;proportionality&quot;-that is, to
admit freshman classes containing the same ethnic percentages
as exist among California's high school graduating class. In order
to do so, it had to set different standards for applicants of
different ethnic groups, because in reality, ethnic groups do
not qualify proportionately. 
<P>
For instance, in 1993-one of the years examined in the OCR report-Asians
made up 15 percent of the graduating class, but 32 percent of
the applicants to Berkeley who met UC's eligibility requirements;
Hispanics, on the other hand, made up 29 percent of the graduating
class, but only 11 percent of eligible applicants. 
<P>
Berkeley, then, could only hope to approximate proportionality
by using different standards for different applicants according
to race. This was legal-again under Bakke-because it was incorporated
into a complex matrix system in which other factors also played
a role. But clearly race is in many cases one of the most important
factors-and in some cases the single most important factor -in
gaining (or being denied) admission to Berkeley.<BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education-the bureaucracy in charge of
enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibiting racial
discrimination in colleges and universities-endorsed Berkeley's
race-based admissions policy, on the grounds that schools can
&quot;take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions
which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular
race, color, or national origin.&quot; Opponents of Proposition
209 applauded. 
<P>
For 209 supporters, on the other hand, Berkeley's policy exhibits
exactly the kind of discrimination the initiative is written to
prohibit. 
<P>
The sides agree that the program amounts to affirmative action,
disagreeing only on its propriety, based on their divergent understandings
of &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
as described in preceding sections.
<P>
As for race- and gender-neutral &quot;outreach programs&quot;-programs
to increase opportunity for the disadvantaged-they would remain
legal under Proposition 209. Many 209 supporters count these also
as affirmative action programs. Thus the ballot description of
209 by the non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office explains
that it would mean &quot;the elimination of most [which is to
say, not all] affirmative action programs...run by the state or
local government in the areas of public employment, contracting,
and education.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT ARE CIVIL RIGHTS? <BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The understanding of &quot;civil rights&quot; held by supporters
of Proposition 209 harks back to the second &quot;self-evident
truth&quot; in the Declaration of Independence: human beings are
&quot;endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
These rights adhere equally to all individuals, based on their
common human nature-hence the term &quot;natural rights.&quot;
They include the rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; as well as property rights, speech rights,
and rights of conscience or religious freedom. 
<P>
The Declaration's third &quot;self-evident truth,&quot; then,
is that &quot;to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.&quot; The purpose of government is to protect the individual
rights-now civil rights-of its citizens.
<P>
The pro-209 campaign hearkens also to the understanding of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and the pre-1965 Civil Rights Movement. In gaining
a majority in Congress and in the nation at large to support the
1964 Civil Rights Act, King and other civil rights leaders appealed
to the natural rights principles of the Declaration, asking the
nation to live up to its founding ideals. For instance, in his
most famous speech, delivered at the Lincoln Memorial on August
23, 1963, King announced, &quot;I have a dream that one day this
nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.'&quot;
<P>
Civil rights in this traditional sense have three essential components:
they adhere to individuals, they exist prior to and separate from
government, and they ensure equal opportunity rather than equal
results. That is, each individual has rights equal to those of
every other individual, regardless of race; civil rights are neither
the product of government, nor can they be taken away by government
(hence &quot;inalienable&quot;); and the Declaration promises
a right to pursue happiness or success, not a right to happiness
or success itself.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Almost immediately upon the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which was in line with the traditional understanding of civil
rights, a new goal was announced: the goal, in President Johnson's
words, of &quot;equality as a fact and equality as a result.&quot;
Along with this new goal, civil rights were redefined. Rather
than being rightful claims to one's own possessions, rights in
this new view are claims to the possessions of others. This can
be seen in the character of the new rights which have been posited
in recent decades; for example, rights to publicly-subsidized
housing, education, medical care, food stamps, and day care. And
with this redefinition of rights, the role of government was changed
fundamentally: rather than protecting equal rights, government
became the redistribution center for money, jobs, promotions,
college admissions, etc., all in pursuit of equal results.
<P>
The newer understanding of rights-held by opponents of Proposition
209-hearkens less to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and
early '60s, than to the Progressive Movement of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. 
<P>
Philosopher John Dewey articulated the view of the individual
which underlies this understanding: &quot;Social arrangements,
laws, institutions...are means of creating individuals.... Individuality
in a social and moral sense is something to be wrought out.&quot;
That is, individuals are born first and foremost, not with rights,
but with needs, and are dependent on government to fulfill them.
<P>
And again, this demands a large and intrusive government. Woodrow
Wilson-a progressive political theorist prior to becoming president-was
openly critical of the parts of the Constitution, based on the
Declaration's natural rights doctrine, which limited the government's
power to regulate private or economic life. Much of the history
of American government in this century is the history of overcoming
those limitations.
<P>
The three essential components of the newer view of civil rights
are opposite those of the founding or traditional view. First,
instead of adhering to individuals, civil rights are assigned
according to group affiliation. Second, rights are assigned: they
are not seen as existing prior to and separate from government,
but rather as government grants. And third, rights are understood
to guarantee results rather than opportunity. 
<P>
One of the clearest indications of the revolutionary character
of the new understanding of rights came in a 1987 Supreme Court
case called Johnson v. Transportation Agency-an affirmative action
case in which a man sued a government agency for awarding a job
to an admittedly less-qualified woman. Justice William Brennan,
writing for the majority, asked &quot;whether the [gender-based
affirmative action program] unnecessarily trammeled the rights
of male employees&quot;; his answer was no. 
<P>
In other words, the newly-defined right of the less-qualified
woman to a job necessitated the trammeling of the traditionally-defined
right of the man to equal legal treatment. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
In 1961, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, prohibiting
discrimination in the employment practices of government contractors.
Those enforcing this order required contractors to submit racial
breakdowns of their work forces, in order to ensure integration.
This was in accordance with previous executive orders by Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman, as well as with the traditional understanding
of civil rights. 
<P>
Four years later, however, President Johnson issued Executive
Order 11246, setting up the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
(OFCC) in the Labor Department to oversee government contractors.
OFCC immediately began requiring what amounted to racial quotas.
Bidders submitted &quot;manning tables&quot; guaranteeing the
proportions of racial minorities they would hire if their bid
was accepted. These tables became quite controversial and were
discontinued, but the general practice of requiring contractors
to hire by race continued in various forms and remains in place
today.
<P>
The state of California has 45 separate laws requiring race- and
gender-based preferences in the contracting of goods and services.
Since 1988, for instance, competition for 20 percent of state-funded
contracts have been limited, in effect, to &quot;minority business
enterprises&quot; and &quot;women business enterprises.&quot;
Much of the commentary on this has addressed the enormous cost
to taxpayers. (For instance, preference requirements in state
construction contracts have been estimated to cost California
taxpayers $43 million per year.) But more basically, these requirements
raise the issue of whether affirmative action violates or promotes
civil rights.<sup>7</sup> <BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
There are two diverse understandings of &quot;civil rights&quot;
involved in the debate over Proposition 209. Behind them are conflicting
ideas of justice. The traditional understanding was reflected
in the Supreme Court majority decision in Hirabayashi v. United
States in 1943: &quot;Distinctions between citizens solely because
of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people
whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.&quot;
By &quot;doctrine of equality,&quot; the court meant the doctrine
that individuals have equal rights by nature. 
<P>
Under this doctrine, conditions of individuals in society will
vary greatly, because they are born with different talents and
interests-not to mention luck. Also under this doctrine, government
is charged with protecting individual rights and ensuring equal
opportunity-including maintenance of a safety net-but otherwise
gives free rein to the citizens' talents and interests.
<P>
The newer understanding of civil rights-the one that leads Educators
for Justice, an anti-Proposition 209 group, to call 209 &quot;the
civil wrongs initiative&quot;-grows out of a different understanding
of equality. This is not an equality of rights, but an equality
of results. Setting equality of results as a goal, it becomes
necessary to regulate rights or opportunity. The granting of special
rights to some, while restricting the rights of others, becomes
the task of government. This in turn requires expansive bureaucratic
government, rather than limited government: as the bureaucrat
in charge of OFCC candidly admitted with regard to affirmative
action in 1967, it justifies &quot;anything that you have to do
to get results.&quot;<sup>8</sup><BR>

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Those on opposite sides of the Proposition 209 debate are not
above calling each other liars. But our assumption in this &quot;Citizen's
Guide&quot; has been that neither side is untruthful. Rather they
are using the same terms for near-opposite things. We have outlined
their different understandings of four terms: preferential treatment
or discrimination, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil
rights. And we have looked at the practical effects of their differences
in three areas: college and university admissions, job hiring
and promotions, and public contracting. 
<P>
Having done so, we hope that when supporters of 209 say, &quot;We
are for equal opportunity and against preferential treatment,&quot;
and opponents respond, &quot;No, we are for equal opportunity,
and you are for discrimination&quot;-or when opponents charge
that 209 prohibits outreach programs, and supporters reply that
non-preferential affirmative action will remain legal-citizens
who have read this guide will be able to cope. 
<P>
In brief, the key to the confusion surrounding the 209 debate-as
discussed most directly in our section on &quot;civil rights&quot;-is
that a new view of justice arose relatively recently in America
which is opposed to the founding or traditional view. Many important
terms-including &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;-were
redefined to support this new view. So far, neither the founding
view or the newer view of justice has completely won out, so dual
(and dueling) sets of definitions remain current. Voters in California
this November will begin a decision-to be completed by voters
in subsequent elections nationwide-as to which set will finally
be relegated to the &quot;dustbin of history.&quot;<BR>

<P>
IN THE LATE SPRING NOT SO VERY LONG AGO, Yang-pat Au a 17-year-old
from San Jose, California received a thin letter in the mail that
every high school senior dreads. It was a rejection from his college
of choice, the University of California at Berkeley. That someone
with Au's record-first in his class, straight As, 98th percentile
SAT scores, Junior Achievement, two varsity letters, a seat on
the Student Council, and numerous awards and scholarships-should
be rejected suggests that Berkeley's admissions standards must
be very high indeed.
<P>
And so they are. But high standards alone do not explain Au's
rejection, because many hundreds of such students with less impressive
credentials were admitted that same year.<SUP>1</SUP> 
<P>
Every year hundreds of students are admitted to every University
of California undergraduate campus and professional school, whose
qualifications fall well short of those of many other hundreds
of students who are not so lucky. Academic credentials are not
the only, or even most important, standard of admission.
<P>
Similarly puzzling things happen outside the academic world. Take,
for instance, the experience of Randy Perch. Perch, who owns a
construction firm in Colorado Springs, submitted the low bid on
a project to build the guardrails for a federal highway. But he
was not awarded the contract. 
<P>
Why not? Because unlike most clients of contractors, the U.S.
Department of Transportation does not consider a competitive bid
to be the prime consideration for awarding jobs.
<P>
Or consider Danny O'Connor. A member of the Memphis Police department
since 1975, O'Connor put his name in for promotion to sergeant
in 1988. Out of over 200 aspirants, only the top 75 would be promoted
that year. O'Connor's rank, based on his combined score from a
written exam, an interview, seniority and career performance,
was 56, yet he was not promoted. 
<P>
Why not? Because the department does not rely solely on a candidate's
performance ranking to decide who gets promotes and who does not.
<P>
What happened in all of these cases? Au, Perch and O'Connor are
were victims-just three of countless others-of a policy known
as &quot;Affirmative Action,&quot; a euphemism bold even by the
loose standards of public relations firms and politicians. 
<P>
Affirmative action is, or is supposed to be, a systematic effort
by governments and private organizations to help &quot;historically
underrepresented groups&quot; participate more fully in mainstream
society-especially in employment and education. The phrase &quot;historically
under-represented groups&quot; is a code for racial and ethnic
groups favored by affirmative action's proponents and administrators.
And it has come to include women, who though not originally part
of the affirmative action scheme, have over the years become,
as a group, one of its chief beneficiaries.
<P>
If the above definition seems vague, that is because it is, and
deliberately so. It is what the advocates of affirmative action
say when asked what exactly, or even approximately, the policy
they so cherish is. But it tells us nothing of how affirmative
action actually works, because its workings are embarrassingly
inconsistent with principles that the proponents of the policy
claim to believe in-like equality before the law and the importance
of character, and not skin-color or gender, as the decisive measure
of a human being.
<P>
How does affirmative action really work? When you or I or anyone
seeks some opportunity from the government, or an employer, or
a university-such as a job, a promotion, admission to an academic
program, a contract, you name it-we will be evaluated, as a matter
of official policy, not as individuals according to our personal
qualifications or merits, but as members of certain racial, ethnic
or gender groups. Members of preferred groups receive preferential
treatment.
<P>
It didn't start out this way. Affirmative action began life during
the height of the Civil Rights Movement as an executive order
that directed federal agencies to make an active effort to seek
out minorities for positions in the government. Mostly, this consisted
of more diverse and far-reaching advertising of federal jobs and
more active recruiting tactics. 
<P>
The thinking behind it was that despite the success of the Civil
Rights Movement in finally securing equal rights for all citizens,
citizens who had been denied their rights for generations were
in no position to participate fully in society. And there can
be little doubt that this was indeed true. But unfortunately these
well-meaning-and perfectly constitutional-forms of affirmative
action did not last long. They quickly gave way to the system
we have today, the one that has given us the cases of Yang-pat
Au, Randy Perch, Danny O'Connor and countless others.
<P>
That system separates applicants or candidates into racial or
gender categories before evaluating for college admission, a job,
a promotion, or awarding a contract. This is how Yang-pat Au,
and many others like him, were treated by the University of California's
admissions policy. Although his credentials placed him far above
a majority of those admitted to Berkeley that year, his file was
not evaluated according to a campus-wide standard of admission,
because there is no such thing.
<P>
Put simply, the University separates its applicants into nine
categories, five of which are based solely on race. The standards
of admission for applicants in those five categories are much
lower than those for the non-racial categories.<SUP>2</SUP> And
they have to be if the University is to meet its goal of enrolling
a minimum number of students from each favored racial group. 
<P>
Since Asian high school students like Au tend to outperform other
groups of students, were the admissions policy merit-based (read:
fair) Asians would make up a higher percentage of the unversity's
undergraduate population, while members of other races, particularly
blacks and Hispanics, would see their numbers fall well below
administrative &quot;diversity&quot; targets.
<P>
These targets-&quot;goals&quot; or &quot;benchmarks,&quot; as
they are called-are particularly obnoxious and thus carefully
disguised and misrepresented. There is a better word for them,
a more accurate word, but one that makes affirmative action's
defenders cringe: quotas.
<P>
For that is what they are. When a university openly proclaims,
as the University of California does, that its enrollment must
mirror the ethnic breakdown of the state or region from which
it draws applicants, that is, quite simply, a quota system. The
population of California is about eight percent black. That means
that no matter what, a minimum of eight percent of UC's enrollment
must be black. If there are not enough black applicants whose
academic records are competitive enough to assure their group
enrollment at a rate of eight percent of the student body, then
some remedy must be found. 
<P>
That remedy, it turns out, is to lower admissions standards, but
only for members of the groups that are not naturally filling
their quota. Can anyone imagine selecting the members of a professional
sports team, a symphony orchestra or a hospital surgical staff
in this manner?
<P>
And it's not just the University of California. Cheryl Hopwood,
who applied to the University of Texas Law School in 1992, confident
that her credentials were up to the school's standards. When she
was rejected, her first reaction was surprise coupled with resignation.
&quot;The only thing I could think of,&quot; she said, &quot;was
that the class the school admitted must have been very, very good.&quot;
<P>
In fact, however, that year's group of applicants was not substantially
better than those of years before. Just as in the case of Yang-pat
Au, many applicants with credentials far lower than hers were
admitted.<SUP>3</SUP>
<P>
The University of Texas Law School, like almost every law or professional
school in the country, attempts to enroll a minimum number of
students from certain prefered groups; in particular, school policy
mandates that 15 percent of the Law School class must be black
and Mexican American. 
<P>
Since enough members of those groups don't meet this quota through
open competition with applicants at large, standards must be-and
are-lowered to ensure that the 15 percent target is met. Simple
common sense tells us that when you have a finite number of any
commodity-in this case seats in an entering class-and you reserve,
or &quot;set aside,&quot; a portion of it for a favored group,
then people not lucky enough to be in that group are bound to
be squeezed out on no other basis than their group membership.
<P>
And so Cheryl Hopwood, who was not one of the lucky ones, was
denied admission to law school while 84 applicants with lower
grades and test scores, but who were members of the prefered groups,
were admitted.
<P>
It is important to understand the significance of dividing people
into groups for such purposes. It is nothing less that the denial
of the central principle upon which America was founded, and from
which all of our laws and institutions radiate, or used to radiate.
That is the principle of equality, the equality of each individual
citizen before the law. 
<P>
The Declaration of Independence states that &quot;all men are
created equal,&quot; but the proponents of quotas would rewrite
that famous phrase to say rather that all groups are created equal.
So when their material conditions vary, it is seen as a result
of racism or policy or both and as such must be remedied by policies
directed at the raising up of such afflicted groups, through the
granting of special, extra rights. It even gets to the point where
already successful or wealthy members of such groups get these
same &quot;extra rights.&quot;
<P>
But in truth it is only individual human beings that are equal,
and only in one, very specific sense: they are all equally human
beings, with equal human dignity and the equal rights to be governed
only with their consent, and to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.&quot; 
<P>
These rights are not guaranteed to groups, because they do not-and
cannot-belong to groups. But they do belong to individuals, regardless
of race, religion or anything else, and it is the first business
of government to secure them. The most famous word ever used to
describe this understanding of government is &quot;colorblind.&quot;
It was coined by Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan in
his ringing dissent from the shameful 1897 Plessy decision, in
which the court upheld constitutionality of racial segregation.
<P>
Clearly, Yang-pat Au and Cheryl Hopwood were not treated according
to the principle of colorblindedness. Affirmative action policies
explicitly repudiate this principle as outmoded or even pernicious.
And the people who administer the policies will go to great lengths
to demonstrate their contempt for it. 
<P>
The examples can get bizarre. James Henry, owner of a Columbus,
Ohio, painting company used to do quite a lot of business with
the Ohio State University. Not anymore. His first indication that
things were changing was in 1983, when he was told that he could
not bid on a coming contract, because it was being reserved for
bidding by minority firms only. 
<P>
By 1989, Henry was shut out altogether from bidding on University
jobs, because the school had decided that to meet a general 15
percent set aside on all contracting, it would have to impose
a 100 percent set aside for painting contracts.<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
This is indeed color-consciousness raised to new and offensive
levels. But there are even more bizarre cases. And it is true
even of such policies that do not require outright quotas, but
that nevertheless make legal distinctions along racial group lines.
We may call such policies preferences. They differ from quotas
only in degree and not in kind; both types of policy are based
on the same denial of colorblind justice. Most examples of merely
preferential policies have to do with hiring, and especially promotion,
or contracting. It is most prevalent in government agencies, particularly
police and fire departments.
<P>
Danny O'Connor learned this firsthand. He was not promoted because
his department decided, in the name of affirmative action, to
arbitrarily place a black candidate into every third spot on the
list. Seven of the original 75 top candidates were black, but
26 blacks were promoted, at least 19 of whom had a lower ranking
than O'Connor. 
<P>
And as for Randy Perch, the U.S. Department of Transportation
very vigilantly enforces a law that requires a certain portion
of federal contracting dollars be &quot;set aside&quot; (the government's
language) for minority- and women-owned firms. So the job for
which Perch submitted the low bid went to a firm that submitted
a higher bid but was owned by a member of a government-prefered
group.<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
But perhaps the most outrageous example of preferential treatment
based solely on race is the case of Sharon Taxman, formerly a
typing teacher at Piscataway High School in New Jersey. Facing
a decline in enrollment in &quot;business education&quot; classes,
the school board decided to lay off one teacher. It came down
to two teachers, Taxman and Debra Williams, both of whom had been
hired at the same time and whose performance records were similar.
Taxman was laid off. 
<P>
Why her and not Williams? Bad luck? Perhaps, if you can ascribe
the result of a specific policy to chance: Taxman is white and
Williams is black, and the school board figured that, in the interest
of affirmative action, it would be more socially responsible to
retain the black teacher and let go of the white. 
<P>
This decision captures the essence of what affirmative action
is all about. In dismissing an employee solely on the basis of
race, the board followed, to the letter, the contemporary denial
of individual rights and equality in favor of the idea of group
rights. Goodbye, color-blindedness.
<P>
But perhaps that is too hasty. To be sure, the status of colorblindedness
in the contemporary justice system is degraded indeed, but recent
court decisions, some of them centering on the very cases described
in this paper, show rays of hope. Also, more and more people are
beginning to understand how patenly unfair quotas and prefences
are to individuals and how harmful they are to the rule of law.
<P>
This is in no small part due to the prevalence of cases just like
those outlined above, and to the increasing public scrutiny such
cases are getting. We should hope that they continue to be exposed,
lest our nation never return to the one understanding of rights
that not only promises but also can actually deliver, liberty
and justice for all.
<P>
And there is reason to think that we will. It has been said that
Americans have &quot;a passion for fairness,&quot; and that precisely
this passion made the victories of the Civil Rights Movement possible.
This is certainly true. But now that passion is being twisted
and abused. The government treats its citizens unequally, and
in the name of fairness, no less. It should not be able to do
this. The fact that it does shows that it no longer respects its
own first principles and founding premises. 
<P>
And if governement does not, there is nothing to stop it from
treating people in any respect it wishes, and a people so treated,
or even in principle subject to such treatment, are not free.
<P>
The fate of free government depends on Americans' &quot;passion
for fairness&quot; reasserting itself in the name of equality
properly understood, which means bringing about an end to quotas
and preferences and all the related double-talk. <BR>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;At the heart . . . of the Equal Protection
Clause lies the principle that the Government must treat citizens
as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic or religious
groups. It is for this reason that we must subject all racial
classifications to the strictest of scrutiny....&quot;</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>- Justice Clarence Thomas<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 represented the completion of a long
process to fulfill the promise of &quot;equal protection of the
laws&quot; that had been embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment
(1868). The Civil Rights Act was comprehensive: Title II prohibited
discrimination in public accommodations; Title VI outlawed discrimination
in universities and colleges receiving federal funds; and Title
VII ended discrimination in employment. Its commands were simple:
it was illegal to discriminate against &quot;any individual&quot;
on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national
origin. The principle that animated the Act was &quot;equal opportunity,&quot;
the idea that individual merit rather than the caste of race or
ethnicity should be the standard of distributive justice in the
nation's laws. No more powerful expression of a commitment to
equal opportunity can be found in the annals of modern legislation
anywhere in the world.
<P>
Between 1868 and 1964 considerable progress had been made in driving
race and ethnicity from the Constitution and laws. This progress
proceeded under the banner that the Constitution was color-blind
and that the laws of the nation were not entitled to inquire into
the race or ethnicity of individuals who were subject to the laws.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the culmination of a long campaign
to banish race, color, ethnicity, religion and sex from the law.
Its purpose was noble and its reach was extensive. The focus was
on the rights of individuals; its promise was the equal protection
of equal rights. With the passage of the Act, the civil rights
movement &quot;celebrated the formal achievement of its historic
objectives: a legal regime from which racial classifications had
been largely expunged, and under which the most salient forms
of private discrimination (in public accommodations and employment)
were finally prohibited.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>
Indeed, it can be fairly said that &quot;[l]iberals believed in
1964 that the Constitution imposed a rule of color blindness on
government; and a color-blind standard, for most civil rights
advocates, was the obvious choice to govern those areas of private
conduct addressed by the new legislation.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The congressional debate over the Civil Rights Act was the longest
in our history. Many opponents expressed the fear that Title VII
of the Act would eventually be interpreted to require racial quota
hiring to maintain racial balance. Its proponents vehemently denied
this charge. Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor leader in the
Senate, stated that, 
<P>
[t]he truth is that this title forbids discrimination against
anyone on account of race. This is the simple and complete truth
about Title VII. Contrary to the allegations of some opponents
of this title, there is nothing in it that will give any power
to the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission or to any court
to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order
to meet a racial &quot;quota&quot; or to achieve a certain racial
balance. That bugaboo has been brought up a dozen times; but it
is nonexistent. In fact, the very opposite is true. Title VII
prohibits discrimination. In effect, it says that race, religion
and national origin are not to be used as the basis for hiring
and firing. Title VII is designed to encourage hiring on the basis
of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
And in the peroration of his speech, Senator Humphrey sought once
again to assure the opponents of the Act that their fears of racial
quotas and preferences were misplaced: &quot;It is claimed that
the bill would require racial quotas for all hiring, when in fact
it provided that race shall not be a basis for making personnel
decisions.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Senator Joseph S. Clark, floor manager for Title VII, was even
more explicit when he remarked that, 
<P>
it has been asserted that Title VII would impose a requirement
for 'racial balance.&quot;.... On the contrary, any deliberate
attempt to maintain a given balance would almost certainly run
afoul of Title VII because it would involve a failure or refusal
to hire some individual because of his race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin. What Title VII seeks to accomplish, what
the civil rights bill seeks to accomplish is equal treatment for
all.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>5<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But once the Civil Rights Act was given over to the bureaucrats
in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to write the rules
and regulations for its enforcement, racial proportionality became
the test for &quot;non-discrimination.&quot; And, by and large,
the federal courts were complicit in approving the use of racial
quotas. Thus, an Act that was designed to prohibit racial discrimination
in a wide range of activities was transformed into one that required
racial discrimination. Equal opportunity became racial preference.
<P>
Affirmative action has a similar history. It began innocently
enough-indeed with justifiable altruism. At its inception affirmative
action was designed to ensure non-discrimination in the awarding
of government contracts. Affirmative action in this original sense
sought to enlarge the pool of applicants to ensure equal access.
In the sense that affirmative action is understood to mean casting
a wider net for applicants, it is arguably in the service of equal
opportunity. But the argument of this study is that affirmative
action in the hands of bureaucrats has come to focus on results
rather than opportunity, which has led directly to racial goals
and quotas. In other words, if the putative argument is that an
affirmative action program merely enlarges the pool of applicants,
the inevitable question that arises is &quot;how do we know when
the pool is large enough?&quot; If the results are not racially
proportional the inference is inevitable: the pool is still not
large enough. Only racially or ethnically proportional results
are evidence that &quot;genuine&quot; equal opportunity has been
achieved. Even the original affirmative action order, Executive
Order 11246, which speaks only of equal rights and of non-discrimination,
was immediately interpreted to require quotas. 
<P>
When President Clinton said that he wanted to &quot;mend&quot;
affirmative action rather than &quot;end&quot; it he was searching
for a non-existent middle ground. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
focused on individual rights; affirmative action programs, because
they aim at race proportional results, focus on racial class rights
and ignore the rights of individuals. There is no mending to be
done without rejecting this perversion of the American Creed.

<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES AND </B>
<P>
<B>&quot;THE AMERICAN CREED&quot;<BR>
</B>
<P>
NOTHING IN THE LAST 50 YEARS has harmed racial relations nor done
more to undermine the principle of equal protection of the laws
than racial preferences and racial quotas. Paul M. Sniderman,
a political scientist at Stanford University and Thomas Piazza,
a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, have
documented that &quot;the new race-conscious agenda&quot; represented
by affirmative action programs &quot;has provoked broad outrage
and resentment.&quot; 
<P>
Racial preferences are so intensely disliked that they have led
some whites to dislike blacks--an ironic example of a policy
meant to put the divide of race behind us in fact further widening
it.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></SUP> Sniderman and Piazza
demonstrate, however, that racial animus is not the principal
cause of the anger and resentment. Rather, they have discovered
in their exhaustive analysis of racial attitudes that racial class
preferences offend the &quot;set of convictions about fairness
and fair play that make up the American Creed.&quot; And, as Sniderman
and Piazza rightly note, the principles of &quot;liberty and equality&quot;
form the basis of the Creed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Although unacknowledged by Sniderman and Piazza, the core principles
of &quot;liberty and equality&quot; derive from the founding principles
of the nation. The authors of the Declaration of Independence
enunciated the principles that would animate the new nation. For
our purposes here, it is important to note that the Declaration's
principle that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; means that
individuals are possessed of the natural rights to &quot;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; These rights exist
by nature--they are not created by government. 
<P>
Indeed, legitimate government is derived from the &quot;consent
of the governed&quot; and instituted with the sole purpose of
protecting natural rights. Government, therefore, must be limited;
it exists only to secure the conditions that allow for the exercise
of rights. 
<P>
Thus government's function is to secure the equal protection of
equal rights by laws that operate equally on all citizens. And
the necessary foundation of the rule of law is &quot;equal protection
of the laws,&quot; a concept embodied in the principles of the
founding and articulated in the Fourteenth Amendment. No class
or caste barriers to the exercise of rights can be tolerated;
there must be equal opportunity for individuals regardless of
their race, ethnicity or religion. 
<P>
But the principle of equal opportunity does not guarantee equality
of results; indeed, the principle of equal opportunity looks forward
to inequality of results, but an inequality of results that is
not based on artificial class or caste status. Rather, the principle
of equal opportunity allows the full development of the natural
talents and abilities of individuals. The practical import of
the nation's founding principles is to enshrine equal opportunity
in the exercise of rights as the basic principle of &quot;fairness
and fair play.&quot; This principle is, of course, undermined
by a system that apportions rewards, not on the basis of individual
merit, but on the basis of race and ethnicity.
<P>
Preferential programs are premised on the notion that rights belong
to racial and ethnic groups, that an individual's rights are conditioned
by the racial or ethnic class that he inhabits. This notion comes
very close to establishing a caste system based on race and ethnicity
that is wholly alien to the principles of the American regime.
It has more in common with a system based on racial apartheid
than it does with a liberal democracy dedicated to the protection
of individual rights through the rule of law. 
<P>
As Sniderman and Piazza note, &quot;[w]hat gives the race-conscious
agenda its distinctive character, what makes the agenda open to
challenge morally, is that the principle of preferential treatment
runs against the Creed.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUP>
<P>
According to Sniderman and Piazza, the tremendous gains of the
civil rights movement were due to the fact that it sought equal
treatment for blacks and whites. This was &quot;consistent with
the American Creed.&quot; But on the &quot;heels of its greatest
successes, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and [the Voting Rights
Act of] 1965, the voices of separatism began to drown out those
of integration.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Once the civil rights movement abandoned the American Creed, transforming
itself from a movement advocating and securing equal rights for
all individuals to one advocating racial preferences and quotas,
it lost much of the support that it had enjoyed in the opinion
of the majority. Opposition to racial quotas is not driven by
racial animus; rather it is driven by a desire to preserve the
principles that animate the American Creed--those principles
that protect the equal rights of every individual. Sniderman and
Piazza conclude from their comprehensive survey of racial attitudes
that &quot;[a]ffirmative action--defined to mean preferential
treatment--has become the chief item on the race-conscious
agenda. It produces resentment and disaffection not because it
assists blacks--substantial numbers of whites are prepared
to support a range of policies to see blacks better off--but
because it is judged to be unfair.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></SUP>
But &quot;[i]t is . . . simply wrong,&quot; Sniderman and Piazza
caution, &quot;to suppose that the primary factor driving the
contemporary arguments over the politics of race is white racism.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>11

<P>
<B>THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION<BR>
</B>
<P>
PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO RACIAL PREFERENCES and quotas has been constant
since the inception of affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></SUP>
A recent poll commissioned by the Washington Post, the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University, found that a
vast majority of whites (86 percent), and substantial majorities
among blacks (68 percent), Hispanics (78 percent) and Asians (74
percent) believe that &quot;hiring, promotion and college admissions
should be based strictly on merit and qualifications other than
race or ethnicity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></SUP> Similarly,
numerous Gallup polls conducted between 1977 and 1990 consistently
showed that more than 80 percent of the nation's population reject
racial quotas and preferences &quot;to make up for past discrimination.&quot;
One analyst concludes that &quot;it is clear that, over a period
of 40 years, the widespread acceptance of segregation and racial
discrimination among white Americans has given way to massive
support for the general principles of integration and equal treatment.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Insofar as affirmative action is understood as mandating racial
preferences, racial quotas and racial set-asides, public opinion
overwhelming opposes it. Rather, there seems to be an overwhelming
attachment to the principle of merit understood in terms of equal
opportunity. In California, surveys published by the Los Angeles
Times in March and May, 1995 showed that whites (71 percent),
Asians (54 percent) and Latinos (52 percent), as well as a substantial
number of blacks (45 percent) support the California Civil Rights
Initiative, a November, 1996 ballot initiative that will end state-sponsored
racial preferences and racial quotas. What is more, the May, 1995
poll found a substantial majority of women favoring the initiative.
This led one commentator to note that different levels of support
among men and women &quot;barely attains statistical significance.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>15</FONT></SUP>
<BR>

<P>
<B>THE RETURN OF </B>
<P>
<B>SEPARATE BUT EQUAL<BR>
</B>
<P>
IT WAS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT affirmative action could have served
the principle of non-discrimination without the use of racial
quotas. Had affirmative action merely meant that the government
would act to insure that only the most qualified individuals were
being hired, promoted, given contracts and admitted to universities,
the law would have remained colorblind. This could have been accomplished
through a system of rigorous audits and reviews. All qualified
minorities would have been confident that in hiring and admissions
decisions only the most qualified were selected. 
<P>
Even this would have required that individuals be regarded in
a completely color-blind manner and not viewed through the lens
of racial proportionality. Had affirmative action maintained this
high ground of principle, no constitutional objections could have
been lodged against it. But what is commonly known as affirmative
action today has nothing of this optimism, having lapsed into
a kind of cynical racial spoils system.
<P>
According to supporters of this system, the test of non-discrimination
is &quot;population parity.&quot; If blacks make up 15 percent
of the population, then they should make up 15 percent of each
university class; this is the only way to insure that discrimination
has not been a factor in the admissions process. When &quot;population
parity&quot; has not occurred, there should be &quot;remedial
action&quot; consisting of relaxed admissions standards or other
non-competitive devices to insure &quot;parity.&quot; In other
words, affirmative action is inseparable from the notion of racial
quotas whenever it assumes that lack of &quot;population parity&quot;
is proof of racial discrimination. The notion of &quot;population
parity&quot; sets the quota. And those who try to distinguish
between goals and quotas are simply obfuscating the issue. Goals
are quotas-no amount of artful dodging can obscure this fact.
<P>
It was more than 30 years ago that the proponents of racial preferences
and quotas assured a skeptical world that they would only be a
temporary measure designed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity.
Today, however, affirmative action is unabashedly looked upon
by their supporters as a means of securing racial class entitlements.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>16</FONT></SUP>
In the palmy days when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed,
everyone seemed optimistic that the final vestiges of race consciousness
had been removed from the laws of the nation. Indeed, many saw
the Act as a legislative endorsement of Justice Harlan's dissent
in the infamous Plessy case, the case that upheld the constitutionality
of the justly decried &quot;separate but equal doctrine.&quot;
In his dissent, Justice Harlan had remarked that,
<P>
Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates
classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens
are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most
powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of
his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed
by the supreme law of the land are involved. It is, therefore
to be regretted that this high tribunal, the final expositor of
the fundamental law of the land, has reached the conclusion that
it is competent for a State to regulate the enjoyment by citizens
of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>17
<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Harlan's dissent had provided a kind of moral standard that steadily
worked toward the eventual demise of the &quot;separate but equal
doctrine.&quot; Indeed, the idea of a color-blind constitution
was the source of tremendous progress in subsequent years; while
that progress might have moved by fits and starts and at too slow
a pace, no one can doubt that between 1896 and the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 the Constitution had indeed become color-blind. But
as more than one observer has pointed out, racial quotas and preferences
are precisely the kind of &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine
that was condemned by Harlan's dissenting opinion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>18</FONT></SUP>
Justice Harry Blackmun, in his separate opinion in Regents of
the University of California v. Bakke, stated the connection between
affirmative action and Plessy's &quot;separate but equal doctrine&quot;
as clearly as it possibly could have been stated:
<P>
I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative-action
program in a racially neutral way and have it successful. To ask
that this be so is to demand the impossible. In order to get beyond
racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other
way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat
them differently. We cannot-we dare not-let the Equal Protection
Clause perpetuate racial supremacy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>19<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Blackmun could have used the word &quot;separately&quot; in place
of &quot;differently&quot; without changing the meaning of the
sentence in any respect. In order to treat people equally, they
must be treated separately (&quot;differently&quot;): this is
the explicit meaning of the racial quotas and preferences that
form the core of results-oriented affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>20</FONT></SUP>
It is a new kind of segregation; this time, however, its supporters
believe that the genie of race can be released once again from
its bottle as a force for good. At almost the eleventh hour--indeed
almost contemporaneously with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act--the civil rights movement abandoned the principles that
had served it so well. It was believed that new principles would
better serve the cause of human liberty and serve that cause more
quickly. But those new principles turned out to be nothing more
than the revival of the old system of &quot;separate but equal&quot;
and race segregation. 
<P>
The racial genie, after having finally been confined by powerful
constitutional restraints, was released once again. To say that
this was a dangerous move is a vast understatement. In the past,
the racial genie had always been a force for evil--there is
no reason to believe that it has miraculously changed its ways.
In fact, as Sniderman and Piazza have pointed out, there is much
evidence to suppose that the genie of race is the same one that
the nation struggled to put back in its bottle--it has not
changed its nature nor its evil ways. But today, its work is made
easier by the apologists of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine, because they portray the new racism--and the supposedly
new genie--as the best that liberal and enlightened opinion
can produce.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>DOES RACE MATTER?<BR>
</B>
<P>
IT HAS BEEN ARGUED BY SUPPORTERS of racial preferences that race
has always been a factor in the calculus of American politics
and American life and that it is naive or dishonest to believe
that the Constitution and the laws can be administered in a color-blind
manner. &quot;Race matters,&quot; we are told, and American society
will never get beyond racism. It is better to be straightforward
about the necessity of racial class consciousness and understand
it for what it is--racial classification to promote racial
class interests.
<P>
This view, of course, has never been a part of the political calculus
in America. Slavery, racial segregation, and racial discrimination
were always considered as a violation of America's deepest held
principles. Martin Luther King's dream that someday his children
would be &quot;judged on the content of their character and not
on the color of their skin&quot; was made possible by those principles
which ultimately derive from the fact that &quot;all men are created
equal.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, whose statesmanship also helped
make King's dream possible, called this principle of natural human
equality &quot;the father of all moral principle in us.&quot;
Lincoln insisted that the Declaration of Independence contained
&quot;the standard maxims of a free society.&quot; In 1857, he
said:
<P>
I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include
all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all
respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size,
intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined
with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider
all men created equal--equal in &quot;certain inalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;
This they said, and this they meant. 
<P>
They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were
then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were
about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no
power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the
right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances
should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free
society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all;
constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though
never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby
constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting
the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.
<BR>
<P>
It was surely in this spirit that the nation adopted the Declaration
of Independence as the principled foundation of its political
life. And it was in this spirit that the nation fought a bloody
civil war over the morality and policy of slavery; ratified the
Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery; ratified the Fourteenth
Amendment to extend equal protection of the laws to all citizens;
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of
1965; and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Those who argue that &quot;race
matters&quot;--that race provides the only principle of distributive
justice--simply reject the principles of the Founders, Abraham
Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>FROM EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALITY OF RESULT<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1954, BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION outlawed segregation in public
schools; later cases did the same for other public facilities.
Some have argued that Brown was the vindication of Harlan's Plessy
dissent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>21</FONT></SUP> In a similar vein, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 was said to have been based on the reasoning
of Brown and its progeny. In short, the Civil Rights Act represented
the national recognition of the principle of a color-blind constitution
and color-blind laws. The Act prohibited discrimination against
any individual in employment or in public accommodations on the
basis of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex or national origin.
It had provisions to extend its reach to private companies with
more than 25 employees and to any educational institution that
received federal funds.
<P>
The important point, however, is that the plain language of the
Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination against individuals,
not racial or ethnic classes. In focusing upon the rights of individuals,
the Civil Rights Act was a perfect expression of the Fourteenth
Amendment's attempt to disallow racial considerations as the basis
for determining the rights of individuals. As the Supreme Court
once noted, the &quot;rights created by the...Fourteenth Amendment
are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established
are personal rights.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>22</FONT></SUP> Indeed,
the Civil Rights Act contained provisions disallowing the use
of racial preferences or quotas of any kind. The language could
not possibly be more explicit:
<P>
It shall be unlawful employment practice for any employer...to
discriminate against any individual because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex or national origin....Nothing contained
in this title shall be interpreted to require any employer to
grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group
because of race...on account of an imbalance which may exist with
respect to the total number or percentage of persons employed...
in comparison with the available work force.<BR>
<P>
But the ink of President Lyndon Johnson's signature had barely
dried when the movement to use racial quotas and preferences in
the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act began. Indeed, the goal
was to transform a law which prohibited discrimination against
individuals into one that required discrimination. The supposed
rationale was to use race as a means of &quot;getting beyond race,&quot;
to hasten the end of discrimination by engaging in acceptable
forms of discrimination now understood as racial class remedies
for past racial class injuries. Johnson gave the first call to
release the genie of race from the confines that had been created
by the Civil Rights Act. Speaking before an audience at Howard
University on June 4, 1965 Johnson said:
<P>
Freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries
by saying now you're free to go where you want and do as you desire
and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who
for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him
up to the starting line of a race and then say, you're free to
compete with the others, and justly believe that you have been
completely fair.
<P>
Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All
our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.
<P>
This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for
civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek
not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as
a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a
result....
<P>
To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not
enough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>23<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The sweep of this pronouncement was breathtaking: &quot;Freedom
is not enough.&quot; Freedom--equal opportunity--is not
enough because it may not produce &quot;equality as a result.&quot;
Restrictions on the freedom of some, therefore, will be the condition
for the advancement of others--those who came to be known
in legal jargon as belonging to &quot;specially protected classes&quot;
or &quot;preferred classes.&quot; Indeed, &quot;coercive remedies&quot;
were to become the favorite instrument of the vast bureaucracy
that was created to administer racial quotas and preferences.
Eventually, the courts, the Congress and both Democratic and Republican
Presidents became complicit in this enterprise to restructure
society based on racial class principles.
<P>
Equality of result and &quot;population parity&quot; are the concepts
that drive racial preferences and quotas. These concepts assume
that, absent discrimination, the races will freely arrange themselves
in the various aspects of political and private life in exact
racial proportionality to their numbers in society at large. When
this does not happen, the cause is presumed to be racial discrimination.
<P>
But, of course, when people are free they will never sort themselves
out in exact racial proportionality in their choice of jobs and
university attendance. Since the presumption is that lack of proportionality
is always caused by racial discrimination, the only way discrimination
can be overcome is to curtail the freedom of the decision makers.
Coercive remedies, whether imposed by administrative bureaucracies
or courts, have the purpose of forcing racial quotas upon society
at large. For the minions of the administrative state, racial
proportionality is the only proof of non-discrimination.
<P>
This policy, rather than seeking out actual discrimination and
working to redress it, instead presumes discrimination on the
part of everyone and fashions remedies based on this presumption.
This situation presents the alarming possibility of a nation that
may one day consider all civil rights to be nothing more than
racial class entitlements. 
<P>
But any nation with the slightest regard for the lessons of history
would never self-consciously allow itself to regard the rights
of individuals as nothing more than the by-product of racial class
interests. Despite assurances by proponents that the ultimate
purpose of racial preferences is to get beyond racial classifications,
it is clear that no system that requires racial classifications
for its operation can result in a decline in racialist thinking--indeed,
racial consciousness is exacerbated by racial preferences and
quotas because it promotes the dangerous idea that an individual's
interest is determined by his race. Those who advocate policies
based on racial consciousness simply have not thought out the
consequences, believing, no doubt, that a means can never become
the end itself. But that is exactly what has happened in the case
of affirmative action.
<P>
In its early years, the use of racial quotas and preferences was
based merely upon an executive order that required &quot;affirmative
action&quot; in the awarding of federal contracts. Actually, the
executive orders had begun as early as the Franklin Roosevelt
administration as a device to insure non-discrimination in the
awarding of federal contracts. Under the Johnson and Nixon administrations,
they became the vehicle for requiring racial discrimination in
the awarding of federal contracts. 
<P>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance in the Labor Department,
created in 1965 to oversee Johnson's Executive Order 11246, developed
into a huge bureaucracy to administer affirmative action--affirmative
action that was now understood to require the use of race to enforce
the belief that &quot;freedom is not enough.&quot; 
<P>
As historian Herman Belz has noted, in the hands of the administrators
at OFCC &quot;[a]ffirmative action in contract compliance was
directed at collective social and institutional discrimination,
rather than individual discriminatory acts . . . Implicitly resting
on the theory of disparate impact discrimination, the executive
order program constituted a simpler and more direct form of government
coercion than Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] enforcement
because it was not concerned with the legal question of the meaning
of unlawful discrimination.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>24</FONT></SUP>
OFCC operations were greatly expanded in the Nixon administration,
where affirmative action developed into &quot;a politically motivated
policy of racial preference.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>25</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had been charged with
writing the rules and regulations to enforce the prohibitions
against employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. Not surprisingly, the EEOC took a race-based remedial
approach to the problem of employment discrimination. 
<P>
Belz says that the EEOC was &quot;more ideologically militant&quot;
than OFCC, and that &quot;despite the very limited nature of its
authority&quot; it &quot;revised the basic principles of employment
discrimination law and began the transformation of equality of
opportunity into equality of result.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>26</FONT></SUP>
The courts also accepted the EEOC's reinterpretation of the Civil
Rights Act to require racial proportionality--called &quot;disparate
impact&quot;--as a test of non-discrimination. The courts
developed the view that the Civil Rights Act was only designed
to protect members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities
who could not successfully press their racial class interests
through the majoritarian political process. 
<P>
Congress was disinclined to challenge OFCC and EEOC policies that
were explicitly designed to promote racial class quotas and preferences.
To do so would risk the ire of politically powerful special interest
groups devoted to the promotion of racial interests. Eventually
the Congress joined the racial class approach to distributive
justice when it passed the Minority Business Enterprise provisions
of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE SUPREME COURT AND </B>
<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
THE MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE provisions mandated a 10 percent
set-aside for minority businesses in local public works projects.
The set-asides applied to blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians,
and Aleuts. Challenges to the constitutionality of the program
came before the Supreme Court in 1980 in Fullilove v. Klutznick.
Writing for a plurality of the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger,
a Nixon appointee, wrote:
<P>
It is not a constitutional defect in this program that it may
disappoint the expectations of nonminority firms. When effectuating
a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of
prior discrimination, such &quot;a sharing of the burden&quot;
by innocent parties is not impermissible. The actual &quot;burden&quot;
shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light.... Moreover,
although we may assume that the complaining parties are innocent
of any discriminatory conduct, it was within congressional power
to act on the assumption that in the past some nonminority businesses
may have reaped competitive benefit over the years from the virtual
exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>27</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Incredibly, Burger maintained that injury to &quot;innocent parties&quot;
is permissible when the injury is &quot;relatively light.&quot;
In more heady and perhaps less cynical days, the Supreme Court
always maintained that &quot;[t]he degree of the discrimination
is irrelevant.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>28</FONT></SUP> In other
words, the Court once believed that any violation of constitutional
rights, however slight or &quot;bearable,&quot; offended the Constitution.
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how there can be &quot;slight&quot;
violations of constitutional rights. 
<P>
Although it may be true that the burden imposed by the MBE provisions
are in some sense &quot;bearable,&quot; it still militates against
the principle of equal protection of the laws--that rights
belong to individuals and not to racial classes. In constitutional
government, principle is everything, for it is precisely adherence
to principle that distinguishes constitutional government from
other kinds of government, and any violation of those principles--however
&quot;slight&quot; or &quot;bearable&quot;--should provoke
alarm among citizens.
<P>
Fullilove provoked a bitter dissent from Justice Stewart, who
wrote that &quot;in the exercise of its powers, Congress must
obey the Constitution....The statute, on its face and in effect...bars
the members of [a] class solely on the basis of their race or
ethnic background. This is precisely the kind of law that the
guarantee of equal protection forbids.&quot; Stewart ended his
dissent with the remark that &quot;[t]here are those who think
that we need a new Constitution, and their views may someday prevail.
But under the Constitution we have, one practice in which government
may never engage is the practice of racism-not even 'temporarily'
and not even as an 'experiment.'&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>29</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In the years after Fullilove, a badly divided Court exhibited
considerable confusion in racial set-aside cases, particularly
with respect to the question of whether rights adhere to individuals
or racial and ethnic groups. In City of Richmond v. Croson (1989),
the Court declared a minority set-aside program to be in violation
of the Equal Protection Clause. The city of Richmond, which has
a 50 percent black population, passed an ordinance that required
non-minority-owned prime contractors who were awarded city construction
contracts to set aside <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>30</FONT></SUP> percent
of the dollar amount of the contract for one or more minority-owned
business enterprises.
<P>
The city alleged no prior discrimination in the award of contracts,
but justified its action as a means of ameliorating society-wide
discriminatory practices. Writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor
concluded that, &quot;[t]o accept Richmond's claim that past societal
discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences
would be to open the door to competing claims for 'remedial relief'
for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal
citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity
and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences
based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs...We think
such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit
of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.&quot;30
<P>
Indeed, it is manifestly clear that there is simply no principled
way to resolve such competing racial and ethnic class claims in
a manner consistent with the rule of law. Justice Kennedy accurately
expressed the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment when
he remarked in his concurring opinion that &quot;the moral imperative
of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal Protection
Clause.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>31</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C. (1990), decided scarcely a
year after Croson, raised the issue of racial quotas and racial
preferences in the starkest possible light. (Incidentally, this
was the last major opinion written by Justice William Brennan,
the most liberal member of the Court.) At issue in Metro was the
Federal Communications Commission's policy of giving racial and
ethnic group preferences in the issuance of broadcast licenses.
The purported goal of this policy was not to compensate for past
racial and ethnic discrimination, but simply to foster &quot;broadcast
diversity.&quot; 
<P>
Brennan indicated that the Court would accord extraordinary deference
to the Congress: &quot;It is of overriding significance in these
cases that the FCC's minority ownership programs have been specifically
approved--indeed mandated--by Congress.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>32</FONT></SUP>
A majority of the Court decided to make a radical break with precedent
in holding that the appropriate test for &quot;racial classifications&quot;
was not &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; but the less demanding &quot;important
governmental interests test.&quot; As Justice Brennan remarked,
<P>
[w]e hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress--even
if those measures are not &quot;remedial&quot; in the sense of
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal
discrimination-- are constitutionally permissible to the extent
that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those
objectives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>33<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The novelty of the decision in Metro is breathtaking. Racial classifications
will no longer automatically trigger the most searching judicial
examination if they are purported to benefit members of preferred
racial and ethnic groups. What is more, there is no necessity
of justifying the classifications in terms of providing remedies
for victims of discrimination; nor was there any necessity of
demonstrating that preferential policies to encourage minority
ownership would in fact lead to programming &quot;diversity.&quot;
It is enough, Brennan wrote, that &quot;both Congress and the
FCC maintain simply that expanded minority ownership of broadcast
outlets will, in the aggregate, result in broadcast diversity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>34</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming, arguendo, that &quot;broadcast diversity&quot; serves
important governmental interests, there seems to be some doubt
even in Brennan's mind that the means chosen by the FCC to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; are substantially related to that interest.
&quot;While we are under no illusion,&quot; Brennan admitted,
&quot;that members of a particular minority group share some cohesive,
collective viewpoint, we believe it a legitimate inference for
Congress and the Commission to draw that as more minorities gain
ownership and policymaking roles in the media, varying perspectives
will be more fairly represented on the airwaves.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>35</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming that members of racial or ethnic groups share the same
opinions and viewpoints would, of course, partake of the kind
of &quot;impermissible stereotyping&quot; that the Court had previously
ruled was disallowed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. But as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her dissenting
opinion, when the FCC wanted to undertake a study to determine
whether the nexus between minority ownership and broadcast diversity
existed to any significant degree, &quot;Congress barred the FCC's
attempt to initiate that examination&quot; through its control
over &quot;appropriations measures.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>36</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Without a clear demonstration of the nexus, however, the race-conscious
policy cannot be said to serve an important government interest.
The racial classifications in the FCC policy were thus merely
based on assumptions and inferences. One does not have to be well
steeped in the lessons of history to see the danger of using racial
classifications in such an open and exploitive manner.
<P>
Brennan concluded his majority opinion in Metro by repeating the
arguments in Fullilove that the racial policies involved in the
FCC programs do not &quot;impose impermissible burdens on nonminorities.&quot;
Of course, &quot;innocent persons may be called upon&quot; to
bear the burden of eradicating the present effects of past discrimination,
a discrimination in which they played no role. This is all acceptable
within the universe of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine because policies such as those of the FCC do &quot;not
impose an undue burden on non-minorities.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>37</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In practice, however, the FCC policy of allowing &quot;minority-led
investor groups&quot; to bid on licenses had led, not indeed to
broadcast diversity, but to buying and selling of licenses at
extraordinary profits for investors from preferred racial and
ethnic groups. Many wealthy minorities have reaped tidy profits
from this policy, including Julius Erving, O.J. Simpson and Colin
Powell. 
<P>
Following revelations that the FCC policy would lead to obscene
profits and tax breaks for a former general counsel to the FCC
who was heading a &quot;minority led investor group,&quot; Congress,
in February, 1995, passed a bill--signed with the greatest
reluctance by President Clinton--repealing the FCC program.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>38</FONT></SUP>
Although the Republican-led Congress has recently given up its
attempt to pass legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole and
Representative Charles Canady to repeal all federal programs--more
than 160!--involving racial preferences, the repeal of the
FCC program could well signal the beginning of a long term project
to eliminate all racial preferences and set-asides from the law.
Both justice and policy demand such a result.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE BEGINNING OF THE END </B>
<P>
<B>OF RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1995, IT APPEARED THAT THE JUDICIAL TIDE was beginning to turn
against the kind of reckless use of racial classifications that
the Metro Court approved. The Supreme Court has, in recent cases,
squarely faced the issue of whether rights belong to racial and
ethnic groups or to individuals, and it has emphatically decided
in favor of the latter. 
<P>
The Supreme Court, after much confusion and not a little sleight
of hand, has finally decided to honor the original intent of the
Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pena (1995) was the first case. At issue was a Department
of Transportation racial and ethnic set-aside program that provided
financial incentives to general contractors to give sub-contracts
to minorities. Adarand had lost a bid to a minority controlled
subcontractor even though he had submitted the lowest bid for
the project. Minority controlled construction firms have to be
certified by the Small Business Administration as either &quot;socially
disadvantaged&quot; or &quot;economically disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
SBA regulations, however, presume that members of designated minority
groups--black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian,
Native American and &quot;members of other groups designated from
time to time by SBA&quot;--are &quot;entitled to a race-based
presumption of social and economic disadvantage.&quot; In practice,
many of the minority-controlled construction firms are headed
by wealthy minorities who play the game of racial and ethnic preferences
with consummate skill. Justice O'Connor, writing for a majority
of the Court in Adarand, overruled the Metro Broadcasting decision,
insofar as Metro had established relaxed standards for allowing
the government to classify on the basis of race. The principal
defect of the majority opinion in Metro, according to O'Connor,
was that it failed to recognize
<P>
the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution protect persons, not groups. It follows from
that principle that all governmental action based on race--a
group classification long recognized as &quot;in most circumstances
irrelevant and therefore prohibited&quot;--should be subjected
to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right
to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These
ideas have long been central to this Court's understanding of
equal protection, and holding &quot;benign&quot; state and federal
racial classifications to different standards does not square
with them. &quot;[A] free people whose institutions are founded
upon the doctrine of equality&quot;. . . should tolerate no retreat
from the principle that government may treat people differently
because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>39</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Thus Justice O'Connor reaffirms the principle that was well-known
to both the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and the drafters
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: what offends the Constitution
is classification and segregation by race, and the level of judicial
scrutiny should not be determined by whose racial class interests
are served. 
<P>
Justice Thomas made precisely this point when he remarked in his
concurring opinion that, &quot;I believe that there is a 'moral
[and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate
a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race
in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government
cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect
us as equal before the law.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>40</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In Miller v. Johnson, a redistricting case decided the same term,
the Court came to a similar conclusion: all individuals, regardless
of race, have a constitutional right, stemming from the Equal
Protection Clause, to be free from government actions which segregate
on the basis of race or ethnicity.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>41</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Adarand and Miller decisions may be the beginning of the dismantling
of the new &quot;seperate but equal&quot; regime. Although not
entirely unambiguous and unequivocal, these decisions give the
country some hope that it may one day look forward to the end
of an egregiously mistaken doctrine that the Constitution allows
so-called &quot;benign&quot; discrimination. 
<P>
The idea that government can engage in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit members of &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;
has dominated equal protection jurisprudence for a generation.
Courts simply assumed that legislation intended to benefit, rather
than harm, preferred races or ethnic groups provided no grounds
for complaint by injured individuals in the majority racial group.
After all, we were assured, the majority cannot injure itself
as a class. If it can be determined that legislative intent was
remedial in a racial context, then individual members of the majority
cannot claim injury because it is a kind of self-imposed injury,
or at least not an injury suffered at the hands of another racial
class. For those individuals within the majority racial class
who are injured by the operation of &quot;benign discrimination,&quot;
their injury is surely &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;only slight.&quot;
<P>
This analysis assumes that all members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot;
minorities have suffered racial class injuries and that all members
of the &quot;monolithic&quot; white majority have perpetrated
racial class injuries. As Justice Marshall remarked in his separate
opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, &quot;It
is unnecessary in 20th-century America to have individual Negroes
demonstrate that they have been victims of racial discrimination;
the racism of our society has been so pervasive that none, regardless
of wealth or position, has managed to escape its impact.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>42</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But this class analysis necessarily ignores individuals and the
rights that are intrinsic to individual, rather than class, autonomy.
Class analysis paints with a broad brush that necessarily covers
over the differing situations of the individuals who make up the
class.
<P>
The intrusion of class analysis into equal protection jurisprudence
is a dangerous proposition, one that is clearly at odds with the
principles of the American regime--principles that are ultimately
derived from the proposition that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;
Class considerations explicitly deny this equality because they
necessarily abstract from the individual and ascribe to him class
characteristics that are different--and necessarily unequal--from
those of individuals inhabiting other classes. If there were no
inequalities implicit in class distinctions, such distinctions
would simply be superfluous. In the class analysis of rights,
it is not necessary to show individual injury because in a presumed
racist society all members of so-called &quot;discrete and insular
minorities&quot; are said to have been injured as a class and
all members of the majority are said to have perpetrated racial
class injuries. But, of course, this is a very thin fiction. Black
or Hispanic immigrants who recently arrived in the United States
do not suffer the &quot;present effects of past discrimination,&quot;
any more than the sons or daughters of a wealthy blacks or Hispanics
who have attended elite preparatory schools. To say that these
people--merely because of their membership in a class--must
be deemed to have been injured by the operation of a &quot;monolithic
white majority&quot; is to pile fiction upon fiction. Preferential
admissions programs for the children of wealthy minorities that
are based on the presumption that the children of poor white families
have reaped the benefits of prior discrimination transforms the
rule of law into a farcical comedy. 
<P>
Whenever the government engages in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit preferred races or ethnic classes, it imposes injuries
on individuals who are not members of those preferred classes.
It does not alleviate--or excuse--the injury to say that
it is &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;relatively slight.&quot; Any
injury that must be borne because of membership in a racial or
ethnic class must be forbidden by any reasonable interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause.
<P>
Justice Powell in his Bakke opinion pointed out the defect of
the class-based analysis of equal protection rights: &quot;There
is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons...to bear
the burdens of redressing grievances not of their own making.&quot;
Indeed, using class considerations as a means of fashioning equitable
remedies for such injuries as &quot;historic&quot; discrimination
or &quot;the present effects of past discrimination&quot; will
inevitably destroy the possibility of a jurisprudence based on
constitutional principles. It is only by viewing the Equal Protection
Clause as the guarantor of individual rights, Powell argued, that
the Constitution can ultimately be applied in a non-arbitrary
manner.
<P>
If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection
against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background
because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather
than the individual only because of his membership in a particular
group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular
classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance .
. .but the standard of justification will remain constant. 
<P>
This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the
product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within
the democratic process. When they touch upon an individual's race
or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination
that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely
tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The Constitution
guarantees that right to every person regardless of his background.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>43</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
As Powell pointed out, an adherence to a conception of equal protection
that disallows class considerations is the only one possible that
is consistent with the dictates of principled constitutional government.
Anything else simply makes protection of constitutional rights
&quot;vary with the ebb and flow of political forces.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>44</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Whenever government acts to distribute scarce resources such as
admission to state universities, preference in awarding of contracts,
awarding of financial incentives, or tax incentives, its principle
of distribution must be reasonable. In apportioning places in
the university, for example, it cannot assign those places in
an arbitrary manner; there must be a rational relationship between
the kinds of persons admitted and the end or purpose of the university.
<P>
It is true that no one has a right to attend the university, but
every individual has a right to be treated equally with respect
to the criteria for admission. The proponents of racial preferences
in California argue that current affirmative action admissions
programs do not admit any minority members to the university system
who are not qualified. It is a well known fact, however, that
the SAT scores of minority admittees at the University of California
are on average nearly 200 points lower than non-minority admittees.
This, of course, is a significant difference in light of the fact
that there is virtual unanimity among experts that SAT scores
are an accurate predictor of success. 
<P>
If the minimum standard of competence is set low enough, then,
of course, everyone is qualified. But the relevant point is that
the most qualified are not admitted under a system of racial preferences.
What could be more irrational and arbitrary in determining admission
to a university? What equal protection of the laws demands is
that individuals have a right to be free from arbitrary and capricious
governmental action. Certainly decisions based on the accidental
characteristic of race and ethnicity are inherently arbitrary.
<P>
A recent Federal court of appeals case has found the racial and
ethnic preferential admission program employed at the University
of Texas Law School to be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's
Equal Protection Clause. The University had employed a segregated
system of evaluation, putting black and Hispanic candidates in
separate pools in which they competed only with members within
their own racial or ethnic pool. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,
relying on the Adarand decision, noted that:
<P>
Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts,
rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity
fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities
as a group, rather than as individuals.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>45<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
And in a stinging critique of the separate but equal admissions
process employed by the University of Texas Law School, the court
concluded that &quot;an inference is raised that the program was
the result of racial social engineering rather than a desire to
implement a remedy.&quot;<SUP>46</SUP> In July, 1996, the Supreme
Court refused to grant certiorari to review the decision. This
has sparked much speculation as to the Supreme Court's motive
for the refusal. It requires only four members of the Supreme
Court to grant the petition for review. 
<P>
Surely the four dissenters in the Adarand case who wholeheartedly
support racial goals and preferences would want to try to overturn
the lower court's decision. But it is possible that they believed
that this was the wrong case to review given the current make-up
of the Supreme Court. Another strong decision striking down the
use of racial and ethnic quotas would make it more difficult to
restore them in the future. Perhaps the four Adarand dissenters
hope that a second Clinton administration will have the opportunity
to appoint pro-preference, pro-quota justices to the Court-thus
the delaying tactics.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE FUTURE OF RACIAL </B>
<P>
<B>PREFERENCES IN CALIFORNIA<BR>
</B>
<P>
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER among the States in restoring equal
protection rights to all its citizens. The Regents of the University
of California last year took the bold step of outlawing racial
preferences in admissions and hiring. The firestorm of protest
that was occasioned by this decision indicates the degree to which
entrenched interests have become attached to the regime of racial
preferences and quotas. Governor Pete Wilson also took a courageous
step in rescinding all executive orders that mandated quota hiring,
racial set-asides in contracting, and other race-based programs.
Most importantly, however, the people of the State of California
will, for the first time, be asked to vote on the issue of racial
preferences in a November, 1996 constitutional amendment initiative,
the California Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI attempts to do one
simple thing: restore to the California Constitution the understanding
of equal protection rights that animated the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. That act made it unlawful to discriminate
against any individual on the basis of race, color, ethnicity,
religion, sex or national origin. CCRI follows the trend already
taken by United States Supreme Court and supported overwhelmingly
by public opinion. Since California is such a trend-setting State,
the fate of CCRI in November may well determine the future of
equal protection rights in the nation as a whole. 
<P>
Those principles that animated the passage of the Civil Rights
Act are the principles that animated the American regime from
its very inception--in a very real sense, the Civil Rights
Act was a culmination of those principles. CCRI may well determine
whether those principles are to be perpetuated or whether the
country will continue to embrace the regime of racial quotas and
preferences that stands in opposition to the principle that &quot;all
men are created equal.&quot;<BR>

<SUP>16</SUP> An interesting debate has arisen recently in regard
to the uses of racial and ethnic categories by the Census Bureau.
One very hopeful sign for the future of race relations in this
country is the fact that the number of interracial and interethnic
marriages has been steadily increasing. This, of course, provokes
the question of how the children of mixed-race marriages are to
be categorized. Are children who are half black and half white
to be counted as black or white? Proponents of racial class entitlements
do not want to allow the Census Bureau to create &quot;mixed-race&quot;
categories because racial classes--and hence the racial demands
based on those classes--will be &quot;diluted.&quot; A recent
article in the New York Times (July 5, 1996) indicated that the
creation of multiracial categories was opposed by the National
Urban League, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza and the
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. As reported by Linda
Mathews, the objection of these groups &quot;is that the availability
of a multiracial category would reduce the number of Americans
claiming to belong to long-recognized racial minority groups,
dilute the electoral power of these groups and make it more difficult
to enforce the nation's civil rights laws. Dozens of federal programs
. . . depend on racial data from the census.&quot;

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in<BR> California Government Contracting</B></FONT></P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>

Government contracting is big business.  Federal, state, and local governments award contracts to businesses for everything from constructing buildings to purchasing paper clips.  The government says that a certain percentage of those contracts must go to businesses owned by minorites and women.  But when governments award contracts on the basis of arbitrary distinctions such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred.  Sometimes they are direct costs of preferential programs.  More often, they are indirect costs, caused by the arbitrary exclusion of bidders.  It is the purpose of this paper to examine the financial costs associated with these preferential policies as they specifically impact California government. <P>  

The estimates in this paper are very conservative for several reasons.  First, there are a number of bureaucracies and businesses (e.g., publicly-regulated private utilities) for which information on administrative costs is not readily available, and no attempt is made here to estimate these figures.  Second, qualitative and opportunity costs are incalculable, and no attempt is made to offer estimates in either of these categories. Third, the paper is confined solely to California state government expenditures, and does not account for similar costs incurred through cities, counties and special districts, or through expenditures affected by federal preference programs.  Nor does it discuss the private sector costs due to federal regulation of business practices.  The estimates are for Fiscal Year 1993-94, the most recent year for which complete numbers are available.
<P>

<B>Racial and Gender Preferences in California Government</B><P>

Racial and gender considerations now permeate virtually every aspect of California government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the funds appropriated for school children.  Just for state acquisition of goods and services, there are at least 45 specific laws for race or gender based preferences, including provisions in the Education, Government, Public Contract, Public Utilities, Streets and Highways, Unemployment Insurance, and Vehicle codes.<P>

For example, under the provisions of Government Code sections 19790-19799, adopted in 1977, all state agencies are required to "overcome any underutilization of minorities and women in their respective organizations," and are required to employ affirmative action officers and to submit annual reports toward compliance with these mandates.<P>

In 1988, the Legislature adopted and Governor Deukmejian signed the most far-reaching legislation affecting the awarding of state contracts (Chapter 61/1988).  In a paradoxical construction, the Legislature first declared that "The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition," and that "Only through full and free competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured."  As if to mock its premise, the act then proceeded to declare in essence that competition for 23 percent of the dollar amount of all state funded contracts should be limited to three arbitrary classes: 15 percent to "minority business enterprises" (MBE's), 5 percent to "women business enterprises" (WBE's), and 3 percent to "disabled veteran business enterprises" (DVBE's).  Although these standards are described as "goals," the act specifically disqualifies from bidding any business which has not gone to extraordinary lengths to attain the requisite race and gender participation percentages, regardless of cost.<SUP>1 </SUP>  Parallel provisions govern regulated utilities administered through the California Public Utilities Commission.  Even state bond counsels are subject to racial and gender preferences.<P>Nowhere are race and gender-based preferences as widespread as they are in the field of education.  For example, the Education Code (sections 87100-87107) requires college districts to hire faculty and staff that "reflect proportionately the adult population of the state," and establishes a "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" which in FY 1995-96 spent $2.745 million.<SUP>2 </SUP>  Extraordinary racial and gender based "outreach" programs are pursued by the universities, including separate "racial lists" for admission of college students.<SUP>3 </SUP><P>  Finally, one of the most expensive items in the state's race-based policies is the voluntary desegregation program, in which 45 school districts currently participate.  Although this is not a preference program <I>per se</I>, clearly it is entirely race-based in its application and is neither required by any court order nor justified by any finding of past patterns of racial discrimination.  According to the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), the program would be prohibited by the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would forbid the use of race and gender in the application of the law, and therefore is included within the scope of this paper.<P>

Overlaying all state requirements and programs is a similar web of federal requirements, affecting about 160 federal programs and nationally consuming an estimated $20 billion in direct costs and $96 billion in indirect costs from private and public sectors.<SUP>4 </SUP><P>
<B>The Costs of Race and Gender Preferences</B><P>
The costs of affirmative action can be divided into six general categories: 1) costs to government for administration, enforcement and implementation of race and gender preferences; 2) costs to government from above-market prices caused by reduced competition; 3) costs to government and private sectors for contract delays caused by challenges based on affirmative action requirements; 4) costs to government and private sectors for repairs and replacement due to reduced competition; 5) costs to government and private sectors for compliance with race and gender based requirements; 6) opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. <P>


<B>1. Direct Costs to Government for Administration and Enforcement</B><P>

In order to comply with the myriad of requirements for affirmative action, "a bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been established in virtually every department of California's state government."<SUP>5 </SUP>  The direct costs to the government for administration and enforcement of these regulations is considerable.<P>

In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson to his cabinet secretaries, state agencies estimated their administrative costs for MBE/WBE programs to be $12.763 million for FY 1993-94.<SUP>6 </SUP>  It should be noted that this survey included only those departments under the direct supervision of the governor's office, and did not include the entire education system, which alone accounts for more than half of the state's budget.  Furthermore, there is reason to believe the numbers have been very conservatively estimated.  For example, the State and Consumer Services Agency (SCS) reported to the governor administrative costs of just $2.008 million, yet just one office within SCS, which administers both small business set-asides and racial and gender preferences (the Office of Small and Minority Businesses, within the Department of General Services), spent $2.209 million that year.<SUP>7 </SUP>  Although the entire cost to the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency is estimated at $6.263 million for FY 1993-94, the Department of Transportation alone reported $6.884 million in affirmative action costs the following year.<SUP>8 </SUP><P>The "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" of the Community Colleges spent $2.924 million in FY 1993-94 for faculty and staff recruitment.  All race-based programs in the UC and California State University (CSU) systems were $47,174,000 in 1994/95, according to the LAO.<SUP>9 </SUP>  These figures may also be understated.  According to a study by John Attarian, an economist cited in <I>Forbes</I> magazine in 1993, 2.5 percent of the entire general budget of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is devoted to recruitment and retention of "protected classes."<SUP>10 </SUP>  Applied to the UC, CSU and California Community Colleges, this would amount to $274 million out of the combined $10 billion spent annually in these systems. <P>In 1993-94, California public schools spent $82 million on voluntary desegregation programs,<SUP>11 </SUP> and according to the LAO, public schools and community colleges spend an additional $10 million annually on categorical programs based on race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.<SUP>12 </SUP><P>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) spends $2.8 million annually to administer Public Utilities Code sections 8281-8286.<SUP>13 </SUP> Although this is not an exhaustive list, it is clear from immediately available state documents that the direct governmental costs of these programs amount to at least $155 million annually for the state of California:<P>

<B>2. Costs to Government Due to Above Market Prices</B><P>

State law requires all agencies awarding state-funded contracts to report the amount of those contracts to the Office of Small and Minority Business of the Department of General Services, and to report the amount which was awarded to minority business enterprises (MBE) and women business enterprises (WBE).  Of $2.9 billion in contracts reported in FY 1993-94, $463.171 million was awarded to MBE/WBE contractors, including $279.882 million to minority businesses (9.4 percent) and $183.289 million to women businesses (6.2 percent).  An additional $36.671 million (1.2 percent) was awarded to disabled veterans business enterprise (DVBE) businesses.<SUP>14 </SUP><P>  

A 1979 report for the National Construction Industry Council (NCIC) noted:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any law that assigns a portion of a market to a particular group, in essence, legalizes monopoly.  Setting aside 10 percent of a construction market for minority firms creates a monopoly for minorities.  It is a well-established law of economics that monopoly power leads to higher prices.<SUP>15 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Quoting from a General Accounting Office report of January 16, 1979, the NCIC observed that "The price quotes of minority firms averaged about 9 percent higher than normal prices."  If this formula is applied to California contracts under the MBE/WBE set-asides, it would account for $41.7 million in inflated contract costs.<SUP>16 </SUP><P> 

This figure is consistent with the experience of the Department of General Services (DGS).  According to figures provided by the Procurement Division of DGS, the difference "between the bid that met all other technical and administrative requirements (however, did not meet the M/WBE requirements) and the bid that met all requirements (including the M/WBE requirements)" amounted to $9.725 million in 1994.<SUP>17 </SUP>  The Procurement Division is responsible for about 20 percent of all state business.  Thus, the annual cost cited by DGS would amount to $48.625 million if the experience was consistent with the 80 percent of state contracting not awarded through DGS.<P>

The figures obtained from applying the NCIC findings to state construction work and from applying the DGS experience to all state contracts are also remarkably consistent with a study of costs prepared by the Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB) in June 1986.  This study was based on a survey of 472 prime contractors, majority subcontractors and MBE/WBE firms which responded to a total of 2,133 questionnaires, representing $1.95 billion of the $4.3 billion in public works construction in California in 1985.  Based upon the information compiled in this survey, the CIRB estimated $43 million in inflated costs due to special preference programs.  The sampling of inflated costs ranged up to 165 percent.<SUP>18 </SUP><P>

An example cited by DGS illustrates the lengths to which these provisions must be taken:<P> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>A solicitation for rolling ball pens was issued by the State without the M/WBE participation requirements.  In response to a request by a local supplier, the State amended the solicitation to include M/WBE requirements.  As in the past, numerous bids were received.  However, the eight lowest bids were all rejected.  Although all bidders had met the technical specifications (in fact, all bidders offered the same pen), the eight lowest bidders had not met M/WBE requirements.  Award was made to the ninth bidder, and cost the taxpayers about $50,000 more on a $200,000 contract.<SUP>19 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>  

It should be noted that all three of these surveys tend to underestimate the increased prices inherent in preference programs, because they all survey only the cost differential among bids which were actually made.  An important consideration which is far more difficult to quantify is the effect that preferences have on discouraging additional bids, which may be considerably lower than those submitted.  According to the CIRB study:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Nearly 61 percent of prime contractors reported that they avoided bidding an average of 6.8 contracts in 1985 because of SPP (special preference program) requirements.  If those contracts had been bid, the number of bids received by government agencies would have been 12.9 percent higher.… Additionally, nearly 46 percent of majority subcontractors reported that they avoided bidding SPP work an average of 26.4 times each in the prior year.  And nearly half of all majority subcontractors also reported that over the past three years they reduced the amount of public works construction that they choose to bid.  Nearly 43 percent, who have reduced their public works bidding, say that the reduction is substantial.  And 88 percent state they are doing more private work than they did before SPP.<SUP>20 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE> 


<B>3. The Cost of Delays</B><P>

Another component of the cost of the state's racial and gender preferences involves the MBE/WBE induced delays in awarding contracts.  An example cited by the DGS illustrates the problem:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the second rebid of a difficult and complex solicitation for aircraft, the state received three responsive bids.  The low bidder was selected for award. The highest cost bidder protested the award, claiming that neither of the lower bidders had made a good faith effort to meet M/W/DVBE goals.  Ultimately, the protest was denied.  However, by that time, the lowest bidder could no longer honor their price.  The State was finally able to award the contract to the second lowest bidder.<SUP>21 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

The CIRB study reported that 78 percent of the respondents to its survey "reported delays in contract awards for projects that have SPP percentage goals.  Those delays averaged 4.6 weeks."<SUP>22 </SUP>  Applying this figure to all MBE/WBE contacts would produce an average delay of 3.6 weeks for the $463 million of MBE/WBE contracts in 1993-94.  Based on 6 percent annual interest, the cost of these delays would be about $1.9 million.<P>	

DGS notes that before the adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements, "departments typically gave suppliers a two to four week period" for submitting bids.  The adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements more than doubled the period for bid preparation to between six and eight weeks.<SUP>23 </SUP>  This factor is by far more significant.  A four week delay over the preparation of all contracts would produce annual costs of $13.7 million.<P>


<B>4. Qualitative Costs</B><P>

A fourth cost component of racial and gender preferences is difficult to quantify: the cost of qualitative differences in the execution of state contracts due to the arbitrary exclusion of qualified bidders.<P>

In some cases, there would be no qualitative difference.  For example, in the case of the $200,000 pen acquisition, the pens were the same, only the cost was different.  Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith cited a 1994 letter from a constituent.  Says Goldsmith:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We have seen the creation of so-called pass through companies, i.e., a minority- or woman-owned firm that advertises as being a supplier for various items but doesn't actually stock the items.  Shelly Holland, owner of the Holland Company, a general engineering firm, writes: "We purchase steel from PDM Steel, but must offer the opportunity to bid to any MBE/WBE supplier.  In doing so, these firms will get a price from PDM Steel, add a percentage to the price, then give us the quote.  If we accept the price from PDM Steel, then we are not giving enough work to [MBEs/WBEs].  If we accept the inflated price from the MBEs/WBEs we may no longer be competitive."<SUP>24 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

According to the CIRB study, MBE/WBE subcontractors failed to perform in 11.5 percent of the contracts reported, compared to 1.8 percent of non-MBE/WBE subcontractors, a failure rate 6.4 times greater.  "When subcontractors fail to perform the work subcontracted for, the prime contractor may incur significant costs to complete the work.  One example of this was offered by a prime contractor who employs eight workers and who stated that his firm lost $30,000 to $40,000 in each of two prior years because '...MBE's went bankrupt, or we had to complete their jobs.'"<SUP>25 </SUP><P>


<B>5. Indirect Costs for Businesses</B><P>

The law is quite specific on the actions which a business must undertake in order to qualify to bid on state contracts.  First, the business must make contact with the "awarding department to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  According to testimony to the Little Hoover Commission, this is more difficult than it sounds.  The Department of General Services noted, "Different agencies have different requirements and do make different interpretations...it would be unrealistic to expect that the same answer would be given to identical callers in identical circumstances in every instance."<SUP>26 </SUP><P>  

Second, the business must make contact "with other state and federal agencies, and with local minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprise organizations to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  All of these actions must be documented.  Third, the business must publish advertising "in trade papers and papers focusing on minority, women, and disabled, veteran business enterprises."  These costs are, of course, entirely shouldered by the business, and passed on as higher prices.  Fourth, invitations to bid must be submitted to these preferred contractors, and, fifth, subcontracting must be done even when the contractor can perform the same services more cheaply in-house.<P>

For example, Pacific Gas and Electric reported that it spent $2.2 million in 1991 to comply with California Public Utilities Commission MBE/WBE requirements.<SUP>27 </SUP>  According to the Little Hoover Commission:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is difficult to pin down the added private industry costs.  If one vendor's estimate of $1,000 were used and three bidders were presumed to compete on each of 80,000 state procurements, the cost would be $240 million.  But MBE/WBE/ DVBE requirements are not included on all contracts, and a substantial number of contracts have only a single bidder while others have far more than three.<SUP>28 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1986, CIRB estimated total costs to business for construction contracts to be $13.1 million.  Its estimate was based on average bidding costs 13.1 percent higher on MBE/WBE construction contracts with total billing amounting to 0.8 percent of the contract cost, and an average of 5.7 bidders per contract.<SUP>29 </SUP>  CIRB estimates this accounts for about ten percent of all contracts.  If the experience were consistent across all state contracts, this would amount to $130 million in compliance costs for firms doing business with the state.<P>


<B>6. Opportunity Costs</B><P>

Finally, there is an incalculable opportunity cost to society which we cannot begin to fathom in the confines of this paper, but simply must note in passing.  For example, racially discriminatory admissions practices within the University of California have been extensively documented.<SUP>30 </SUP>  When a more qualified applicant is arbitrarily denied admission to a university in favor of a less qualified one, how much economic damage is done to society?  Arbitrary preferences in all fields clearly inhibit the application of resources for their highest and best potential use.  It is impossible to begin to quantify this effect, but it conceivably dwarfs the other costs of preferential policies discussed in this paper.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The costs to support the race and gender preferences in current law are impossible to fully assess, and it should be stressed that figures presented in this paper offer only a partial glimpse.  However, combining the estimates which have been made by the Department of General Services, the Legislative Analyst's Office, the Little Hoover Commission, industry studies and the Administration, it is clear that these programs easily exceed $343 million annually in administrative costs to government, compliance costs to business, and inflated prices paid by taxpayers because of the constriction of competition for the provision of governmental goods and services. Specifically, the state spends at least $156 million on direct costs for these programs, between $42 million and $49 million for inflated prices in contracting, $15 million in project delays, and anywhere from $130 million to possibly as much at $240 million in compliance costs to businesses.<P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Michael Lynch*</B></P>


<B>Background</B><P>

The last year has been tumultuous for the University of California.  In July 1995, after a nearly year-long review and much public debate, the University of California Board of Regents adopted a resolution designed to end race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting decisions.  The Regents' intention is clear: administrators are to design and implement a completely colorblind admission process for the entering class of Fall 1997.<SUP>1</SUP>  To the casual observer, this appears to be no major task.  Simply removing the ethnic-check boxes from admission applications--a section which, according to wording on the application itself, is for "statistical purposes only"--would go a long way to ensuring a colorblind admission process.  If the schools still wanted to know their racial and ethnic composition, they could avail themselves of modern statistical sampling techniques to determine the ethnic and racial composition <I>after</I> the admission decisions had been made. <P>

This reform, however, is too simple, too honest, and too effective for the system's administrators, all of whom opposed the Regents' decision.  Footdragging and controversy quickly ensued.  Newly-appointed UC President Richard Atkinson maintained that the Regents' decision didn't affect the entering class of Fall 1997, but rather the entering class of Fall 1998. After much handwringing and a reassertion of authority by the Regents, a compromise was struck.  Race supposedly will not be a factor in admission to UC by Spring 1998, well after the Regents' original date but earlier than Atkinson's initial interpretation of the policy.  At the same time this controversy was bubbling, a group of activist professors asserted that the Regents' decision upset the proper balance of power in the university system and that the faculty were united in opposition to the ban on preferences.  Major state news outlets reported both of these stories, rarely questioning their veracity.  But a scientific poll of the UC faculty, conducted by the independent Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, found the faculty split on, if not in favor of, the Regents' policy.<SUP>2</SUP>  As for the usurpation of the faculty's power, setting policy is the purview of the Regents, the UC's governing board.  After all, when the University of California is sued for discrimination, the suit names the Regents, not professors. <P>

As the dust settles, school administrators have until Spring 1998 to come up with an admission system that neither grants privileges nor discriminates on the basis of race and ethnicity.<SUP>3</SUP>  If the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which would amend the state constitution to prohibit race-based preferences in the public sector, passes in November 1996, the UC will not only be prohibited from discriminating by the Regents but also by the state constitution. <P>

The current climate, then, has Californians paying close attention to a recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision, <I>Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, in which the court ruled that race could not be a factor in admissions,<SUP>4</SUP> and to the findings of a report by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the University of California at Berkeley's (UCB) admission process.  On the one hand, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision is a legal affirmation of the Regents' decision.  On the other, the OCR's  report asserts that the existing admission policy at UCB in 1993, a close version of which is still used, did not lower academic standards or discriminate against whites or Asians. This confusion raises the question: What is really going on and what lies ahead for the University of California? <P>


<B>Conflicting Decisions or Differing Premises?</B><P>

On March 18, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rocked the country's higher educational establishment.  In its <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the court ruled that the University of Texas law school was guilty of discrimination for maintaining different admission standards for applicants of different races and ethnicities.  More important, the court called into question the justification for such discrimination set forth in the famous decision in <I>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</I> (438 U.S. 1978), which has been the governing doctrine of race-based preferences in admission to higher education since 1978.  Justice Powell's opinion in <I>Bakke</I>, in which the court struck down explicit set-asides for minority students at the University of California at Davis Medical School, allowed for schools to use race as a factor in admissions in order for schools to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity as long as it was just one of many factors considered. <P>

Although the <I>Hopwood</I> decision has been decried by proponents of racial preferences as "profoundly radical in its contempt for the precedent set by the historic <I>Bakke</I> decision,"<SUP>5</SUP> it is far more evolutionary than revolutionary.  In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I><SUP>6</SUP> that programs that take race into account must pass the "strict scrutiny" test.  Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized that the Constitution protects "persons, not groups" and that government classification based on race is a "group classification."<SUP>7</SUP>  Quoting from the 1943 <I>Hirabayashi</I><SUP>8</SUP> decision four times, "Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," O'Connor emphasized that all racial classifications by government must be scrutinized to ensure that personal rights, which the Constitution does protect, are not violated.<SUP>9</SUP>  In addition to <I>Adarand</I>, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated a scholarship program reserved only for African Americans at the University of Maryland.<SUP>10</SUP>  Far from revolutionary, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision fits squarely in the vein of these two recent decisions. <P>

In <I>Hopwood</I>, the court ruled: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this issue.  While he announced the judgment, no other Justice joined in that part of the opinion discussing the diversity rationale.  In Bakke, the word "diversity" is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion.<SUP>11</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Stating that recent Supreme Court opinions "show that the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny," the Court went on to declare that "within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection."<SUP>12</SUP>  Two out of the three judges ruled that race can never be used as a factor in admissions because race is not a reliable proxy for either intellectual or ideological diversity.  In this ruling, the court laid bare a festering problem in Justice Powell's opinion.  Although Powell declared that race could be used to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity, he never explained why race was, in and of itself, a useful proxy for these types of diversity.<SUP>13</SUP>  Powell's opinion seems to embrace the very thinking on race--that certain traits can be ascribed to individuals based on their group membership--that the original civil rights movement sought to dispel.  After all, the argument that individuals should be judged based "on the content of their character," is not a plea for racial categorization.<SUP>14</SUP><P>

Three days following the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights released the suspiciously well-timed findings of its seven-year investigation into the admission practices at UC Berkeley (UCB).  Just as the University was preparing to send out acceptance and rejection letters to anxious applicants, the OCR reported in a fifteen page letter that "1) UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black, Hispanic, and Filipino applicants to the freshman class in the College of L&S [Letters and Sciences], and 2) neither the University of California (UC) system nor UCB illegally discriminates against minority students by segregating them away from other UC campuses to UCB."<SUP>15</SUP><P>

If California's education establishment was driven to cold sweats by the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, they were ecstatic about the long-awaited OCR decision.  <I>The Los Angeles Times'</I> front page headline declared, "Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality, U.S. agency says."  UC Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of the school's admission system, told <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> that the OCR's finding was "an historical vindication of one of the strongest and most scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country."<SUP>16</SUP>  This investigation's findings were also declared to be "a striking counterpoint to a federal appeals court ruling Tuesday in a Texas case [<I>Hopwood</I>], knocking down the use of affirmative action in a state college or university."<SUP>17</SUP><P>

The OCR's findings were not, however, a rebuke to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision.  Two points must be made clear.  First, the <I>Hopwood</I> case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and thus is not binding on California's universities, which are governed by the Ninth Circuit.  Second, the OCR's findings in no way contradict the <I>Hopwood</I> decision because the report is premised on Justice Lewis Powell's <I>Bakke</I> opinion, which the <I>Hopwood</I> decision rejects.  If the OCR had investigated under the <I>Hopwood</I> standard, it would have been forced to find the University guilty of discrimination. <P>

Californians should thus not conclude from the media reports on the OCR's investigation that race is not a critically important factor in undergraduate admission to UCB.  Nor should they conclude that members of all ethnicities are held to the same undergraduate admission standards.  The OCR's own Letter of Finding (LOF)<SUP>18</SUP> debunks this notion.  What the OCR did find is that "the undergraduate admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI."<SUP>19</SUP><P>

Although the OCR took nearly seven years to reach its decision and, according to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I>, based its decision "on reams of documents provided by university officials,"<SUP>20</SUP> the LOF contains surprisingly little data.  The author has put in a federal Freedom of Information Act request with the OCR for the data on which it based its decision, and has also put in a California Public Records Act request at UCB for further admission data.  When these data become available, a fuller analysis of the admission system and its consequences will follow.  This analysis is based on the information contained in the OCR's LOF, the original complaint that prompted the investigation, and other information, cited when used, already in the public domain. <P>


<B>The University of California's Dilemma</B><P>

The University of California has a problem.  Its mission, as outlined in the University of California's Master Plan, is to educate those students performing academically in the top 12.5 percent of California's graduating high school class.  It has also been charged with ensuring diversity by two Assembly Concurrent Resolutions (ACR 151 in 1974 and ACR 83 in 1984).<SUP>21</SUP>  In 1988, the UC Regents further adopted a policy on undergraduate admissions which stated, in part, that beyond its more narrow mission, the university "seeks to enroll, on each of its campuses, a student body that, beyond meeting the University's eligibility requirements, demonstrates high academic achievement or exceptional personal talent, and that encompasses the broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic, and socio-economic background characteristic of California."<SUP>22</SUP>  Administrators interpreted this policy to mean that entering classes should approximately reflect the ethnic proportions of the graduating high school class.<SUP>23</SUP><P>

As reported in an earlier study,<SUP>24</SUP> all of UC's affirmative action headaches stem from the same source: high school graduates from various ethnic groups do not qualify for the system in equal proportions.  The University's primary mandate is to provide an education for the top 12.5 percent, or one in eight, of California's graduating high-school seniors.  This means that any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate of less than 12.5 percent will be underrepresented in the system as a whole if standards are not lowered for that group.  Likewise, any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate exceeding 12.5 percent will be over-represented3/4unless members of that group are discriminated <I>against</I> in the admission process or a great number choose, for some reason, not to attend the University of California. <P>

Table I shows the ethnic breakdown of 1990, 1993 and 1994 high school graduates and the UC eligibility rates for 1990, the last year for which published data are available.  There are huge disparities in eligibility rates across ethnic groups.  While four in 10 Asian graduates from California's high schools were UC eligible, this proportion was one in five for whites, and less than one in ten for African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino). <P>

As illustrated in Figures I through IV, these varying rates produce a qualified applicant pool with an ethnic composition that differs radically from that of the graduating high-school seniors.  While Asians constituted only 14 percent of the graduating high-school seniors in 1990, they accounted for 30 percent of those eligible for the University of California.  Whites accounted for 55 percent of high school graduates and 59 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), however, while constituting approximately 7 and 23 percent of the high school graduates respectively, accounted for only 3 and 8 percent of those eligible for the University of California.<P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5212a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures I and II" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=441 WIDTH=385>
By 1993, the year for which the OCR investigated, things had not changed much.  As illustrated in Figures II and IV, Asians, which constituted just 15 percent of California's high school graduates accounted for 32 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Whites were 48 percent of high school graduates and 54 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), while 29 percent of high school graduates made up only 11 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  The respective percentages for African Americans were 7 percent and 3 percent.  It must be noted that these figures only provide an approximation because the eligibility rates are calculated based on 1990 data, the last year for which they are available.  Also, the pool doesn't include American Indians due to a small sample size which precluded a statistically significant result.<P>


What is true for the system as a whole is also true for each institution.  The most competitive schools, UCB and UCLA, can approximate proportionality for targeted minorities who, like Asians and whites, prefer these schools over other UC campuses.  But they can only do so by applying different academic standards to applicants based on their race. <P>

This has the twin effects of producing radically varying GPA and SAT averages in the entering class among the different ethnic groups<SUP>25</SUP> and concentrating targeted minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Chicanos and Latinos) at UCLA and UCB.  Indeed, the original complaint that prompted the OCR investigation noted that in 1988 UCB and UCLA "accounted for 35 percent of all students in the UC system, but they also enroll a much larger 51 percent of minorities."<SUP>26</SUP><P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5234a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures III and IIII" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=365 WIDTH=361>

By 1994 these disparities had lessened, but nevertheless remained.  Thirty-six percent of all undergraduates but 43 percent of targeted minorities enrolled in the UC system attended these two schools in that same year.  By contrast, 33 percent of all UC undergraduates admitted in 1994 attended these two schools, but only 21 percent of white students.<SUP>27</SUP>  As illustrated in Figures IV and V, the only group significantly underrepresented in UCB 1993 admissions in comparison to the potentially eligible applicant pool is whites, who account for 54 percent of the eligibility pool but only 32 percent of the students accepted.  Similarly, the only two groups underrepresented in UCB 1993 acceptances in comparison to the California graduating high school seniors (Figures II & V) are whites and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino).  While Hispanic under-representation is due to this group's low eligibility rate, this explanation is not available for whites. <P>




As discussed in detail in an earlier paper,<SUP>28</SUP> California taxpayers generously support a comprehensive system of higher education.  From the broad base of the open enrollment community colleges to the California State University system to the top tier of the University of California system, no Californian is denied a highly subsidized education.  Although advocates of racial preferences in admission would have the public believe that if UCB and UCLA did not admit a high proportion of minority applicants these applicants would be denied an education, this is false. <P>

<B>The Complaint that Started it All</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"There is wide agreement that if whites have higher admission rates and lower test scores than Asians, it is evidence of discrimination against Asians.  But if this applies to black students relative to white students, it is called affirmative action, even though it is exactly the same procedure."</I>
					<P ALIGN=right>--Arthur Hu, <I>Original Complaint</I><SUP>29</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1989, Arthur Hu, a software programmer in Seattle, columnist for <I>Asian Week</I>, and inveterate data collector, filed an official complaint with the U.S. Department of Education charging discrimination against Asians in admissions to Harvard University.  He claimed also that UCB and UCLA maintained quotas and differential admissions standards at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles which discriminate not only against Asians, but against all racial groups."<SUP>30</SUP><P> 

In brief, Hu's complaint accused the UC system, primarily through UCLA and UCB, of maintaining quotas for minority group admissions based on representation among the state's high-school graduates. In the wake of the ACR No. 83 in 1984, which the UC interpreted to mean that it must strive for racial proportionality, the number of minority admits increased dramatically while that of whites fell, especially at the more competitive schools.  Hu based his complaint on this evidence.  Hu wrote: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>UC claims that it uses goals, but not quotas to admit minorities according to state proportions.  In 1988, UC has actually admitted all minorities in equal to, or even greater than graduate proportions.  Since this is caused by affirmative action, and is not based on qualifications, but on numerical goals, this policy is a fourth illegal quota in fact, if not in name.<SUP>31</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hu pointed out that by concentrating minority students at UCB and UCLA, the UC system "discriminates against whites and Asians who apply to these campuses."<SUP>32</SUP>  He claimed that the policy "also discriminates against minorities in other campuses such as UC Santa Cruz because it makes them [the campuses] primarily white and Asian."<SUP>33</SUP>  This is a direct consequence of the high acceptance rates at UCB and UCLA.  An attendant claim by Hu was that the UC was "mismatching abilities by putting the weakest students in the toughest schools" and thereby reducing these groups respective graduation rates by admitting African American and Filipino students with considerably lower grades and SAT scores than other students. <P>


<B>Enter the Feds: The OCR's Findings</B><P>

The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is charged with ensuring that colleges and universities that take federal money do not discriminate.  It carries out this mission primarily by enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It determined, in this investigation, that the relevant implementing regulations reside at 34 C.F.R. &#167 &#167 100.3(a), (b)(1)(v), and (b)(6)(ii).  The first section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states "that no person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies."<SUP>34</SUP>  The second section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "a recipient [of federal money] may not directly or through contractual arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program."<SUP>35</SUP>  Complicating, if not contradicting, these first two seeming prohibitions against classification and differential treatment based on race, the third section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "that even in the absence of a prior finding that a recipient has discriminated in the past, a recipient, in administering a program, may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin."<SUP>36</SUP><P>

These were the standards against which the legality of UCB's admission policy was judged. The first two prohibit treating people differently depending on their race and ethnicity while the third states that a university "may take affirmative action."  If these sections are to be internally consistent, then racial preferences, such as those we shall see are used by UCB, cannot be considered "affirmative action." That is, affirmative action programs are proscribed from using racial preferences.  They can, however, concentrate on recruitment.  The OCR didn't interpret these regulations in this manner.  For the OCR, even though its report didn't explicitly recognize this fact, there is a contradiction between the first two prohibitions against discriminating based on race and the third which states, in OCR's interpretation, that preferences can be granted on the basis of race.  In this light, the OCR sacrifices the first two standards on the altar of the third.

In a letter dated March 1, 1996, nearly seven years after the original complaint was filed, the OCR released it findings.  Among other things mentioned, the OCR found "The program employed not quotas or set-asides, and all students, regardless of race or national origin, competed with all other students."<SUP>37</SUP>  Furthermore, any problem associated with not being admitted to UCB was mitigated by the fact that applicants were free to apply again, were offered admission at a later date, or, if UC eligible, guaranteed a spot at a less competitive UC school. The LOF found: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any impact of the affirmative action component on students who were not admitted to UCB was substantially diminished by the fact that all UC-eligible students must be admitted by the System to one of the UC campuses, and many students achieved admission to UCB subsequent to an initial denial of admission.<SUP>38</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

To arrive at its conclusion of non-discrimination, the OCR's investigation focused on the 1993 admissions process.  In 1992, UCB switched to a matrix admission process that it states was "quite different" from the old system.  We shall examine the matrix process, but it should be noted that the OCR did not release a Letter of Finding directly related to Hu's charges, which were obviously filed under an older admission process.  In a similarly misleading vein, if the OCR investigated and found a discriminatory process but UCB was willing to alter its policies to mitigate this discrimination, the OCR wouldn't necessarily disclose that it had deemed the former policy discriminatory.<SUP>39</SUP>  As a result, one should be suspicious of the OCR's complete neglect of UCB's admissions policies prior to 1993, which were, after all, the policies that prompted the complaint.  As Arthur Hu recently wrote in <I>Asian Week</I>, it is as if the police investigated "O.J. Simpson by checking on whether he killed anybody in the next year."<SUP>40</SUP>  Even so, there is plenty in the 1993 matrix standards to make one wonder how the OCR concluded that UCB does not "on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfied any admission, enrollment, . . . requirement."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

<B>Brief Overview of Admissions Policy</B><P>

In 1993, UC policy mandated that no less than 40 percent and no more than 60 percent of the first year entering class be selected on academic criteria alone, which include required course-work, GPA, and SAT scores.<SUP>42</SUP>  The remaining students were to be selected on the basis of supplemental factors.  According to the OCR, these factors included: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1) special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts; 2) special circumstances adversely affecting applicant's life experiences, including personal difficulties, low family income, refugee status, or veteran status; and 3) ethnic identity, gender, and location or residence.<SUP>43</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Notice that, as is nearly almost always the case when supplemental, non-academic factors are delineated, race and ethnicity are placed at the end of the list.  As we shall soon see, this is a deliberate inversion of the order of importance. <P>

In addition to those who meet the UC Eligibility criteria, the UC maintains the right to admit up to 6 percent of the entering class by "exception."  According to the LOF, "This policy is designed for the purpose of admitting students who have not met the eligibility requirements who are either athletes, have special talents, are disadvantaged (i.e. from minority and/or low income or low education backgrounds), have demonstrated exceptional ability in certain areas, or have shown marked improvement in academic performance."<SUP>44</SUP>  Notice that middle class and wealthy minorities can be considered disadvantaged simply on the basis of their ethnicity and race. <P>

Through this admissions process, UCB seeks to ensure diversity in its incoming class.  In 1988, the Academic Senate and the Admissions and Enrollment (A&E) Committee adopted the recommendations from a report entitled "Freshman Admissions at Berkeley: A Policy for the 1990s and Beyond" which is known as the Karabel report, after the aforementioned sociologist Jerome Karabel.  The Karabel report recommended flexible targets for admissions based on the following characteristics (notice the order): "low socio-economic status (SES), athletic ability, age, disability, re-entry students, students from rural and non-traditional high schools, and ethnicity and underrepresented minority status."<SUP>45</SUP>  These targets were soon adopted.  Here's how these goals manifested themselves in the admission process. <P>

<B>1993 Matrix</B><BR>
Below is the 1993 admissions matrix for UC Berkeley. <P>

<P><IMG SRC="/gsp/gsp526a.jpg" ALT="Figure VI" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=272 WIDTH=593></P>

The Social Diversity Score (SDS) categories are as follows: <B>SDS A:</B> 1)  California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano AND low socio-economic status (SES)<SUP>46</SUP> or disabled; 2) California residents who are low SES and disabled; 3) California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age). <B>SDS B:</B> 1) California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled. <B>SDS C:</B> 1) California residents who are Latino; 2) Non-resident American Indian, African American or Chicano applicants.<SUP>47</SUP> <B>SDS D:</B> Very low SES.<SUP>48</SUP> <B>SDS E:</B> Rural and Other High School <B>SDS F:</B> Non-resident Latinos;<SUP>49</SUP> 2) Other Low SES. <B>SDS G:</B> California Residents <B>SDS H:</B> Domestic Non-residents. <B>SDS I:</B> Foreign Applicants. <P>

Under this matrix, an applicant is placed in a box depending on two variables: 1) an Academic Index Score (AIS) and 2) his or her social diversity category.  The AIS is determined by multiplying an applicant's GPA, capped at 4.0, by 1,000, and adding to this the combined total of the SAT scores and three required Achievement Test scores.<SUP>50</SUP> The socio-economic categories, which are on the vertical axis, are determined by an applicant's birth.  The LOF states that the AIS scores for the first box are 7160 to 8000 (8000 is a perfect score), but didn't disclose the other cut-off scores. The Social Diversity Scores, which are under the matrix, are quoted directly from the LOF<SUP>51</SUP><P>

In 1993, applicants placed in this matrix were admitted in the following manner.  All those in AIS 1, regardless of SDS, were admitted.  This accounted for roughly 50 percent of the acceptances.  This groups satisfies the requirement that 40 percent to 60 percent of the students be admitted on academic qualifications alone. <P>

A second group comprising SDS A through SDS F and AIS cells 2 through 5 were also automatically admitted.  Those admitted in this group, in which race and ethnicity play a major role, accounted for 17 percent of the total acceptances.  Explaining these acceptances, for which race was an important factor, the "OCR determined that while race/ethnicity was one factor in defining this group, placement in this group was not based exclusively on race or ethnicity."<SUP>52</SUP><P>

A third group in cell SDS G and AIS 2 was also automatically accepted, accounting for 9 percent of total acceptances.  Another 21 percent of the acceptances came from cells SDS A through SDS F and AIS 3 through AIS 7.  These acceptances were granted after each file was reviewed and the essays read by two review teams.  The Karabel diversity goals were taken into consideration in accepting this group.<SUP>53</SUP>  In addition, three percent of total acceptances were granted on the basis of "special admission."  The LOF didn't disclose the racial composition of this or any other admission group. <P>

There are many things about this process that indicate that while race may be a factor among many, it is the most important factor.  While all applicants are put through the same process, they are not all judged by the same standards while in that process.  First, note that to be simply a California taxpayer who is white or Asian is to be in the seventh-lowest SDS ranking, above only out-of-state whites and Asians and non-minority foreign applicants.  In fact, any African American, Chicano, or Latino from anywhere in the United States will be automatically admitted with lower academic qualifications.  For example, non-resident American Indians, African Americans or Chicano applicants, regardless of whether they are wealthy, middle class or poor, were automatically admitted in two AIS categories (C2-C4) in which non-poor whites were automatically rejected, without even having their file reviewed.  Out-of-state minorities, regardless of socioeconomic status, were also automatically admitted in one AIS category (C4) in which "Very Low SES"<SUP>54</SUP> in-state whites and Asians merely get their application read.  It is surely strange for a state university which draws more than $8,000 from the General Fund per student<SUP>55</SUP> to grant a privilege to wealthy out-of-state applicants over poor and middle class California taxpayers solely on the basis of race. <P>

Take a close look at SDS A and SDS B.  Why are they separate categories?  Automatic admissions for both categories extends to AIS 5 and applicants in both categories have their applications closely examined in as low an AIS category as 7.  There is no difference between these two categories except, perhaps, their public relations utility.  If these two categories were properly combined (as in practice they are simply one category for the purpose of the matrix), it would be obvious that all California residents who are American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos are automatically granted admission--again, regardless of socioeconomic status--without even a review of their file, at radically lower academic standards than whites and Asians.  The proper SDS A category would then read, "1 ) California residents who are American Indian, African American, or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled; 3) California residents who are low SES and disabled; and California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age.)  SDS B would disappear and each other category would simply move up the matrix while retaining the same structure.  This would dispel the carefully crafted notion that in order to be considered in highest disadvantaged status, American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos must not only be California residents, but must also be poor or disabled. <P>

This would also complicate the OCR's statement, in support of its finding of non-discrimination that "the criteria for placement on the matrix grid were not based exclusively on race or ethnicity nor was race or ethnicity the exclusive criterion for any group in the selection process."<SUP>56</SUP>  While this statement would still be true, since a second factor, California residency, is still needed, it would be apparent that all minorities are afforded great preferences in admissions.  Two factors place applicants in the most privileged group: race and residency status.  But as we have seen, even residency status is not necessary for applicants of favored groups to receive preferences over poor California residents who belong to the wrong ethnic and racial group. <P>

Two other points.  First, notice that based on the matrix, a computer automatically admitted in 1993 nearly three in four admittees.  For all the talk of personal reviews of files, only one in four addmittees was admitted after having his file reviewed.  Unless an applicant is somehow considered disadvantaged, the chance of him even having his file read appears remote.  For a white or Asian student who excels in the supposed subjective criteria--"special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts"--it is not clear how the University avails itself of this information.  Non-poor whites and Asians are automatically rejected if not in AIS 1 or 2.  Thus, their chances of being accepted based on non-academic qualifications appear remote.  This failure to review the files of non-minority applicants helps explain the recently exposed "back-door admissions policy" for the wealthy and well connected.  It appears that a non-minority applicant who was a class president, volunteered at a homeless shelter, spent her spring break in Mexico building houses for poor peasants, and was fluent in three languages but was just shy of the GPA and SAT score needed for the first two AIS categories, would be automatically rejected without a file review.  It is reasonable for parents to wonder why some of their childrens' peers with both lower academic credentials and fewer extra-curricular activities were granted admission and to inquire through whatever channels available.  In many cases, such a review would not be a further review, but rather the first review--a review, one might add, that each minority applicant is entitled to simply on the basis of his race.  While this helps explains the backdoor policy, it does not condone it.  After all, such a policy does little to help the majority of taxpaying Californians who are bereft of connections but support UCB with their taxes nevertheless. <P>

Second, without hard data on the academic parameters for the various categories, (automatic admission on AIS alone, automatic admission on AIS and SDS, admission based on extensive review of file, and special admissions), the exact magnitude of the differing standards cannot be evaluated.  Similarly, although the two-step intensive review process as described in the LOF seems race and ethnic neutral, there are points in this selection process in which race bias could play a significant role.  Until hard data on the composition of the pool and the composition of the acceptances from this pool are provided from the OCR, the reader should not conclude that race and ethnicity do not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission in this category.  As always, the devil is in the details.  In this case, the details are the data, which have yet to be released by the OCR. <P>


<B>OCR's Incredible Conclusion</B><P>

After review of the process and still undisclosed data, the OCR concluded that UCB does not discriminate based on race.<SUP>57</SUP>  It stopped short, however, of saying that all applicants were judged by the same standards regardless of race, which would, of course, be untrue. <P>

This is the central issue in which most Californians are interested.  The OCR concluded that "the process ensured that no applicant was considered or excluded from consideration for selection solely on the basis of race or national origin."  This simply means that UCB put all of the applicants on the same grid before it gave enormous preferences depending on racial and ethnic classification.  The OCR dismissed Hu's complaint that by concentrating minorities at two schools it was denying diversity to other schools by pointing out that it is the individual schools and applicants who make the decisions. <P>

Hu's complaint of "academic mismatching" causing low graduation rates for targeted minorities admitted by lower standards was also dismissed by the OCR, which stated "UCB provided additional data which showed the current six-year graduation rates for African American students at UCB is 62 percent compared to a national average [for African American students] of 37 percent."<SUP>58</SUP>  This, of course, neglected the fact that the proper base for comparison is not against an amorphous national average, over which the University has no control, but against the ethnic groups it holds to higher admission standards.  The six year graduation rates for the entering class of 1988 showed very different rates depending on race, with Whites and Asians graduating at rates over 80 percent and Chicano/Latinos, American Indians, and African Americans, who we have seen are admitted by lower standards, all in the neighborhood of 60 percent.<SUP>59</SUP>  UCB's six-year graduation rate, independent of race, for all regularly admitted students in Fall 1987 was 81 percent.  For those admitted by exception, the graduation rate was 48 percent.<SUP>60</SUP>  In fact, the differing graduation rates for different groups probably do not reflect racism or differences in academic abilities inherent in race, but simply the different standards at which students are admitted.  This hypothesis, which asserts that if Asians were admitted to UCB with the same academic qualifications as other targeted minorities, they would fail to graduate at similar rates, can only be tested with further data.  At any rate, the OCR didn't investigate this issue in its LOF. <P>

Finally the OCR determined that UCB's racially determined admission matrix "did not impose an undue burden on non-beneficiaries."  It came to this conclusion because "by state law, all UC-eligible students must receive admission to a UC campus."  It continued, "Thus, no student would experience exclusion from the opportunity to receive a University of California education."<SUP>61</SUP>  This "UC Riverside is just as good as UCB" logic should apply to targeted minorities as well.  As it stands, though, UC eligible targeted minorities seem to have a presumptive right to attend the system's most prestigious schools to ensure that these schools exhibit the right color scheme.  At the same time, it is acceptable for the system's other schools to be filled with Asians and whites.  It is never explained why UC Santa Cruz equals UCB for whites and Asians, but not for preferred minorities.  Or why, for example, deferred admission to UCB is considered the equivalent of a direct admission for California's taxpayers who are white and Asian, when this same standard apparently isn't applied to targeted minorities, some of whom are no doubt wealthy and from out-of-state. <P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The OCR's finding of non-discrimination was welcomed by proponents of racial preferences in university admissions as both a counterpoint to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision and conclusive proof that UCB's admission process does not discriminate based on race.  In reality, it was neither.  The <I>Hopwood</I> criteria, if applied to UCB, would no doubt find the school's admission process unconstitutional.  It was the OCR, an administrative bureaucracy of the federal government's Department of Education, which declared under its interpretation of both Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Justice Powell's opinion in the Supreme Court's 1978 <I>Bakke</I> decision, that UCB's admission process was "lawful."  Indeed, as shown above, this means neither that the process was race neutral nor that race did not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission.  It merely meant that, <I>in the interpretation of the OCR</I>, race was only one factor.  Just how large a factor race is, as determined by the objective results the process produces, cannot be determined until the OCR discloses the data it used to form its conclusion.  Until that time, California residents can be assured that race-based admissions are alive and well at UCB. <P>

<SUP>14</SUP>	This leap in logic, that race equals ideological diversity, has led university administrators to strain their muscles patting themselves on the back for their success in ensuring diversity at the same time America's universities have become, ideologically speaking, some of the most homogeneous institutions in society under the scourge of political correctness.  The problem is that neither Powell, nor anyone else, has ever properly defined diversity or its relationship to certain "preferred" races and ethnicities.  That this is the case, one only need consider the fact that a Hispanic or African American who may never have left the 90210 zip code in his life is automatically considered "diverse" at the University of California while neither a person fleeing impending communism in Hong Kong nor a Russian Jew are seen as contributing to diversity.  Diversity has always been and continues to remain an ill-defined, amorphous concept. <BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>

Over the past year, California's public policy makers have expressed increasing optimism over the health of California's economy, the solvency of her finances, and the prospects for continued expansion.  Certainly there is cause for such optimism.  Tax reductions and workers compensation reform have begun to repair the damage done by the record-breaking tax increases of 1991; the job losses of the recession have been regained, personal income is rising, state revenues are building, the state's deficit spending is easing, and a volume of pro-growth measures have been proposed by the Wilson administration, including a 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income taxes. <P> 

A broad range of policy initiatives are now being predicated on these projections, including $5 billion of new general obligation bonds approved by voters on March 26, and the proposed 1996-97 state budget.  These initiatives are based not only upon ebullient optimism over the state's economic prospects, but also upon the conventional wisdom that the state government's services have deteriorated over the past decade because spending limitations and tax reductions have constricted revenues.  The ultimate conclusion is that California's brightening fiscal condition enables higher spending, while her need for infrastructure improvement demands it. <P>

Two cautionary notes should be sounded in discussions of the state's economy.  First, California's economy, though greatly improved from the early 90's, still shows several weaknesses which ought to be considered by policy makers.  Second, California's fiscal condition, though meliorating, is still precarious.  Furthermore, California's past experience challenges the assumption that her infrastructure crisis is due to inadequate revenues.  The optimism exuded by the state's policy makers should be tempered by the fact that Californians' behavior is contrary to what one would expect in an economy which is rapidly improving.  Real estate prices are again falling, retail sales are still sluggish, and the net outmigration which accompanied the 1990-94 recession is continuing, as suggested by outbound, one-way household relocations reported by major van lines and rental truck companies. <P>

The budget deficits which reached historic proportions in the early 1990's, and which have caused California's bond ratings to plunge, are still a serious threat to the state's long-term[B1] solvency.  Book keeping gimmicks have distorted the true picture of the state's finances, and both short-term and long-term debt is dramatic.  General Obligation bonded indebtedness has doubled between 1990 and 1994, while lease-purchase debt has tripled in the same period.  The percentage of general fund spending required to service this debt doubled between 1990 and 1994, and tripled between 1990 and 1996. <P>

Finally, although significant policy changes have been adopted in the form of both tax reductions and workers compensation reform, the tax, regulatory and litigatory policies of the state are generally unchanged from the conditions which undermined the state's economic condition in the early 1990's.  Although defense cutbacks are generally cited as the predominant factor in the state's deterioration, other states whose economies were much more dependent on defense spending performed significantly better than did California. <P>

Whether the deterioration of state services is due to revenue constraints is also questionable.  Inflation-adjusted per capita general fund spending is 65 percent more than it was in 1966, while infrastructure has declined conspicuously.  This suggests that California's inability to finance needed services and infrastructure is not revenue-based, but rather expenditure-based, and should be addressed through policies to change the way existing revenues are being spent.   Three broad policy options are offered to address the expenditure-based obstacles to service delivery and infrastructure expansion, and three policy options are offered to restore fiscal discipline to the state's appropriation and budgeting process. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTIONARY NOTES ON THE ECONOMY</FONT></B><P>

In 1991, the largest single tax increase in American history was imposed on California's economy--$8.3 billion of new taxes and fees,  or about $1,081 annually from the income of an average family of four.<SUP>1</SUP>  This fueled a nine percent increase in spending in one year, from $51.4 billion to $56.3 billion, including an eight percent increase in general fund expenditures, from $40.3 billion to $43.3 billion.<SUP>2</SUP> <P>

This tax package included a 20 percent increase in the retail sales tax.  In the following quarter, retail sales plunged faster than they had at any time in the prior 30 years.  When the sales tax was applied to bunker fuels, sales at California ports dropped precipitously, and the tax was repealed the following year because it was not generating revenue.  The economic impact was so great that projected general fund revenues fell short by $5.9 billion. <P>

Since then, a revisionism has taken shape which argues that the recession was caused by forces beyond Sacramento's control, and that the economic implosion following the tax increases was merely coincidental.  It is said that California's economic recession was the result of the national recession magnified by disproportionate cuts in defense-related industries and an over-built real estate market. <P>

This revisionism ignores several important facts. <P>

The first is that California, which does not even rank in the top ten states in the percentage of defense-related spending, performed significantly worse than states which did. As economist Arthur Laffer noted: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Defense prime contracts in California peaked in FY 1984 at $30.1 billion and declined steadily to $20.1 billion in FY 1989.  Throughout these years the California economy was more healthy than the rest of the nation.  From 1986 through 1989 the unemployment rate in California was less than the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices in California were appreciating relative to the rest of the nation. <P>

1991 was the first clear decline in the California economy relative to the U.S. economy.  Defense prime contracts to California, however, actually increased over the 1990-91 period from $20.1 billion to $21.2 billion.  The drop in prime contracts awarded to California companies does not correspond well to the drop in the state's economy.  Prime contracts declined in real terms 28 percent from FY 1984 to FY 1989, while the state's economy was doing well.  The decline in prime contracts from FY 1989 to FY 1992, the years of poor economic performance, was 8 percent.<SUP>3</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Laffer's analysis of state dependency on percentage of defense prime contracts per percentage of personal income ranked California 11th in the nation between 1990 and 1992.  Yet all but one of the states more reliant on defense spending saw greater growth in per capita personal income than California, including Arizona, Mississippi, Colorado, Alaska, and Missouri.<SUP>4</SUP><P>  

The second fact ignored by this strain of revisionism is that many California companies with major defense contracts where choosing to fulfill those contracts out of California.  For example, in 1993, Hughes Aircraft announced its decision to transfer 1,900 engineering jobs from Canoga Park to Tucson, culminating in the loss of  7,000 jobs with the closure of satellite complexes in other parts of southern California.  Hughes executives said that they had run out of patience with California's anti-business climate and when the opportunity to move came, they took it.  The entire cost of the move was expected to be recouped in three years from the savings of doing business in Arizona-estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.  Said Hughes CEO C. Michael Armstrong: "California is no longer a competitive place to do business."  The company's division chairman said company representatives had appealed to the state for regulatory relief, but to no avail.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

A third fact ignored by this revisionism is that California's net domestic migration over the last five years has been decidedly outbound.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 1995 that 1.5 million more Americans moved out of California than moved in during the first five years of the decade.  The state's population increase is entirely a combination of foreign immigration (much of it illegal), and high birth rates. <P>

The conventional wisdom continues that with the most painful of the defense cuts behind us and with real estate prices bottoming out, California is through the worst and is now poised for explosive economic growth based on the strength of its small businesses, its motion picture and high tech industries and returning aerospace contracts, notably McDonnell-Douglas's C-17. <P>

Actually, there is better news than this.  <I>More than three fourths of the tax increases enacted in 1991 have been repealed, have expired, or have been offset by regulatory relief</I>.<P>  

In 1992, voters ordered the repeal of sales taxes on candy and snack foods and legislators repealed the bunker and jet fuel sales tax, for combined relief of over $500 million.  On December 31, 1995, the upper income tax brackets automatically reverted from their 1991 levels of 11 percent and 10 percent to a maximum of 9.3 percent, for a savings to taxpayers of $1.3 billion.  Business tax credits for new equipment purchases, and targeted business tax cuts were adopted in 1993, providing an additional savings of $600 million.  De facto abolition of the unitary method of corporate tax assessments has provided additional tax relief.  These tax reductions alone have offset more than one-fourth of the 1991 tax increases.  Even more significant were the workers compensation regulation reforms adopted in 1993, which have resulted in cost reductions to California business of as much as $4 billion annually. <P>

It may not be mere coincidence that California's economy performed well below national figures in the aftermath of the 1989, 1990, and 1991 tax increases, nor that it began to recover following the salubrious tax and regulatory reductions which have been adopted in the last three years.  The lessons drawn from these experiences are important in discussing the Administration's proposed 15 percent across-the-board tax cuts in 1996. <P>

The new economic forecasts from Sacramento reflect robust optimism.  The Department of Finance bases its revenue assumptions on a 5.7 percent rate of growth in personal income in 1996 to 5.9 percent in 1997.<SUP>6</SUP>  The Controller is even more bullish, at 5.9 percent income growth for FY 1995.<SUP>7</SUP>  Not to be outdone, the Legislative Analyst predicts that state revenues will exceed the D.O.F. forecast by $1 billion. <P>

Such optimism was reflected in state spending plans, and in the Governor's January State of the State Address, when he announced to legislators that "The U-Hauls have reversed course" and are coming back to California. <P>

Not according to U-Haul.  From January 1 to November 15, U-Haul moved 4 percent more families out of California than into the state, the worst numbers since 1992. <P>

In its January 1996 report of one-way moving orders, Allied Van Lines painted a similar picture.  Allied reported that in 1995, California had the third highest percentage of outbound one-way moves in the country, behind New York and North Dakota.  Sixty-one percent of Allied's household relocations were outbound from California; only 39 percent were inbound.  Although this was a slight improvement over the previous year when the state ranked second behind New York with 64 percent outbound moves, it falls short of the reversal of the state's disturbing outmigration pattern. <P>

Clearly, if families are flocking back to California, they are doing so without the services of van lines or rental trucks. <P>

Real estate prices also are showing continued erosion.  The median home sales price reported by the California Association of Realtors in February 1996 was $170,920, the lowest monthly price since the recession began and the 6th straight month of decline. <P>

California families are buying more than they did during the recession, although anecdotal information on California retail sales suggests a disappointing Christmas season.  The growth in first quarter taxable transactions cooled in California between 1994 and 1995 showing a modest decline from 4.3 percent growth to 3.3 percent, but improved dramatically in the second quarter from 3.7 percent to 7.0 percent.  Third quarter growth has also improved from 4.8 percent to 5.6 percent.  These numbers are not quite as encouraging when broken down by merchandise type.  Goods with the most elastic demand are consistently underperforming general retail sales, indicating that households are avoiding frills.  Growth in recreational vehicle purchases, gifts and novelties, and sporting goods, for example, has consistently lagged behind.<SUP>8</SUP><P>

The second cautionary note is that while the state government's fiscal condition is also improving, it is still far from sound.  The Department of Finance begins its current budget summary by boasting: "For the fifth consecutive year, the Governor's Budget continues the fiscal discipline necessary for California to live within its means, where spending from the State's General fund is being held below the amount of General Fund revenues."<SUP>9</SUP>   In support, the D.O.F. offers the following figures: <P>

Although it can be argued that fiscal discipline has been better than it was in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 fiscal years, the state's progress back from the brink of bankruptcy has been slower than the D.O.F. numbers first imply.  These numbers are distorted by their treatment of loans and transfers, off budget "loans" to schools, and deferred pension obligations, to name but three bookkeeping anomalies. <P>


<B>1. Adjustments for Transfers and Loans</B><P>

During each of the budget years 1990-91 to 1994-95, the state has engaged in billions of dollars of short-term borrowing.  The "balanced" numbers reported by the Department of Finance are attained, in part, by including loans and transfers of funds within the state budget, which distorts the actual balance of revenues and expenditures.  A more accurate picture of the state's general fund condition can be found in the D.O.F.'s reports of actual revenues and expenditures, undistorted by loans and transfers: <P>

<B>2. Off-Budget Loans to Schools</B><P>	

The "Off-Budget" loans are loans only in a fictional sense.  Proposition 98 established a minimum level of school funding, based in part on a percentage of state revenues.  The problem in appropriating funds under Proposition 98 is that the appropriations must be made at the beginning of the fiscal year, and the precise condition of the general fund is not known until the end.  This imprecision is compounded by inflated revenue projections the Department has until recently made at the beginning of the fiscal year.  The result is that the Proposition 98 appropriations at the outset of the fiscal year are usually higher than the condition of the general fund would require.  In 1992-93 and again in 1993-94, the legislature attempted to recapture this overappropriation by retroactively reducing school appropriations. <P>

Of course, the funds had already been expended during the past year by the schools, and those districts were in no condition to retroactively cut budgets which had already been spent.  Thus, the fictional "Off-Budget" loan was created.  The district budgets were retroactively cut on paper, and the difference was then "loaned back" to them from future entitlements.  The funds which had been fictionally cut were then spent a second time.  $1.5 billion was moved off budget in this manner in FY 1992/93 and an additional $700 million in 1993-94: <P>

This practice was ruled unconstitutional by the courts in 1994, but not until off budget loans added $2.2 billion to the state's red ink.  In CTA v. Gould, the court has ruled that the state is constitutionally required to add $4 billion to annual school appropriations as a result of this device. <P>


<B>3. Deferral of Pension Obligations</B><P>

Another device used by state budget writers during this period was a decision simply not to make the scheduled half-billion dollar pension payment to the Public Employees Retirement Fund for FY 1993-94.  Legislation was adopted as part of the trailer bills to the budget that year which accomplished this feat by pushing back the payment dates by one year.  The problem with this practice is that the state cannot simply "skip" a year of pensions to retirees.  Thus, the state has incurred $480 million of obligations which, though not actually expended, are obligated to be expended in the future.  This adjustment runs up additional red ink: <P>

This discussion is not exhaustive of all the various devices which have been employed in the state budget process during the first half of the decade.  Absent from this discussion, for example, is the use of fee increases to offset general fund expenditures, which gives the illusion of a decrease in general fund spending but which in effect is merely an increase in revenues.  Spiraling university fees and suspension of the renters' tax credit are among the most egregious examples of this.  Also unmentioned is the transfer of local property tax revenues to meet the state's obligations, which also gives the illusion of general fund cuts where none are actually made.  But once the major accounting anomalies are factored into the budget numbers, it is clear that the state has been in a condition of chronic deficit finance, from which it is only now emerging.  This condition has been responsible for the record levels of short-term borrowing which the state has had to employ. <P>


<B>4. Growing State Debt</B><P>

In order to meet the actual operating deficits in the general fund, the state has resorted to record amounts of short-term borrowing to meet the very real gap between expenditures and revenues. <P>

State borrowing can be divided into two broad categories: short term debt, which is incurred to bridge the gap between ongoing spending and revenues, and long term debt, which is used mainly to finance capital outlay.  Short term debt can be further divided into internal and external borrowing. <P>

Although the state's expenditures are fairly uniform throughout the year, state revenues fluctuate dramatically.  Because much of the revenue is received in the last half of the year, the state often experiences a negative cash-flow in the first months of the year.  This temporary cash gap can be addressed either through internal borrowing from special funds, or through entry into the capital market.  With a genuinely balanced budget, these temporary loans are retired at the end of the fiscal year. <P>

However, this benign cash management practice has been used increasingly to borrow funds without voter approval to plug the general fund's operating deficits. It is precisely this form of non-voter approved borrowing that Article XVI of the state constitution specifically prohibits beyond an aggregate of $300,000. <P>

In a real sense, the short-term borrowing by the state provides a rough gauge of the operating deficit in the state's general fund.  The debt at the end of each fiscal year has been substantial: <P>

A secondary concern is the long term debt, which is generally used to finance capital outlay.  Although this debt is not a function of the state's general fund deficits, its repayment increases pressure on the general fund (and many special funds as well). <P>

There are three kinds of long term bonds.  The first is voter-approved general obligation bonds, repaid over a period of 20 to 30 years from the state general fund.  The second is revenue bonds, which are repaid from revenues generated from the projects financed with those bonds.  A water district or a toll-bridge are examples of this kind of instrument.  Revenue bonds are not approved by voters, since they are guaranteed and redeemed not by general taxes, but by fees paid by the users of the facilities. <P>

The third kind of long term debt instrument is the so-called "Lease Purchase" bond.  Beginning in the mid 1980's, the state bypassed voters and began financing billions of dollars of capital construction through the use of these bonds based on the fiction that the lease purchase arrangement made these a form of revenue bonds, financed not from the general fund, but from the enterprise, primarily, prisons.  Since prisoners are not renting out rooms, the question arises, what is the stream of revenue the prisons are generating?  The answer is the annual prison budget which comes directly out of the state general fund.  Once again, the debt trend is dramatic: <P>

California's budget problem is that actual expenditures have significantly outpaced revenues over the past five years, with the accumulated gap filled with unprecedented levels of government borrowing.  This borrowing not only increases the obligations which future budgets must address, but the growing interest costs of short and long term debt are placing additional upward pressure on expenditures. <P>

After general fund spending growth of 5.4 percent from FY 1994-95 to 1995-96, the Governor's budget anticipates a reduction in the growth rate to 2.3 percent for 1996-97.  The reduction in expenditure growth is due in part to major policy initiatives in health and welfare spending.  Revenue is projected to grow 1.3 percent after the first phase of a 15 percent across the board reduction in personal and corporate income taxes. <P>

These levels are based on projected rates of personal income growth of 5.7 percent in 1996-97 and 5.9 percent in 1997-98.  Taxable sales are estimated to grow 5.4 percent in 1996-97 and 4.9 percent in 1997-98, up substantially from the 3.3 percent gains posted in actual sales between the first quarters of 1994 and 1995. <P>

Surprisingly, the most controversial aspect of the proposed state budget is the Governor's intention to reduce personal and corporate income taxes by 15 percent over the next three years.  California's recent experience with tax increases and tax cuts suggests a strong correlation between economic performance and tax reductions.  The state's slowly improving economic condition and the concomitant growth in tax revenues is clearly consistent with what free-market economists have promised.  This, however, has not been enough to silence critics. <P>

Two additional observations, then, ought to be made. <P>

First, the debate over reducing the state income tax in California by 15 percent takes place at a time when Arizona Governor Fife Symington is pushing for the abolition of the Arizona state income tax.  Nevada has no income tax; Oregon has no sales tax; while California ranks 11th in per capita income taxes and 11th in per capita sales taxes among all states.<SUP>10</SUP>  Indeed, California's top marginal personal income tax rate of 9.3 percent is the highest in the nation. <P>

Second, the revenue effect of the first year of phased-in personal income tax reductions is almost entirely offset by the effective tax increase proposed in the budget through the abolition of the renter's tax credit.  The renter's tax credit was suspended in 1993, has since remained in abeyance, and is due to be restored automatically this year delivering a half-billion tax cut to California renters.  The proposed budget would abolish the credit, effectively increasing renters' income tax obligations beyond current law.  Although income tax collections would be decreased by $572 million in the first year of the proposed tax cut,<SUP>11</SUP> these revenues are offset by a $520 million in income taxes paid by renters, which would otherwise automatically be repealed.<SUP>12</SUP>  <I>Thus, the net revenue effect of the combined package is virtually neutral in the first year of operation</I>.  Static losses of revenue do not occur until January of 1998, by which time the dynamic economic impact of the cuts can be expected to boost revenues. <P>


<B>2. Notes on Expenditure Assumptions</B><P>

$2.6 billion of expenditure reductions in health and welfare are based on changes in, or waivers of, federal law.  Similar assumptions were made in last year's budget, which are now causing approximately $1.5 million in daily expenditure overruns. <P>

Last year, we warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social welfare spending, but there's a hitch.  The cuts can't take effect until waivers are granted from the federal government, or federal laws are changed. <P>

Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  That's a very likely scenario, considering the state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made in 1994.   The same imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit which California's taxpayers now owe.<SUP>13</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

It should be noted that these developments have indeed occurred, although the expenditure overruns are more than compensated by unanticipated increases in revenues.  Caution should be exercised in making similar assumptions of federal action in expenditure reductions which account for six percent of the state's general fund spending proposal for 1996. <P>



<B><FONT SIZE=+1>A (FOND) RETROSPECTIVE ON THE (PAT) BROWN ADMINISTRATION</B></FONT><P>

During the administration of Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown from 1959 to 1967, California government provided a cornucopia of services.  During this period, California embarked upon a historic expansion of her highway and university systems.  The state water project was constructed to provide for the needs of a growing and thirsty population.   A college education was guaranteed free to every Californian who wanted one. <P> 

Surprisingly, California's golden age of government was financed with less than two-thirds of the funds that the state is now consuming, after adjusting for both inflation and population growth.  In FY 1965-1966, the last full year of the Brown Administration, the state spent $1,070 per person (in 1995 inflation-adjusted dollars).  Today, it spends $1,775 per capita, <I>an absolute increase of more than 65 percent beyond the combined growth of population and inflation</I>.<P>

Neither the aftermath of Proposition 13, which shifted some local financing to Sacramento, nor the <I>Serrano</I> decision, which required the state to equalize education expenditures, excuse or explain such a run-up.  Total per capita inflation-adjusted spending is 31 percent more than 1972-73, the first year after <I>Serrano</I>.  It is almost exactly the same as it was in 1978-79, the first full year after Proposition 13 (adjusting for the 1992 and 1993 property tax shifts). <P>

As the population nearly doubled from 18 million to 33 million, simple economies of scale should have significantly reduced the per capita cost of providing a host of state services.  Ironically, per capita costs have increased while the quality of those basic services has declined dramatically. <P>

Why is it that a state with one of the highest marginal tax rates in the country, a state which is spending 65 percent more per person after inflation than it did in 1966, is so utterly unable to provide basic services to its people? <P>

<UL>
<LI>The cost of the University of California in this year's budget is more than $40,000 per student, not including extra-curricular expenditures.  Just three years ago, it was less than $36,000.  
 
<LI>The average cost of locking up a single prisoner in the state's prisons is $24,000.  Three years ago, it was $21,000.  Since 1980, prison costs have grown at twice the rate as prison population.
 
<LI>California taxpayers pay a flagman on a state-contracted road job $25.12 per hour in wages and benefits in most parts of the state to hold a stop-and-go sign.

<LI>Taxpayers support every classroom of 30 students in this state with nearly $168,000 of public resources, or $5,600 per pupil.  According to a recent study by the Rand Corporation, half this money never reaches the classroom.
</UL>

This experience suggests that California's failure stems not from how much revenue it is receiving, but rather how that revenue is spent.  If a golden age of California government is to return, it will come not because of increased revenues, but because of fundamental changes in the way policy makers spend those resources.  In order to make those changes, two fundamental reforms are essential.  First, the proclivities of policy makers to avoid painful policy reforms by spending more money must be disciplined.  Second, the perverse incentives under which the state's bureaucracies function must be reversed. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS</B></FONT><P>

California's fiscal affairs are a shambles in part because the constraints which the constitution placed on uncontrolled increases in spending have been eroded over the past decade.  Had these constitutional safeguards remained intact, even the most profligate class of policy makers could have done little harm.  If fiscal discipline is to be restored, constitutional provisions which were originally intended to require a balanced budget, prohibit borrowing without voter approval, and limit the growth of state spending must be restored to their original condition. <P>

First, California's constitution has always required that the budget sent to the legislature each January must be balanced, and for generations it naturally followed that the same requirement applies to the final product.  This constitutional requirement for a balanced budget has been circumvented through two devices. <P>

As discussed above, inflated revenue projections have often given the illusion of balance while annual expenditures clearly exceeded revenues.  But by 1993, even the polite pretense of a balanced budget was dropped, and the 1993 and 1994 budgets have included programmed "roll-overs" of debt from one year to the next.  Thus, budgets which would have been clearly unconstitutional if introduced in January are legally adopted in June, transforming California's balanced budget requirement from a revered practice to a quaint myth. <P>

A second vital mechanism which disciplined the state's expenditures had been Article XVI of the state constitution, which prohibits the state from borrowing more than $300,000 without a vote of the people.  A variety of court rulings and the ever-expanding interpretation of these rulings by budget writers has completely undermined this protection. <P>

During the depression of the 1930's, the state issued IOUs to meet temporary cash shortages, which the courts ruled was merely an emergency response to unanticipated events and therefore not a deliberate circumvention of the constitution.  Short term notes within the fiscal year were further sanctioned as a means to smooth out the monthly fluctuations in state revenues. <P>

This precedent has been used in recent years to justify financing a substantial portion of the state's operating deficit with billions of dollars in notes of less than one year.  During the budget deliberations of 1994, the Attorney General opined that court rulings which allowed the state to issue temporary IOU's for a few weeks between fiscal years to cover unexpected shortfalls now empowered the Legislature to enter into a multi-year $4 billion debt--tying the hands of legislators not yet elected. <P>

To add a final blow to Article XVI, the state introduced the fiction of lease-purchase bonds, which are discussed above. <P>

A third element in the taxpayer's triad of defense was a constitutional provision of more recent origin. In 1979, voters approved Proposition 4, better known as the Gann Spending Limit, which placed a flexible restraint on the total amount of funds the government could spend without voter approval.  The limit was hardly draconian (it expanded with population and inflation), and from 1979 to 1990 allowed state general fund spending to increase from $12.6 billion to $31.2 billion in current dollars. <P>

In 1988 and 1990, Propositions 98 and 111 changed the formula for calculating Gann, sending the spending limit into the upper stratosphere of government finance, where it still orbits unobtrusively today.  For example, Proposition 111, which the Legislature titled a "Transportation Improvement and Spending Limitation Act," increased the spending ceiling by $53.3 billion over a decade for purposes unrelated to transportation. <P>

The requirements that policy makers balance the budget, that they seek voter permission for borrowing and that they obtain public approval for expenditures above a certain limit, which operated effectively throughout the 1980's, have been knocked down one by one.  But in addition, perverse provisions have been adopted to encourage fiscal folly. <P>

The strangest provision virtually guarantees a future of deficit finance.  To his credit, Governor George Deukmejian insisted on a three percent prudent reserve for economic uncertainties, providing the budget with a cushion to accommodate unexpected revenue shortfalls or cost overruns. It was this reserve that protected California against deficits in the mid-1980's, and won the state a triple-A bond rating. <P>

Ironically, just when a reserve was most needed to cushion the erratic revenue and expenditure projections of the Department of Finance, the state's stewards eliminated the reserve, translating every miscalculation into red ink. <P>

To make matters worse, the 1991 budget included a statute which guarantees that a budget reserve will never be restored.  As part of the $8.1 billion tax and fee package that year, a quarter cent sales tax hike was instituted with a perverse trigger.  The $750 million annual tax is set to expire automatically when a three percent budget reserve is restored.  In effect, this measure provides budget writers with a $750 million disincentive ever to restore a prudent reserve, guaranteeing that every future calamity or shortfall will ratchet the state progressively deeper into debt. <P>

To restore fiscal discipline to the budget making process, it is an essential prerequisite that a true balanced budget provision be enacted into the state constitution; that a three percent reserve requirement govern all future budgets, and that the full intent of Article XVI be restored to prohibit non-voter approved borrowing.  If these provisions sound extreme, it is a measure of how dramatically the state's fiscal management has changed. These are precisely the constraints under which the state budget operated until the late 1980's, when California maintained a triple-A bond rating even while general fund expenditures more than doubled. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUREAUCRACY</B></FONT><P>

In addition to restoring fiscal discipline to the budget process, three dramatic alterations must be made to the bureaucracy itself.   First, brisk, healthy competition must be restored for the provision of governmental goods and services.  Second, superfluous or superannuated bureaucracies must be eliminated.  Third, the civil service system must be placed under the discipline of a free market. <P>

In their <I>History of Civilization</I>, Will and Ariel Durant ask the question, "What makes Ford a good car?"  Their answer, "Chevrolet." <P>

No human enterprise could be reasonably expected to perform optimally if the best and brightest producers were paid the same as the dullest and laziest sluggards.  Incentives matter: excellence must be rewarded if the sacrifices required to attain it are to be endured.  Over time, few people could be expected to continue to strive, to innovate, or to improve if guaranteed the same number of customers, an unbroken chain of pay increases, and a constantly expanding budget.  Yet this is precisely the way we manage the institutions responsible for educating our children, protecting our families and supporting our communities. <P>

Over the past twenty years, insurmountable obstacles have been deliberately erected to prevent California's government from doing what every family and business in the state does routinely: shop around for the best service at the lowest price. <P>

A constitutional amendment repealing anti-competitive provisions in current law would prompt an explosion in privatizing, offering California's beleaguered taxpayers a veritable cornucopia of better services at lower costs--a concept universal in the market but unknown in the government.  More importantly, it would introduce competitive incentives for bureaucrats to contain costs, to innovate, to improve efficiency, and even to be nice to their customers. <P>

Secondly, California government is riddled with overlapping bureaucracies and duplicative jurisdictions, both within the state government and among local, state and federal levels.  In 1992, the Commission on California Competitiveness warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Overlapping jurisdictions occur not only at all levels of government--state, regional and local--but within single-purpose agencies as well.  The result is a labyrinth of policies and regulations which, instead of fostering a thriving business community, confound and stymie small and large business alike.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

In addition, a wide range of state agencies simply provide no vital services at all.  In fact, when California's drought was officially declared at an end during the floods of 1993, instead of disbanding the superfluous "Drought Information Center," the bureaucracy was re-named the "Water Conservation Center" and will presumably continue through the next biblical flood. <P>

The obstacle to eliminating such agencies is that each has an established constituency, with a huge financial incentive to lobby for its expansion.  Congress faced this resistance when reformers tried to close out-dated military bases.  The result was the "Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission," an independent panel responsible for drafting a base closure list insulated from parochial congressional concerns.  The list of unnecessary bases cannot be amended by congress or the president, but must be accepted or rejected in total.  This mechanism protects members of congress from special interest pressures while proceeding with the long overdue closure of obsolete facilities.  A "Bureaucracy Closure Commission" could insulate legislators and the governor from the same pressures while taking the historic action of actually eliminating unnecessary state agencies. <P>
	
Third, the state's civil service system must be overhauled, as has been repeatedly advocated by officials as diverse as the governor and the legislative analyst.  California state employees are potentially just as productive and efficient and innovative and courteous as their private sector counterparts.  However, they are denied the incentives, inducements and rewards for excellence which are provided in every other field of human endeavor outside of government.  The state's civil service system fails to encourage the best and the brightest to rise to the top, and it provides a range of perverse financial and procedural incentives that destroy the impetus toward excellence which act on private sector workers in a competitive environment. <P>

Civil service examinations, which were originally intended to identify and promote proficiency, are now weighted with so many non-merit considerations (such as whether the applicant is a veteran or an incumbent state employee), that non-favored applicants with much higher performance are arbitrarily excluded.  The state's de facto racial and gender quotas further skew what was originally conceived as a system built exclusively on merit.  Ninety nine percent of eligible state employees received the maximum allowable "merit salary" increase last year, making a mockery of rewarding excellence over mediocrity.  Complicated personnel procedures make disciplinary action against state employees prohibitively expensive.   Incestuous promotions within agencies freeze out superior applicants and seniority protections reward longevity above all other considerations. <P>

The provisions in current law which capriciously confer unearned advantages in civil service examinations to veterans, state employees and other privileged classes ought to be removed.  The preference of seniority over merit ought to be discontinued.  The Public Employment Relations Board should be abolished, disciplinary proceedings should be streamlined, and dismissal standards conformed to those already well practiced in the private sector.  Outcome-based criteria for evaluating and rewarding job performance should be re-introduced. <P>

The reason that common-sense reforms are often ignored brings us to the second malfunction of the civil service: the enormous influence of public employee unions over the selection of management.  Public employee unions have significant advantages which are not shared by private sector unions, including the collection of union dues and political contributions at public expense, the ability to directly influence the selection of management  through the election process, and the ability to hold the public hostage in prolonged strikes. <P>  

If this unfair influence is to be contained, California's long-standing prohibition against public employee strikes, which was struck down by the Rose Bird Supreme Court, must be restored.  Public funds should not be used to assist the exaction of political contributions and union dues from state employees.  A state Hatch Act, modeled after the federal law which until recently maintained the political neutrality of federal bureaucrats, must be enacted to restrict the extent to which state public employees may make political demands on state elected officials. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CONCLUSION</B></FONT><P>

	Californians live in a state which has been blessed by the most equitable climate in the North American continent.  Geographically, it is poised on the Pacific rim, in a position to dominate trade in the next century.  It has the most bountiful resources of any of the contiguous states.  And yet for five years, it has suffered a continuing exodus of domestic population.  An unprecedented number of California's sons and daughters have found a better place to live and work and raise their families in the middle of the Nevada or Arizona deserts than they found in California.  This exodus has not been the result of acts of God, but rather of government.  Given the right policies, there is every reason to expect California to resume the prosperity, optimism and growth which has characterized her history as recently as the Pat Brown administration, when inflation-adjusted per capita spending was 38 percent less than it is today. <P>

California's recent experience affirms the wisdom of additional phased in tax cuts and suggests that the disastrous impact of the 1991 tax increases is being slowly repaired through the gradual repeal, expiration or offset of taxpayers' overall tax and regulatory burdens. <P>

Caution must still be exercised in planning the state's fiscal affairs, however, in the absence of significant changes in expenditure policy.  California's crumbling infrastructure, her failed public schools, her ubiquitous and overbearing regulators, her chronic budget deficits, her expanding bureaucracies, are all lessons unheeded from ancient Rome to modern Russia.  California's institutions are reaching the terminal phase of bureaucratic evolution, when they begin to fail to provide the most basic of services even while they consume ever increasing portions of the society's productivity. <P>

The brisk competition of a market place, the clear-headed elimination of unnecessary programs and agencies, and the restoration of merit as the guiding force of governmental administration are essential antidotes to the California's chronic fiscal anemia. <P>

A return to California's golden age requires a return to the fiscal discipline and the wholesome incentives which guided past generations. Ultimately, this is a question of political willpower.  It will happen on the day that the political will of the voters to demand reform exceeds the political will of the bureaucracy to resist it. <P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Rocky Road to Electricity Deregulation</FONT></B><P>

In the last 15 years deregulation of major industries has led, in most cases, to better service and lower costs--witness the airline and telephone industries.  Likewise in the case of electricity, economists are happy to report that costs--and rates--will be going down.  The reason?  Good old-fashioned American competition.<P> 

Currently California consumers buy their electricity from individual power companies that have monopolies in their local markets, courtesy of the government, which both regulates them and sets their rates through the Public Utilities Commission.  Now, because of a 1992 federal law we are entering a new era in which power companies from all over the country will be able to compete to sell consumers electricity in much the same way people now buy phone service.  Although this new and better system promises lower costs and better service, there is a growing and heated debate here in California over the transition from monopoly to full blown free-market competition. <P>

The transition will not be easy.  The difficulties demonstrate the inefficiencies of the system of regulated monopolies that is common in our country.  This system has many of the same inequities of pure socialized production.  It carries negatives for customers and for the economy at large.  In the case of electricity, the problem has two parts.  The first is that rates have been set by a government body, and the ratepayers have no choice but to pay the rate that is set.  Power companies build into their rates all kinds of costs that would not be there in the face of competition. For many companies, competition could mean massive downsizing--loss of jobs and benefits on a large scale. <P>

The second problem is the potential, often realized, for an oversupply of electrical production.  The laws that set up the electricity monopoly here in California compel the power companies to provide electricity to any customer who seeks it.  Because electricity cannot be stored, it must be produced on demand.  This means that facilities must be able to meet all demands that are put on it.  This requires a significant investment in facilities and coordination.  To compound this challenge the Public Utilities Commission, in the interest of using renewable resources, mandated that power companies purchase electricity from co-generation plants--industrial facilities who create electricity using a by-product such as steam--at a cost significantly higher than their existing power plants.  In effect they are mandated not to be as efficient as they know they can be. <P>

Compare this to a company subjected to normal competition.  Like the power companies, they must predict how much their customers will demand.  To meet demand, they must make investments--in advance--in machines, materials and labor.  If they produce too much, they will have goods on hand that they cannot sell.  If they produce too little, they will miss opportunities to sell at a profit, opportunities likely to be seized by their competitors. <P>

The market rewards competitors that anticipate customers demands accurately.  In other words, companies make money if they make the correct advance decisions about what consumers will want and in what quantities they will want it.  Power companies are relieved of this pressure.  Moreover, the very laws that tell them to make sure they do not underestimate consumer demand encourage them to build power plants that are very expensive to operate and that are not necessary to meet market demand.  For example, several nuclear reactors in both Northern and Southern California cannot compete with the latest modern plants using non-nuclear technology.  We now know that they should not have been built.  Would a private company have made such a mistake?  Sometimes they do, but when they do, they suffer the consequences.  That makes them more careful. <P>  

To worsen an already bad situation, the government has intervened even more directly in the capital decisions of the regulated monopolies.  The windmills that stand in vast flocks in the low desert of Southern California and East Bay valleys in the North were built under the pressure of regulatory requirements, not market demand.  They are not an efficient way to produce electricity, but they please people who have an ideological commitment to the environment--or an investment in windmills.  The extra cost imposed on the electricity ratepayers is a hidden tax. <P>
  
Who should pay to get out of this situation?  It is true that the power companies have enjoyed a cozy situation for many years.  One argument is they--meaning their shareholders and possibly also their bondholders--should now pay the cost for the power plants that are not needed.  These power plants constitute what is called a "stranded investment," meaning that the investment has been made, but there may be no revenue stream to pay the investors back.  Why not leave the investors, the shareholders and bondholders of the regulated monopolies, high and dry? <P>

The answer against this route is that the public made commitments, which amount to a contract, in two different ways.  Through their political institutions the people passed laws that require the regulated monopolies to meet customer demand, and to meet all of it.  And they have required that power be produced in certain ways, whether the power companies liked it or not.  It would be one-sided to ask the shareholders of the regulated monopolies to bear the full cost.  These investment decisions were mandated by public authorities, so the public should bear the cost along with shareholders. <P>

The issue of principle raised by this point is profound.  An old tradition in America says that contracts are sacred, and they must be kept by all parties, even when one of those parties is the people acting through the government.  That tradition stems directly from the principles stated in the founding documents of our nation. <P>
  
We need then to accomplish two things.  The first is to put a stop to government sponsored monopoly in any function that can be performed by an ordinary business in a competitive environment.  In particular we must subject the electricity industry to the full rigor of competition.  This will impose upon that industry profound change, and likely some of its leading companies will lose their competitive advantage.  Some may even disappear. That is how markets work.  They are not kind to the inefficient or the slow. <P>  

As we make the transition, we must pay scrupulous attention to the commitments we have made and the costs we have imposed on others. This means, in practical terms, that the "stranded investments" of the electricity companies must be recaptured by them, and at the expense of the ratepayers over some reasonable period of time.  Especially is this true in cases-such as the windmills out in the desert-where the power companies had no control over these costs.  Electricity prices will fall more slowly because of this.  Let it be a lesson to us to keep the government out of such matters wherever possible. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT><P>

American parents, politicians, and business leaders are concerned about the quality of American education.  Everyone agrees that the system is broken.  And although there are dozens of ideas for reforming the schools, no idea is more widely accepted than the need for higher standards.  Other reform ideas--such as voucher programs, charter schools, or increasing per pupil expenditures--have vociferous advocates but lack the widespread support needed to change public education on a systemic basis. <P>

Almost all Americans agree that the schools do not set their sights high enough.  Raising standards is considered one of the best ways to improve the schools and students without radical restructuring.  It is thus useful to look at recent reform efforts which have focused on standards.  By doing so, we can evaluate the potential of current efforts and better understand what is at stake.  The essential question that must be addressed is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is more fundamental overhaul needed?  No state offers a better example of both the promise and pitfalls of standards reform than California. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Honig Years</B></FONT><P>  

California in the early 1980s was widely regarded as a trailblazer on the path to education reform.  It had a massive publicity campaign detailing the ideas to be implemented.  It had a highly regarded leader in Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, first elected in 1982.  It had one of the nation's largest teachers' unions and a state school system attentive to the latest ideas of reform. <P>

Honig ran and was first elected on a "back to basics" platform, which the public saw as the needed corrective after the explosive growth of school spending under Wilson Riles.  During the first years of his watch, schools refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, and it paid off.  From 1983 to 1987, elementary school pupils showed slow but steady improvement on the California Assessment Program (CAP) exam, though the increases were not consistent across the board and students continued to score well below the national average on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and the Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT).  In all, however, there was reason for guarded optimism. <P>

What happened?  Like the Greek tragedies studied in the early days of American education, the mighty Golden State's small successes soon gave way to a punishing hubris.  State education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and began to put more emphasis on ideas popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists.  So from a primary focus on tried-and-true methods of basic education, the system lurched toward a more radical agenda.  There were numerous reasons for the change. <P>

Honig and the State Department of Education decided in 1987 that California's standards were not being applied "equitably."  Some students, mostly in middle to upper middle class areas, were performing better than students in poorer areas.  In such areas, active parents began to challenge school districts to deliver on the new basics education and the result was a system where students in some districts saw accelerated learning.  But in areas where parents were less involved and districts less challenged, scores continued to slide. <P>

Honig and others also became concerned that higher standards and greater discipline would frustrate and hurt the self esteem of many students.  He claimed that kindergartners were being pushed too hard to learn how to read, write, add, and subtract.  Instead of learning to read, Honig said, children ages four, five, and six should be spending their days listening to stories, acting out plays, counting with beans, growing plants in the windows and building with blocks. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Enter Stage Right: "Outcome-Based Education"</B></FONT><P>

Thus in 1987, the four years of California's modest attempts at reform ended and a new, more ambitious endeavor was launched.  New frameworks began to focus on "higher-order thinking skills," so-called "learning to learn" skills, and other abstract education theories.  Skills-based learning was pushed aside for a performance, or "outcome-based" curriculum. <P>

Hailed at the time as cutting edge and widely endorsed by business leaders, the new state standards led to a swift reversal in the gains of the previous four years.  From 1988 to 1994, statewide SAT scores stagnated.  Some districts did worse than others.  From 1990 to 1994, for example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's verbal average fell 13 points, and its math average declined by 16 points.  To take one year, the district's average in 1992 was 789--more than 100 points below the national average of 899 and the statewide average of 900.  That was down from 797 in 1991; 806 in 1990; and 817 in 1989.  On the verbal portion of the test, Los Angeles students averaged 357 points-down from 361 in 1991; 366 in 1990; and 372 in 1989.  On the math portion, students averaged 432 points--down from 436 in 1991; 440 in 1990; and 445 in 1989. <P>

These numbers were not lost on the business world that would be hiring the next generation of Golden State graduates.  According to a 1992 survey by the Council on California Competitiveness, 63 percent of California employers said recent high school graduates applying for entry level jobs "lack a satisfactory education." <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The CLAS Is Out</B></FONT><P>

By spring 1995, after eight years of experimenting with these progressive education techniques, California's education officials could no longer make excuses for students' poor performance.  Tests at both the national and state levels indicated a tragic debacle.  In March, the results of the defunct California Learning Assessment System test showed that a majority of the state's fourth, eighth, and tenth graders were below acceptable levels in reading, writing and math.  When the National Assessment of Education Progress reported a month later that California's fourth graders tied for last with 
Louisiana in reading proficiency, it was clear that the reforms of the last decade had failed. Newly elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin called the results "depressing" and pointed out what many California parents had known, or at least suspected, for a long time: "Our students are not learning to read well enough."<SUP>1</SUP><P>

The fact that she had presided over these years of failed experimentation from post as chairman of the Assembly Education Committee makes her admission all the more dramatic.  "We are not here to make excuses," Eastin said.  "The bottom line is something is wrong.  The kids' basic skills are not what they should be."<SUP>2</SUP>  It was a stunning admission that shocked the national education establishment.  It came from a woman who had either written or supported much of the legislation that compelled the schools to turn their back on skills instruction in the first place. <P>

The state went on red alert--again.  In the wake of the bad news, Eastin formed the California Reading Task Force, a 24 member panel of education experts, teachers, parents, and community members, to assess the present methods of reading instruction and suggest improvements. <P>

The task force issued its recommendations in September.  Entitled, "Every Child A Reader," the task force's report was in large measure a repudiation of the state's eight year experiment with "Whole Language," one of the major reforms implemented as part of the revised 1987 frameworks.  Considered one of the most dynamic ideas in education, whole language teaches reading by teaching students to identify words by sight, rather than sounding out words using the traditional phonics method. <P>

Though the task force did not recommend abolishing whole language entirely, its report made important concessions to traditionalists.  Among other things, "Every Child A Reader" called for a "balanced approach" in reading instruction, combining the "literature based" technique of whole language with skills development and tried-and-true, intensive systematic phonics. <P>

Even Bill Honig, the fallen champion of school reform, admitted to the news media that maybe he had pushed too far--that maybe the state shouldn't have eliminated skills instruction after all.<SUP>3</SUP><P>

The revelations from CLAS and NAEP are only the latest numbers indicating that California's students are wallowing in the education mire, if not sinking.  They are even more significant in light of what was already known when the Golden State began to reform itself.  Twelve years earlier, the National Commission on Excellence in Education's landmark report, "A Nation At Risk," identified a "rising tide of mediocrity" in the schools and launched a series of reforms supposed to put public education right back on track.  There was no longer any question that the establishment didn't know that something was wrong. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rediscovering Standards, Again</B></FONT><P>

In the wake of these revelations, new ideas took shape.  "Standards" became the battle cry of the eighties, as education officials, legislators, administrators, and teachers labored over how to make kids learn better.  Conservative political reformers' call to raise expectations and accountability was heard.  The education establishment agreed.  For the first time in nearly 40 years there was a consensus about what needed to be done.  Standards, however, have proved to be more problematic than once believed.  The movement to raise standards gave rise to a fundamental conflict of visions that has split efforts to reform the education system.  The questions became whose standards and how to implement them.  Even the methods needed to measure them differed radically. <P>

While almost everyone agrees on the end--that students should graduate from school having, among other things, mastered certain basic skills--there is fierce disagreement about the means.  Much of the debate centers on "content" versus "performance" standards.  Content standards refer to the skills and knowledge to be taught, while performance standards focus on the depth of mastery, often through essays, science experiments, mathematical evidence, or a combination of these activities, in each skill area. <P>

Performance standards have garnered the most recent national attention, mainly due to their association with Outcome Based Education (OBE) curriculum and testing.  The problem with OBE is that nobody fails.  Getting the correct answer, students are told, is not nearly so important as how they solve the problem.  And so the push for standards was ultimately hijacked in the mid 1980s by the abandonment of basic skills in favor of immeasurable, obscure "skills" such as "critical thinking" and "problem solving." Performance either remained static, with occasional upticks, or declined. <P>

A 1993 federally-funded study showed U.S. high school students spend an average of only three hours every school day on core academic subjects.  Classwork in English, math, science, history, geography, foreign languages, civics, and fine arts lags by 50 percent behind that of competitor nations.  Total academic hours in a four year period in the U.S. is 1,460, compared to 3,268 in Germany and 3,170 in Japan.<SUP>4</SUP><P>

Thus, the last fifteen years have been a story of failed reform.  After all the "back to basics" rhetoric, the revised curriculum, the new assessments, and  higher expenditures, California schools were in worse shape than ever.  Understanding why these efforts failed will help us map a more intelligent course to achieve the goal of higher standards and improved education for all students. <P>

Thirty years ago, California's schools weren't that bad.  There was no state-mandated curriculum or graduation requirements a generation ago, and yet California's students were at or near the top of their game.  Priorities began to shift in the 1960s, as progressive ideas in education gained new currency in the education department and teachers' colleges and began filtering into schools and enshrined in law.  The 1970s saw a downward slide in standardized test scores.  From 1970 to 1980, California's average SAT score fell 58 points, from 957 to 899.  The average verbal score fell from 464 to 425, and the average math score falling from 493 to 474.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

In 1982, the only requirement to graduate from high school in the state was two years of physical education.<SUP>6</SUP>  School districts had their own graduation requirements, but nearly half were non-academic courses, a lingering and persistent symptom of the "life education" model popular in the 1950s.  Also, schools regularly assigned their students into tracks, depending on their grades and how well they performed on standardized tests.  Former U.S.  Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch explains that tracking tended to shortchange students, especially those students who were neither exemplary nor in need of remedial help: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A Stanford University study released in 1984 found that high school students were assigned to four different tracks.  About 10 percent were in an honors track, about 35 percent were in the college preparatory track, 10-15 percent were in a remedial track, and nearly 45 percent were in the general track.  The general track students had the weakest, most incoherent curriculum, with the most non-academic electives.  A sample transcript of a general track student included courses in typing, cultural awareness, homemaking, beginning restaurant management, food for singles, exploring childhood, and clothing."<SUP>7</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Thus the stage was set for more than ten years of trial and error in education reform. <P>

<P ALIGN=right>-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, April 1986</P>

In 1983, Californians looked upon their schools and despaired.  That year, "A Nation At Risk" sent shockwaves through the American education establishment.  California's education officials faced climbing dropout and illiteracy rates, and plummeting standardized test scores.  When Bill Honig took office in January 1983, the average combined SAT score was 895.  (By comparison, the national average that year was 893.<SUP>8</SUP>)<P>

A self-described former progressive turned traditionalist, Honig campaigned throughout the 1980s on the need for schools to "get back to basics."  His message was the same wherever he went:  Kids need more homework, better-trained teachers, more challenging textbooks, stricter discipline, and a traditional education firmly rooted in the basics.  Math, science, history, and literature were not just for the college-bound.<SUP>9</SUP>  He criticized the non-academic courses which dominated the various curriculums offered in over 1,000 school districts across the state, and vowed to do away with tracking.  He won the 1982 election with 56 percent of the vote. <P>

Upon his election, Honig immediately set out to centralize the curriculums.  Students would no longer be able to graduate from high school with courses in home economics and food.  In 1983, Honig pushed (and the legislature passed) SB 813, the California Education Reform Act, an $800 million reform package that set strict graduation requirements, and created a state-mandated curriculum that included English, history, math, science, fine arts, foreign language, health, and physical education.<SUP>10</SUP>  Honig retooled the CAP test, setting the average score at 250 and challenging all schools to meet or exceed that number. <P>

Honig took a strong stand on textbooks, arguing that most had been watered down over the last decade.  With 11 percent of the total U.S. student population, California is the largest textbook buyer in the nation (with Texas a close second).  When California wants a change, the textbook publishers listen.  In 1985, the state rejected most junior high school science books up for consideration.  In 1986, it rejected all of the math books.<SUP>11</SUP>  And in 1988, the state threatened to do the same with about half of the reading, spelling, and English texts unless publishers revised them to place greater emphasis on writing and making stories more interesting. <P>

Honig also began issuing annual report cards to chart the progress of reform.  In June 1986, Honig's state report card found that after three years of the reform effort, only 47 percent of the state's 739 high schools were able to raise the reading and math scores on the CAP test high enough to meet the goals set in 1983.  CAP averages rose less than one percent overall, and when compared with similar tests, California students ranked 41st percentile nationally in reading, 48th percentile in math.<SUP>12</SUP>  Nationally, they have remained at or near the bottom ever since. <P>

But Honig assured the public that reform was right on track.  After three years, he could boast that for the first time since 1979, California's sixth grade students showed as much progress in the basic skills as third graders.  The 1985-86 scores for third, sixth and eighth graders showed improvement in all subject areas but eighth grade history.  Both third and sixth graders raised their average scores by 17 points.  "There is momentum, there is direction, there is a common vision," Honig said.<SUP>13</SUP><P>

Also, SAT scores went up 11 points from 1982-83 to 1986-87, when California's average combined score was 906.  The national average for 1986-87 was also 906.  (California's 12th graders tended to score better on the math portion of the test--482 compared to 476 nationally--and lower on the verbal portion--424 compared to 430 nationally.)  That year, 46.4 percent of California's high school seniors took the college entrance exam.<SUP>14</SUP>

There was good reason then to believe that the reforms were working.  As columnist Peter Schrag wrote after Honig released his data, <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The report recognizes the progress that's been made under the state's school reform law of 1983 and the increased funding of the past three years.  But it also documents how far California--now mediocre at best by most national standards--still has to go, and how much more difficult the problems of California education are likely to become in the next few years.  Student performance on academic test scores--assuming they're indicative--shows similarly mixed numbers.  Scores of elementary school students are up from their lows of the 1970s.  They started to rise before the reform law was passed, both in California and nationally, and before George Deukmejian and Bill Honig were elected, while high school scores, both on California's own tests and on such measures as the SAT are still lagging.  In 1984-85, for example, 12th graders scored considerably higher in mathematics on the CAP test than they had five years earlier, but slightly lower in reading."<SUP>15</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=right>-California State Language Arts Frameworks</P>

At Superintendent Honig's behest, the course of reform shifted in 1987.  New curriculum "frameworks" were introduced that departed radically from the "back to basics" approach he advocated over the previous four years.  Four factors contributed to the change. <P>

First, higher standards were a victim of their own success.  Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) surveyed 17 unidentified high schools across the state and found that all exceeded the standards imposed by SB 813.  As the basics appeared to improve, however, schools began tinkering with other areas of instruction which had nothing whatsoever to do with reading, writing, or math.  "We found people talking about an even more complex and deeper curriculum: thinking skills, learning-to-learn skills, problem-solving skills," said USC education professor Allan Odden, a member of the PACE research team.<SUP>16</SUP>  But as priorities changed, so did the definition of "basic skills."  Simply teaching verb conjugation and multiplication was not enough.  Schools had to teach kids how to think. <P>

Second, even though reform was working, the improvements were not evident across the board.  Honig and other educationists began to worry that reform was not progressing as well in certain areas, particularly inner cities.  Honig estimated that a little more than a quarter of the state's 1,780 middle and high schools had made real progress with the 1983 reforms.  About 40 percent had made some progress, but "there's another 25 percent where nothing has happened."<SUP>17</SUP>  Lingering problems, Honig and other education analysts throughout the state reasoned, had to do foremost with inequities in funding and changing demographics. <P>

Also, Honig was concerned that younger children were being overwhelmed by performance goals too early.  Advocating they be read to instead, he urged schools to hold off teaching kindergarten students to read.  He feared that too much attention on academics early on would alienate and possibly drive away students later and cited a study indicating that future drop-outs could be identified as early as third grade. <P>

Finally, an increasingly performance-based curriculum generated the need for performance-based assessment.  The trouble was, nobody could agree on what exactly "performance-based" meant.  As priorities changed to favor "learning-to-learn" skills and the like, assessment systems had to change as well. <P>

So, skills instruction was out, and outcome-based instruction was in.  Though differing in subject, each new curriculum framework was built around four central ideas: <P>

<UL>
<LI>An emphasis on thinking, application, and problem solving;
 
<LI>High expectations for all students, instead of the tracking that had been prevalent;
 
<LI>A focus on the body of knowledge and the ways of knowing in each discipline, enabling every student to build a foundation for future learning;
 
<LI>A shift from coverage of minute details to emphasis on understanding the major ideas in each field.<SUP>18</SUP>
</UL>

An instructional shift from minutia to the bigger picture sounded like a good idea at the time, but before long it was clear that the change in focus robbed students of the very foundation for learning that the frameworks were supposed to provide.  As priorities changed, non-academic subject matter began to leak back into the curriculum.  Thus, the definition of "skills" was expanded to include "critical thinking," "life skills," "conflict resolution," and a whole gaggle of special interest-mandated studies which came at the expense of the true basics. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Language Arts</B></FONT><P>

Under the new frameworks, California stopped teaching English and began teaching "language arts." The new language arts framework all but abandoned basic skills instruction.  Elementary grammar, punctuation, spelling, and vocabulary went by the boards: no more drills, no more workbooks, no more vocabulary tests. <P>

But the most radical change was the way in which reading was taught.  For more than thirty years, with the exception of a short period in the early seventies, California students learned to read using the "Look-Say" method, best known for the "Dick and Jane" series of readers.  Look-Say was the among the first in a long line of progressive education reforms designed to make learning more interesting.  The theory behind it was that kids could learn to read better by identifying words with pictures--See Dick, see Dick run, see Dick run to the Tree, and so forth.  Look-Say largely replaced phonics, which teaches kids to read by sounding out words through drill and repetition.  Educationists dismissed phonics as too boring.  But research has indicated time and again that intensive systematic phonics is the most effective method of reading instruction, boring or not.  California retained some aspects of phonetic instruction in the Look-Say curriculum. <P>

The new language arts framework jettisoned Dick and Jane--along with what little phonetic instruction that remained-for the "literature-based" approach known as "whole language."  Like its predecessor Look-Say, whole language teaches students to identify whole words rather than sound them out.  The technique is based on the belief that if kids can learn to speak by being exposed to spoken words, then they can become literate by being exposed to literature. <P>

But whole language is more than just a method of teaching kids to read.  It's a philosophy of learning.  As one proponent described it, whole language is "child-centered, experiential, reflective, authentic, holistic, social, collaborative, democratic, cognitive, developmental, constructivist, and challenging."<SUP>19</SUP>  Phonics, whole language enthusiasts say, is "generally boring and lead[s] to a dislike of reading," "misrepresent[s] what reading is," "detract[s] from time that would be better spent in reading aloud together," and "lead[s] to unrealistic expectations for children."<SUP>20</SUP>  Eighty-seven percent of reading teachers embraced whole language, according to a survey, and fewer than one in ten employed phonics.<SUP>21</SUP><P>

Honig and the state education department made it clear that there was not enough attention to writing under the old frameworks, largely because writing wasn't tested.  As with reading, the whole language approach to writing is based on the faith that students will learn to write by immersion in writing.  This method has some rather disturbing byproducts.  One byproduct of whole language is "invented spelling," which is the educationist's euphemism for uncorrected misspelling.  The idea is to shift "from a focus on error to a focus on creation" and to encourage students to become "natural writers." Just as reading is supposed to come naturally, through exposure to literature, "learning to spell should ultimately be as natural, unconscious, effortless, and pleasant as learning to speak."<SUP>22</SUP><P>

Even though Honig has since switched his position on whole language, he still finds merit in invented spelling.  In fact, he believes the method can even be used effectively in phonics instruction: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"'Invented' or 'temporary' spelling is a technique that allows students to approximate the letters and patterns of letters which represent a given sound and so permits the construction of more advanced writing connected to student interests.  It is a helpful technique to encourage students to write and pays off in increased writing volume and more elaborate stories, which in turn encourage children to think about what they are writing more than traditional techniques."<SUP>23</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Couched in such technical terms, invented spelling almost sounds reasonable.  Here it is in practice, as employed by a six-year old student in San Francisco: "If i wd hf mg ics I wd save the bses and one I sav the bes then I wi g thm way the end."  Translation: "If I would have magic beans, I would save the beans.  And when I save the beans, then I will give them away.  The End."  The child was writing a book report about "Jack and the Beanstalk" for his first grade class.  His teacher, Michelle Chabra, told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> that he was permitted, even encouraged, to write that way because it will help him become a writer in "the truest sense."  "The issue is confidence," she said.<SUP>24</SUP><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Education As Therapy: The Self Esteem Task Force</B></FONT><P>

Building confidence was and remains a crucial element of California's curriculum.  By reinforcing the self-esteem of students, the theory goes, all other things would fall into place; students would be more interested in learning, thereby improving their performance.  California, always on the forefront of education change, reacted to this new thinking with its <I>modus operandi</I>--it formed a task force.<P>

The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem first convened in 1988.  Three years and $735,000 later, the task force concluded that a positive sense of self was the cure for what ails many students, especially in the crime-ridden inner cities.<P>

A good self-conception, the task force reported, "inoculates us against the lures of crime, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency, and educational failure."<SUP>25</SUP><P>

This thinking about feelings profoundly affected the course of California education.  While the public called for higher standards, standards within the education universe were corrupted by the new psychological imperative that failure was not an option because of its alienating effect on students.<P>

California introduced its new mathematics frameworks in 1985.  They would become a model for the national math standards introduced four years later.  Similar to the language-arts model, the new curriculum was designed to teach math in a "new, dynamic way," again by moving away from basics and refocusing on "problem-solving skills."<P>

For example, writes Charles Sykes, "a typical eighth grade student might be asked to 'Write a set of directions for a younger student, explaining how to add 2/3 and 1/3.  Then use a picture and write an explanation as to why you add fractions the way you do.'  The idea was to encourage children to think and communicate mathematically, a skill that was encouraged by having students write in journals and creating mathematical artwork."<SUP>26</SUP> Flash cards and multiplication tables were out.  For the first time, students were permitted to use calculators.<P>

And teachers stopped teaching.  A teachers' guide for one fourth grade math text admonished instructors to step back and let students lead discussions.  "Your job is . . . not to judge the rightness or wrongness of each student's answer.  Let those determinations come from the class. . . .  Avoid showing any verbal or nonverbal signs of approval and ask, 'Does everybody agree?'"<SUP>27</SUP><P>

According to Wayne Bishop, professor of mathematics at California State University, Los Angeles and a member of the State Superintendent's Math Task Force, this "new, new math" departed too far from the rudiments of math in favor of this "dynamic" approach.  "There has been far too much support for curricula and instructional techniques that are perceived as being in harmony with the California Framework . . . and the NCTM [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics] Standards, given that there is almost no statistical data that has been confirmed as valid and reliable in support.  In fact, considerable contrary data, such as the Oklahoma City study or the Japanese avoidance of calculator use in elementary school, is simply ignored because the results do not agree with the philosophical underpinnings of the current [math] reform movement."<SUP>28</SUP><P>

On the whole, impact of the frameworks has been mixed.  Younger students have clearly fared worse than older students who had a chance to learn basic skills under the pre-1987 frameworks.  The 1991 NAEP found that California's students ranked in the bottom third of participating states in mathematics.  And, Sykes notes, "only one in 12 eighth graders was capable of working the problem" asking them to explain how to add two fractions.<SUP>29</SUP><P>

In 1992, NAEP reported similarly bad news in reading: their report found California's eighth graders tied for last with their classmates in Louisiana--a result that was repeated two years later, which made big news in the spring of 1995.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CLAS Dismissed</B></FONT><P>

California's own assessments were a mixed bag.  In 1990, the education department reported that CAP scores in reading and writing dropped for the third consecutive year for third graders, who were the first group exposed to the new language-arts frameworks.  Sixth grade scores also fell.  Math scores for those grades did improve, however, and eighth grade scores improved slightly across the board.<SUP>30</SUP>  Yet from 1986 to 1991, the average eighth grade reading score increased 14 points to 257; math scores increased 18 points to 271; history/social science scores increased 17 points to 260; and science scores increased 19 points to 269.<P>

Overall, the CAP scores were a mess.  They were difficult to gauge due to wide disparities among the grades, and on the decline among younger students.  The modest gains of 1986-87 were overshadowed by the beginning of the new decade, as more reports were released showing students' performance was slipping.  So in 1991, education leaders decided that the old test was not authentic.<P>

"Authentic" (or "performance-based") assessment is the kissing cousin of outcome-based education and a typical phrase educators use in conjunction with standards.  According to conventional wisdom, multiple choice tests do not give an accurate portrait of what a student can and cannot do in a particular subject.  Authentic assessment purports to do away with the pitfalls of the old multiple choice tests by making students demonstrate what they know.  The technique "directly measures actual performance in a subject area," according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing.  "Standardized multiple choice tests, on the other hand, measure test-taking skills directly and everything else either indirectly or not at all."  There is some truth to this, although many education experts still maintain that multiple choice tests can be "authentic" if the questions are detailed enough, and require students to perform several complex tasks.<SUP>31</SUP>  Like OBE, "performance-based" assessment was decorated in conservative garb and sold as a way to hold schools and teachers accountable.<P>

Specific authentic assessment techniques include: "written products, solutions to problems, experiments, exhibitions, performances, portfolios of work and teacher observations, checklists and inventories, and cooperative group projects.  These assessments may evaluate regular classroom activity or take the form of tests or special projects."<SUP>32</SUP><P>

A new, performance-based test--the California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS--was developed in cooperation with Governor Wilson, Honig, and State Senator Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  According to Honig, the goal was to develop techniques to teach students to analyze, evaluate, understand and explain what they were learning.  The new test, he said, would test "what students know, not how well they can guess."  Wilson wanted numbers: "individual student scores so parents can track how their children stack up, and so teachers can be evaluated by how well their charges do."<SUP>33</SUP>  The State Legislature in 1991 passed a bill sponsored by State Senator Gary Hart authorizing the creation of the new tests.  CLAS was first administered in Fall 1992.<P>

What eventually happened with the CLAS test is fairly well known, although the finer details may have been lost in the media circus that surrounded it.  The 1994 controversy surrounding the CLAS test was, at bottom, a challenge to the legitimacy of outcome or performance-based assessment.  What had originally been an attempt by conservative reformers to turn the focus in education from the historical measurement of inputs (i.e., spending, class time, etc.), to an objective measure of accountability (e.g., can the student find the square root of 81 or diagram a sentence?) was contorted by the educationists into a mainly political and social agenda.<P>

CLAS, described as "manifestly unworthy" by no less than the State Auditor General, was an "outcomes-based" debacle of the highest order.  Students were graded 85 percent on what they expressed, and 15 percent on how they expressed it.  And it was anything but standardized.  In 1994, there were about 97 versions of the test in circulation.  Much of CLAS spurned traditional literature in favor of contemporary, politically-correct writing.<P>

The press heralded CLAS as a way of making students really show what they know.  Writing in the <I>Sacramento Bee</I> shortly before Governor Wilson signed the CLAS legislation in 1991, Peter Schrag gushed:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"[CLAS] would ask them to solve real problems, giving elementary school students, for example, some simple equipment--a battery, a couple of wires, a light bulb--and ask them to create a circuit that lights the bulb, then draw a diagram to show what they did.  It would demand more writing.  It would ask them to construct models.  It would require oral solutions to certain problems.  And it would lead to the creation of a 'portfolio' on each student that includes art and science projects and essays, as well as more conventional work on which each student would be evaluated."<SUP>34</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

CLAS found support early on from the California Business Roundtable and other business groups as an ideal way of measuring those oft-mentioned "critical thinking" and "higher-order" skills.  The Roundtable, unable to ignore the siren song of performance-based testing, did not back off its support of the "cleanup" legislation, even after being advised in mid-1994 that the CLAS test did not grade for punctuation, grammar, and spelling.  Nor did the union-backed legislators (including then-Assemblyman Delaine Eastin) on the education policy committees blink during hour after hour of testimony by parents, educators, and legislators questioning the details of the test.  They simply circled their wagons and voted to reauthorize the test, which was eventually vetoed by the Governor.<P>

Just what was wrong with the CLAS test?  It evaluated students more on their feeling than their analysis of a subject.  It permitted students to take certain sections of the test in groups.  It didn't require students to write complete sentences, much less complete paragraphs.  In some cases, students could draw pictures instead of write their answers.  In short, it furthered the state's policy of eschewing basic skills for so-called "problem solving" skills.  Some portions of the test bore little relationship to the subjects they were supposed to be testing, or were used to push particular agendas.  For example, a fourth grade science question asked: "When trash leaves your home, where do you think it goes?"<SUP>35</SUP>

The literature portion of the test provoked the most controversy.  It was there that the state, asking students questions relating to their personal beliefs about religion, politics, and family, stepped over the line.  Examples abound:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A fourth grade literature question presented a short biography of Civil Rights-era icon Rosa Parks and asked students to "discuss your thoughts," draw posters, and explain how the story related to their lives.<SUP>36</SUP>
 
<LI>A prototype fourth grade literature section included a story about discrimination against Chinese immigrant laborers in California during the 19th century.  Students were again asked to write their thoughts and feelings about the story, and to discuss their own experiences with discrimination.  Another question asked what kind of problems teenagers have with their parents.<SUP>37</SUP> That particular question was fiercely denounced by parents and some civil libertarians as invasive and psychological in nature, and therefore in violation of state laws prohibiting schools from administering psychological tests without permission.
 
<LI>Tenth graders were asked to read an excerpt from "Roselily," a short story by <I>Color Purple</I> author Alice Walker about a black unmarried mother who is about to wed a Muslim man.  Parents objected to a number of passages, including: ". . . She cannot always be a bride and a virgin, wearing robes and veil.  Even now her body itches to be free of satin and voile. . . .  She wonders what it will be like.  Not to have to go to a job.  Not to work in a sewing plant.  Her place will be in the home, he has said, repeatedly, promising her rest she has prayed for.  But now she wonders.  When she has rested, what will she do?  They will make babies--she thinks practically about her fine brown body, his strong black one.  They will be inevitable.  Her hands will be full.  Full of what?  Babies.  She is not comforted."  At one point, the groom declares that Christians believe in "the wrong God."  Parents criticized the story and the accompanying questions because they "emphasized emotion, not intellect."  Some parents and education critics said the story was anti-Christian and anti-clergy.  In response to the public outcry, the education department removed the passage from the 1994 test.<SUP>38</SUP>
 
<LI>One of the more controversial passages students were asked to analyze appeared in a story entitled, "Just Lather, That's All" on the tenth grade test.  The narrator of the story is a barber with homicidal thoughts.  "I could cut this throat just so--zip, zip.  I wouldn't give him the time to resist, and since he has his eyes closed he wouldn't see the glistening blade or my glistening eyes.  But I'm trembling like a real murderer.  Out of his neck a gush of blood would spout onto the sheet, on the chair, on my hands, on the floor."<SUP>39</SUP>
</UL>

For all the trendiness, the group work, the sketch drawing, the stream of consciousness writing, the pseudo-psychoanalysis--in short, the distinct lack of objective standards--students still performed poorly on the CLAS test in 1994.  Statewide, 70 percent of students tested below proficiency in reading; 60 percent were below proficiency in writing; and 80 percent were below proficiency in math.  Tenth graders fared among the worst:  86 percent of high school sophomores tested below proficiency in math.<P>

The two-year experiment cost California taxpayers $28 million.  Governor Wilson vetoed continued funding for CLAS in September 1994.<P>

Barely mentioned was the quiet release in June 1995 of the final set of scores for two pilot exams in history and science given to the state's fifth graders in May 1994.  The results demonstrated that students were not just poor readers and mathematicians, but substandard in science and ignorant of U.S. and California history, too.  Only 34 percent of fifth graders scored three or better (out of a possible six) on the CLAS history test, and 37 percent scored three or higher on the science test.<SUP>40</SUP><P>

<ALIGN=right>California Secretary of Child Development and Education, September 1991</P>

Academic standards remain, for now, in the hands of the state school superintendent, the legislature, and gubernatorial appointees.  State officials cannot shake their belief that the best answers to the problems plaguing California's schools come from the top.  But if the last decade of experimenting with state-mandated standards have proven anything, it is that top-down mandates and one-size-fits-all standards rarely work. Invariably, standards become debased by politics or infected with educationist cant. And results, in the form of standardized tests, have been mixed at best. In big city school districts like Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, they've been downright disastrous.<P>

Nineteen ninty-five may one day be seen as a watershed year for the standards movement.  It was the year that state officials began to doubt the effectiveness of the state standards project, and began talking at least about making amends.  The question remains whether the public policy that follows will be consistent with the rhetoric.<P>

State education officials have been more critical of the drift away from skills instruction, indicating a possible turn of the tide.  "It's a terrible thing to do to children," Wilson education advisor Maureen DiMarco said last year of the new "new math."  "This should be common sense.  Every time we throw out the fundamental skills we get into trouble."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

"Where we went wrong," former school superintendent Bill Honig confessed to the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>, "is that we weren't strong enough on the basic skills.  We thought teachers would continue teaching the skills, but they didn't."<SUP>42</SUP><P>

And in the wake of the double blow from CLAS and NAEP, Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked, "do we have the courage to face these results honestly and do something?"<SUP>43</SUP>  But Eastin continues to tour schools across the state touting the virtues of state-mandated standards as "something we've never tried before."<P>

Since the death of CLAS, the state Department of Education has been scrambling to find a suitable replacement.  A new standardized testing bill (AB 265) passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Wilson in October.  The new law basically creates two tests.  Students in grades two through ten will take basic skills tests that will assess their ability to read, write, and perform basic mathematical calculations.  Unlike the old CLAS test, the new skills test will grade students individually so parents can have some idea how their children are progressing.<P>

In addition, fourth, fifth, eighth, and tenth graders will take a statewide exam that includes more in-depth questions that assess basic skills as well as students' ability to apply those skills in reading, writing, math, science and history--presumably what the CLAS test was supposed to do.<P>

Legislators attempted to address many of the objections to the CLAS test in the new legislation.  On the new exam, questions that probe into a student's personal beliefs or practices in sex, family life, morality or religion are strictly prohibited.  Legislators also included an opt-out clause, so parents may choose whether or not their children take the test.<SUP>44</SUP><P>

The problem with the new law is that, like CLAS, it establishes a statewide assessment but fails to create standards prior to the development of the tests. Unless there is supplemental legislation which clearly removes the cart from in front of the horse, the adage "testing drives curriculum" will continue to dominate schools in the state.<P>

Similarly, the state will continue to reform its curriculum frameworks, but the impact will not be seen most likely for several years until new teachers are trained and new textbooks are issued that reflect the changes.  The California Reading Task Force's report called for sweeping changes, particularly a more "balanced" approach to reading instruction that gives intensive systematic phonics its due.  The task force also recommended ongoing assessment of students' reading skills, early intervention programs, more books for school libraries, limiting class sizes, new training, and new books.  That raises serious questions about how this can be done and where the state will find the money to pay for it all.<P>

But there also appears to be resistance within elements of the bureaucracy itself.  A week after the task force issued its findings, the English Language Arts and English as a Second Language Textbook Adoption Committee held its "Invitation to Submit" meeting, at which it was made clear that until the legislature says otherwise, the task force's recommendations were just that.  "The Reading Task Force has no impact on the evaluation of adoption," said committee member Glen Thomas.  "The [old] K-8 Instructional Resources Evaluation Form is what publishers need to be concerned with." Another committee member, Dennis Parker, was more blunt: "Balance does not mean 50-50."<P>

National standards will continue to overshadow California.  The prospect of  California having to comply with top-down standards set at the federal level is very real as long as the state receives Goals 2000 grants.  Although U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley insists that the program contains "zero regulations," there are a number of thinly-disguised federal mandates.  In addition to mandating "voluntary" standards, the law imposes onerous spending requirements, issues federal "skills" certificates, and ultimately shifts the educational agenda from the states to the federal government.<P>

Goals 2000 will drive national standards, not only because of its mandates regarding curriculum and assessments but also because of the revolving door that exists between various elements of government bureaucracy and vested interest groups, as well as individual education "experts."  Even the <I>de facto</I> standards in textbooks and standard assessments seem preferable to allowing the long arm of contemporary government such an "up close and personal" entry into the lives of youth.<P>

School-To-Work is among the latest Goals 2000-related federal programs to usurp state autonomy and again divert the standards question away from academics and on to more vocational skills.  Congress debated and passed the School-To-Work Opportunity Act in conjunction with Goals 2000 in 1994. The law was reauthorized in 1995. Designed ostensibly to create an internationally competitive workforce, federal School-To-Work legislation creates a National Skills Standards Board to evaluate and certify the skills of potential employees.  School-To-Work enjoys widespread support among business leaders, who spend millions each year retraining poorly educated graduates. But two objections emerge: first, students who do not receive skills certificates, for whatever reason (including non-participation in the program) will be put at a competitive disadvantage; and second, the reemphasize on work skills could represent a return to the non-academic standards which dominated the curriculum in the early 1980s, when students graduated high school with courses in shop, home economics, and food.<P>

Also, California is one of 17 states involved in the New Standards Project which has continued to forge ahead in spite of the intense criticism surrounding the development of national standards.  In drafting content and performance standards, the project reviews the national standards as they emerge from federally and privately financed panels as well as those being developed in partner states.  The State Legislature budgeted $500,000 in membership dues for California's continued participation in the project.  It is not clear how, or if, this effort will mesh with the work of the new 21-member state Standards Commission, whose members are to be appointed by the Governor and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, under AB 265. The State Senate is at work on follow-up legislation, SB 430, which will clarify who will appoint the commission, and how the commission will operate. The new legislation also includes an amendment requiring any new assessment system be based explicitly on the standards that come out of the commission. <P>

Knowing the penchant of education officials to hijack valid concepts and reshape them into self-serving mandates and regulations, initiating reform aimed at higher academic standards is like walking the razor's edge.  Even so, it is a journey that must be attempted.<P>

Americans across the political spectrum strongly and consistently support higher standards, even when they know the possible negative consequences for students' "self-esteem."  A recent report by the liberal Public Agenda Foundation, "Assignment Incomplete: The Unfinished Business of School Reform," indicates that testing, withholding diplomas, toughening grading, and establishing clear guidelines for what students should learn were viewed as positive actions among the general public.<SUP>45</SUP><P>

To succeed, the journey must achieve greater participation by local communities and parents.  California's schools cannot afford to continue along their present course of state-mandated standards, steeped in non-academic subject matter and untried educationist theories about critical thinking and self esteem.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RECOMMENDATIONS</B></FONT><P>

<B>For Parents:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Inquire whether schools and districts have a "basics first" philosophy.  Don't just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Demand academic excellence. 
 
<LI>Determine whether schools implement a systematic phonics approach to reading. Obtain the State Reading Taskforce's report, <I>Every Child A Reader</I>, available 
from State Superintendent Delaine Eastin's office. Bill Honig's criticism of whole language and his conversion to the merits of skills instruction is detailed in <I>How Should We Teach Our Children To Read? The Role of Skills in a Comprehensive Reading Program: A Balanced Approach </I>(Far West Laboratory for Education Research and Development, San Francisco).  Though Honig tries to please everyone, he offers a devastating critique of the "two myths of whole language," and demonstrates why phonics is essential to a good reading curriculum.  The Virginia-based National Right to Read Foundation is a clearinghouse of information on phonics and whole language.<SUP>46</SUP>
 
<LI>Monitor homework and/or classroom assignments, particularly essays, for an academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus.
 
<LI>Consider home use of E. D. Hirsch, Jr.'s <I>Core Knowledge Series: What Your First-Sixth Grader Needs to Know</I>, published by Core Publications, Inc.  The content builds on prior foundations of information through a grade by grade sequence of specific guidelines in history, geography, mathematics, science, language arts, and the fine arts. Also excellent are William J. Bennett's <I>The Book of Virtues</I> and <I>The Moral Compass</I>, both published by Simon and Schuster.
</UL>

<B>For Districts:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Review current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence, and measurability. Get back to basics by writing new standards which eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. 
 
<LI>Re-examine collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions which may interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 
 
<LI>Require principals and curriculum planners to read the book, <I>World Class Schools: New Standards for Education</I>, by Donald M. Chalker and Richard M. Haynes, based on 10 international school systems.
 
<LI>Read and apply former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch's book, <I>National Standards in American Education: A Citizen's Guide</I> (Brookings Institution, 1995). This is a good primer on the standards movement and the importance of skills.  The American Federation of Teachers recently published "Making Standards Matter: A 50 State Report on Efforts to Raise Academic Standards," which argues that high standards offer an opportunity for the public schools to turn themselves around and regain public confidence.  Also, see the recently released report, "What Secondary Students are Expected to Know: Gateway Exam Taken by Average-Achieving Students in France, Germany, and Scotland."  The U.S. Department of Education published in the 1980s an acclaimed series of pamphlets entitled <I>What Works</I>, focusing on all elements of curriculum and schooling. Though the series is long out of print, it may still be found through ERIC.
</UL>

<B>For California's State Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>A new statewide assessment model is a <I>fait accompli</I>. In the past, assessment drove curriculum and quality suffered. With that in mind, the Legislature should eliminate the current curriculum frameworks and mandate the development of a basic statewide model for standards prior to the development of the new assessment system, which will not be completed until at least 1998.
 
<LI>The Legislature should enact legislation adding 30 public members to the Governor's Standards Commission to ensure a cross section of community and parental participation in the development of standards.  Specified appointments from both houses should be required to guarantee extensive parental representation on the Commission.
 
<LI>The Governor and the Legislature should work to streamline the textbook adoption process and place greater authority with districts as much as is possible within the constitutional restrictions of the textbook adoption program.
 
<LI>The California State University should be supported in its attempt to eliminate remedial courses within its system.  The sending districts should be required to pay for remediation of its high school graduates.
 
<LI>The Legislature should pass legislation eliminating teacher tenure and revamping teacher education in the state's universities.  Prospective elementary school teachers need to be trained in intensive systematic phonics instruction.  Recent surveys indicate the general public supports these reforms, as well as merit pay.
</UL>

<B>For the Federal Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>The quality of American education is not dependent on the existence of a federal bureaucracy. Congress should pass H.R. 1883, which eliminates the Department of Education and returns authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, and states in the form of block grants. Programs are transferred to other departments under this proposal, called the "Back to Basics Education Reform Act."  
 
<LI>Congress should avoid the proposed combining of the departments of Education and Labor. Instead, we should consolidate job training programs into one or more block grants and place them under the jurisdiction of the Labor Department.
 
<LI>Congress should repeal provisions of the Improve America's Schools Act requiring states to send plans for state standards and curriculum to the federal government.  Furthermore, it should preserve local and state authority over expenditures by repealing the "opportunity to learn" standards in Goals 2000/IASA which potentially subject states to judicial rulings.
</UL>

The experience of California shows that only with these reforms can real education standards, higher expectations for students, and accountability for teachers be realized.  To go beyond the mantra of standards, it is vital to have parents, teachers, and, yes, politicians involved in this effort.  But educating students for the 21st century requires these measures sooner rather than later.<P>

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
Few topics in recent years have inflamed parents and grassroots
education activists as the Clinton administration's Goals 2000:
Educate America Act, passed in 1994.  Although the law's supporters
contend that Goals 2000 is merely a helpful attempt to increase
academic standards in K-12 education, the authors of this study
find that in any common sensical reading of the law, power is
transferred from state and local education authorities to the
federal bureaucracy in Washington.
<P>
The law makes mandatory a wide variety of federal dictates, controls
education's purse strings, requires national standards, issues
federal &quot;skill certificates,&quot; imposes new regulations,
and manipulates state and local assessments.  In so doing, Goals
2000 radically alters the education decisionmaking landscape by
centralizing policymaking at the federal level, leaving the states
and localities to carry out Washington's dictates.
<P>
The major findings of this study include:
<UL>
<LI>Drafters of the Goals 2000 law use the command &quot;will&quot;
over forty times in describing what the federal government expects
states and local districts to do to accomplish the Act's eight
national goals.  The more permissive &quot;should&quot; is used
only three times.
</UL>


<P>
*This paper is co-published with The Pacific Research Institute
for Public Policy, San Francisco, California.
<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a wide variety of bureaucracies (e.g.,
the National Goals Panel, regional education laboratories, federal
education research institutes, etc.) which are endowed with wide
&quot;advocacy&quot; powers in order to get states and localities
to implement the national goals and objectives contained in the
Act.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Once a state accepts federal Goals 2000 money, it must implement
the national goals and objectives of Goals 2000.  According to
the Act, any state that applies for Goals 2000 funding must devise
a state improvement plan that incorporates &quot;strategies for
meeting the National Education Goals.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Through its control of the purse, the federal government will
increase its influence over school curricula.  Washington explicitly
recommends that states include &quot;gender equitable and multicultural
materials&quot; in its improvement strategies.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 tells states how to cut their education pie and
in some cases even dictates the size of the pie (the level of
spending) and mandates what social services schools are to provide
on campus.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a National Skills Standards Board that
will endorse a broad spectrum of skills standards to be considered
by business and employers when hiring.  The related School-to-Work
law strongly encourages states to issue &quot;skill certificates&quot;
to students who supposedly have met the skills standards promulgated
by the National Skills Standards Board.  Schools and students
who refuse to participate in the skill-certificate program will
be at a disadvantage in the job market.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Even though compliance with Goals 2000 is &quot;voluntary&quot;
for states, the law holds disadvantaged children hostage to its
dictates.  Goals 2000 requires states that receive federal money
under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA) to align
state assessments, curriculum, and professional teacher development
programs with the standards contained in the Goals 2000 law. 
California is slated to receive more than $1 billion in IASA money
in 1995-96; two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 may impose radical and untried ideas on most of
the nation, but its objectives are already mirrored in California's
subject frameworks and its statewide assessment (both the defunct
CLAS test and the proposed new assessment).  In other words, California
has &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  Since student performance
in California has continued to fall under these frameworks, we
can expect no improvement if California decides to participate
in Goals 2000.
</UL>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;We seek to support and encourage; we do not dictate or
determine local or </I>
<P>
<I>state policy.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Richard Riley</I>
<P>
<I>U.S. Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;In the future, because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage
to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. . . federal regulation
may extend much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught,
the conditions in which it is taught, and how </I>
<P>
<I>it is tested.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Diane Ravitch</I>
<P>
<I>former Assistant Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
In 1989, the nation's governors met with President Bush and issued
a list of six education goals that they wanted America to achieve
by the year 2000.  Then-governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton was
a big proponent of this goal-setting process, which combined national
leadership with state innovation and flexibility.  There were
no federal dollars involved, and no new federal bureaucracy was
created to administer it.  It was a state-centered program pledged
to broad national goals, with the key role of policy development
left to the governors of the fifty states.
<P>
But once Clinton moved from the statehouse to the White House,
he abandoned this state-centered program.  Instead of a <I>national
</I>program of statehouse leadership, it became a <I>federal government
</I>initiative-a distinction that has been lost or forgotten by
many of the governors who had joined the Bush initiative.  The
original six goals were expanded to eight by Clinton and his new
Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, and the eight goals were
tied to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, which channels billions of dollars to local school districts.
<P>
Why has Goals 2000 become controversial?  After all, what could
be wrong with wanting American students to be number one in the
world in math and science?  Or wanting every American adult to
be literate?  Or wanting to increase parental involvement?
<P>
The answer, of course, is that there is nothing wrong with desiring
these and some of the other laudable goals contained in the Goals
2000 law.  However, as with many worthwhile objectives, the means
to the ends are just as important as the ends themselves.  And
in the case of Goals 2000, the means contained in the law's more
than 150 pages of fine print should give great pause to anyone
who takes seriously the notion of state and local control of education.
<P>
This paper, a joint publication of the Pacific Research Institute
and the Claremont Institute, examines the fine print in Goals
2000 and focuses on how this law will affect California's public
education system-and by inference, the public school systems in
other states.  Although the law has been seen by many as helpful
at best and innocuous at worst, the authors of this study find
that Goals 2000 threatens to dominate and control its subject
area and concentrate decision-making power in a few unelected
officials in Washington.  For this reason, it is fair to call
it &quot;devolution in retreat,&quot; a step backward to greater
centralization of authority, not forward to more state and local
responsibility.  As such, it is a piece of warmed-over 1970s legislation,
not a progressive step into the 21st Century.
<P>
<B>MECHANISMS OF FEDERAL CONTROL</B>
<P>
Congress and the Clinton administration were well aware of the
suspicion that had grown in many quarters regarding Goals 2000's
potential for federal usurpation of educational decision-making
authority.  The Goals 2000 law, therefore, specifically cites
past laws enacted by Congress that reserves responsibility for
education to the states and local school systems.  Section 319
of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (hereafter &quot;the Act&quot;)
notes:
<P>
Public Law 96-88 specified that the establishment of the Department
of Education shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government
over education or diminish the responsibility for education which
is reserved to the States and local school systems and other instrumentalities
of the States<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This statement is more than a little disingenuous, however, since
everyone knows that the vast array of federal programs that funnel
federal tax dollars to the states all come with strings and conditions
that increase Washington's control over what goes on at local
levels.  For example, many public schools in low-income areas
must ensure that their actions conform to Washington's requirements
if they are to receive the millions of federal dollars earmarked
for disadvantaged children.
<P>
Still, the Act maintains that:
<P>
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize an officer
or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control
a State, local educational agency, or school's curriculum, program
of instruction, or allocation of State or local resources or mandate
a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur
any costs not paid for under this Act.
<P>
Viewed in isolation, this provision seems to preclude the type
of federal intrusion that has become all too familiar over the
last thirty years.  Unfortunately, the Act is laden with terminology,
programs and incentives that clearly contradict this supposed
respect for the autonomy of states and local jurisdictions.
<P>
In Title I, which lays out the eight national education goals
and the thirty-five objectives listed under the goals, there is
a troubling pattern of word usage that indicates a greater willingness
by the federal government to impose its will than it would have
the public believe.<FONT SIZE=2>  Although the Clinton administration
emphasizes the voluntary nature of the goals, the Act uses the
command &quot;will&quot; at least forty-five times in describing
what the federal government expects states, localities, and individuals
to do to accomplish the various goals.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, one finds dictates such as:
<P>
All children <B>will have</B> access to high-quality and developmentally
appropriate preschool programs. . . .
<P>
Parents<B> will have</B> access to the training and support parents
need.
<P>
Children<B> will receive</B> the nutrition, physical activity,
experiences, and health care needed to arrive at school with healthy
minds and bodies. . . .
<P>
All students <B>will be</B> knowledgeable about the diverse cultural
heritage of this Nation. . . .
<P>
All teachers <B>will have</B> access to preservice teacher education
and continuing professional development activities. . . .
<P>
States and school districts <B>will create</B> integrated strategies
to attract, recruit, prepare, retrain, and support the continued
professional development of teachers, administrators, and other
educators. . . .
<P>
Schools, in implementing comprehensive parent involvement programs,
<B>will offer</B> more adult literacy, parent training and life-long
learning opportunities. . . .
<P>
Every local educational agency <B>will develop</B> a sequential,
comprehensive kindergarten through twelfth grade drug and alcohol
prevention education 
<P>
program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .  (Emphases added.)</FONT>
<P>
What are the meanings of phrases such as &quot;will have access
to,&quot; &quot;will offer,&quot; &quot;will develop,&quot; and
&quot;will create&quot;?  Do they not mean that states and local
school districts have an obligation to create a plethora of new
programs to fulfill the imperatives of the Act?
<P>
It is obvious that the use of the command &quot;will&quot; was
deliberate.  In Title I, the permissive word &quot;should&quot;
is used as well, but only three times.  Thus, for example:
<P>
Community-based teams <B>should be</B> <B>organized</B> to provide
students and teachers with needed support.
<P>
Every school<B> should work</B> to eliminate sexual harassment.
 (Emphases added.)
<P>
Why the difference?  One expert on legal drafting observes that
the word &quot;will&quot; not only expresses a future contingency,
but also, &quot;when the relationship is a delicate one, expresses
both parties' obligations.&quot;.<FONT SIZE=2>  Under such a definition
of &quot;will,&quot; the states could find themselves forced to
implement the goals' many objectives (especially if, as will be
discussed later, the states decide to accept the federal funding
attached to the Act).</FONT>
<P>
A principal problem that arises from such usage is judicial interpretation
in future court cases.  Recent judicial history is replete with
examples of courts making critical changes in public policy through
loose interpretations of the words in laws.  The word &quot;will&quot;
is not permissive; it is a mandate to do a specific thing, and
federal courts will likely interpret it that way.
<P>
<B>New Bureaucracies</B>
<P>
Another concern is the various federal entities that are created
under the Act.  For instance, the National Education Goals Panel
is empowered to report progress that the states and the nation
are making toward achieving the goals of the Act.  Among the Goals
Panel's duties is to &quot;identify actions that should be taken
by Federal, State, and local governments to enhance progress toward
achieving the National Education Goals and to provide all students
with a fair opportunity to learn.&quot;  Although states and local
jurisdictions may decide to ignore the identified actions, as
we discuss in the following section on the federal &quot;purse,&quot;
resisting federal &quot;advice&quot; will not be as easy as it
may seem.
<P>
The Goals Panel is also charged with an advocacy mission:
<P>
The Goals panel shall help build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus
for the reforms necessary to achieve the National Education Goals<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Statements by Colorado Governor Roy Romer, an active supporter
of Goals 2000, demonstrate what type of advocacy one can expect
from the Goals Panel and its bureaucratic subgroups.  According
to Romer, Goals 2000 is in trouble because &quot;parents and voters
oppose the scheme.&quot;  In view of this skepticism on the part
of the public, Romer is encouraging the Goals Panel's subgroups
to work with business executives and state legislators who have
been resistant to Goals 2000.  In other words, if local leaders
aren't showing the proper enthusiasm, they must be educated and
propagandized until they come around.  The federal goals will
drive local reforms, not the other way around.
<P>
The Act also creates Resource and Technical Planning Groups on
School Readiness.  A primary duty of these Groups is to &quot;create
clear guidelines regarding the nature, functions, and uses of
early childhood assessments, including assessment formats that
are appropriate for use in culturally and linguistically diverse
communities, based on model elements of school readiness.&quot;<FONT SIZE=2>
 What is the force of these guidelines?  Will the federal government
determine the validity of assessments in areas such as bilingualism?
 Even though the Planning Groups are supposed to operate in an
advisory capacity, in California their guidelines could have a
disproportionate impact on the state's assessment programs.  The
assessment debate in California continues to rage after last year's
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) debacle, leaving
an open field for federal influence. </FONT>
<P>
A major body created by the Act, the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), which is charged with overseeing
the creation of the voluntary national content and student performance
standards, is currently the target of defunding moves in Congress.
 Although still not officially dead, the NESIC will not be a factor
for some time, if at all (at present, no nominations have been
put forward for any Council member positions).  It should be remembered,
however, that the NESIC's possible demise does not eliminate the
national standards themselves, or the fact that states receiving
federal funds will have to meet those standards.
<P>
The Act also creates a number of federal research institutes.
 The problem with these institutes is that the mission outlined
for them in the Act contains provisions that would turn them into
advocacy organizations.  For example, the National Institute on
Student Achievement, Curriculum and Assessment (NISACA)<B> </B>is
charged with, among other things, identifying:
<P>
(viii) the impact and effectiveness of Federal, State, and local
efforts to provide gender-fair educational opportunities to elementary
and secondary students;
<P>
(ix) programs, policies, and approaches which promote gender equity
in elementary and secondary education.
<P>
Given this charter, what would the Institute have to say about
recent efforts by African-American parents to create single-sex
schools, which have been shown to improve the achievement and
discipline of children, especially male children, in that community?
 It is hard to imagine that such innovations would be able to
receive a fair hearing and analysis.
<P>
Another group of bureaucracies created by the Act, which have
so far received little attention, are the &quot;regional educational
laboratories.&quot;  Under Section 941(h) of the Act, the United
States would be divided up into regions each having a regional
educational laboratory.  States participating in Goals 2000 must
give their consent to the formation of these laboratories through
their chief state school officials and their state boards of education.
 The mission of the labs is to promote reform efforts.  The labs
are supposed to be, among other things, a resource for schools
within the region.
<P>
Although the regional labs may prove to be innocuous, they are
simply another layer of bureaucracy that have the potential to
impose their will on local schools.  The regional labs will be
governed by an unelected, appointed board made up of various state
officials and special interest representatives.  Among its main
duties, the board:
<P>
Directs the regional educational laboratory to carry out the laboratory's
duties in a manner as will make progress toward achieving the
National Education Goals and reforming schools and education systems.
<P>
Like the Goals Panel and the research institutes, the board and
the labs are given an advocacy mission.
<P>
Potentially more damaging to local control of schools is the labs'
stated duty to:
<P>
Facilitate school restructuring at the individual school level,
including technical assistance for adapting model demonstration
grant programs to each school<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This duty is much more interventionist than simply supplying educational
research to state and local school agencies.  Furthermore, &quot;restructuring&quot;
has become a buzz word in many education circles for changing
school curricula and school governance and for promoting the controversial
principles of outcome-based education.  The fact that unelected
bureaucratic entities such as the regional educational labs have,
as a primary duty, the facilitation of this controversial concept
at the school site level is an open invitation to unwanted federally-sponsored
meddling into local decision-making. 
<P>
<B>Federal Requirements Come with the Money</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most pernicious instrument of federal control of state
and local education policy is the additional federal funding that
is made available by the Goals 2000 Act.  Under Title III of the
Act, $400 million was authorized for fiscal year 1994-95 for the
purpose of allowing the federal government to make allotments
to the states.  In order for states to receive this funding they
must, unsurprisingly, meet a number of requirements contained
in the Act.
<P>
What are those requirements?  According to Section 306 of the
Act, &quot;any State educational agency that wishes to receive
an allotment under [Title III] after its first year of participation
shall develop and implement a State improvement plan for the improvement
of elementary and secondary education in the State.<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;
 In turn, the required state improvement plan must itself meet
an important requirement:</FONT>
<P>
Each State educational agency, with broad-based classroom teacher
input, shall establish and include in its State improvement plan
strategies for meeting the National Education Goals by improving
teaching and learning and students' mastery of basic and advanced
skills. . <FONT SIZE=2>. .</FONT>
<P>
In order for the states to get the Goals 2000 money, they must
adhere to the goals, objectives and standards laid out by the
Act.  The minute any state decides to accept any part of the Goals
2000 largesse, the supposedly &quot;voluntary&quot; goals become
mandatory.
<P>
But this is not all.  The Act not only requires that states abide
by its goals, it also lists the strategies that they must follow
in order to meet the goals.  Alarmingly, these required strategies
open the door to radical policy-meddling by federal officials.
 For example, a state strategy must include:
<P>
A process for aligning State or local curricula, instructional
materials, and State assessments with the State content standards
and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The trouble is that under Goals 2000, state content and student
performance standards are heavily influenced by the federal government.
 (This influence is explained in detail below.)  The federal government
will therefore have a heavy influence on the curricula, books
and tests of local schools.
<P>
What kinds of books and materials does the federal government
wish to promote?  Again, the Act explicitly recommends that state
strategies include:
<P>
A process for developing, selecting, or recommending instructional
materials, including gender equitable and multicultural materials,
and technology to support and assist local educational agencies
and schools to provide all students the opportunity to meet State
content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Gender-equity and multiculturalist textbooks and materials have
caused extreme controversy and division among parents and state
and local school officials.  Many of these works are infused with
anti-male and anti-Western biases, and often rely more on polemics
than on objective scholarship.  Yet this is the type of instructional
material that Washington singles out for inclusion in state strategies.
<P>
Further, the Act seeks to affect the exact ways in which states
divide their education budget pie.  The Act recommends that strategies
include:
<P>
Assessing the effectiveness and equity of the school finance program
of the State to identify disparities in the resources available
to each local educational agency and school in such State and
how such disparities affect the ability of the State educational
agency and local educational agencies to develop and implement
plans under [Title III<FONT SIZE=2>].</FONT>
<P>
In view of provisions such as this, the Act's pretense of not
directing how a state or locality allocates its resources is no
more than empty rhetoric.
<P>
A good example of the gap between a good goal and bad means can
be found in the Act's standards regarding parental and community
involvement.  On the positive side, the Act requires that:
<P>
Each State improvement plan shall describe strategies for how
the State educational agency will involve parents and other community
representatives in planning, designing, and implementing the State
improvement plan. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The strategy described by the Act as a way to achieve parental
and community involvement raises very serious questions.  The
Act envisions a strategy which will result in:
<P>
Increasing the access of all students to social services, health
care, nutrition, related services, and child care services, and
locating such services in schools, cooperating service agencies,
community-based centers, or other convenient sites designed to
provide &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for parents and students<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
To what social services must the state and local jurisdictions
provide &quot;access&quot; to?  What types of health care services?
 Perhaps those &quot;reproductive services&quot; advocated by
former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders?  And what types of child
care services?  And how appropriate is it to locate these services
on school campuses?  Is this not another example of schools taking
on new roles that divert it from its primary mission-to teach?
<P>
<B>Carrots and Sticks: Federal Approval of State Plans and Strategies</B>
<P>
Although Goals 2000 advocates in California downplay the mandatory
nature of the state improvement plans and the strategies required
to implement them, there is no getting around the fact that under
Section 307 of the Act, it is the federal Secretary of Education
who has approval power over a state's application for funding
under the Act.  More important, after the first year of funding,
the Secretary will approve further funding only if he has approved
the state improvement plan and has determined &quot;that the State
has made substantial progress in developing its State improvement
plan and will implement such plan not later than the end of the
second year of participation.&quot;
<P>
This process raises important questions, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Does the state's improvement plan and accompanying strategies
include gender equitable and multicultural textbooks?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Does it include an &quot;equitable&quot; distribution (at
least in Washington's eyes) of state education budget dollars?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are large numbers of social services, including perhaps even
reproductive services, available to the state's children?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Has the state included in its plan and strategies ways to
implement the thirty-five objectives listed under the eight national
goals?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The answers to such questions could determine whether the federal
Secretary decides to bestow a Goals 2000 grant on a state.  In
other words, the federal Secretary has significant discretionary
power to accept or reject a state's application based on the state's
adherence to Washington's policies.  Given that states have historically
accepted federal dictates that translate to more dollars in their
budgets, there will be powerful and irresistible pressure on states
to conform to federal education policies.
<P>
It is not just the Secretary's power to approve a state's improvement
plan that gives his agency carrot-and-stick leverage.  According
to Section 317 of the Act, the Secretary of Education can award
technology grants to states that, as part of their state improvement
plans, include:
<P>
[A] systemic statewide plan to increase the use of state-of-the-art
technologies that enhance elementary and secondary student learning
and staff development in support of the National Education Goals
and State content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Again, behind the promise of money is the requirement that the
federal goals be promoted.  It is also instructive to note that
the Act dictates how the states allocate the funds they receive
under its auspices.  After the first year of funding, at least
ninety percent of a state's allotment must be used either to fund
the state improvement plan at the local level or &quot;to improve
educator preservice programs and for professional development
activities that are consistent with the State improvement plan<FONT SIZE=2>.&quot;
 The remaining ten percent or less can be used for state activities
such as promoting public magnet and charter schools; supporting
contracting with private management organizations to reform schools;
and supporting violence-reduction programs in schools.  In essence,
teachers are given access to the vast majority of the Act's funds,
but supporters of cutting-edge reforms such as charter schools
and private contracting have access to only a tiny fraction of
these funds.</FONT>
<P>
Even supporters of Goals 2000 admit that there are potential control
problems if states decide to take the Act's funding.  California's
state Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), which supports California's
participation in the Act, nevertheless warns that &quot;Taking
advantage of the federal framework is not risk-free. . . .&quot;
 The LAO realizes that the voluntary nature of the Act is more
illusion than reality:
<P>
The state would always be able to opt out of Goals 2000 if it
appeared federal policy making was interfering with state or local
authority.  (Of course, California would also have to relinquish
the federal funds provided under Goals 2000, which would not be
easy.)
<P>
The amount of money California has received under the Act has
been modest thus far.  In 1994-1995, California was allocated
$10 million.  For 1995-1996, however, California is to receive
$42 million.  After that, the amount increases even more dramatically.
 How easy will it be for the state to withdraw after local districts
become dependent on this money?  And remember, only the state
has this option; California's 1,002 districts will have no such
option.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND THE FEDERAL SCHOOL-TO-WORK LAW</B>
<P>
Usurping local decision-making power is just one troubling aspect
of the Goals 2000 Act.  Equally disturbing is the Act's intrusion
into the private labor market.  Under the Act, a<B> </B>National
Skill Standards Board is established, the purpose of which is:
<P>
. . . to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and
adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and
of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards.
<P>
Why the need for &quot;skill standards&quot;?  According to the
Act, the standards, assessment, and certification are to be used:
<P>
(A) by the Nation, to ensure the development of a high skills,
high quality, high performance workforce, including the most skilled
front-line workforce in the world;
<P>
(B) by industries, as a vehicle for informing training providers
and prospective employees of skills necessary for employment;
<P>
(C) by employers, to assist in evaluating the skill levels of
prospective employees and to assist in the training of current
employees;
<P>
(D) by labor organizations, to enhance the employment security
of workers by providing portable credentials and skills;
<P>
(E) by workers, to
<P>
(i) obtain certifications of their skills to protect against dislocation;
<P>
(ii) pursue career advancement; and
<P>
(iii) enhance their ability to reenter the workforce;
<P>
(F) by students and entry level workers, to determine the skill
levels and competencies needed to be obtained in order to compete
effectively for high wage jobs;
<P>
(G) by training providers and educators, to determine appropriate
training services to offer<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, <I>everybody </I>should be using these skill standards.
<P>
As with the Act's national goals, skill standards may, at first,
seem like a good idea, especially in view of employer complaints
about the quality of new workers coming out of the public schools.
 Unfortunately, the envisioned skill standards, like the national
goals, are a Pandora's box of federal entanglement in local education
and the private sector job market.
<P>
The National Skills Standards Board will, after conferring with
representatives of business, labor, education, and various other
organizations, adopt skill standards for a broad spectrum of private
industries (the Act refers to &quot;broad clusters of major occupations&quot;).
 These standards must take into account, among other things, standards
used in other countries, requirements of work organizations, and,
perhaps most importantly, &quot;content and performance standards&quot;
certified by the National Education Goals Panel.  Thus, the education
standards created by the National Education Goals Panel will be
incorporated into the national skills standards that Washington
wants employers to use.  It is apparent that the Clinton administration
wants the business community to pressure local schools to use
the education standards contained in the Act so that students
will be able (supposedly) to meet the new skill standards.
<P>
Goals 2000 supporters will undoubtedly point out that, like other
provisions in the Act, the skills standards will be voluntary.
 However, like these other &quot;voluntary&quot; provisions, closer
scrutiny shows that there is less &quot;voluntaryness&quot; here
than meets the eye.
<P>
To judge fully just how &quot;voluntary&quot; the skills standards
are, it is necessary to look at the federal School-To-Work Opportunities
Act of 1994 (referred to below as STW), which is a companion law
to the Goals 2000 Act.  According to its stated purpose, STW establishes:
<P>
. . . a national framework within which all States can create
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems that-
<P>
(A) are part of comprehensive education reform;
<P>
(B) are integrated with the systems developed under Goals 2000:
Educate America Act and the National Skill Standards Act of 1994;
and
<P>
(C) offer opportunities for all students to participate in a performance-based
education training program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .</FONT>
<P>
In addition, STW explicitly states that another of its purposes
is:
<P>
. . . to further the National Education Goals set forth in Title
I of the Goals 2000:
<P>
 Educate America Act.
<P>
STW, therefore, exists in large part simply to further the reach
of Goals 2000.
<P>
One of the principal tools used by STW to ensure that the ideology
of Goals 2000 becomes part of both school and workplace is the
creation of a &quot;skill certificate.&quot;  According to STW,
a skills certificate is:
<P>
. . . a portable, industry-recognized credential issued by a School-to-Work
Opportunities program under an approved State plan, that certifies
that a student has mastered skills at levels that are at least
as challenging as skill standards endorsed by the National Skill
Standards Board established under the National Skill Standards
Act of 1994, except that until such skill standards are developed,
the term &quot;skill certificate&quot; means a credential issued
under a process described in the approved State plan.
<P>
Why is this skill certificate so critical?  If the government
is handing out skill certificates to select students, then these
students will, at least initially, have an advantage 
<P>
over those students who do not have a certificate when it comes
to getting a job or perhaps getting into college.  The problem
then becomes two-fold.  First, those states and local jurisdictions
that want to resist participation in Goals 2000 will feel pressure
to reverse their position because students from states and localities
participating in Goals 2000/ STW will be receiving skill certificates
which will, as a consequence, place the students from non-participating
jurisdictions at an initial competitive disadvantage.  Second,
those students without a certificate will not just be those youngsters
who have failed to study hard and perform, but will also include
many students who attend private schools and home schools that
oppose participation in Goals 2000/STW because of fear of government
control.
<P>
If states, localities and private schools decide to participate
in the offering of skill certificates, the inevitable result will
be teaching to the certificate:  curricula will be shaped to improve
the chances of students to obtain these certificates.  This is
important since, as has been noted, the skills certificates issued
under any state plan must meet the skill levels and standards
endorsed by the National Skills Standards Board.  It will be this
federal Board, therefore, that will set the broad criteria for
getting a skill certificate, not the states or localities.  This
power will give the federal government strong influence over what
is being taught in the classroom. 
<P>
Further, STW also increases federal power by requiring that a
state or local School-to-Work Opportunities program that awards
skill certificates include:
<P>
. . . a program of study designed to meet the same academic content
standards the State has established for all students, including,
where applicable, standards established under the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, all those supposedly voluntary standards contained in the
Goals 2000 Act suddenly become mandatory if a state or local jurisdiction
wants to award skill certificates under STW.  Federal education
priorities, not local ones, will, therefore, become dominant.
<P>
As with the Goals 2000 Act, the federal government also increases
its education policy-making power through the disbursement of
federal dollars.  Under STW, states can apply for grants to develop
a School-to-Work Opportunities system.  Not surprisingly, there
is a big condition that must be met if states are to get their
federal money:
<P>
The Secretaries [of Education and Labor] may approve an application
submitted by a State under section 203 only if the State demonstrates
in such application that the activities proposed to be undertaken
by the State to develop a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
system are consistent with the State improvement plan for the
State, if any, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, in the grant application the state's School-to-Work
Opportunities plan must:
<P>
. . . describe how the State will adopt, develop, or assist local
partnerships to adopt or develop model curricula and innovative
instructional methodologies, to be used in the secondary, and
where possible, the elementary grades, that integrate academic
and vocational learning and promote career awareness, and that
are consistent with academic and skill standards established pursuant
to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the National Skill
Standards Act of 1994.
<P>
Also, a state's grant application must:
<P>
. . . describe the process of the State for assessing the skills
and knowledge required in career majors, and the process for awarding
skill certificates that is, to the extent feasible, consistent
with the skills standards certification system endorsed under
the National Skill Standards Act of 1994<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, unless a state can demonstrate that its School-to-Work
Opportunities plan is following the national goals and standards
contained in the Goals 2000 Act, and that its skills certification
system is following the skills standards laid down by the Goals
2000 Act's National Skill Standards Board, a state will not be
able to receive its grant.  In view of these requirements, STW's
Section 604, which purports to prohibit STW from imposing federal
mandates, direction, and control, becomes just so much ineffectual
boilerplate.  The reality is that states will be forced to bend
to the federal will because that is what the federal funding strings
require.
<P>
Is this too harsh an assessment of what faces California and other
states?  The evidence to date, unfortunately, indicates that this
assessment is all too accurate.  In June 1994, Governor Wilson
created a School-to-Career Task Force.  A preliminary report of
that task force endorsed the skill certificate concept (the task
force proposed &quot;certificates of mastery&quot;).
<P>
In addition, this year several school-to-work bills were introduced
in the State Legislature.  One bill, AB 1835 by Assemblywoman
Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), would have created &quot;certificates
of mastery&quot; that would have been coordinated and integrated
with the Goals 2000 Act and STW.  These certificates would be
awarded based on &quot;performance-based&quot; assessments of
pupils.  It should be pointed out that performance-based assessments
are not synonymous with <I>skill-based</I> assessments.  In today's
testing and assessment environment, they often involve putting
emphasis on what a child feels rather than what the child knows
about the subject.  It was this deficiency that led to the cancellation
of the CLAS test last year.
<P>
Although none of the school-to-work legislation passed, bills
such as AB 1835 give Californians an insight into what could lie
ahead in their education future under STW.  It seems odd that
California, which is one of the leaders in the charter school
movementa movement based on empowering parents, teachers, and
principals at the school sitecould also be on the verge of taking
a bite out of the STW apple and transferring key powers to federal
bureaucrats in Washington.  Indeed, it is chilling to read that
under STW:
<P>
. . . the Secretaries [of Education and Labor] shall jointly provide
for, and shall exercise final authority over, the administration
of this Act, and shall have final authority to jointly issue whatever
procedures, guidelines, and regulations, in accordance with section
553 of Title V, United States Code, the Secretaries consider necessary
and appropriate to administer and enforce the provisions of this
Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Is this not an opening for greatly expanded federal regulation
of education?  A common sensical reading of Goals 2000 and STW
would make it hard not to feel uncomfortable when answering this
question. 
<P>
<B>HOLDING CHILDREN HOSTAGE:</B>
<P>
<B>THE IMPROVING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT (IASA)</B>
<P>
In addition to School-to-Work schemes, another federal program
is guided by Goals 2000 and involves vastly greater sums of federal
dollars-the<B> </B>Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA).
 The IASA reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act (ESEA), and allocated approximately $12 billion to thirty-two
separate federal funding programs.  In 1994-1995, California received
$900 million in ESEA money, and will receive more than $1 billion
in 1995-1996.  More than two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education,&quot; i.e., money for services to disadvantaged children.
 
<P>
In a critical analysis titled, &quot;Goals 2000 and a Reauthorized
ESEA: National Standards and Accompanying Controversies,&quot;
authors Michael W. Kirst and James W. Guthrie note that Goals
2000 will alter the Chapter One element from its long-standing
regulatory and fiscal role to a &quot;powerfully administrative
instrument for fundamentally changing America's public schools.&quot;
  Goals 2000 in effect achieves a marriage between the financial
clout of the reauthorized ESEA/IASA-nearly $1 billion in California-and
the administrative authority of a planning process aimed at comprehensive
goals for all schools.
<P>
It should come as no surprise that in order to receive its ESEA/IASA
money, California must use the Goals 2000 standards.  In summarizing
the state responsibilities under ESEA/IASA, the LAO notes:
<P>
Title 1Compensatory Education
<P>
*  Develop content and performance standards and assessments to
evaluate school performance in mathematics and reading.  States
are required to use the standards and assessments developed under
Goals 2000 if they are participating in that act.
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
*  Develop a plan to provide teachers and administrators the skills
to help students meet Goals 2000 performance standards. . . .
<P>
* Align teacher training and licensing with Goals 2000 curriculum
and performance standards.
<P>
Local education agencies, according to the LAO, must also adhere
to the Goals 2000 agenda:
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
* Apply to the state for Title 2 grants.  Local applications must
be focused on the training needed to meet Goals 2000 standards.
. . .
<P>
Title 6Innovative Education Strategies
<P>
* Develop a plan for the use of funds that helps the district
meet the Goals 2000 standards. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Further, under ESEA/ IASA Title V, which is designed to promote
equity of magnet school assistance, priority funding is given
to magnet schools that propose to implement approaches that are
consistent with Title III of the Goals 2000 Act (recall that this
was the part of the Act dealing with state and local improvement
plans).
<P>
In testimony before Congress, former Secretaries of Education
William Bennett and Lamar Alexander observed that the legislation
reauthorizing ESEA &quot;mandates the kinds of federally-approved
'standards' that Goals 2000 said would be voluntary.&quot;  However,
said the two former Secretaries, &quot;Only with those approved
'content' and 'student performance' standards in place can a state
or community get its federal aid.&quot;  Finally, Bennett and
Alexander warn:
<P>
[The IASA/ESEA] bill takes a giant step toward reviving the legitimacy-and
federal supervision-of criteria that judge schools by their spending
levels, pupil-teacher ratios, and suchlike, instead of their effectiveness.
 And since Goals 2000 authorized the Education Department to develop
national &quot;opportunity to learn&quot; standards, we can expect
that these will soon exist-and be used.
<P>
Bennett's and Alexander's fears are more than justified.  The
Legislative Analyst Office, for example, recommends that:
<P>
Local ESEA plans should be required to address the standards set
out in the state's Goals 2000 plan<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
If the state follows such recommendations, federal control of
state and local education will have been accomplished by the states
and localities themselves.  As Diane Ravitch, former Assistant
Secretary of Education in the Bush administration and a highly
respected education writer, observed:
<P>
What bears watching in Goals 2000 is the precedent it establishes
for federal legislation that influences the kinds of textbooks,
teaching materials, teacher training methods, and research findings
that must be used in every school to receive federal funds.  For
many years, the federal government exercised great restraint by
respecting state and local control of education.  In the future,
because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage to the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act . . . federal regulation may extend
much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught, the
conditions in which it is taught, and how it is tested.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND CALIFORNIA'S DECLINING STANDARDS</B>
<P>
Given that Goals 2000 and its related laws will increase federal
control over education decision-making, it is fair to ask what
effect the Act will have on education standards in California.
 Most Americans would agree that any standard adopted by policymakers
should 
<P>
be clearly measurable and based on academics.  Ravitch says that
&quot;A standard is both a goal (what should be done) and a measure
of progress toward that goal (how well it was done).&quot;
<P>
The Act gives us a clue to the type of standards it will endorse
when it says that one of its purposes is &quot;to improve learning
and teaching by providing a national framework for education reform.&quot;
 Those involved in recent debates on tests and standards will
recognize the term &quot;frameworks.&quot;  It is the buzz word
for California's troubled experiment with outcome-based education.
 As one California report noted:
<P>
Outcome-based education, or whatever it is called by the various
school districts, is not yet specifically defined at the state
level, though the frameworks suggest learning outcomes.  Each
district will be required to conform to standards of achievement
based on an implied understanding of what reform documents actually
mean.
<P>
Goals 2000, therefore, will have a great impact on how the state
and local districts understand what standards they should adhere
to.
<P>
The existing California Subject Matter Frameworks are designed
to be a guide for what is taught in California schools.  However,
methods promoted in the Mathematics and English/Language Arts
Frameworks have resulted in the de-emphasis of basic math skills
and phonics.  As a result of growing pressure from the public,
valid criticisms are surfacing. The following is a brief discussion
of the current state of &quot;frameworks,&quot; standards, and
basic skills in California.
<P>
<B>California Math Standards</B>
<P>
Under California's current &quot;Math Frameworks,&quot; the emphasis
is on problem solving rather than on basic skills or rote memorization
(e.g., multiplication tables).  Critics charge, however, that
without a good working knowledge of basic skills, it is hard to
expect students to come up with academically rigorous responses
to word problems.  In a recent critique of the California Math
Framework, Dr. Wayne Bishop, who teaches mathematics at California
State University at Los Angeles, finds that there is little commitment
to teaching deepening levels of mathematical competence and sophistication
as students progress through the curriculum:
<P>
There are to be no assumptions of, let alone mandates of, minimal
computational 
<P>
and conceptual competence at progressively higher grade levels.
 Since there is no 
<P>
data to support the contention that this current practice is aiding
students at either end of the performance spectrum, and massive
evidence is that it is hindering progress of students overall,
this philosophy must be critically challenged instead of embraced.
<P>
Indeed, with the development of the California Learning Assessment
System assessment test (which downplays the importance of correct
computational answers in favor of answers based on feelings and
sincerity), the state, according to Dr. Bishop, has taken steps
to eliminate heretofore well-understood statewide assessment.
<P>
<B>Reading Skills in California</B>
<P>
At a time when even teachers union publications are admitting
that phonics is the superior English reading instructional technique,
many schools in California are still de-emphasizing phonics. 
 Through its English/Language Arts Frameworks, California has
been a leader in adopting the &quot;whole language&quot; approach
to reading which calls for teachers to spend more time reading
stories to children than on specific skills such as spelling,
the sounds of letters or syllables.
<P>
Other states have caught on where California has not.  In Ohio,
a law was passed which requires the teaching of systematic, intensive
phonics in the primary grades.  Teachers are now receiving phonics
in-service programs.  The National Right To Read Foundation indicates
that there are currently nine states working on phonics legislation:
Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Missouri,
New York, and Illinois.
<P>
<B>Goals 2000 and the CLAS Fiasco: The Untold Story</B>
<P>
What is the connection between these state Math and English frameworks
and the Goals 2000 debate over measuring standards?  The answer
to that question lies with the California Learning Assessment
System (CLAS), the assessment test that was developed by the State
Department of Education.  The link is that the CLAS test was designed
to measure the effectiveness of education reforms envisioned under
Goals 2000 programs.  Indeed, since CLAS is &quot;performance-based&quot;
(i.e., it attempts to measure a child's thought processes rather
than simply totaling up right and wrong answers), <I>it is exactly
the type of test envisioned and preferred by Goals 2000 and its
supporters.  </I>
<P>
News media reports on the 1994 CLAS scores showed students unable
to read critically or apply math to real-world problems, but virtually
no mention was given to the fact that the English portion of the
CLAS exam did not test for incorrect spelling or incorrect grammar,
or that the Math portion did not emphasize basic skills.  The
unwritten story, therefore, is that even the low scores reported
on the CLAS exam were still artificially high.
<P>
How can California's parents and policymakers judge the effectiveness
of the new state frameworks if the state's measuring tool bases
its scoring on <I>non-academic</I> benchmarks?  Thus, although
Superintendent Eastin has assigned task forces to examine the
state Frameworks, it is disturbing to note the all-out support
Ms. Eastin has given for a performance-based successor to the
now defunct CLAS test.  The ultimate problem of testing based
on non-academic benchmarks is that even if scores rise, the public
has no assurance that this is the result of improved student learning
of academic subject matter.
<P>
<B>A Case Study: How One California School District Uses Goals
2000 Funding</B>
<P>
How will districts use Goals 2000 money?  The linkage between
Goals 2000 and the IASA permits the philosophy behind Goals 2000
to permeate the more than thirty programs authorized under IASA.
 Poway Unified School District in San Diego County provides a
revealing example.  The district plans to use Goals 2000 money
for elementary school counselors to assist in meeting the supposed
emotional and social needs of district children.
<P>
As part of these counseling services, Poway has issued so-called
&quot;wellness&quot; manuals.  These manuals, used without parents'
knowledge or permission, contain questions and techniques to get
children to reveal private feelings about their family.  Questions
and techniques include &quot;Do you feel that no one at home loves
you and cares about you?  Yes or No?&quot; and &quot;As bonding
and trust evolve, the [counseling] group becomes a safe place
where youngsters talk openly about their lives, sometimes sharing
secrets they've never talked about before.&quot;
<P>
Poway will also use Goals 2000 money to promote an array of &quot;core
values&quot;: all students learning; parents as partners; competent
and caring staff; staff participation in decision-making; safe,
orderly, and attractive environment; and effective management
of resources.  All these goals may sound worthwhile, but notice
that the focus is not on academics.  The interaction of the Goals
2000 triad (Goals 2000, IASA, and STW) will mean a significant
expansion in these &quot;soft&quot; areas of school management
and school environment, with no assurance as to improved student
performance or a higher quality of classroom instruction.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
<P>
California should just say &quot;no&quot; to Goals 2000 and School-to-Work
dollars. 
<UL>
<LI>Although the funding amounts are not huge at present, there
is a clear expansion of federal control underway.  At a time when
there is a national consensus that decisionmaking power should
be returned to the state and local level, Goals 2000 is a throwback
to the discredited &quot;Washington-knows-best&quot; solutions
of the Great Society. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>California does not need to look to Washington for ways to
improve education.  Charter schools, privatization, radical decentralization
of school finance, streamlining of categorical programs, alternative
teacher certification, tenure reform, and other innovations can
radically turn around education in our state without any need
for approval from a federal bureaucrat.  Goals 2000 is a muddy
detour on the road to reform, a detour California can't afford
to take.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 will discourage and hinder the development of rigorous
standards for California's public schools.  At a time when parents
and others at the grassroots are demanding that students be made
to demonstrate what objective knowledge they possess, Goals 2000
will do nothing to satisfy these demands-and in fact, will impede
real reform.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rigorous academic standards will only be established  by involving
the public in a broad-based deliberation on the subject, thereby
building a genuine and informed consensus.  Goals 2000 obfuscates
and delays that public debate by purveying the myth that new federal
goals, standards, and strategies are meeting these needs.  That
is demonstrably not the case.  Goals 2000 is, in reality, a gigantic
hoax played on the public by the education bureaucrats and the
teachers unions, both in Washington and Sacramento.  Given what
is at stake, the rescue of our failing schools, politicians who
contribute to this hoax should face ridicule for the misuse of
taxpayers funds.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rejecting Goals 2000 funding is only a starting point.  Local
control must be given more than lip service, and education standards
must mean more than testing for &quot;self-esteem.&quot;  Financial
incentives and disguised mandates from the federal level to use
any particular type of learning strategy or curriculum program
should be rejected.
</UL>

<P>
For too long local schools have opted to rely on supposed &quot;experts&quot;
in state and federal bureaucracies to dictate standards and curricula.
 Goals 2000 merely encourages this dependency, which carries over
to other areas, such as textbook adoptions.  This process relies
heavily on State Department of Education staff, who are generally
more committed to the latest curriculum fads than to rigorous
academic standards. 
<P>
What is lost in this fevered quest for federal dollars is local
control in any meaningful sense.  Local school boards do not understand
and therefore cannot influence this process; they become mere
observers and cheerleaders for the local superintendent and his
team.  Federal dollars and state bureaucrats drive both curriculum
choices and budget decisions in this system.  The current system
is bad enough without adding another federally approved state
plan to the mix.

2000</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
It is widely recognized that California's academic standards are
deficient and that the basic skills of the state's students are
at a woeful level.  The paramount question for Goals 2000 is,
therefore, will Goals 2000 improve learning or will the attempt
to achieve the national goals, not all of which are academic,
further dilute academics in the average school day?  An examination
of the National Educational Goals gives thoughtful citizens cause
for concern.  Presented below are the eight goals and a brief
commentary on each.
<P>
<B>1. SCHOOL READINESS</B>
<P>
&quot;<I>By the year 2000, all children in America will start
school ready to learn.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This goal opens the door for government intrusion
into family life under the guise of assuring that all children
are ready to learn.  In an attempt to cure the ills of a few children
who may not be well cared for, all families, good and bad, are
subject to the government playing nanny.  The entire social service
agenda of the Clinton administration can be imposed on schools
through this goal.  A National Education Goals Panel Report states:
&quot;Readiness to learn necessarily begins long before school,
even before birth itself, and we conclude that 'school readiness'
relates to the child's health, to the home environment, and to
preschool education.&quot;  The federal government will be in
a position to determine what is and what is not an appropriate
home environment through the implementation of Goal #1.
<P>
<B>2. SCHOOL COMPLETION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will
increase to at least ninety percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  Creates an incentive for schools to lower the
requirements for graduation in order to boost the percentage rates
of students who are graduating.  Does not contain an incentive
to hold students to rigorous academic standards, but rather gives
incentive to teach down to the lowest common denominator.  Students
are not allowed to choose from a wide array of curriculum and
program options;  therefore, this goal could homogenize all students
and discourage healthy diversity.
<P>
<B>3. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND CITIZENSHIP</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, all students will leave grades 4, 8,
and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject
matter including English, mathematics, science, foreign languages,
civics and government, economics, arts, history and geography,
and every school in America will ensure that all students learn
to use their minds well so they may be prepared for responsible
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our
nation's modern economy.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  In response to this goal of &quot;responsible
citizenship,&quot; many schools are beginning to mandate community
service as a graduation requirement.  This is problematic because
of the vagueness of what qualifies as community service.  Is it
really a good use of students' valuable school time to coerce
them into community service programs when many are graduating
from high schools without basic reading, writing, and computational
skills?  Is it hypocritical to teach volunteerism by mandating
it?
<P>
<B>4.  TEACHER EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the nation's teaching force will have
access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional
skills and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills
needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the next
century.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This is one of the goals added to the original
six by the Clinton administration.  Throughout the Goals 2000
Act, teacher education and training is a recurrent theme.  This
is not surprising since the National Education Association and
other teacher unions view increased funding for teacher training
as one of their top objectives and President Clinton has received
key support from the teachers unions.  Unfortunately, the underlying
premise of this goal is wrong.  The unions feel that the only
thing that is needed to turn bad teachers into good ones is a
little more training.  Yet the real reason for poor teacher performance
is union-imposed collective bargaining agreements that protect
incompetent teachers.  Teacher advancement and pay scales are
based on seniority rather than merit. 
<P>
This goal does not address the serious problem of barriers to
non-traditional teachers, whereby many highly skilled individuals
such as engineers, chemists and others with professional degrees
are not allowed to teach in a public school classroom simply because
they lack an irrelevant teaching certificate.  As written, this
goal serves only the interests of the teacher unions, and it obstructs
efforts to open the teaching profession to retirees and others
who have much to offer our children.
<P>
<B>5.  MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, United States students will be first
in the world in mathematics and science achievement.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> In view of the current Mathematics Framework
and the increasing numbers of students enrolled in remedial math
at the university level, it is difficult to see how this goal
will be reached without an increased focus on academics in California.
 Further, Californians should take little comfort in this year's
publicized bump upward in SAT scores.  A key reason why SAT math
scores rose is because students were allowed, for the first time,
to take calculators into the exam.
<P>
<B>6.  ADULT LITERACY AND LIFELONG LEARNING</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete
in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Given that an estimated twenty-seven million
adults are &quot;functionally illiterate,&quot; is the Clinton
administration advocating an entirely new public schooling system
for those adults who did not learn to read in 12 years of public
education?  If so, how much would this cost?  Is it logical to
entrust this task to the public school system, which often graduates
eighteen year-olds without even eighth-grade reading skills? 

<P>
<B>7.  SAFE, DISCIPLINED, AND ALCOHOL AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school in the United States will
be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms
and alcohol and will offer a disciplined environment conducive
to learning.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> It is difficult to see the Clinton administration
making much headway on this goal.  Lackadaisical enforcement efforts,
poor leadership, and outright endorsement of drug use (e.g., the
pronouncements of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders) have
characterized the Clinton administration's poor record on curbing
illegal drug use.  It is no wonder that drug use in California
(as in many other states) has risen in the years following the
Reagan administration's concerted anti-drug campaigns.  According
to one recent report, &quot;Since 1989, drug use among seventh,
ninth, and eleventh graders in California has revealed a disturbing
trend of increased use.&quot; 
<P>
Controlling juvenile violence will be just as difficult.  Although
a recent study showed that juvenile crime rises by seventeen percent
for every ten percent increase in the number of children living
in single-parent homes, the Clinton administration has done little
to address the problem of rising illegitimate births or to break
the connection between illegitimacy and high welfare payments
(both of which contribute to juvenile crime).  The reality is
that violent juvenile crime will increase dramatically because
of demographic trends.  From 1983 to 1992, juvenile arrests for
violent crime (homicide, forcible rape, robbery, assault and kidnapping)
increased from 12,321 to 21,549, a 74.8 percent increase.  Between
1995 and the year 2004, California's 11 to 17-year-old population
will increase thirty-three percent, growing from approximately
three million to nearly four million.  Even if the arrest rate
stays the same, the state Legislative Analyst's Office says that
the number of juvenile arrests for violent crimes will rise by
62 percent over 1993's total.
<P>
<B>8.  PARENTAL PARTICIPATION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school will promote partnerships
that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting
the social, emotional and academic growth of children.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Parent participation often translates into parenting
skills classes and mandatory compliance with government programs.
 All schools that receive funds under this Act are required to
have a plan to achieve Goal #8:
<P>
Section 2 (8).  The purpose of this Act is to provide a framework
for meeting the National Education Goals established by Title
I of this Act by . . . assisting every elementary and secondary
school that receives funds under this Act to actively involve
parents and families in supporting the academic work of their
children at home and in providing parents with skills to advocate
for their children at school.
<P>
Under Title IV of the Act, states and non-profit agencies can
apply for federal grants to fund parent information centers. 
Groups applying for grants must include as part of their grant
application an assurance that part of the funds they receive will
be directed to &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; (PAT) programs
and are required to use the Missouri program as a model.
<P>
The &quot;certified parent educators&quot; are trained to identify
certain &quot;risk factors&quot; that exist in the child's home.
 Risk factors documented under PAT programs include &quot;inability
of parent to relate to or connect with child, overindulgence,
undue spoiling on part of parent, low functioning parent (due
to limited ability or illness), low weight gain, poor appetite,
frequent illness, other.&quot; (Missouri Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education, PAT National Center)  Thus, the laudable
goal of involving parents becomes in practice a device for government
agencies to intrude into the personal lives of individuals.  Parents
have the greatest interest in the quality of education that their
children receive.
<P>
The practical effect of Goals 2000 will be to undercut parental
rights and derail parental empowerment.  When  schools become
counseling centers for parents, parents become just one more client
group of an expanding social service bureaucracy.

Two Approaches to<BR>
Compensated Takings Under<BR>
the California Endangered Species Act 
</CENTER>
</H1>

<H3>
<CENTER>
<I>A Comparison of SB 131 and AB 137</I> 
</CENTER>
</H3>

<HR>

<H3>Introduction The California legislature recently began consideration of important proposals to change the manner in which the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) is implemented. The issue of uncompensated takings of private property is squarely addressed in legislation introduced in the Assembly; it is skirted in legislation introduced in the Senate. California, like 42 other states considering some 100 property rights bills, must enact strong legislation to protect the citizens' right in property.</H3>

<P>
Uncompensated regulatory takings are unconstitutional under the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, yet such actions are allowed under current law and court rulings in California. Legislative proposals under consideration in California seek to remedy this neglect of constitutional protections.
<P>
A regulatory &quot;taking&quot; is an action of government that reduces or eliminates the value of property through regulation, but the government does not take physical possession of the property. Although guarantees against takings exist in the California Constitution, our courts have been reluctant to protect private property rights.
<P>
Ironically, bureaucratic ignorance and even hostility to these civil rights inevitably lead 
<P>
to the destruction of many species, endangered and threatened, as well as extraordinary losses of critical habitat. When confronted with an endangered species on private property, many
<P>
Americans follow the adage, &quot;Shoot, shovel and shut up.&quot; Search and destroy missions of critical habitat to ward off unwanted endangered species are becoming more common. Jokes about marbled murreletes tasting like something between a spotted owl and a bald eagle loosen up the crowd in Rotary Clubs across the land. Americans, who have been so generous to conservation and preservation organizations, know when their government has gone too far.
<P>
Compensation is constitutionally required, but the courts, the legislature and the bureaucracy have made a mockery of the rights of property owners in California. California is probably the least hospitable of the fifty states to the rights of property owners. Requiring compensation of Californians whose property is diminished by the CESA would restore balance to the debate about which species and which habitats should be saved. Compensation would save many endangered species that are being destroyed by the perverse incentives of the current law. 
<P>
<B>Legislative Approaches to Reforming the California ESA</B>
<P>
Two proposed modifications to the California ESA have been considered by the California legislature. One confronts the issue of compensation head on; the other addresses it only tangentially. AB 137 (Olberg-R-34-Victorville) addresses the perverse consequences of governmental endangered species regulation by aiming to explicitly protect the rights of property owners. By contrast, SB 131 (Maddy-R-14-Fresno) pays much attention to the subject of &quot;biodiversity,&quot; but misses the critical point that property rights are no less important than other fundamental liberties.
<P>
Senator Maddy's bill states: 
<P>
<I>It is the policy of this state to remove disincentives for owners of land and water resources to be good stewards of the land while maximizing the economic return from their property. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be applied in a manner that would deny the economically viable use of private property. Furthermore, it is the policy of this state that just compensation be paid to an owner of land or water resources who is denied economically viable use of private property as the result of actions taken by government under this chapter. </I>
<P>
Other than this reference, SB 131 does not mention compensation of property owners victimized by discovery of endangered species on their land. Instead, it provides that a 
<P>
landowner may enter into a &quot;partnership&quot; with the state to protect not only the specific endangered species, but &quot;regional biodiversity.&quot;
<P>
By contrast, AB 137 is very explicit in stating that &quot;just compensation shall be paid for the taking of private or public property, and would, for that purpose, define a 'taking'.&quot; The bill establishes what constitutional lawyers refer to as a &quot;bright line&quot; test. It requires that, 
<P>
<I>Just compensation shall be paid for any taking of private or public property to the owner </I>
<P>
<I>of the property, including compensation for damages incurred by the owner as a result of the taking. For the purposes of this section, the term 'taking of private or public property' means the foreclosure of any use of private property or public property that is otherwise allowed under federal, state, and local law that is caused by any of the following acts if that act, by itself, or in combination with other foreclosures of use so caused, reduces the fair market value of the property by 20 percent or more:</I>
<P>
<I>(a) The inclusion of a species in a list of endangered species or a list of threatened species.</I>
<P>
<I>(b) The designation of a critical habitat for that species.</I>
<P>
<I>(c) The implementation of a recovery plan for that species. </I>
<P>
<I>(d) Any other act that is authorized or required by this chapter.</I>
<P>
What does the language of these bills mean? Does the &quot;policy&quot; announced in Senator Maddy's bill, that just compensation be paid, actually require that compensation be paid? What difference would Assemblyman Olberg's &quot;bright line&quot; definition of a &quot;taking&quot; mean? How does the language of both bills square with the constitutional requirements envisioned by the framers of the United States Constitution and the California Constitution?
<P>
<B>First Principles: Why Protect Property? </B>
<P>
The framers of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights understood well the importance of protecting private property rights. They believed that it was critical to protect private property for two fundamental reasons: 1) the individual right to property is itself a natural right; 2) the vigorous protection of this right is central to the government's protection of all individual liberties.
<P>
<B>Property as a Natural Right</B>
<P>
Like John Locke, the political thinker from whom many of America's founding principles originate, the founders recognized that individuals are endowed by their creator with the natural right to private property. Both Locke and the founders understood that government is created by man and is granted political authority for the very purpose of protecting natural rights. While many environmentalists would have us believe that private property exists only insofar as it does not interfere with state authority, a look to the Declaration of Independence reveals that they have it backwards: government is only legitimate when it serves the people by making them secure in the exercise of the fundamental natural rights. The Declaration states that, &quot;to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.&quot;
<P>
<B>Protection of Individual Liberties</B>
<P>
The Declaration of Independence proclaims that the fundamental duty of any just government is to protect the individual natural rights of citizens. James Madison demonstrates, in <I>Federalist</I> 10, how the vigorous protection of private property enables government to live up to this duty.
<P>
Madison writes that the greatest threat to citizens' natural rights are factions, defined as groups of individuals organized for the purpose of attacking the natural rights of their fellow citizens. While he acknowledges that nothing can be done to eliminate factions, Madison argues that they can be controlled, so that no single faction comes to exercise the power of the majority. One of the best ways to keep factions in check, Madison recognizes, is to ensure that there is a great diversity, or &quot;multiplicity,&quot; of interests within society. In this way, no single faction can grow too powerful without being checked and restrained by competing factions.
<P>
How do we ensure that there is such a diversity of interests within society? Madison answers: the vigorous protection of private property. Since individuals, by nature, have different talents and abilities (or &quot;faculties,&quot; as Madison calls them), they will naturally acquire different amounts of property. This diversity of property leads to a diversity of interests, and it is this diversity of interests that is central to controlling factions and protecting individual liberties. Consequently, Madison writes, &quot;The diversity in the faculties 
<P>
of men, from which the rights of property originate,&quot; ensures the diversity of interests necessary to the protection of individual liberties. &quot;The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.&quot;
<P>
Madison's views on property rights were expressed often and eloquently in both private and public writings. He believed property rights were fundamental to all our freedoms:
<P>
<I>[Property]. . . in its</I> <I>particular application, means &quot;that dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in exclusion of every other individual.&quot; In its larger and juster meaning, it embraces everything to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and a man's land, or merchandise, or money, is called his property. In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them. He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them. He has a property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person. He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties, and free choice of the objects on which to employ them</I>. In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may equally be said to have a property in his rights.<I> </I>[Emphasis added.]
<P>
It is, therefore, through the protection of private property rights that the American political system must fulfill the obligation of the Declaration of Independence. The Fifth Amendment, which holds that private property will not be &quot;taken for public use, without just compensation,&quot; seeks to ensure the government's adherence to the standards of the Declaration.
<P>
Beginning with the Progressive era, the Supreme Court dangerously downgraded the importance of property rights. In so doing, the Court ignored Madison's warning that property rights were central to the protection of individual liberties. Fortunately, more recent courts have slowly come to understand the importance of property rights. In <I>Lynch v. Household Finance</I>, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that, &quot;A fundamental interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right in property.&quot; This reflects Madison's understanding of the role of property rights in the American system. Recent Supreme Court decisions do indeed provide hope that the founders' conception of property rights may regain its proper place in the public mind.
<P>
<B>California Courts Embrace Environmental Extremism </B>
<P>
Legislative attempts to protect the environment have led to a body of state jurisprudence concerning the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment, and similar provisions in the California Constitution. This jurisprudence is confused and conflicting. Nevertheless, enforcement of environmental laws has spawned &quot;takings&quot; cases that have flooded the courts as more citizens claim harm.
<P>
Some of the recent legal mischief can be traced not to a misreading of the state or federal Constitution but to bad science. Both legislators and judges, understandably, have been influenced by pseudo-science masquerading as evidence of impending environmental catastrophe-the most glaring evidence of which is the loss of species. Fortunately, scientists are beginning to expose the fallacious doomsday claims of the environmentalists. Evidence mounts that much of the environmentalist litany is not only unscientific, but simply untrue. If judges recognized that much of the environmental hysteria is not based on fact, judicial deference to these claims could diminish. Laws based upon the notion that the earth faces imminent catastrophe will change as that view recedes. But courts may be slow to change. Without a change in the law, conforming environmental policy to constitutional mandate is difficult for courts. Conservative jurists normally view such bold steps as judicial activism, while liberal jurists resist them because they are environmentalists.
<P>
Courts in California seem particularly averse to allowing takings claims in matters involving the environment. Citizens affected by confiscatory environmental regulations face nearly impossible procedural obstacles and difficulties, difficulties imposed as a deliberate matter of policy to &quot;protect the public fisc.&quot; These two bills and the escalating public debate over ESA absurdities signal a change in the public attitude, away from extremism and toward a more balanced environmentalism. The question being asked more frequently and more insistently is, does the desirable end of environmental protection require a total disregard for the rights of property owners? The answer we are hearing with increasing volume is, no!
<P>
<B>Just Compensation or &quot;Biodiversity&quot;?</B>
<P>
SB 131 proposes a &quot;partnership&quot; between the landowner and the state, in the event that the landowner is subjected to endangered species legislation. It is difficult to see how Senator Maddy's proposal of &quot;partnerships&quot; between private landowners and the state restores the protection of property established by the founders. We normally think of a partnership as a voluntary association for mutual gain, whereas SB 131 sees the use of property as a privilege bestowed upon the property owner by the state, like a driver's license. 
<P>
An example of this presumption in SB 131 is its embodiment of the planner's view that building and development permits are privileges bestowed by a benevolent state. The costs imposed by the permitting process guarantee that only the wealthy can afford to seek permits. Why do our legislators continue to propose laws that are bound to be specially applied for the benefit of the wealthy? As noted in 1987 by Gideon Kanner, &quot;There's a curious amalgam of radical political rhetoric cheek and jowl with upper middle class exclusivity.&quot; The proposed &quot;public-private partnerships&quot; are but further examples of vehicles for elite patronage.
<P>
The ostensible rationale of the partnership idea is that the owner enters into a contract with the state to serve society's end of &quot;biodiversity.&quot; While &quot;biodiversity,&quot; however defined, may be desirable and important, should this public good transcend and displace the individual's right to use his property or be fully compensated for the loss of that right? Surely Maddy's bill is a step toward recognition of some rights in property, however exclusive, and may even be attractive to large developers who are stymied by the current regulatory regime. They may buy their way out of regulation with minimal harm. After all, they can pass on the costs of Maddy's &quot;partnership&quot; to their customers. But it does little to help the small landowner or developer.
<P>
SB 131 does contain a <I>de minimis</I> five acre exception to application of the CESA. But what of his neighbor who owns 5.1 acres? Are his rights less important? Either property rights are important all the time and for all Americans, or they are not important at all.
<P>
SB 131 also provides assurances that no person's right to &quot;economically use&quot; his property may be taken without just compensation. This is an illusory gesture. Just what is economical use of property in California? The California courts have provided no guidance and the issue is one of the most pithy problems in the jurisprudence of regulatory takings. The Supreme Court has established that reasonable, investment-backed expectations may not be taken by overregulation. Anyone familiar with the manner in which land use laws are applied in this state knows that the &quot;discovery&quot; of endangered species can (and often does) follow down-zoning and general plan amendments, and perhaps several permit denials, each of which devalue the property. From which devaluation does the taking occur? At what point does one's reasonable &quot;investment-backed expectation&quot; occur? Furthermore, there is little judicial support for the idea that economic use necessarily means the highest and best use. Currently, the Supreme Court's property rights jurisprudence protects only against regulation that takes <I>all</I> use of the property. 
<P>
Finally, SB 131 appears to allow for concurrent use of property by humans and endangered species, but under the watchful eye of the state. Under this scheme, there is no taking if some corner of the property is left for a business use, while the balance is preserved in a state supervised natural condition. SB 131 does not correct the deficiencies in the current law, and confounds an already confused mix of cases and laws. The promise of &quot;just compensation&quot; is not a right under this scheme, but a privilege that may be conferred at the will of the sovereign. 
<P>
One must conclude, reluctantly, that the approach of SB 131 to the California Endangered Species Act is to dilute some objectionable aspects of the current law while paying lip service to property rights. It is a <I>political </I>approach, one designed to placate large developers who have been effectively shut down under our current regulatory scheme, and to satisfy environmentalists bent on the new buzz word in their business, &quot;biodiversity.&quot; However, it ignores the fundamental problem facing ordinary Californians seeking security in the enjoyment of their natural rights. California does not honor citizens' rights in property today, and under Senator Maddy's bill, it will not honor them tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Defining Takings-Does it Help?</B>
<P>
Assemblyman Olberg takes an entirely different approach to endangered species legislative reform. Rather than establish a new bureaucracy to determine the compatibility of humans and endangered species, Olberg's bill assumes the preeminence of property rights over environmental concerns. Simply put, his bill requires compensation whenever the presence of an endangered species diminishes the value of property by a factor of 20 percent or more.
<P>
The simplicity of Olberg's bill is attractive because it clarifies two issues that have confounded the courts in regulatory takings cases: first, that property rights are preeminent over the worthy legislative efforts of the state; and second, that a regulatory taking is defined by a predetermined event. Assuming that some burden on the landowner is fair, AB 137 burdens his property up to and including 20 percent of its value. Thus a 20 percent loss is the bright line beyond which CESA regulation may not go. 
<P>
One problem with Olberg's &quot;bright line&quot; approach is that it fails to remove the environmental disincentives of the current law. It is human nature to avoid obligations imposed by the state. Whether the loss to regulation is 10 percent, 20 percent or more, the citizen still has some incentives to &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up&quot; if an endangered species inhabits his property. Thus the burden on the individual is not only counterproductive to the end of the regulation, but also punishes the citizen for events over which he has no control.
<P>
Another problem of AB 137 is that it fails to identify the date of valuation of the property. Endangered species are often &quot;discovered&quot; only upon application for a development permit. Does the 20 percent devaluation occur before or after the discovery, before or after the application?
<P>
Finally, both bills fail to adequately address two serious deficiencies in current ESA law: legislation can only meet the standards of the rule of law if it can be applied <I>generally</I> <I>and equally</I> to the whole population and if its enforcement is <I>predictable and certain</I>, not arbitrary or capricious. If a citizen must bear the cost of the presence of an animal that resides (however temporarily or seasonally) on his property, then that citizen is being regulated while his neighbor is not. The presence of the animal is <I>not </I>predictable, and the application of the law is therefore uncertain. If some (large) land owners can buy their way out of the compliance while others cannot, then the law is again uncertain. Under a uniform system of just compensation, the whole society will bear the cost of purchasing the land where the animal resides. This meets the test of the rule of law, and is also just and fair, since it is the whole society, through government policy, that is deriving benefit from the protection of the animal. 
<P>
<B>Reaffirming the Preeminence of Property Rights</B>
<P>
Assemblyman Olberg's requirement of compensation, establishing the preeminence of property rights over endangered species, is a huge improvement over current law. AB 137 accomplishes this simply, indeed elegantly. Under current law, endangered species regulation is imposed with impunity because there is no cost to the state or any other interested party that brings a lawsuit under the endangered species law; the property owner bears the entire burden.
<P>
If the philosophy behind AB 137 were enacted, the state would have to evaluate the full impact of endangered species regulation on a case by case basis. An ancillary benefit of requiring compensation would be that endangered species would be protected on the basis of rational inquiry, with a view to the protection of the rights of individual citizens. No longer would the cry that the environment is on the verge of collapse mandate the suspension of &quot;mere&quot; economic rights. 
<P>
This is not to say that wildlife preservation will be abandoned under a fair compensatory scheme. In fact, it would most likely be enhanced. One need only look at society's slavish attempt to recycle trash to recognize its commitment to nature and its moral desire to preserve the natural environment. Requiring compensation for the imposition of this environmental regulation will only enhance the opportunities for preservation. Compensation should virtually eliminate the &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up&quot; phenomenon because private efforts to preserve endangered species would be given an impetus not found under current law.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
If enacted, bills like SB 131 or the legislation that is certain to follow it would advance an already confused and unfair jurisprudence of regulatory takings cases. They would not help the average property owner. Moreover, such laws could be the Trojan Horse within which hide a new horde of regulations on &quot;biodiversity&quot; as well as more federal incursions into state affairs.
<P>
Despite its elegant brevity, AB 137 could be improved. As the legislature considers AB 137, it should attempt to incorporate the following measures into the ultimate legislation. At minimum, a compensation scheme should include the following:
<UL>
<LI>A declaration of condemnation should be required of a state agency invoking the CESA, in a court of competent jurisdiction near the situs of the taking. If the state wishes to impose its will to the detriment of the individual, it should be incumbent upon the state to initiate the compensation action, and to do so in the area affected by the law. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>Partial and temporary takings should be fully compensated. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>Compensation should occur when the regulation is imposed, and the value of the land should be taken into account at that time, given the owner's reasonable, individual expectations for the development potential of the land. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>Nothing in the compensatory scheme should prevent citizen claims under the common law doctrine of inverse condemnation, which allows individuals to seek remedy for uncompensated takings. If the government does not follow the law, a citizen should be able to initiate the process of compensation. However, a citizen subject to endangered species regulation should not have to endure the costly and time-consuming expense of pursuing an administrative mandamus claim as a prerequisite to his claim for damages. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>Separation of the real property estate on ecological grounds should be permitted where fair to the landowner. A severable environmental interest similar to the mineral estate, water resources, and other severable interests should be permitted to avoid total takings. This should save the government some funds while allowing continued use of the affected lands. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>At their option, individuals should be able to avoid condemnation of their land under application of the ESA. At the option of the land owner, he should be able to preserve critical habitat himself. Appropriate property tax incentives should be allowed to encourage the creation and preservation of habitat and to avoid the condemnation of private lands. This would become possible if the environmental estate were granted legal recognition. <FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<LI>Individuals should receive appropriate income tax benefits for grants of critical habitat to private, tax-exempt conservation organizations. Individuals who may not be able to take advantage of tax deductions should be able to sell their land that is burdened with critical habitat to private conservation organizations without incurring income tax liability on &quot;gain&quot; they may receive. If these measures are enacted, critical habitat will become a very marketable asset instead of a blight. Further, encouragement of private protection of critical habitat in lieu of direct government compensation will avoid depletion of the treasury, discourage government ownership of formerly private lands, and ensure proper stewardship of habitat.
</UL>

<P>
These steps are necessary to fulfill the objectives of an ordered system of liberty that observes all Constitutional rights and recognizes their interrelatedness. While AB 137 nearly reaches the mark, our Legislature should adopt a bolder vision, and ensure that property rights in California are not forgotten.

<h3>Introduction </h3>

This compendium offers over 217 specific reductions that could
be made in the 1995-1996 state budget.  Total savings from these
proposals amount to more than $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion
in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items.
 
<P>
In compiling this collection, our purpose is to show that there
are ample opportunities to reduce spending.  It will be said by
defenders of many of the items that they are &quot;small amounts&quot;
in the context of a $89 billion budget.  This is true, but it
misses the point. &quot;Small&quot; programs involve real dollars
that add up to millions, then tens of millions-all of it spent
on unnecessary state activities.  To regain control of the budget,
unnecessary spending of all kinds must be eliminated.  All that
is needed is the requisite resolve. 
<P>
 Budget developments in Sacramento and Washington present California
policy makers with both the responsibility and the opportunity
to begin a long overdue down-sizing of California's inefficient
administrative structure and the abolition of obsolete bureaucracies.
<P>
 
<P>
 The opportunity is obvious.  An overwhelming public sentiment
for economy in government produced a political sea-change at the
polls in 1994, which is now being translated into historic budget
reform in Congress.  Similarly, California's administration and
legislature have moved dramatically away from the days of record-breaking
tax increases and unchallenged bureaucratic growth.
<P>
 The obligation Sacramento owes to California's citizens is to
use this opportunity for genuine and permanent budgetary down-sizing
and reform.  Contrary to the rosy economic predictions of the
Department of Finance's &quot;May Revise,&quot; California is
still in deep financial difficulty.  The state's high tax rates
continue to place California at a significant competitive disadvantage
with neighboring states, and the increasing ability of commerce
to by-pass such obstacles bodes poorly for the future.  Furthermore,
the administration's tax cutting proposal only rolls back a quarter
of the 1991 tax increase which gravely deepened the 1990-1994
recession in California.  Finally, bureaucratic bloat seriously
reduces the government's ability to provide basic services such
as education, law enforcement and transportation.
<P>
<B>THE GROWTH OF STATE SPENDING</B>
<P>
It is an astonishing fact that a government whose budget has <I>quadrupled</I>
in 20 years now lacks the funds to educate its children, transport
its commerce or lock up its criminals.  The paradox is easily
explained with a simple calculator and a little basic common sense.
 Apply these tools to some current spending practices:
<UL>
<LI>Next year, it will cost $69,244 for every student attending
the University of California.
<LI>It will cost an average of $23,684 to house a prisoner in
the Department of Corrections.
</UL>

<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

<P>
<h4>SAVINGS</h4>

The combined budget cuts in this report will conserve
$11.7 billion, or about    $1,400  for every family of four in
California.

<P>
 The savings amount to about 13% of all funds proposed to be spent
in the Governor's  budget, or 18% of General and Special Funds.
<P>
 The proposals would eliminate $725 million in fees on California
citizens.
<P>
 $350 million would be returned to federal taxpayers.
<P>


<h3>REFORMS</h3>

<P>
This report identifies 217 budget items which could be
reduced or eliminated.

<P>
 We propose three broad reforms affecting many budget sections:
<P>
<ul>

<li>Bring the state prevailing wage into conformity with the federal Davis-Bacon standard;
<li>Implement Proposition 187;
<li>Adopt a 5% across-the-board salary rollback.
</ul>

<P>
112 agencies and commissions are proposed to be abolished, saving $1.7 billion and $725 million in fees.

<P>
85 programs with unjustified growth in overhead are identified,
and budget freezes or rollbacks are proposed with savings of $4 billion.

<P>
 10 opportunities for contracting out services are identified,
with $350 million  in potential savings.

<P>
13 operational reforms are proposed, with savings of $4.5
billion.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It will cost taxpayers $25.12 per hour in wages and benefits
for a flagman holding a stop and go sign under the state's prevailing
wage regulations.

<LI>Taxpayers will back every classroom of 30 students in this
state with $167,790 of public resources, or $5,593 per pupil.

<LI>Next year, taxpayers will buy the average legislator nearly
$800 in snacks and meals, and will spend $7,300 each for legislators'
luxury car leases.

<LI>Because of lavishly generous contracts for state employees
approved in 1992, an average working family now pays $125 more
in taxes to fund salary increases granted in the middle of the
worst recession this state has experienced in 50 years.
</UL>

<P>

Sadly, these practices are symptomatic of the deeply ingrained
habits of the state bureaucracy.  They are mere examples of spending
that is out of control.
<P>

The 1995-96 budget submitted to the legislature in January proposes
expenditures of $89.3 billion drawn from all sources: the state's
general and special funds, bond funds and federal trust funds.
 This constitutes $10,891 from the purchasing power of every family
of four in California which they pay directly as taxpayers, or
indirectly either as consumers through taxes passed along as higher
prices, or as employees and investors through taxes passed along
as lower wages and earnings.  This transfer of purchasing power
is not theoretical: the money expropriated for support of the
state government is real, it is massive, and ultimately it is
paid by the working people who comprise the private sector of
the economy.
<P>
In the last two years, state general and special fund spending
has increased by $3.2 billion, or 6.1 percent, producing a record
level of short term borrowing to bridge the gap between revenues
and expenditures.  In 1995, the administration and legislature
face a continuingly sluggish economy combined with the need to
retire $4 billion of short term notes carried over from the prior
fiscal year.
<P>
The Wilson administration has taken dramatic steps to stem the
spiraling costs of the state's health and welfare system, and
the reforms contained in the Governor's budget are vitally important
to continue this progress.  The administration has also succeeded
in eliminating a few unnecessary or duplicative bureaucracies-no
small task considering the institutional resistance to government
downsizing.  But much remains to be done to get state spending
under control.

<h3>A MENU OF BUDGET OPTIONS </h3>

The compendium of proposals offers a menu of reductions that total
$11.7 billion.  This will sound draconian to some people, especially
to politicians who are accustomed to incremental adjustments in
the rate of spending growth, not real cuts.  But $11.7 billion
is only 13 percent of the proposed budget of $89.3 billion.  If
all of the proposals were enacted, the state budget would return
to its 1989-1990 level in constant dollars.
<P>
It is true that many of the proposals for abolishing small programs
yield only one-time savings, as is the case when &quot;special
funds&quot; are abolished and their balances transferred to the
General Fund.  If the funds are abolished, they will not collect
the same fees and fines next year, so those savings will not be
available in future years.  However, these special funds <I>should
</I>be abolished unless they meet the test of a true &quot;user
fee&quot;-genuinely voluntary payments by citizens who derive
a tangible benefit from the agency's activities.  Such cases are
rare.  Most of the fees are not voluntary, and their proliferation
has created a web of hidden government costs and expenses.
<P>
The proposed reforms can be divided into four general classifications:

<UL>
<LI>Contracting out services the private sector can provide more
efficiently.
<LI>Abolishing superfluous or superannuated state agencies and
programs.
<LI>Freezing or rolling back out-of-control or unjustified budget
growth.
<LI>Operational reforms within individual agencies and across
the bureaucracy.
</UL>

<P>
<B>CONTRACTING OUT SERVICES</B>
<P>
A tangled web of constitutional and statutory prohibitions prevent
California government from using the private sector to obtain
the best possible services at the lowest possible cost.  Contracting
out state services not only opens up vastly less expensive ways
to provide these services, it introduces the missing element of
competition into the mix of incentives which act upon state bureaucracies.
 Forcing state managers to compete with private sector vendors
adds a powerful incentive-where none currently exists-to economize
and streamline operations.
<P>
The Reason Foundation has conducted extensive studies on privatizing
government operations, and the Pacific Research Institute has
showcased individual studies in its past <I>Government Efficiency
Reports</I>.  This compendium cites ten specific instances where
state programs could be contracted out to private vendors, either
by divesting current programs such as the State Fair and the Museum
of Science and Industry, or by contracting out specific functions
in agencies ranging from Corrections to General Services.  These
ten proposals would conserve more than $350 million, while in
many cases delivering a better quality of service than currently
provided by the bureaucracy.  This figure does not include the
elephantine one-time savings from the sale of state assets which
would accompany some privatizing proposals.
<P>
<B>ABOLISHING OBSOLETE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS</B>
<P>
This compendium identifies 112 various agencies or programs which,
bluntly stated, provide no vital services to the people of California
or merely duplicate services available elsewhere.  These proposals
include eliminating free cars and meals for legislators; discontinuing
state regulation of trades and professions ranging from barbers
to tax preparers; consolidating the Governor's cabinet to eliminate
an entire layer of middle-management; and abolishing agencies
such as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Cal-OSHA
and the state Banking Department which are entirely duplicative
of the work already performed by federal agencies.
<P>
These 112 programs together consume well over $1.7 billion in
state funds, and nearly $725 million in licensing and permitting
fees, fines and assessments which feed these bureaucracies and
are ultimately passed on to consumers as higher prices.  These
calculations do not include the unknown savings to consumers which
would result from greater competition within trades and professions
as bureaucratic barriers to entry are reduced.
<P>
<B>CONTROLLING BUREAUCRATIC BLOAT</B>
<P>
We have identified 85 budget sections which are experiencing extraordinary
growth in administrative overhead or in overall program delivery
costs.  For example, since 1992 the cost per student (full-time
equivalency) at the University of California has grown from $35,790
to $40,426 (not including extramural programs, which bring total
per pupil spending to $69,244), and at the California State University
from $11,100 to $12,065.  Since 1993, the cost per prisoner has
grown from $21,659 to $23,684, and even after excluding lease-payment
bond service has grown from $20,153 to $21,885.
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, California state employees received 5 percent
and 3 percent across-the-board salary increases respectively,
adding nearly $1 billion to state payroll costs and taking an
additional $125 from the average family through taxes.  These
salary boosts were provided despite studies by such organizations
as the American Legislative Exchange Council documenting that
California state employees earned on average 40 percent more in
wages than private sector employees performing the same work.
<P>
Administrative overhead has also continued to expand exponentially
in many bureaucracies.  The most dramatic example is the office
of the Governor's Secretary for Child Development and Education,
which has grown 1,032 percent in two years, in part because of
the addition of duplicative state and federal programs administered
through that office.  The office is itself duplicative of the
State Department of Education.  The Franchise Tax Board and Department
of Corporations are each increasing their budgets 25 percent over
two years, the State Coastal Conservancy, 44 percent; the Mobile
Source Program of the Air Resources board, 47 percent; the Managed
Risk Medical Insurance Board, 61 percent.  Administrative overhead
at the Department of Social Services will grow 80.1 percent and
will triple at the Department of Health Services.
<P>
The 85 proposals in this class would save over $4 billion from
all sources, in the most extreme examples by merely rolling back
per unit expenditures to the 1992/93 spending level or by rolling
back overall budgets to the 1993/94 expenditure level.
<P>
<B>OPERATIONAL REFORMS</B>
<P>
In several cases the operational reforms cited in this report
require implementing decisions the voters have already made at
the ballot box: returning legislative agencies under the Proposition
140 ceiling for the Legislature, and ceasing to provide services
for illegal aliens.  The three other major operational reforms
in this report involve conforming the state prevailing wage to
the federal Davis-Bacon standard; tax simplification, either through
the adoption of the Laffer flat tax proposal or conforming state
income tax law to federal codes; and capping the AFDC grant level
at 10 percent below the net wages one would earn in a full time
job at the minimum wage.
<P>
Together, these proposals would reduce expenditures from all sources
by $4.5 billion annually, in addition to the ancillary benefits
of increased tax compliance, and reduction of the welfare rolls
by voluntary return to work by chronic welfare dependents.
<P>
Some of the numbers in this report are estimates based on extrapolations
of studies done for prior budget years and others depend on statutory
or constitutional changes or upon actions of the federal government.
 Unless otherwise noted, references to &quot;the Governor's Budget&quot;
refer to Governor Wilson's 1995-96 proposed budget submitted to
the legislature on January 10, 1995, and all cost savings estimates
are based on the spending levels proposed in that budget.  In
most cases, &quot;reimbursements&quot; are included among special
fund savings, except when programs are proposed to be eliminated.
 Section numbers refer to the affected budget section.  The aggregate
figures reflect about $250 million in overlapping proposals, principally
in mass transit and Franchise Tax Board proposals.

perquisites, there is still much that can be cut from the pending
budget.  As recently as March 7, 1995, the <I>Sacramento Bee</I>,
hardly a bellwether of fiscal conservatism, complained that the
Assembly had just spent $149,000 to remodel a new office, hired
two Assembly chief administrative officers ($10,758 per month
each) and handed out double-digit pay increases to legislative
staff.  The <I>Bee</I> observed, &quot;As the speakership fight
wanes for now, both parties in the Assembly seem to have settled
down to the real business of this session-sharing the booty. 
When the voters approved term limits in 1990, they also approved
a provision to cut the Legislature's budget by 38 percent.  Maybe
they didn't cut enough.&quot;
<P>
The Legislature's spending spree, which was presaged by a 40 percent
salary increase granted by the &quot;Citizen's Compensation Commission&quot;
and effective December 5th, was made possible by a bit of legerdemain
which the <I>Bee</I> and many other newspapers supported.  SB
37, enacted in 1993, transferred two vital agencies-the legislative
analyst and the auditor general-out from under the voter-approved
ceiling on legislative spending, allowing legislators to evade
the effect of the cuts.  The proposals outlined in this part of
our report would restore that intent, and highlight a few of the
additional cuts which could be made in legislative spending without
adversely affecting the legislature's ability to address public
policy.
<P>
But the Legislature is a tiny-though instructive-part of the overall
problem.
<P>
California's executive authority has been divided and bifurcated,
causing inefficiency and redundancy.  One obvious example is the
Lieutenant Governor's office, a vestige of the 19th century which
still costs taxpayers over $1 million annually.  Bureaucratic
bloat within the organizational structure of the executive branch
during the last thirty years has developed an entirely superfluous
level of middle-management which could be eliminated with a simple
consolidation of departmental functions.
<P>
By far the largest component of the reforms in this division-and
the most radical-is the proposed Laffer tax reform plan, which
would abolish the current tax codes and replace them with a streamlined
flat rate income tax and value added (sales) tax.  We estimate
this single reform would save nearly $50 million in administrative
and enforcement costs of the Board of Equalization and at least
$150 million in Franchise Tax Board costs, bringing the total
savings to more than $200 million in state enforcement and administration,
exclusive of county savings from abolition of the county tax collectors
and assessors and elimination of the collection apparatuses of
the mystifying tangle of local fees.  This figure is also exclusive
of the unknown compliance cost savings to taxpayers and the dynamic
economic effect of such a plan.
<P>
<B>0100.  Eliminate legislators' free automobile program</B>
<P>
Comments: Last fiscal year, legislators' free cars cost taxpayers
$878,000.  The proposed budget for next fiscal year would cost
taxpayers $1.042 million-an increase of 18.6 percent over two
years.  It should be noted that legislators received a 40 percent
pay increase in December.
<P>
Savings: $1.042 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Declare a one-year moratorium on new furniture and office
equipment for legislators</B>
<P>
Comments: New furnishings and equipment in the legislature's budget
will cost taxpayers $1.447 million, at a time when few families
can afford new furnishings for themselves.
<P>
Savings: $1.447 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Abolish legislators' office remodeling</B>
<P>
Comments: The recent scandal involving the Speaker's secret approval
of a state-of-the-art telecommunications center provides graphic
illustration of the abuses within the current system.  Meanwhile,
the Senate has nearly doubled its remodeling budget from $83,000
in 1993-94 to $160,000 in 1995-96.
<P>
Savings: $0.556 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Let legislators pay for their own meals</B>
<P>
Comments: $95,000 is budgeted for legislators' meals next year-nearly
$800 per legislator.  Requiring legislators to pick up the tab
for their own meals is not an unreasonable request. 
<P>
Savings: $0.095 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Reduce legislature's budget to reflect General Fund
cost of State Auditor General</B>
<P>
Comments: Under the provisions of Proposition 140, the Auditor
General was supposed to be paid from the legislature's budget.
 Instead of obeying the public will, the legislature transferred
the Auditor General to a separate line item, freeing the difference
for legislative extravagances.  This proposal restores the intent
of the people.
<P>
Savings: $8.238 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Reduce legislature's budget to reflect General Fund
cost of Legislative Counsel</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Counsel is employed by the legislature
to do the work of the legislature and should be included under
the Proposition 140 ceiling.  Returning the Legislative Counsel
to the legislature's expenditure limit would also provide legislators
with an incentive to avoid unnecessary bill introductions.  This
need is underscored by the introduction this session of &quot;joke&quot;
bills that would make poverty a crime and reduce the voting age
to 14.  These &quot;jokes&quot; consume the real money of taxpayers
who are unlikely to share the legislators' amusement.
<P>
Savings: $54.025 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0100.  Roll back salaries of legislators to $52,500</B>
<P>
Comments:  Amidst the state's worst recession in fifty years,
California legislators were granted a 40 percent salary increase
by the &quot;Citizen's Commission on Compensation.&quot;  Rolling
back salaries to last year's level would save taxpayers more than
$4 million.
<P>
Savings: $4.422 million (GF) 
<P>
<B>0250.  Reduce Appointed-Counsel program to reflect actual workload</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst recommends a reduction of $5.7
million for this program &quot;because the requested amount is
not justified on a cost and workload basis.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $5.7 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0250.  Reduce record storage request of Judicial Council</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst recommends a reduction in this
item &quot;because costs can be absorbed from within existing
facilities operations expenditures.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $0.126 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0450.  Abolish &quot;Collection Enhancement&quot; function
of trial court funding</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst points out that under the Governor's
realignment proposal, the collection enhancement incentive of
$35 million per year is simply unnecessary.
<P>
Savings: $35.300 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0450.  Eliminate court-appointed counsel for juveniles in certain
civil actions</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has suggested this reduction,
involving such actions as child custody and visitation disputes.
 According to the LAO, &quot;because these actions are civil and
not criminal, the state does not have legal obligation to provide
the service.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $38.000 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0500.  Reduce Governor's office budget to reflect Proposition
140 mandate for legislative budget reductions</B>
<P>
Comments: The Governor's office budget has been frozen at $4.764
million since FY 1993-94, when it was reduced from its 1992-93
level of $6.7 million.  An additional reduction of $744,000 would
mirror the 40 percent reduction in legislative spending mandated
under Proposition 140. 
<P>
Savings: $0.744 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0510.  Abolish the Secretary for State and Consumer Services
and consolidate subordinate departments to report directly to
the Governor</B>
<P>
Comments: This is one of the cabinet &quot;super-agency&quot;
secretaries that were interposed in the 1960's between the departmental
directors and the Governor.  They constitute an unnecessary layer
of &quot;middle-management&quot; between the executive and the
individual departments.

subordinate departments to report directly to the Governor</B>
<P>
Comments: This agency is completely out of control.  As noted
by the Legislative Analyst, it has &quot;borrowed&quot; 36 staff
members from subordinate departments in addition to its own growing
budget.  It is one of the cabinet positions discussed in section

  $0.090 million (Fed)
<P>
<B>0558.  Abolish the Office of Secretary for Child Development
and Education</B>
<P>
Comments:  This bureaucracy within the Governor's office is slated
to grow a breathtaking 1,032 percent from 1993-94 to 1995-96 because
of the addition of the Volunteer and Mentor Service program and
the federal AmeriCorps program.  The secretary's position is duplicative
of functions of the State Department of Education.  Furthermore,
the Legislative Analyst has recommended deleting the Volunteer
and Mentor Service program because it duplicates AmeriCorps.

<B>0695.  Abolish the Natural Disaster Relief Fund and revert
balance to General Fund</B> Comments: The Natural Disaster Relief
Fund was the accounting receptacle for the temporary sales tax
increase from 1989-90 to pay for damage caused by the Loma Prieta
earthquake.  The surplus funds should be reverted to the General
Fund and ultimately returned to the taxpayers.
<P>
Savings: $30.014 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0750.  Abolish the Office of the Lieutenant Governor</B>
<P>
Comments:  This office is a vestige of the 19th century.  The
line of constitutional succession already extends well beyond
the Lt. Governor and modern communications technology and transportation
long ago eliminated the need for an &quot;acting&quot; Governor
in the physical absence of the real Governor.  This useless appendage
is growing at the rate of 14 percent over a two-year period.
<P>
Savings: $1.300 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0820.  Abolish the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement</B>

<P>
  $0.687 million (Fed)

<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has suggested this reduction
because the program duplicates local law enforcement programs.
<P>
Savings: $4.000 million (GF)
<P>
<B>0860.  Adopt the Laffer tax reform proposal and abolish administration
of all non-sales tax related enforcement and reduce administrative
costs</B>
<P>
Comments: The Laffer Tax reform proposal abolishes the current
California tax code and replaces it with a flat rate income tax
and value-added tax.  Such a reform would eliminate the need for
the ancillary tax enforcement and administration programs of the
Board of Equalization.

<P>
Comments: This agency is duplicative of functions performed by
the office of the Treasurer, the Controller, the Legislative Analyst
and the Department of Finance, not to mention private bond rating
agencies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's.
<P>
Savings: $1.373 million (SF)
<P>
<B>0971.  Abolish the California Alternative Energy Source Financing
Authority and revert balance of California Alternative Energy
Authority Fund to the General Fund.</B>
<P>
Comments: This authority duplicates what the market system can
do more efficiently and without taxpayer cost.  The Authority
is expected to begin the fiscal year with a balance in the California
Alternative Energy Authority Fund of $219,000 which could be reverted
to the General Fund.

<P>
The scandal-ridden commissions and bureaus of the State and Consumer
Services Agency unnecessarily cost taxpayers nearly a half billion
dollars annually in taxes and fees, and an incalculable amount
in higher consumer prices because of reduced competition in a
wide range of trades and professions, ranging from contractors
to tax preparers.  The largest saving in this division ($218,698,000)
comes from the abolition of 26 regulatory commissions.
<P>
There is a recognized need for state oversight of standards for
medical practitioners, and there is a general consensus that the
increased consumer cost for such regulation is justified by the
sensitivity of health care.  The same argument cannot be made
for the vast majority of trades and professions regulated by the
current system.  The $174 million in permitting fees and assessments
are directly passed on to consumers as increased prices, but the
real cost from reduced competition is incalculable.
<P>
The State Contractors License Board, for example, has virtually
eradicated the &quot;handyman&quot; of past generations who provided
low cost labor to small businesses and households.  Given the
consumer protection afforded by voluntarily negotiated bonds,
insurance, and the heavy civil and criminal penalties for breach
of contract and fraud, it is difficult to see what is accomplished
by the State Contractors License Board, except to erect a very
significant barrier to entry by competitors in a semi-skilled
trade.  It is not surprising that the most vigorous defenders
of the board are the state's existing contractors.  They are not
unique.  The principal constituencies for the continuation and
expansion of these boards are invariably the industries ostensibly
&quot;regulated&quot; by them.
<P>
The second largest savings in this division involves various and
conflicting proposals for reorganization of the Franchise Tax
Board.  The aggregate savings noted above are based on the largest
of these proposals, an estimate of FTB savings from conforming
California's personal income tax to a straight percentage of the
federal code.  A close second in FTB savings is the Laffer proposal
discussed in the introductory section of the LJE division above.
<P>
<B>1100.  Privatize the Museum of Science and Industry, abolish

<P>
Comments: This museum is a prime candidate for privatizing, as
has been recommended by a myriad of reports and studies.  In addition
to the savings noted from budget items, additional one-time General

  $0.431 million (GF-reversion)
<P>
<B>1110.  Abolish the Board of Accountancy; abolish Accountancy
Fund and revert balance to General Fund</B>
<P>
Comments: Accountancy certification could-and should-be done by
private professional associations and institutions of learning;
it does not require a state bureaucracy.  In addition to the one-time
General Fund savings by reverting the Accountancy fund balance,
abolition of the board will also allow elimination of $8,968,000
in fees paid by accountants.  Also, increased competition should
also result in a reduction in costs to the public.  It is not
in the consumers' interest to erect barriers to entry for this
profession.

<P>
Comments: This commission's services could-and should-be assumed

noted here, this reform would also relieve private parties from

<P>
Comments: Certification for barbering and cosmetology could-and
should-be done by private professional associations and institutions
of learning.  There is no benefit to consumers from erecting barriers
to entry for this trade.  In addition to the savings noted below,
this reform would save barbers and cosmetologists $9,523,000 in
annual permitting fees, and unknown savings to consumers from
increased competition.

<B>1110.  Abolish Cemetery Board; abolish Cemetery Fund and revert
balance to General Fund</B>
<P>
Comments: Based on the commission's past performance, it should
be obvious that private professional associations could do a better
job of policing the industry.  In addition to savings noted below,
cemetery operators would save $292,000 in permitting fees.
<P>

<P>
<B>1110.  Abolish Contractors State License Board; abolish Construction
Management Education Account and Contractors License Fund and
revert balances to General Fund</B>
<P>
Comments:  Despite the self-serving rhetoric about protecting
consumers from fly-by-night contractors, the principle purpose
of the Contractors State License Board is to act as a very significant
obstacle to entry by competitors.  Consumer protection in this
field is fully provided by voluntarily arranged bonds or insurance
and recourse to the courts.  Regulatory functions could be performed
by private professional associations.  Consumers' interests are
not served by erecting barriers to competition.  In addition to
the savings noted below, this reform would save consumers $38,182,000
in permitting fees which are passed on by contractors and would
produce unknown additional consumer savings due to increased competition.

Comments: The functions of this board could-and should-be performed
by private associations.  In addition to the General Fund savings
noted below, consumers would save $729,000 in permitting fees
which are passed along by operators, and unknown additional savings

was accomplished through private professional associations.  In

<P>
Comments:  This regulatory function was established in 1994. 
The start-up fund balance of $111,000 should be reverted to the

<P>
Comments: In 1993, the Pacific Research Institute published a
paper by Peter M. Towne, proposing a simplification of the California
Income Tax Code to essentially conform to the federal code on
a percentage basis.  He estimated savings of $117,358,000 in personnel,
printing, internal operations and facilities costs for FY 1990-91.
 On a proportional comparison, this reform would translate to
savings of $186.227 million for FY 1995-96.

<P>
<B>1730.  Merge the Franchise Tax Board into the Board of Equalization,
and reduce the combined budget 10 percent to reflect first year
cost savings</B>
<P>
Comments: California is nearly alone among the states in maintaining
two entirely separate bureaucracies to administer tax policy,
including separate offices in over 20 California cities.  Reducing
costs by just 10 percent from such a merger would save taxpayers
$61 million.  Legislation to do so was passed by the legislature
last year but vetoed by the Governor.

<P>
<B>1730.  Adopt the Laffer Flat tax proposal; reduce tax enforcement
expenditures by one-half; abolish Homeowners and Renters Assistance
and DMV Collections expenditures</B>
<P>
Comments: The Laffer Tax Reform proposal abolishes the current
California tax code and replaces it with a revenue-neutral combination
of a flat rate income tax and value-added tax.  It will vastly
simplify audit requirements by abolishing all deductions, exemptions,
credits, etc., thereby achieving at least a 50 percent reduction
in tax enforcement costs.  (Laffer estimates a 2/3 reduction in
enforcement costs.)  Administrative costs for tax checkoffs would
also be eliminated.  Home- owners and Renters Assistance and DMV
collections programs would also become obsolete.

<P>
<B>1760.  Contract out records storage operations of the State
Records Center</B>
<P>
Comments: According to a study by Mark F. Meier, president of
Record Systems Associates of Danville, immediate savings of between
$700,000 and $1 million could have been realized relative to FY
1990-91 expenditures by contracting out records storage operations,
or 22 percent of records management costs that year.  Using the
low end estimate as a proportional comparison, this savings would
translate to $1.970 million for FY 1995-96.
<P>
Savings: $1.970 million (SF)
<P>
<B>1760.  Privatize fleet administration of the Department of
General Services</B>
<P>
Comments: Based on 1992 expenditures for the administration of
all of the state's countless automobiles, Terry Flesia, CEO of
Autocross and Associates in Irvine, documented cost savings of
$67.644 million from privatizing fleet administration services
for state, county and municipal governments-approximately 19.3
percent of the estimated $350 million spent for fleet administration
by those governments.  Assuming a similar savings for the 1995-96
state budget, this reform would yield more than $5.5 million in
savings.

<P>
  $5.589 million (SF)
<P>
<B>1760.  Contract out State Printing Operations</B>
<P>
Comments:  Paul Page, President of Page Design, Inc. in Sacramento,
documented $5 million in cost savings by contracting out work
done by the Office of the State Printer, about 10 percent of state
printing expenditures, in PRI's January, 1993 report.

Savings: $0.619 million (GF)
<P>
  $3.745 million (SF)
<P>
<B>1760.  Privatize Ground Maintenance</B>
<P>
Comments: In 1993, the Assembly Republican Working Group chaired
by Assemblyman Dean Andal estimated that contracting out building
and landscape maintenance could save $2 million per year.  This
estimate appears to be in line with other privatization studies.
 If correct, the savings extrapolated from FY 1993-94 would be
$2.264 million.

<P>
The Business, Transportation and Housing division of the budget
could be cut by over $1 billion next year without seriously affecting
the business, transportation or housing condition of the state.
 Indeed, many reforms would improve the state's ability to promote
business, move people and commerce and increase housing, by removing
layers of accreted bureaucracy and the crushing compliance and
tax costs of supporting it.
<P>
The overlapping and duplicative jurisdictions in the state are
illustrated by the proposals to abolish such time-honored institutions
as the state Department of Banking, and the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board.  Would such actions suddenly expose the public
to insolvent financial institutions and rampant alcoholism?  Hardly.
 Banks and savings and loan institutions are already chartered
and regulated by the federal government; the state's parallel
structure is a vestige of the last century which could be eliminated
by transferring the few remaining state chartered institutions
to federal oversight.  The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board does
not enforce age or impairment laws-local police departments do.
 The ABC Board exists primarily to restrict the issuance of liquor
licenses as a barrier to entry of retail competitors.  If restricting
alcoholic beverage sales is desirable public policy, it should
be done directly through legislation and not furtively through
bureaucratic interference.
<P>
By far the largest savings can be found in transportation expenditures.
 Through Propositions 111 and 116, unprecedented levels of funding
have been provided by California's taxpayers to meet the state's
transportation needs, but these funds have so far not produced
the transportation renaissance that voters were promised.  The
Legislative Analyst is now raising serious questions about the
efficacy of some of the state's mass transit systems, echoing
concerns which have been raised for years by such institutions
as the Reason Foundation.  After spending billions of dollars
over the past several years for such projects, they have failed
not only to alleviate surface road congestion, recent studies
suggest the ratio of passengers per vehicle is <I>decreasing</I>.
<P>
For these reasons, perhaps the time has come to re-examine the
effectiveness of the state's mass transit expenditures and to
insist that they meet the same standards as private sector mass
transit: that the demand for such service is sufficient to pay
for providing that service.
<P>
<B>2100.  Abolish the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control;
abolish Alcohol Beverage Control Fund and revert balance to General
Fund</B>
<P>
Comments: This bureaucracy regulates the issuance of alcoholic
beverage licenses, a pointless exercise which needlessly adds
to business expenses with no public safety benefits.  Enforcement
of age restrictions on alcohol purchases is accomplished by local
law enforcement agencies.  In addition to the savings below, the
public would be saved $33,045,000 in annual licensing fees.
<P>
Savings: $6.467 million (GF)
<P>
<B>2120.  Abolish the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board;
abolish the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Fund and revert

<P>
Comments: This is an adjunct of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage

<P>
Comments: There is no reason to maintain an entirely redundant
state banking agency while the federal government provides precisely
the same regulatory functions.  In addition to the savings noted
below, this reform will repeal $14,735,000 in fees.

Program of the Department of Housing and Community Development</B>
<P>
Comments: Those aspects of the Codes and Standards Program which
involve building and safety standards for mobile or manufactured
homes should be supported by the dedicated special funds established
for this purpose.  The program's other functions merely duplicate
local government jurisdiction and should be eliminated.

<P>
Comments:  Amazingly, more than a decade after initiation of the

<P>
Comments: The LAO recommends reducing the housing program administrative
staff by $800,000.  According to the LAO, the HCD should &quot;redesign
its loan monitoring program to reduce costs and 
<P>

<P>
<B>2240.  Reduce administrative overhead for monitoring HCD's

<P>
Comments: The LAO recommends a reduction of 15 positions:  the
HCD &quot;should ensure that its monitoring program reflects the

<P>
Comments: This program, enacted by voters as Proposition 116 in
1990 and dedicated to mass transit systems, has neither cleaned
the air nor improved upon the state's transportation needs.  $367
million in bond funds is to be expended on this program next year.
 These funds should be used to redeem bonds already sold or at

Comments: Because of their limited range, bicycle travel is by
its very nature a local form of transportation and cannot be seriously
considered as significant to the state transportation system.

<B>2660.  Abolish mass transit subsidies</B>
<P>
Comments:  The state's mass transit programs are notoriously expensive
and inefficient, and should be supported from operating revenues.
 Furthermore, these programs are taking increasing portions of
state highway funds.  The Legislative Analyst reports that &quot;Highway
funds now provide the main source of state revenues to fund intercity

<P>
Comments: This program consumes $56.426 million per year, compared
to $25.690 million in 1990.  Thus, transportation planning costs
have more than doubled in five years.  Lamentably, transportation
projects have not.  In 1990, a study found that contracting out
services for planning could save at least 10 percent per year.
 Applied to non-federal expenditures for statewide and regional
planning in this year's budget, this reform would produce $1.436
million in savings.
<P>
Savings: $1.436 million (SF)
<P>
<B>2660.  Reduce Caltrans requests to restore $28.6 million in
legislative cuts</B>
<P>
Comments:  The LAO has recommended a cut of $28.6 million, mainly
for equipment and operating expenses to replace an unallocated
cut made by the legislature last year.  According to the LAO,
&quot;It was the intent of the Legislature that the $41.5 million
cut be a permanent reduction in expenditures.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $28.600 million (SF)
<P>
<B>2660.  Revert $2.9 million for expansion of intercity rail
service that will not occur</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has recommended that $2.9 million
for expansion of intercity rail service be reverted to the Transportation,
Planning and Development account because of delays in delivering
specialized cars and track and signal improvements.
<P>

<P>
<B>2660.  Reduce New Technology Research Program</B>

<P>
<B>2740.  Privatize the Department of Motor Vehicles</B>
<P>
Comments: In a 1993 Pacific Research Institute report, businessman
Ken Royal documented annual cost savings of $290 million by contracting
out various functions of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a 55
percent cost savings.  Royal also estimated $550 million resulting
from the sale of DMV assets.  Applied to the FY 1995-96 budget,
the operational savings would amount to nearly $300 million.

licensing fees next year, in addition to unknown consumer savings
from increased competition.

The Trade and Commerce agency was created in 1992, and like many

The proposals in the Resources division amount to nearly $900
million of cost savings through three basic reforms: withdrawal
of state participation in regional or local land use affairs;
abolition of obsolete or duplicative programs and, by far the
largest proposal, abolition of California's Beverage Recycling
Act which alone accounts for $359 million in fee reductions for
California consumers and $85 million in General Fund savings.
<P>
The first set of reforms propose to withdraw state funding and
participation in local or regional land use issues such as the
conservancies and agencies serving Lake Tahoe, the Santa Monica
Mountains, the Colorado River and the San Francisco Bay.  These
agencies serve essentially regional interests, and should be funded
and governed regionally, not subsidized by the state's taxpayers
as a whole.  By the use of such agencies, including the Coastal
Commission and Conservancy, the state has usurped and in some
cases abolished local authority over land use issues.  From a
fiscal standpoint this is wasteful, and from a policy standpoint,
it is questionable that the state government's wisdom over local
land use is superior to that of local officials.
<P>
The second set of reforms involve unnecessary commissions, the
California Energy Commission being the most expensive example.
 Even according to Resource Secretary Douglas Wheeler, the commission
&quot;has simply outlived its usefulness,&quot; yet instead of
abolishing it, the proposed budget transfers 92.5 percent of its
total annual budget to other departments.  If the commission &quot;has
simply outlived its usefulness,&quot; then simply renaming it
isn't going to help.  It should be (simply) abolished.
<P>
The largest and most controversial recommendation in this division
is abolition of the Beverage Container Recycling Program.  The
program, established in the late 1980s, now consumes nearly a
half billion dollars annually in fees and General Fund support.
 The fees alone add $45 to the grocery bill of an average family
of four.  The program was designed to accomplish two objectives:
to decrease litter and to increase recycling.  It is not clear
that the first objective has been significantly addressed, since
the measure took effect at the same time littering fines more
than doubled.  Clearly it has promoted additional recycling, but
whether this is economically justified is questionable.  By interfering
with the market inducements for recycling, the act has caused
gluts of recyclable material for which there is no market while
unnecessarily impacting the supplies which would be recycled without
this program.  The savings from allowing market forces to work
are substantial.

Comments: This program has become a multi-million dollar pork

Mineral Exhibit, construction of a &quot;flow-through seawater

<P>
Comments: According to the Legislative Analyst, &quot;At least
36 employees will be loaned to the Secretary (for Environmental
Protection) from other Cal-EPA boards and departments in 1994-95.
 This represents expenditures of $1.2 million in 1994-95, in addition
to the $1.6 million of personal service expenditures reflected
in the Secretary's budget.&quot;  If these positions are justified,
they should be forthrightly budgeted through the Secretary's office.
 They are demonstrably unnecessary in this item and should be
removed.

<P>
Comments: The LAO has withheld its recommendation on $2.8 million

 The purpose of this center primarily is to train CCC members

<P>
Comments:  The administration has formally called for abolition
of this commission.  As recently as February, Resource Agency
Secretary Douglas Wheeler wrote: &quot;The Energy Commission as
presently constituted has simply outlived its usefulness.  Created
in 1974 at the height of the Arab oil boycott and the national
energy crisis, the commission was designed for a time when energy
polices were unsettled because of great economic uncertainly,
utilities were proposing new rate increases and the prospect of
more nuclear power plans bitterly divided the state.&quot;  Regrettably,
the proposed budget provides $75.209 million for the Commission's
final year, transferring $34.792 million to the newly created
Department of Energy and Conservation at mid-year.  The mid-year
transfer translates to a $69.584 million annual budget, which
is hardly an abolition.  <I>It constitutes an effective decrease
of just 7.5 percent.</I>  In addition to the savings noted below,
the public would be saved $225,000 in annual fees and assessments.

<P>
Comments: The Beverage Container Recycling Program is an economic

<P>
Comments: The LAO has recommended a reduction of $401,000 &quot;for
four land use coordinators because the efficacy of these positions
will be limited by the lack of a clear policy regarding the department's
appropriate role and objectives in shaping federal and local land

<P>
<B>3600.  Abolish Natural Community Conservation Planning Program</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst withheld recommendation on making
the Natural Community Conservation Planning Pilot Program permanent,
in part due to the department's failure &quot;to provide information
requested by the Legislature that would enable an evaluation of
the success of the pilot program.&quot;  This program, however,
represents an intrusion of the state into local land use planning

The spending reductions recommended in this division amount to
$122 million in fees and expenditures.  The affected sections
have two things in common: the agencies are generally of recent
origin, and they are experiencing exponential increases in administrative
overhead and budget.  Increases range from the 23 percent two-year
growth in administration of the State Water Resources Control
Board to 72 percent expansion at the six-year old California Integrated
Waste Management Board (due to mid-year transfer of administration
of the Beverage Container Recycling Program).
<P>
The largest recommendation is for abolition of the California
Integrated Waste Management Board, which, exclusive of the transferred
recycling program, now consumes $75 million in annual permitting
fees and assessments which are ultimately paid by California families.
 Its principal responsibility is oversight of siting and administration
of local land fills, a function entirely duplicative of local
land use planning authorities.  State usurpation of this local
land use function might be justifiable as a means to overcome
predictable local opposition to siting, but this should then replace
and not merely duplicate local jurisdictions.  This six-year old
bureaucracy could be dissolved without any adverse effect upon
disposal of solid waste.

The administration has made tremendous progress in holding down,
and in some cases reversing, the growth of California's run-away
health and welfare programs.  Department of Health Services costs,
for example, have actually declined $340 million over the past
year.  In 1994, two-year growth in that department's budget came
to nearly $3.3 billion from all funds.  This year, two-year growth
comes to just $363 million-more than a ten-fold reduction in the
expansion of this bureaucracy.  The adoption of a large number
of cost-cutting proposals on Medi-Cal optional services, eligibility
and administration have had a dramatic effect on this division
of state expenditures.  Similarly, the administration's welfare
proposals move California away from welfare statism and toward
a more rational and realistic approach to chronic welfare dependency.
<P>
The $750 million in additional expenditure reductions contained
in this division represent a small fraction of total funds for
these programs, and are mainly comprised of the abolition of 
<P>
several ancillary offices such as the Commission on Aging and
the Office of Statewide Health Planning, and a number of relatively
small organizational and bookkeeping reforms.
<P>
The largest individual proposal is an additional $25 per month
reduction in AFDC grants below the cut contained in the Governor's
budget.  This reform would cap AFDC cash grants at a rate 10 percent
below net earnings at the minimum wage, thus providing a significant
differential between welfare dependency and full time entry-level
employment.  Extrapolating the administration's estimates on cost
savings, this would result in an additional $180 million in savings
from the state General Fund and the federal trust fund.

mode for provision of In-Home Supportive Services</B>
<P>
Comments: Noting widespread abuse and inefficiency in the provision
of In-Home Supportive Services, Robert H. Lucas, President of
Health Resources Management, Inc. in San Francisco, proposed &quot;expanding
the state's involvement in contracting and . . . adopting a case
management delivery and funding mode.&quot;  In a PRI paper released

<B>5180.  Cap AFDC payments 10 percent below the minimum wage</B>
<P>
Comments: Full-time employment at the minimum wage for 241 days
per year would provide an annual gross income of $8,194.  Assuming
payroll deductions of 15 percent, net income becomes $6,964.90,
or $580 per month.  The basic AFDC cash grant for a family of
three is currently $607 per month.  It is a quite rational and
realistic economic decision for welfare recipients not to seek
entry-level jobs.  A welfare career has several other significant
attractions: guaranteed job security, 365 days off each year and
full medical coverage.  And you are your own boss.  Add to these
factors the comparative income advantage and the incentives to
remain on welfare are decisive.
<P>
To correct this incentive, the administration has proposed a grant
reduction for a family of three from $607 per month to $547 per
month, and an increase in allowable earnings from $311 per month
to $400 per month for a savings of $219.5 million in General Fund
expenditures.  We propose an additional $25 per month reduction,
bringing the AFDC grant level ten percent below what could be
earned with a full time job at the minimum wage.  This would produce
$90 million in savings beyond the administration's proposal in
General Fund savings.

Savings: $91.450 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5180.  Reduce AFDC-FG funding to reflect caseload</B>
<P>
Comments: The LAO recommends reducing AFDC-FG budget to reflect
actual caseload growth.  According to the LAO: &quot;Our analysis
indicates that the department's caseload projections for the current
year are overstated by about 1.2 percent. . . . General Fund expenditures
are overstated by $24.7 million.&quot;

<P>
<B>5180.  Reduce state-only component of child care for Greater
Avenues for Independence and Cal Learn Programs</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has recommended reducing this

of AFDC to reflect caseload</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst recommends deletion of the &quot;offset

amount is in excess of projected county spending in 1995-96, based
on past trends adjusted for caseload growth, inflation and policy
changes.&quot;

<P>
<B>5180.  Reduce state payment to Options for Recovery Program

<P>
<B>5180.  Eliminate &quot;advance pay&quot; option of IHSS</B>
<P>

<P>
Savings: $4.000 (GF) 
<P>
<B>5180.  Limit AFDC-Unemployment grants by deleting the adult
portion of grant after 6 months</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has made this recommendation
for modifying the program which supports AFDC-U recipients.  The
LAO argues that &quot;AFDC-U recipients, by definition, are two-parent
families who have had an attachment to the labor force and would
therefore be likely to focus on finding employment during their
spell on aid.&quot;

<h3>Youth and Adult Corrections</h3>
<P>
$370,774,000 General Fund
<P>
$19,698,000 Special Funds
</CENTER>

<P>
Ironically, while political sentiment has finally hardened in
favor of longer sentences for violent criminals and habitual felons,
out-of-control prison costs are threatening the ability of the
state to act on this consensus and house additional prisoners.
<P>
Costs in the Department of Corrections are simply out of control.
 Between 1993/94 and 1995/96, the average daily population of
adult inmates is expected to grow 15.3 percent while the incarceration
cost is expected to grow 26.2 percent.  The cost per inmate has
increased from $21,659 to $23,684 per prisoner.  Part of this
increase is due to circumvention of Article XVI of the Constitution,
which requires voter approval of bonded indebtedness.  In recent
years, this requirement has been evaded by the use of revenue
bonds, and the repayment of those bonds has been made directly
out of the Department's operating budget:

<P>
<h4>Institution</h4>

<pre>
Program  Average Cost

YEAR  Budget   Population Per Inmate

92/93  $2,139,679  104,364  $20,502

93/94  $2,502,326  115,534  $21,659

94/95  $2,744,405  121,663  $22,557

95/96  $3,157,089  133,295  $23,684

</pre>

<P>
Even after this budgeting gimmick and Prison Industries overhead
(discussed below) is factored out, <I>per prisoner</I> costs have
still increased 8.6 percent over the two year period, from $20,153
to $21,885 per prisoner.  Some of this increase has been due to
reductions in the inmate to staff ratio and to continuing increases
in labor costs.  In recommending a $30.5 million reduction in
operating fund increases proposed by the administration, the Legislative
Analyst wrote: &quot;we can find no analytical basis for granting
such an inflation adjustment to the CDC at a time when other departments
and agencies must forego similar increases.&quot;
<P>
The largest single proposal in this division is freezing the per-prisoner
funding level at last year's level ($20,153).  Athough this does
not account for inflation, it could be accomplished by restoring
inmate to staff ratios to the 1993/94 level and other operational
changes.  This level would still be well above the $16,000 annual
per prisoner cost commonly cited for the Texas Department of Corrections,
which practices a number of cost saving innovations from an extensive
prison work program to privatizing minimum security operations.
 Indeed, Texas maintains some 14,100 inmates in private facilities,
at a substantial cost savings.
<P>
<B>5240.  Freeze per prisoner funding at 1993/94 level (exclusive
of bond repayments) of $20,153</B>
<P>
Comments: Excluding the revenue bond repayments and Prison Industries
expenditures, capping prison expenditures at the 1993/94 per prisoner
level of $20,153 would save $1,732 per inmate, or $231 million
and would still provide significantly more than states such as
Texas.
<P>
Savings: $230.861 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Abolish the Civil Addict Program</B>
<P>
Comments: In 1993, the Legislative Analyst concluded that the
Civil Addict Program had failed to achieve its goals and called
for its abolition.  The LAO recommends deletion of a $1 million
augmentation in the current budget.
<P>
Savings: $1.000 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Roll back administrative overhead of Department of Corrections

Savings: $37.897 (GF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Cease paying salaries to inmates in Prison Industries
and eliminate civil service status for Prison Industries employees</B>
<P>
Comments: Senator Rob Hurtt's office estimated cost savings in
excess of $7 million from these reforms for FY 1993/94.  Hurtt's
office noted that &quot;In 1993, the Texas prison industry program
employed 75 percent of its inmates and generated net savings to
the Department of Criminal Justice of $6 million while our state
employed only 6 percent of total inmates and generated a net loss
of $5 million. . . .&quot;  The Director of Prison Industries,
Texas Department of Criminal Justice, makes this case very plainly:
 &quot;The reason California loses money is because you pay your
inmates.  If I had to do that we'd be broke in a week.&quot; 
His office also estimated 10 percent savings from allowing PIA
management to adjust positions based on workload.
<P>
Savings: $7.300 million (SF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Deport Illegal Aliens upon prison release</B>
<P>
Comments: According to the Assembly Republican Working Group/Draft
Report, $9.7 million was spent in FY 1993/94 for parole supervision
of 4,600 illegal aliens allowed to remain in the U.S.
<P>
Savings: $9.706 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Eliminate Leisure Time Activities for Prisoners</B>
<P>
Comments: According to the 1993 Assembly Republican Working Group,
&quot;Televisions and athletic uniforms should be paid for by
the inmates, not the taxpayers.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $12.398 million (SF)
<P>
<B>5240.  Privatize Department of Corrections management and operations</B>
<P>
Comments:  Many states, including Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Texas, already contract out management of prison operations
for substantial cost savings.  In a report for the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Association in 1990, the Reason Foundation estimated
$212 million in operational savings from such reforms.  In 1993,
the Office of Senator Rob Hurtt estimated cost savings of $2,800
per prisoner, or $327.7 million.  If ten percent of the prison
population were placed under such management, $37.323 million
could be expected in savings.
<P>
Savings: $37.323 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5430.  Abolish the Board of Corrections</B>
<P>
Comments: The Board of Corrections duplicates the functions of
local law enforcement agencies for jail planning and officer training.
 Its remaining functions could be absorbed by the Department of
Corrections.
<P>
Savings: $50.840 million (GF)
<P>
<B>5450.  Abolish the Youthful Offender Parole Board</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has suggested abolishing the
board and instead to rely on the Youth Authority for parole determinations,
since &quot;the YOPB relies on Youth Authority staff recommendations
over 85 percent of the time for parole determinations.&quot;

Education expenditures in the 1995-96 budget vary widely: $3,294
per student for the Community Colleges; $5,593 for K-12 public
schools; $12,065 for the California State University; and a breathtaking
$69,244 per year for every student attending the University of
California.  What is particularly amazing is the fact that while
enrollment has declined since 1992-93 at all three post-secondary
systems, their budgets have continued to increase.
<P>
Most of the savings proposed in this division come from freezing
per student expenditures for the post-secondary institutions at
their 1992/93 levels, saving $1.28 billion at the three university
systems.  This freeze of per pupil expenditures at 1992/93 levels
does not account for inflation rates during the intervening period,
but rather assumes cost saving adjustments which have been recommended
to the universities and colleges for years, including slight increases
in the student/instructor ratios or in the course teaching requirements
for professors.
<P>
<B>6110.  Roll back administrative costs of the Department of

<B>6110.  Abolish Voluntary Desegregation Programs</B>
<P>
Comments: Current law provides for 80 percent reimbursement of
costs to school districts for implementing voluntary desegregation
programs or programs that &quot;alleviate the harmful effects
of racial segregation.&quot;  However, according to the Legislative
Analyst, the state has no method for assessing the outcome of
the various programs, nor is it clear any are needed to meet constitutional
requirements.  Indeed, the absence of specific court findings
of discrimination 
<P>
suggest that these expenditures are not necessary for meeting
legal mandates.  Abolishing these programs would result in savings
of approximately $460 per classroom.

<P>
<B>6110.  Reduce reimbursement to school districts for Public

direct classroom instruction.  The LAO suggests these initiatives
be postponed.
<P>
1. $20 million to expand child development programs beginning
January 1996.

<B>6110.  Suspend Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for

Comments: The Legislative Analyst has proposed three alternative
approaches to suspending the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee,
with savings ranging from $200 million (suspending the minimum
funding guarantee in 1994, but holding harmless the 1995-96 guarantee)
to $597 million by suspending the guarantee for both years.  The
LAO states that for 1994-95, &quot;this option would not eliminate
any funding already appropriated in 1994-95 or drop them below
the per-pupil funding level envisioned in the 1994 Budget Act.&quot;
 For 1995-96, the proposal would simply eliminate the scheduled

<P>
Comments: Prior to 1970, teacher Credentialing was the province
of individual school districts, deciding for themselves their

<B>6440.  Freeze per student budgeted program costs of the University
of California at $35,790</B>
<P>
Comments: Assuming enrollment trends last year continue this year,
the University of California is proposing to spend an average
of $40,426 per student on budgeted programs.  Between 1992/93
and 1994/95, UC full time equivalent student enrollment declined
3.1 percent while expenditures grew by 4.3 percent.  Between 1993/94
and 1994/95, enrollment declined 1.8 percent, while total university
spending grew 4.5 percent.  The University still has not made
available its enrollment estimates for 1995/96.  If per FTE university
costs were capped at their 1992/93 level of  $35,790, and we use
1994/95 enrollment minus 1.8 percent, savings would exceed $680
million.
<P>

<P>
<B>6440.  Redirect funds from teaching hospitals</B>
<P>

<P>
Savings: $9 million (GF)
<P>
<B>6440.  Reduce University research budget</B>
<P>
Comments: In its budget analysis, the LAO recommends a reduction
of $24.8 million, opining that &quot;We believe the UC can adjust
to a lower level of General Fund support for research by setting
priorities among research activities to ensure that the highest
priorities are addressed and by relying to a greater degree on
systemwide competition for research grants.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $33.8 million (GF)
<P>
<B>6610.  Freeze per student expenditures of the California State
University at $11,100 per student</B>
<P>
Comments: Between 1992/93 and 1994/95, CSU full time equivalent
student enrollment decreased by 3.4 percent, while expenditures
grew by 6.9 percent.  Between 1993/94 and 1994/95, enrollment
grew 1.1 percent, while total university spending grew 8.0 percent.
 The university has still not made available its enrollment estimates
for 1995/96.  If per FTE university costs were capped at their
1992/93 level of $11,100 per student, and we use 1994/95 enrollment
plus 1.6 percent, it would save $121.066 million from the University's
budget request, which could be accomplished by reducing the General
Fund appropriation by that amount.
<P>
Savings: $121.066 million (GF)
<P>

budget balancing option, stating the &quot;System would have to
live with current-year funding level.&quot;
<P>
Savings: $31.000 million (GF)
<P>
<B>6870.  Freeze per student expenditures of the California Community
Colleges at $2,762 per student</B>
<P>
Comments: From 1992/93 to 1995/96, the Community Colleges anticipate
an enrollment decline of  2.8 percent, but increased expenditures
of 15.9 percent.  If the per student cost were capped at the 1992/93
rate of $2,762 per student, savings of nearly half a billion dollars
would result.
<P>
Savings: $478.965 million (GF)
<P>
<B>6870.  Suspend Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for
community colleges for 1994-95 and 1995-96</B>
<P>
Comments: The Legislative Analyst has proposed three alternative
approaches to suspending the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee,
with savings ranging from $47 million (suspending the minimum

to $99 million by suspending the guarantee for both years.  The
LAO states that for 1994-95, &quot;this option would not eliminate
any funding already appropriated in 1994-95 or drop them below
the per-pupil funding level envisioned in the 1994 Budget Act.&quot;
 For 1995-96, the proposal would simply eliminate the scheduled

Administration Fund and Student Tuition Recovery Fund and revert
balances to General Fund</B>
<P>
Comments: This bureaucracy was transferred from the State Department
of Consumer Affairs in 1991, where it prospers today with an increase
of 11.8 percent over the current year.  The Council's functions
could be provided entirely through private accrediting associations.
 In addition to the savings noted below, this reform would save

<P>
Comments: Gov. Deukmejian abolished Cal-OSHA in the 1980's, only
to have it reimposed by initiative.  The collective wisdom of
the electorate notwithstanding, this program is entirely duplicative
of the federal OSHA and has grown nearly 25 percent in two years.

positions [in addition to the 91 positions for the Claims Adjudication
Unit discussed above] that the DWC is keeping vacant.  These positions

<P>
Comments: This commission was designed to curb legislative salary
abuses, yet its first act was to increase legislators' salaries.
 Last year, it ignited a firestorm of protest when it granted

<B>8800.  Reduce Memberships in Interstate Organizations</B>
<P>
Comments: California is the largest state in the nation and has
vast resources to provide for itself the policy-making chores
that the various interstate organizations perform.  For small
states, membership in interstate organizations may be cost effective.
 For the largest state, it seldom is.  Membership fees are proposed

<h3>Other Proposals</h3>
<P>
$4,410,000,000 General and Special Funds
</CENTER>

<P>
This final division involves three broad-based cost reduction
proposals which affect a large number of individual budget sections
and special funds:
<UL>
<LI>a five percent across-the-board rollback of state employee
salaries, partially offsetting the eight percent salary increase
granted to them during the past two years;
<LI>conformity of the state's prevailing wage regulations with
federal standards;
<LI>and implementation of Proposition 187, which comprises the
single largest cost saving option in this report.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>A.  Implement a 5 percent across-the-board salary rollback</B>
<P>
Comments: State employees have received an 8 percent across-the-board
salary increase over the last two years, despite a statewide economic
recession and despite studies indicating 40 percent overall higher
wages than paid for comparable work in the private sector.  For
99 percent of all employees who are not already at the highest
pay scale in their category, <I>the practical effect of this reform
would be to freeze their current income.</I>  And at the end of
this three year period, the state employees would be likely still
to be paid more than their private sector counterparts.  This
is not an unreasonable request, particularly when the practical
effect is a wage freeze-not a wage reduction-for all but those
at the very top of their pay scale.  The state's system-wide payroll
is $11.8 billion; a 5 percent salary rollback would save taxpayers
more than a half billion dollars.
<P>
Savings: $590 million (GF &amp; SF)
<P>
<B>B.  Conform state prevailing wage to federal Davis-Bacon Act</B>
<P>
Comments: The state's bloated prevailing wage is now routinely
paying unskilled labor on taxpayer-financed projects in excess
of $26 per hour in wages and benefits.  According to a 1993 PRI
report by former Assemblyman Robert Cline, simple conformity with
federal requirements would have saved an estimated 20 percent
on wages, saving the state at least $170 million annually and
perhaps as high as $340 million.
<P>
Savings: $170.000 million (GF &amp; SF)
<P>
<B>C.  Implement Proposition 187</B>
<P>
Comments: It should be noted that the largest single cost saving
reform available to the state has already been mandated by the
voters through their adoption of Proposition 187 in November of
1994.  This mandate, now stayed pending judicial review, would
save public schools $1.7 billion according to the Department of
Finance (adding about $10,000 to every classroom in the state
or conversely saving every taxpaying family more than $200 per
year), and a total of $3.65 billion in overall costs, or $456
for every family of four in California. 
<P>
Savings: $3,650.000 million (GF &amp; SF)

<h1>The Endangered Species Act Reconsidered</h1>

<h3>How Congress Can Restore Balance and Common Sense 
    to the Protection of Endangered Species</h3>

</CENTER>

<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>


Republicans in the new Congress have assumed responsibility for
directing the nation's legislative agenda for the first time in
nearly half a century.  Among the most important issues they must
consider in 1995 is the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due for
reauthorization this year.
<P>
Reauthorization of the ESA is certain to engender fierce debate
in Congress.  The ESA needs to be changed in fundamental ways,
not only in its actual workings and administration by a zealous
bureaucracy, but also in its design and purpose.  The public needs
to understand what is at stake in this debate, and both Congress
and state lawmakers need to be alert to the land mines awaiting
the implementation of attempted reforms.
<P>
The emerging debate on the ESA may well be more intense than those
over the Balanced Budget Amendment or welfare reform.  This is
because it will force Congress and the nation to choose between
individual liberty and big government.  For the first time since
the beginnings of the environmental movement in the 1970s, a major
environmental policy will be evaluated on the basis of the actual
results of its enforcement, and not the self-congratulatory rhetoric
of the bureaucrats who administer it.  For the first time since
its passage in 1973, the ESA will be debated as a matter of <I>public
policy</I>, not a matter of state religion.  In their deliberations,
the people's representatives will have to weigh the possibility-indeed,
the considerable evidence-that the ESA has done more harm than
good to the environment.  For all these reasons, the ESA debate
will stand as a watershed event in the history of environmental
legislation.
<P>
<B>The Political Species Act</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has been described as one of the most
far-reaching laws ever passed, yet most Americans are only vaguely
aware of its profoundly radical character.  Unlike most laws,
which attempt to balance competing interests in an effort to achieve
equitable results, the ESA is virtually absolute in its favoritism
toward what its authors perceived to be &quot;environmental&quot;
interests.  Under the ESA, an &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;
species is <I>always </I>favored over the competing interests
of men.
<P>
Like all special interest legislation, the ESA is unevenly applied.
 Few exceptions to the ESA are allowed, but with enough political
clout the law can be circumvented.  For example, when a little
fish called the snail darter held up the Tennessee Valley Authority's
giant Tellico dam project in Tennessee, Senator Howard Baker led
the charge in Congress to create special legislation to exempt
the project from the Act.  Other <I>ad hoc</I> exemptions followed,
including limited exceptions for agricultural pests and the so-called
&quot;God Squad&quot; cabinet level exemption, whereby a committee
of cabinet heads may override the law and thereby pass judgment
on the fate of a threatened or endangered species.
<P>
Sometimes this special interest favoritism goes too far and the
courts intervene.  In the case of the controversy of the Northern
Spotted Owl, for example, a federal court ruled that Congressional
antics to overrule a lower court's findings were unconstitutional.
 But in general, political exceptions to the ESA have little or
no relevance to ecology, and frequently go unchallenged.  This
arbitrariness is but one reason that the ESA is inimical to the
principle of the rule of law.  To be fair and just, a law must
be certain, and the ESA's application in particular cases is as
far from certain as the bald eagle is from extinction.
<P>
<B>&quot;Shoot, Shovel, and Shut Up&quot;:  Advanced Weed Abatement
and Other Perverse Incentives Of The Endangered Species Act</B>
<P>
That the ESA contains perverse incentives toward the destruction
of species is a fact that even environmental groups cannot deny.
 Because the ESA imposes the full burden of its costs on property
owners, property owners have a strong incentive to ensure that
there are no endangered species or habitat on their land.  Ever
since Richard P. Christy shot and killed a protected grizzly bear
that was marauding his livestock, landowners have sought to minimize
or eliminate any endangered species or endangered species habitat
from their property.  Examples are legion, from destruction of
habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker in the South to the careful
weed abatement practiced nearly everywhere else.  Such measures
are known in the West, and increasingly across the country, as
the code of &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up.&quot;  The court
that heard Christy's case ruled that under the ESA, he had no
right to protect his property from destruction by the bear.  But
most Americans, despite their sentimentality and charity toward
wildlife, put themselves ahead of all other species, endangered
or otherwise.
<P>
The law is equally unkind to those who might extend their charity
to help endangered species.  The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service is empowered to determine what constitutes &quot;harassment&quot;
of an endangered or threatened species.  All too often, productive
use of a private conservator's land is deemed &quot;harassment&quot;
and thus is prohibited.  It is therefore not surprising that private
efforts to create habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, the
northern grayling (a fish), and the bald eagle have been abandoned.
<P>
But Congress can and must learn from the remarkable private efforts-undertaken
before the enactment of the ESA-to restore the populations of
the wood duck, the bluebird, and the falcon, as well as dozens
of other endangered and threatened species.  The private sector
has proven its ability to protect truly endangered species, and
can do so again, but only if the current perverse incentives of
the ESA are removed.
<P>
<B>The Secret Process of Endangered Species Listings</B>
<P>
Central to the application of the ESA is the &quot;listing&quot;
of threatened and endangered species.  Such species are listed
through a complex political process that is completely outside
the arena of public debate and without the benefit of traditional
scientific analysis or peer review.  One U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service biologist determines whether or not a species is listed.
 Imagine our government permitting one physician to decree a serious
public health hazard!  Yet when it comes to endangered species
we are bound by the opinion of a single federal civil servant.
<P>
The failure of this system is illustrated by the listing as an
endangered species of the so-called Alabama Sturgeon.  That fish
is indistinguishable from other sturgeon that inhabit waters elsewhere,
and yet it was listed as endangered despite over-whelming scientific
evidence to the contrary.  U.S. Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL)
argued persuasively against the listing to no avail.  The story
of the Alabama Sturgeon is similar to that of the kangaroo rat,
another plentiful species listed as endangered because many distinct
populations in the West are smaller than the government thinks
they ought to be.
<P>
Saving every distinct population without regard to the real impact
on human beings is wrongheaded and impractical.  That it is wrong
is best illustrated by the unnecessary destruction of private
property caused by a wildfire fueled by uncleared brushbrush that
the government had declared kangaroo rat habitat.  Saving every
distinct population under the ESA is impractical in that huge
expenditures are made to protect creatures that are endangered
not due to human action but to the harshness of nature.  Moreover,
many species whose range lies primarily outside the geographical
United States are protected even though they are plentiful in
their chief habitats.  At the same time, funding for other, truly
endangered species goes wanting.  Despite self-congratulatory
rhetoric from federal agencies, there is no hard evidence that
a single species has been saved from extinction by application
of the ESA.
<P>
The dismal record of the ESA as a species-saving measure is well
documented.  Under the ESA several species have certainly become
extinct, and the government itself claims to have saved only one
species from extinction.  Like other command-and-control environmental
laws, the ESA fails to enhance the environment.  For the reasons
stated above, habitat is destroyed rather than enhanced, and truly
endangered species are further endangered by those who consider
them a blight on their land.  There is also a high probability
that many of the 853 species listed as endangered and the 3900
candidate species are not, in fact, endangered.  Many have been
listed for purely political purposes to serve the ends of special
interests or to enhance the reputation of the biologist who recommends
the listing.
<P>
Given public awareness of the absurd consequences of the listing
process, one might imagine that the federal bureaucracy would
at least try to improve it.  However, Senator Shelby has accurately
described the &quot;avalanche of proposed rules and the continuing
expansion of the law's scope beyond the preservation of species
in peril from immediate development.&quot;  Do Americans need
more bureaucratic experts making these decisions without regard
to their efficacy or the consequences to the citizenry?  The public,
not just pressure groups, should have a role in the listing process,
and all scientific evidence with regard to listing under the ESA
should be subjected to an academic's peer review process.
<P>
<B>The Real Costs of &quot;No Cost&quot; Federal Land-Use Controls</B>
<P>
The real impact of the ESA is that it amounts to a &quot;no cost&quot;
federal land-use law.  That is, it severely limits the use of
private lands and yet costs its advocates almost nothing to invoke.
 Many commentators have remarked that the ESA is but one of many
arrows in the quiver available to opponents of land development
and public projects.  In fact, a legal challenge to land development
can be made by any interested party seeking to invoke the ESA.
 If an invocation is successful and development is blocked, the
landowner must shoulder the cost of attorney's fees.  Since most
environmental groups have large budgets with which to pay their
lawyers and private landowners typically have little with which
to fight back with, it is nearly always a winning proposition
for a special interest group to try to invoke the ESA.  Even failed
challenges may result in an eventual victory.  Designation of
a species as &quot;threatened&quot; instead of &quot;endangered&quot;
has nearly the same effect-the private land-use or public project
may not proceed.  The ESA is actually more valuable to special
interest groups that want to block land development than that
it is to genuine environmentalists concerned with saving species.
<P>
Because the Fish and Wildlife Service is not constrained by cost
in its efforts to implement the law, application of the ESA is
said by its proponents to be &quot;free,&quot; but the actual
costs of the law are staggering.  From increased costs of raw
materials and financial hardship to landowners to the loss of
productivity of lands and tax losses to local government, the
true costs of the ESA certainly run into the billions of dollars
annually.  The notion that the ESA is &quot;free&quot; assumes
that it costs government little or nothing to enforce.  This view
fails to take into account the loss of liberty to the productive
sector of our economy.
<P>
<B>Environmentalism As a Religion</B>
<P>
One may wonder, given the poor record of the ESA, how such a law
can be supported.  To understand support for the ESA, one must
look to the law's origins.  During the 1960s there was growing
concern that human activity, particularly industrialization and
public works, was rapidly destroying many species that were vital
to the earth's ecosystems.  Lacking scientific agreement and scientific
support on the subject, many of those concerned with the issue
turned to an anti-Western philosophical argument to support a
new environmental policy.
<P>
The primary academic bulwark for this new philosophy of ecology
was the work of University of California at Los Angeles history
professor Lynn White.  White's thesis is that our Judeo-Christian
heritage, and Christianity in particular, is the root cause of
environmental pollution and destruction of the earth's ecosystems.
 White proposed a new ethic, essentially based on Eastern pantheism,
that was readily adopted by environmentalists.
<P>
Environmentalist pantheism asserts that all species are equal
and that mankind is the principal threat to the environment. 
To extreme environmentalists, mankind is a virus on the earth.
 Environmentalism grew in popularity as the American media was
announcing the &quot;death of God.&quot;  Hence it filled a spiritual
need for many Americans, especially among those most susceptible
to influence by the media and the academic elites.  When codified
into the ESA, a new religious order was created, officially sanctioned
by the government of the United States. Earth Day is its religious
holiday, dutifully celebrated by the faithful.
<P>
The ESA (1973) was enacted and the Environmental Protection Agency
(1971) established at the height of environmentalist enthusiasm.
But it is the wholesale, root-and-branch attack on our Western
heritage, not the goal of protecting endangered species, that
now alarms most Americans.  As an abstract idea, environmentalism
and reverence for the natural world had and still has broad appeal.
 But its popularity wanes in direct proportion to the visibility
and economic impact of its bureaucratic manifestations in everyday
life.  Experience with the ESA over the past twenty years has
generated a popular backlash against its excesses.  Radical environmentalism
today retains its religious character only on college campuses
and among clergy of &quot;progressive&quot; churches, where it
is one of the pillars of Political Correctness.  Outside that
insular world, most Americans are re-evaluating the impact and
legacy of that destructive era.
<P>
Despite its popularity among environmental activists, Professor
White's thesis has been widely disputed on both philosophical
and historical grounds.  Father Robert Sirico, a Paulist priest
and economist, squarely identifies the religious nature of environmentalism
and argues that it is inimical to our heritage.  Other writers
have also demonstrated the poverty of White's thesis against the
richness of the Western tradition and Judeo-Christian teaching.
 Christianity mandates individual<I> responsibility</I> as a necessary
corollary of individual <I>liberty</I>.  Whatever warm feelings
may come about from &quot;saving&quot; endangered species, adherence
to the basic tenets of &quot;species egalitarianism&quot; -that
all species are morally indistinguishable and that other species
are to be given priority over mankind's interests -is contrary
to our Western heritage and common sense. 
<P>
Most Americans have concluded that much of the environmentalist
litany is patently ridiculous.  If the premises of the ESA were
broadly accepted by the American public, we would let cows walk
in the streets, rats forage unmolested in our restaurants, and
bears roam in our school yards.  Moreover, reverence for &quot;natural
processes&quot; would mean abandonment of attempts to defeat the
HIV virus and other diseases.
<P>
<B>The Endangered Species Act and the Rule of Law</B>
<P>
Another sober realization now shaping the American political landscape
is that the Endangered Species Act works in opposition to the
economic interests of most Americans.  Unwary citizens can have
their entire estates bound up in land subjected to government
control, and thousands of jobs are lost through ESA enforcement.
 When it comes to endangered species, individuals are forced to
pit their own interests against the purported interests of the
state.
<P>
Thus it comes as no surprise that citizens &quot;shoot, shovel,
and shut up,&quot; cut down trees before they can become habitat,
ensure that weeds are plowed under rather than letting land lie
fallow, and fill all low spots to avoid vernal pools on their
land.  The fact that the law cannot be fairly applied without
extraordinary coercion is a telltale sign that it violates the
cornerstone of our ordered system of liberty-the rule of law.
<P>
Our legal system is based upon the rule of law.  It assumes that
the law exists to preserve the liberty <I>of the citizens</I>.
 To work, it must be universally applied and general enough to
receive the support of the populace.  It must also be certain
in its effects.  The ESA has popular support only when it is applied
against some giant corporation whose position in the community
may be easy to envy and criticize.  As regards certainty, it is
certain only that the ESA will yield disparate, unfair results.
 Landowners who do not destroy habitat will be affected, and then
only if the endangered species chooses their land instead of a
neighbor's.  It is also uncertain because government agencies
and large corporate interests can often buy special rules to avoid
it.  The ESA thus lacks the universality, generality and certainty
basic to the rule of law.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act needs to be amended.  Reform should
be grounded upon the principle of balance, and the objective of
the law should be to preserve not federal power but endangered
species.  The debate should begin from the premise that human
liberty is the guiding principle of American law.  Private property,
a vital prerequisite and safeguard of ordered liberty, should
not be denigrated.  Individual responsibility with regard to the
environment should be encouraged.
<P>
Congress must address specific deficiencies in the current law.
 But the first order of business should be to open up the debate
and insist on &quot;truth in advertising.&quot;  This means that
the philosophical underpinnings of the current program and the
proposed solutions should be openly discussed and called by their
right names.  The American people should not again submit to the
wholesale abandonment of their traditions and their liberties,
as when the ESA was passed in 1973.  If we wish to reauthorize
a new state religion-pantheistic environmentalism-we should be
open about doing so.  The law should not be &quot;curious,&quot;
as Chief Justice Warren Burger described the ESA in the case of
<I>TVA v.</I> <I>Hill</I>.  Its preferences must be clearly stated
and labeled.
<P>
Specific features that need to be changed in the law include the
following:
<UL>
<LI>Congress should provide that the listing and de-listing process
includes peer review of all candidates for endangered and threatened
species.  Funding of peer reviewers should be disclosed to ensure
that the review is objective, as should any special relationships
or conflicts of interest.
<LI>Public input into the listing and de-listing process should
be required, as should ample public notice so as to ensure the
opportunity for all those concerned or affected to be heard.
<LI>Congress should state explicitly that all species are not
created equal.  The revised ESA should state a preference for
mankind where balance is an issue.  And the impact on humans of
endangered species listings should be part of the listing analysis.
 Economic impacts should be part of any listing procedure as well.
 That is, a full analysis of the true economic costs of endangered
species listing should be required whenever a candidate is considered
for listing.
<LI>Congress should state that some non-human endangered species
may be determined to be more important than others.  In this way,
limited public resources may be allocated to those species deemed
the most important public resource. 
<LI>Congress should require periodic re-evaluation of species
listed and all candidates for listing.
<LI>Congress must compensate for the loss of private property
taken by endangered species regulation.  Compensation must be
required for full, partial, and temporary takings, and it should
be paid upon determination that private property must be taken
for use by an endangered species.  Also, a declaration of condemnation
and filing of condemnation proceedings must be filed not just
in any court competent to hear the action, but within the congressional
district of the affected citizen or that in which the property
is located.  Nothing in the condemnation proceedings may infringe
upon the property owner's right to just compensation as guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
<LI>Congress should also encourage individual efforts to enhance
endangered and threatened species.  Such private efforts have
the greatest chance of enhancing small numbers of species and
of preserving or creating critical habitat.  Permits should not
be required to use private property for endangered species enhancement,
except in cases where such efforts may constitute a public nuisance.
 Tax incentives should be established, including deductions from
estate and income taxes, for the contribution of private property
for endangered species habitat.  No income tax should be levied
upon the sale of critical habitat to conservation organizations
devoted to endangered or threatened species enhancement.  A divided
real property estate should qualify for endangered or threatened
species tax treatment.  In this way, the presence of an endangered
species would be a boon to the landowner instead of a dreaded
blight.
<LI>Commercial opportunities geared to endangered species enhancement
should be permitted.  Congress should allow private husbandry
of threatened and endangered species.  It also should allow regulated
marketing of threatened and endangered species, following the
enlightened example of Zimbabwe, whose game population has flourished
under commercial management.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Congress should address reauthorization of the Endangered Species
Act in a manner consistent with American tradition, through open
and honest debate, and with a view toward protecting both the
liberty of our citizens and truly endangered species.  Only in
this manner can the injustices and excesses of the existing law
be rectified.  In crafting the language to effect these changes,
and in monitoring their implementation, Congress must be alert
to the self-interest of the bureaucracy in perpetuating and extending
its discretionary powers. 
<P>
After Congress acts to correct ESA deficiencies, the states must
follow suit in revising state plans to reflect the new federal
policies.  State policy-makers must match federal changes with
innovative steps of their own in the balancing of competing interests,
compensation for takings of private property, and other changes
in the direction of common sense.

<B>Rethinking Welfare Reform in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
In 1966, one year after Lyndon Johnson and Congress declared war
on poverty, the poverty rate stood at 14.7 percent.  Over a quarter
century later, after approximately $5 trillion in federal, state,
and local welfare spending, the poverty rate remains virtually
the same at 14.5 percent in 1992.  In California, even as the
economy boomed in the 1980s, welfare caseloads continued to grow,
and they continue to grow rapidly in 1994.
<P>
Over the past three years the Wilson administration, in concert
with a reluctant Democratic legislature, has made several changes-from
cuts in individual grants to instituting fingerprinting programs-and
their effects on the California budget have been relatively beneficial.
 Budget tinkering, however, will not solve welfare's core crisis.
 Through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other
programs, we subsidize behavior that destroys communities.  Teenage
motherhood, divorce and separation, absent and delinquent fathers,
and even drug addiction can qualify a person for state payment.
 Fortunately, after nearly thirty years of destructive social
policy, a new consensus has emerged:  something has gone dreadfully
wrong with the welfare state.  Unfortunately, this new consensus
on the scope of the problem does not yet extend to agreement on
how to fix it.  
<P>
We can learn from the experience of past generations.  We need
not be prisoners of welfare state misconceptions and biases about
either &quot;root causes&quot; or workable solutions.  In fact,
it is only by looking beyond the &quot;welfare establishment&quot;
that we find innovative thinking and viable solutions.  The history
of that last thirty years teaches us one clear lesson: our goal
should not be to &quot;reform&quot; welfare or to turn it into
a new public works program.  Our goal must be to abolish it.
<P>
Much can be learned from examining how welfare was managed in
19th century, which was done largely, and more successfully, by
private charities.  We must relearn and reapply what was common
knowledge less than a hundred years ago, before the rise of the
welfare state, its entitlements, and its bureaucracies.
<P>
Prior to outlining new proposals for reform, we will examine trends
in California welfare in the 1980s and 1990s.  We will also explain
why Bill Clinton's program to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;
will not help California-or do anything substantial to break the
cycle of dependency.  
<P>
<B>RECENT TRENDS</B>
<P>
<B>Expenditures</B>
<P>
Welfare in California operates on several different levels.  The
main program is AFDC, the costs of which are shared by the federal
and state governments.  AFDC falls into two categories:  AFDC-Family
Group (AFDC-FG) which goes to single-parent families, and AFDC-Unemployment
Parent (AFDC-U) which goes to two-parent households with at least
one unemployed parent.  In 1992-93 these two programs enrolled
2,458,6000 individuals per month at a cost of $5.9 billion, of
which California paid $2.8 billion and counties paid $0.4 billion.
 (California accounted for 27 percent of all money spent on AFDC
nationwide in 1993-more than double the average per capita for
the nation.)
<P>
The two AFDC categories differ in significant ways.  AFDC-FG now
accounts for 84 percent of the AFDC caseload.  Growth in the AFDC-FG
caseload was &quot;completely unrelated&quot; to fluctuations
in the unemployment rate for ten of twelve large counties in California
over a seven-year period through 1991-92.  In contrast, the Department
of Social Services found that the recession accounted from much
of the growth in the AFDC-U caseload.
<P>
Why do people go on welfare in the first place?  According to
nationwide data on AFDC, 75 percent of AFDC-FG cases begin receiving
aid because of changes in family structure, while only 15 percent
do so as direct result of a reduction in income.  Of those who
leave AFDC, 46 percent leave because of changes in family structure,
and 26 percent leave AFDC because of increased income.
<P>
This information suggests that offering employment in exchange
for AFDC-FG will not significantly reduce the caseload.  There
is another element at work-teenage pregnancy.
<P>
California has the highest teenage birthrate in the nation, with
births to mothers under age 18 comprising over 10 percent of all
births.  During the 1980s, the teenage birthrate increased by
12 percent.  These numbers have a direct effect on the AFDC-FG
program.  Approximately 54 percent of women currently receiving
aid had their first child as a teenager, and 32 percent of AFDC
families have additional children after first receiving aid, making
them eligible for a larger grant.  This suggests that if we reduce
teen pregnancy, AFDC payments will also fall.  We believe an inverse
relationship exists as well.  Reduce or eliminate AFDC and replace
it with a system absent the current perverse incentives, and teen
pregnancy will fall significantly.
<P>
Other forms of welfare in California include General Assistance,
a county-operated program which enrolls approximately 165,000
people per month, providing benefits mostly to adults with no
children.  Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program
(SSI/SSP) is jointly funded by federal and state governments,
and provides aid to 960,500 aged, blind, and disabled people per
month.
<P>
The Department of Finance estimates that in the fiscal year 1993-94,
2.6 million people, or 8.2 percent, of all Californians received
some kind of welfare benefit.  This is up from 7.3 percent in
1991-92-an 11 percent increase in two years.
<P>
<B>Recent Reforms</B>
<P>
Some progress has been made in reducing the size of individual
welfare grants, which are currently 12.9 percent below 1990-91
levels.  The &quot;need standard&quot; (a schedule that reflects
the state's determination of the income that families need to
subsist) has increased to reflect the cost of living.  The difference
between the two is now 15.1 percent, and the legislature has lifted
some limitations on work income for recipients.  Despite these
changes in benefit levels, the AFDC caseload and budget will continue
to grow, 4.5 percent for AFDC-FG, and 4.7 percent for AFDC-U,
according to Department of Finance estimates..
<P>
The current 1994-95 budget will reduce individual grants for a
family of one parent and two children from $607 to $593 per month,
but because of increasing caseloads, the entire Health and Welfare
budget will increase by 3.3 percent.  The costs of new cases are
outstripping the reductions in individual grants.  Clearly, just
reducing the size of individual grants is not enough.
<P>
The new budget includes two additional changes.  First, beginning
in November 1995, AFDC families will no longer receive the automatic
increase in benefits from having another child.  Welfare families
will also be allowed to keep their benefits for one year after
marriage.

<P>
Even these modest improvements, however, are in jeopardy.  On
July 13, 1994 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
cutting individual welfare payments is against the law.  In 1992,
California obtained a waiver from the Bush administration to reduce
AFDC payments.  Now, two years later, Judge Alfred Goodwin of
the Ninth Circuit Court has written that the Bush administration
improperly considered the request's effect on the poor.  The ruling
also called into question this year's decision to deny additional
benefits for children born while their mothers are on AFDC.  The
Wilson administration is appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
<P>
In December 1992 welfare payments to out-of state emigrants were
reduced to home state levels, but a U.S. District Judge promptly
blocked the law.  In April 1994, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of appeals upheld the decision, agreeing that new residents must
be held equal with respect to the &quot;basic necessities of life.&quot;
 The Wilson administration is, once again, appealing the decision
to the Supreme Court.
<P>
In our 1992 report, we found that welfare fraud is more prevalent
than is officially reported.  New data collected by the Department
of Finance has backed that view.  To address this problem, Los
Angeles County has instituted a fingerprinting program for general
assistance benefits, as has San Francisco. That city-home to 14,900
general assistance recipients-has seen between 400 and 610 people
ignore two notices to be fingerprinted or be kicked out of the
system.  If just 350 of those people leave the system, the city
estimates savings of $1.2 million annually.  In the budget this
year is a provision for a pilot fingerprinting program in Los
Angeles for state AFDC benefits<I>.</I>

<B>AFDC AVERAGE MONTHLY CASES (IN THOUSANDS)</B>
<P>

</CENTER>

<P>
<B>The GAIN Program</B>
<P>
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) is California's version
of the federal JOBS program, a provision of the Family Support
Act of 1988.  The GAIN program is overseen by the Department of
Social Services and administered by the 58 counties.  The Department
of Social Services estimates the GAIN budget for all levels of
government for  the 1993-94 year to be $211 million.
<P>
The California Department of Social Services commissioned the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in New York to evaluate
GAIN'S effects on welfare recipients.  MDRC has tracked 33,000
welfare recipients in six counties for three years.  A control
group that was precluded from the GAIN program but could seek
employment services in the community was compared with the 33,000
in employment rates, average earnings, average AFDC payments,
and percentage of each group that left the AFDC rolls.
<P>
That last category should be the ultimate test of any work-training
program, and GAIN's impact on this has been modest at best.  At
the end of three years MDRC found virtually no difference between
the control group and the GAIN group for both AFDC-FG and AFDC-U
in leaving welfare (the difference was only three percent).  In
some countries, there were marginal to significant increases in
average total earnings and employment of GAIN participants, and
welfare savings were achieved through individual grant reduction.
 Nevertheless, these gains are modest and it is premature to call
GAIN a success.  We can't say GAIN has succeeded until it moves
people off welfare for good or reduces the entire welfare budget,
and so far, that hasn't happened.
<P>
Undoubtedly, the GAIN program has produced positive results for
a number of individuals, although that number is a fraction of
the total AFDC population.  In California, 171,865 people, or
20 percent of adults receiving AFDC, will participate in GAIN
in the current budget year.  Thus, it is probably true that GAIN
has been a worthwhile reform, and should be continued.  Yet it
is too early to gauge its long-term impact or its effectiveness
in reducing welfare expenditures statewide.
<P>
It is also too early to gauge the effects of fraud prevention
measures.  If the San Francisco experience is typical, fingerprinting
programs may save the state considerably.  Likewise, some evidence
shows that moving AFDC recipients into training and education
programs like GAIN can achieve some savings in some counties.
 But legitimate welfare caseloads are still on the rise, outstripping
the modest gains realized through fraud prevention and worker
training programs.  Until we stem that tide, reducing individual
payments or stamping out fraud is akin to rearranging deck chairs
on the <I>Titanic</I>.
<P>
<B>THE SOCIAL COSTS OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY</B>
<P>
Governor Wilson justifies his welfare reform proposals &quot;because
of the severe nature of the fiscal circumstances facing California,&quot;
and in the face of Democratic majorities in the legislature, Wilson's
success in reducing welfare payments <I>at all</I> is laudable.
 But the logic of Wilson's economic argument implies that if fiscal
circumstances were more favorable, we should maintain, or even
increase, welfare grants.  In confining his arguments strictly
to the budget impact, Wilson ignores the seminal reason for welfare
reform: government welfare payments have demoralized their recipients
and have created a culture of dependency.  Yes, comprehensive
welfare reform will save Californians money, but saving money
in itself ought not be the primary goal.
<P>
Consider two recent news stories, representative of events occurring
across America nearly every day.  From <I>Newsweek</I> magazine:
<P>
The cops found the last of 19 [children] asleep under a mound
of dirty clothes; one 4-year-old gnarled by cerebral palsy, bore
welts and bruises.  . . . And though the six mothers living there
collected a total of $4,500 a month in welfare and food stamps,
there was barely any food in the house.
<P>
In Sacramento recently, four boys-two 17-year-olds, a 14-year-old,
and one just 13-were arrested for a string of robberies and callous
shootings.  &quot;Don't care about nobody,&quot; said the 13-year-old,
who was the &quot;designated shooter&quot; in the group.  The
grandmother of the 14-year-old spoke to the <I>Sacramento Bee:</I>
<P>
We are stunned and very sad.  I feel very badly about the people
who were hurt. . .  In my age it was different.  I worked all
my life.  I set an example.  I was a nurse for 30 years.  I got
an education.  None of this welfare business. . . . It's just
a mass problem, and I don't have the answers. . . . The truth
is, these kids need their mom.
<P>
It turns out that the boy's mom has a drug problem and his father
is gone. 
<P>
<B>The Illegitimacy Connection</B>
<P>
These examples are extreme, yet we see them in the headlines every
day.  At the same time youth crime has become more common and
increasingly serious, out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed,
and both common sense and statistics demonstrate a strong correlation
with welfare.  Robert Tector of the Heritage Foundation provides
the common sense:  &quot;[A teenage single mother] will continue
to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she fulfills two conditions:
1) She must not work; and 2) she must not marry and employed male.&quot;
 In the early 1940s illegitimacy among blacks was 19 percent,
at a time when racial discrimination was high, and crime rates
were relatively low.  By 1965 that rate had risen to 28 percent.
 Since 1965, however, the rate is up to 68 percent overall, and
is much higher in many inner city neighborhoods.  Among whites,
the illegitimate birth rate stands at 22 percent, and for high
school dropouts it is 48 percent and rising rapidly.
<P>
Establishing that births to unwed mothers has increased is relatively
simple.  What links that fact with the breakdown of cities like
Washington D.C. and New York?
<P>
Social scientists Douglas Smith and Roger Jarjoura found that
high crime rates are caused by a greater number of single-parent
families.  Other factors found to contribute to high crime rates
were population density, mobility, and the percentage of adolescents
in a community.
<P>
Poverty<I> per se</I> is not the driving force behind violent
crime.  Other factors are far more decisive.  Dr. June O'Neill
of Baruch College found that young black men raised in single-parent
families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activity than
black men raised in two parent families, even accounting for variables
like family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment,
and parents' education.
<P>
Furthermore, children from one-parent families are two to three
times more likely to need psychiatric care than those in two-parent
families, and more likely to begin sexual activity at a younger
age, thereby increasing the chance the cycle will continue.
<P>
An alternative theory popular with the social welfare establishment
is that high crime rates are not the results of generous welfare
benefits and illegitimacy, but result from the absence of available
jobs in inner cities, giving residents nothing to do but join
gangs and commit crimes.  This is the philosophy behind Jesse
Jackson's answer to &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; laws.
 &quot;Four Balls, You're On&quot; includes job training, education,
and guaranteed employment.
<P>
The available evidence suggests that the more likely answer is
not the absence of jobs, but the absence of a<I> work ethic</I>,
the very foundation of seeking and keeping a job.  Mayron Magnet,
a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, illustrates the point:
<P>
That is the lesson of Korean economic success in ghetto neighborhoods.
 No opportunity?  Then why do Korean greengrocers flourish in
Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where no such business has flourished
for years... It doesn't take arcane skills to run a vegetable
stand, only hard work, long hours, determination, rudimentary
entrepreneurialism, and family cooperation... What limits economic
opportunity for the underclass above all is the lack of such skills-skills
like being able to show up on time dependably, to be conscientious
and have manners, to treat customers well enough so they'll come
back, to stick to something unpleasant and arduous, to attend
to details.
<P>
Why do families with no fathers tend to produce juvenile criminals,
and  contribute to the overall breakdown of values in a community?
 UCLA political scientist James Q. Wilson believes the key to
community harmony is that &quot;fathers live there.&quot;  That
is, it the males who live in a given neighborhood are responsible
adults with something to protect, the community will likely be
safer than a neighborhood in which many of the males are rootless
and lawless.  Professor Wilson suggests that young males without
fathers still feel the need for them, and finding none present,
turn to street gangs for that guidance.
<P>
In addition, many of the single-mothers in the communities Wilson
is talking about are ill-equipped to be parents themselves.  A
recent study by the Columbia University Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse demonstrates the disastrous level of alcohol and
drug abuse among AFDC recipients.  From the report:
<UL>
<LI>37 percent of women on AFDC 18 to 24 years of age abuse or
are addicted to alcohol and drugs.
<LI>Mothers receiving AFDC are three times more likely to abuse
or be addicted to alcohol and drugs than mothers not receiving
AFDC (27 percent compared to 9 percent).
<LI>14 percent of pregnant women on public assistance in California
would test positive for cocaine use.
<LI>Nationally, 200,000 drug-exposed babies will be born every
year to mothers on AFDC.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
As the study shows, too many children are left not only without
fathers, but without any parent at all.
<P>
In an influential essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, Charles
Murray of the Manhattan Institute predicted that if this trend
is nor revised, we can count on high crime and high unemployment
in white communities, a crisis of bigger proportions because of
sheer numbers.
<P>
In every human society, from Brazil's Yanomamo Indians to Communist
China, the family has been the basis for bringing the next generation
into the society, teaching its members that particular society's
customs and laws.  Our welfare system thwarts this pattern by
subsidizing a system in which one person (usually the biological
mother) is charged with raising one or more children, and penalized
if she attempts to marry or become self-sufficient.  When viewed
through the scope of human history and experience throughout the
world, the result is unsurprising: many of our youth are growing
up uneducated, anti-social, and violent.
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: BOLD RHETORIC. BALD POLITICS</B>
<P>
In an NBC News interview, President Clinton commented on Charles
Murray's widely-read essay, published a month earlier.  &quot;He
did the country a great service.  I mean, he and I have often
disagreed, but I think his analysis is essentially right.  There's
no question that [ending welfare payments to single mothers] would
work.  The question is . . . is it morally right?&quot;
<P>
Clinton's answer to his own question is found in the &quot;Work
and Responsibility Act of 1994.&quot;  Unfortunately, his plan
doesn't live up the advance billing.  Instead of bold new ideas,
it falls into the pattern of other liberal &quot;reforms&quot;
of the recent past.  The plan simply calls for more of the same-more
job training, guaranteed (&quot;last resort&quot;) government
jobs, and incredibly, <I>more money</I>.  President Clinton would
spend an additional $9.3 billion over five years in order to &quot;save
money in the long run.&quot;  (It's a quintessential Congressional
reform plan: spend now, save later-in the &quot;out years&quot;
of the budget calendar).
<P>
Some of President Clinton's proposals are laudable.  He would
require unwed teenage mothers to live with their parents or a
responsible adult before they receive a welfare payment.  Currently,
young teenage mothers might be put up separately in their own
apartments.
<P>
The few positive effects of the Clinton plan, however, would be
offset by its sheer irrelevance in solving what the President
himself acknowledges is the core problem, namely, the cycle of
dependency.  Clinton's plan does propose to eliminate welfare
benefits after two years, but this change is a hollow reform because
the federal government would guarantee a public service job at
that point.  So much for &quot;ending welfare as we know it.&quot;
 This jobs program will almost certainly cost more than projected,
since by  administration estimates, government-subsidized jobs
will increase from 15,000 today to 394,000 by the year 2000. 
Furthermore, the major provisions of the plan will apply only
to those born after 1971.  This means that only one-third of welfare
recipients will be affected by the program.
<P>
In the final analysis, the Clinton plan will do virtually nothing
to solve the underlying problems of the American welfare system.
 For all of his eloquent speeches about the breakdown of the family
and the specter of teenage motherhood, the Clinton plan is nothing
but gradualism and &quot;business as usual&quot; for the welfare
state:  $9.3 billion in new expenditures and a guaranteed public
works job for those who can't find or keep a job in the private
sector.  This is warmed-over Democratic machine politics: put
people on the public dole and they'll vote for you forever.  A
&quot;guaranteed job&quot; is no job at all; it's merely disguised
public assistance, and no one will be fooled.  If there is no
threat of firing, whether explicit or implicit, what incentive
is there to work?
<P>
To his credit, President Clinton proposes to allow states to cut
benefits for additional children born while the mother is on AFDC.
 But it is likely that any Clinton reforms wouldn't take effect
until 1996 or 1997.  California can't wait that long.
<P>
The irony is that nothing short of radical solutions will change
the trends, yet Americans are traditionally wary of radical reforms
from which there is no escape, i.e., a Congressional mandate encompassing
the entire United States.  Americans want to see something work
<I>somewhere</I>; before it is implemented <I>everywhere</I>.
 The answer is for Congress and the President to remove all impediments
to state- and county-based reforms.  This idea, like most good
ideas, is not new; but has never been allowed a trial run.  Allowing
real freedom for states to test new welfare concepts would be
a radical departure from the history of the past thirty years.
 Its an idea whose time has come . . . again.
<P>
<B>WELFARE BEFORE THE WELFARE STATE</B>
<P>
Most people have at least heard of the two milestones of the American
welfare state:  the New Deal in the 1930's and the Great Society
programs launched in 1965.  But how many Americans know what welfare
&quot;programs&quot; were in place <I>before</I> the Great Society?
 Without AFDC, did single mothers and their children starve to
death in the streets?
<P>
Marvin Olasky of the University of Texas studied the approach
to welfare in the late 1800s and early twentieth century.  He
found that the approach to welfare was nearly the mirror opposite
of today's practices-and the results far more benign.  The ingredients
were legislative support for the family, and local community support
for those known as the deserving poor: widows, orphans, and the
disabled.  Distinctions were made between those physically unable
to work, and the able-bodied who were temporarily down on their
luck.
<P>
Olasky writes of a more striking crisis in the 1890s in New York
City:
<P>
Thousands of orphans roamed the streets.  Infant mortality rates
were 10 times present levels . . . A survey found 6,576 New York
slum families living in tenement 'inside' rooms-rooms without
windows facing out, only air-shafts, which many tenants used as
garbage chutes.
<P>
According to Olasky, a &quot;war on poverty&quot; was waged by
various local charities and religious groups using firm principles:
<P>
Emphasizing the restoration of broken ties to family and friends
. . . forging long-term contact between a volunteer and a needy
person . . . Using &quot;work tests&quot; and background checks
to distinguish among different types of applicants . . . Learning
to say 'no' in the short run so as to produce better long-term
results . . . Requiring work from every able-bodied person . .
. Helping the able needy to resist enslavement to the charity
of governmental or private masters.
<P>
Federally funded welfare has induced national amnesia.  Grants
are now seen by recipients, bureaucrats, and social welfare advocates
not as charity, but as an entitlement from a faceless bureaucracy,
for which nothing is owed in return.
<P>
Charity, in the proper sense if the word, is a voluntary expression
of compassion for someone in need.  Exactly who is in need is
determined by those willing to give, and when the transaction
is voluntary, the relationship enriches both parties.  Comments
by one Sacramento welfare mother points out the core distinction
in any charity program:  &quot;There are those who honestly need
it as a steppingstone.&quot;  She is right, but who best can distinguish
between those truly in need and those simply trying to sponge?
 The answer is-those who are closest to the problem: individuals,
private charities, and in some cases, local governments.
<P>
<B>THE FIRST STEP IS CRIME CONTROL</B>
<P>
No welfare reform plan can hope to succeed without simultaneously
addressing the other crisis of the American city-juvenile crime.
 The U.S. Department of Justice reports that in the four years
between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles in court for murders
increased by 55 percent.  For aggravated assault, robberies, and
forcible rapes, the increases were 80 percent, 52 percent, and
27 percent respectively.  But the real tragedy is that children
ages 12 to 17 are the most common <I>victims</I> of violent crime
in America.
<P>
When violent crimes like murder, rape, and armed robbery are commonly
committed by teenagers, some as young as 13, a light sentence
of 10 years is simply not enough.  These perpetrators must be
considered adult criminals and sentenced accordingly.  Their values
and outlook on life are so empty of human consideration that even
human life has no meaning.  And what values does one learn in
the prison system?  For most, exactly the same values they learned
growing up without proper parental guidance.  Turning these young
criminals loose at the age of twenty-five will do nothing but
endanger more innocent lives.  We must eliminate age discrimination
in sentencing.  Violent crime is violent crime no matter what
the age.
<P>
This get-tough policy regarding juvenile crime is not a matter
of imposing heavy punishment for the sake of retribution.  Its
goal is to remove the criminal element from the streets so that
the law-abiding population can pursue jobs, family life, and recreation
in safety and security.  Communities cannot be built in a war
zone.  
<P>
As we identify and incarcerate the few pathological juveniles
among the teenage population, so too can we identify those who
show early signs of criminality with relatively minor transgressions,
such as shoplifting or vandalism.  For these minor crimes, we
should not allow suspended sentences or lenient treatment after
a first offense.  On a second offense, even of minor crimes, the
time for leniency has passed.  There are any number of punishment
options, from boot camps, to forcing vandals to clean up the walls
of a city, to minimum security jail time.  The important thing
is not the specific punishment exacted, but that any punishment
is swiftly and surely applied.  This will send a message that
even minor transgressions will be taken seriously, and that actions
have consequences.  This is a message rarely conveyed today to
any criminals, least of all to juveniles.
<P>
Getting violent young hoodlums off the streets is essential to
making neighborhoods and schools safe for young people who want
to pursue positive goals, to build families and prepare for careers.
 Without such policies to bring crime under control, the &quot;positive
role models&quot; in every community will continue to be victimized
by gangs and street crime.
<P>
<B>INVESTING IN THE FUTURE</B>
<P>
The other component of radical welfare reform is fortifying family
structures through new incentives and new mechanisms for fostering
family life.  What do we know about successful child-rearing?
 Close supervision, attention to the child's needs (often in place
of the parents' selfish interests) and making that child feel
needed and loved are important ingredients.  It is abundantly
clear that most teenagers are incapable of the maturity needed
to raise a child.  This problem is greatly exacerbated if the
teenage mother is alone.  That is a recipe for social disaster,
as we have learned to our collective sorrow.
<P>
Once we accept this basic truth, there are several approaches
we can follow.  The first and most essential reform must be to
abolish the AFDC program at both the state and federal levels.
 It is time for the federal government to end its &quot;war on
poverty.&quot;  As part of a radical restructuring of welfare
policy, the social welfare function should be returned to the
states, with federal taxes reduced commensurably to allow states
the latitude to finance needed reforms at the local level.
<P>
Once the problem is reduced to a state and county level, it becomes
less overwhelming.  The people in each locality must then answer
two questions for themselves: First, what can we do about teenage
mothers and their children <I>today</I>?  And once we have agreed
that teenage motherhood is on the whole undesirable, how do we
reverse the trend?
<P>
For the present, for young mothers already on welfare, we must
move to alternative structures and incentives.  We  must encourage
them to support themselves in some way, either by getting married,
getting a job, or living with their family, or all three.  For
mothers with preschool age children and nowhere else to turn,
group homes can be established under county government or-better
yet-private charities to provide both generations much needed
parenting.
<P>
Once the children are of school age, the mothers must move out
on their own, and they will have a choice.  If they have proved
their willingness and ability to care for the child at home, they
may take him home, and enroll him in a public school.  If the
mother cannot provide for the child, or feels the child is better
off elsewhere, public or private <I>boarding</I> schools should
be created.  These new schools, financed through philanthropy,
vouchers, and local government money, can also be available to
non-welfare recipients.  The schools should have great latitude
in instilling discipline and responsibility in their students.
 No federal money, mandates, or federal court decisions should
be involved.  This is a plan that can radically change the face
of the inner city, but will only work at a grassroots, hands-on
level.
<P>
Several notable programs are meeting with success with no help
from the federal government.  In Cleveland, the private National
Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Development has
been counseling wayward teens since 1982.  The Institute employs
counselors (available 24 hours a day) assigned to young fathers
and mothers who haven't had parental guidance.  Fifty-seven year-old
Charles Ballard, himself a former teenage father and founder of
the Institute, talks about the requirements for the program: 
<P>
We only insisted on three things.  First, legitimize your child.
 Second, be in school or a GED class.  Third, find a job, no matter
how menial, to learn financial responsibility.  We also spent
a lot of time teaching how to change diapers, to feed and bathe
the child-and how to respect the mother.
<P>
In addition to boarding schools, adoption should be expanded.
 In particular, racism in adoption policies must be abolished.
 Just such a bill, authored by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, is currently
in the House/Senate conference committee.  According to Al Hunt
of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, there are currently 200,000
children available for adoption, 40 percent of which are black.
 Minority children on the average wait twice as long to be adopted,
in part due to a policy position by the National Association of
Black Social Workers, which calls interracial adoptions a &quot;blatant
form of racial and cultural genocide.&quot;  Such ideological
nonsense should not pass for social policy.
<P>
For the mothers who are unable to care for their children, once
relieved of the burden of not having to support them, they can
go to work.  If they have drug or alcohol problems, one-chance
community programs can be implemented.
<P>
In these ways, we can convince pre-teen girls that teenage pregnancy
is an impediment to success, not a path to independence.  The
boarding schools will instill this message clearly and effectively.
 Combined with abstinence (not condom) education, this is a program
that can significantly reduce the teenage pregnancy rate in coming
years.
<P>
<B>FEDERAL MANDATES: TIME FOR A REVOLUTION?</B>
<P>
There is a web of federal statutes that force state governments
to implement various welfare programs, including AFDC.  This labyrinthine
system of mandates hamstrings state legislatures if they want
innovative change.  Assume that a state legislator or the Governor
wants to create a new program to combat AFDC fraud, or amend an
existing program, or even eliminate one.  Included in such legislation
must be a provision for the Department of Social Services to apply
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver
to implement the change.  If HHS refuses, the state legislation
is invalidated.
<P>
During the last 12 years, not a single waiver has been denied
for welfare demonstration projects in California.  However, this
does not mean California has had a free hand in experimenting
with changes in AFDC or other elements of the welfare system.
 State Department of Social Services officials contemplating a
waiver request must calculate the costs, delays, and difficulties
in negotiating a formal waiver request with the federal government.
 Moreover, the request must first be approved <I>internally </I>with
the leadership of the legislature and the Governor's office. 
At this design stage, the request is &quot;pre-negotiated&quot;
with HHS regional and national headquarters staff, and informal
consultation that smokes out the arguments, the obstacles, the
threatened law suits, and the likely outcome.  Thus, all too often
this &quot;pre-negotiated&quot; stage acts as a screen against
genuine change: radical reforms are bartered away for  more &quot;realistic&quot;
ones.  In other words, the fact that waivers must be approved
by the federal government-and now by the federal courts!-determines
the parameters of permissible reform.
<P>
The waiver process itself leads to abominations such as the two
recent Federal Circuit Court decisions (described above) that
have invalidated wavers for California welfare reform.  That states
must apply for &quot;wavers&quot; to decide how they will spend
their tax money is perverse, and must be changed if we are to
make any significant improvements.  Unfortunately, this change
will require changes in federal legislation, which will not occur
without far more aggressive political leadership by governors
and state legislatures.
<P>
There is yet another, more fundamental obstacle to state experimentation
with welfare reform.  States are under many federal mandates that
are costly and burdensome.  But ending the mandates would be only
a first step in creating a policy framework for true reform. 
Bringing full welfare responsibility back to the states will also
require reducing the federal tax burden so that states may have
the fiscal resources to shape and administer alternative plans.
 Without significant federal tax reform as part of a total reformulation
of the federal partnership, shifting full welfare responsibility
to the states would be yet another unfunded mandate.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Our proposals have covered only the AFDC program and the federal-state
nexus fro welfare policy.  We have not examined the General Assistance
programs, largely because they are locally administered.  California
counties are strapped for funds and have ample incentive for policy
innovation-if the state government and federal bureaucracy will
let them do it.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, reform on a comprehensive scale is only
possible through a massive power shift from Washington D.C. back
to the states, followed by further devolution to the counties
and local communities.  Inefficient and perverse programs like
AFDC must be eliminated and their budgets revert back to local
governments, to be replaced by more efficient systems of determining
who are the truly needy.  Innovations like these have heretofore
been stifled by the long arm of federal bureaucracy.
<P>
This policy shift will require a revolution in thinking about
welfare.  Not a revolution from above, but from below, in thousands
of communities across the nation.  Communities are different,
and we should leave administration of welfare for the needy to
them.  No county or state should be forced to apply to Washington
D.C. to change a failed system.
<P>
Congress has exhausted its moral authority in the realm of welfare
policy, and should return welfare to its rightful place in our
political system-to the people in the respective states and counties.
 Then the real revolution can begin.

<B>A Practical, Market-Based Concept to Solve Certain</B>
<P>
<B>Air Quality Problems in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The following paper was  presented at a conference on air quality
cosponsored by The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental
Protection Agency, January 20, 1993, Los Angeles, California.
 </I>
<P>
Nearly everyone but the hard core socialist holdout on his academic
campus agrees that our ecological problems will not be adequately
addressed unless market forces are put to work to control pollution.
 Our efforts to solve these serious problems through police action
have been abysmally ineffective.  Not only have these efforts
been horrendously costly, taking jobs and hastening the de-industrialization
of our country, but they have also threatened our liberty.  Worse,
they have not solved the problem.  So, many of us are in agreement
that we need to go back to what works, the overpowering forces
of the market as the means to address our waste of the environment.
<P>
I would like to present an outline of an idea that is based upon
market principles, which at its core, stresses individual responsibility.
 Without individuals choosing between alternatives, no market
may exist.  Individual accountability is the swiftest and most
effective means to achieve our goals and is the essence of any
market.
<P>
Nobel laureate Ronald Coase demonstrated in &quot;The Problem
of  Social Cost,&quot; that both economic systems (economists)
and blame allocating systems (lawyers) cost society the same number
of dollars when applied to social ills.  If both systems cost
the same, why not continue increasing the regulatory system, exacting
fines from those who pollute.  First, the efficiencies and effectiveness
of using economics instead of blame to deal with social problems
that are generally caused by a majority of the population create
opportunity of choice.  Second, blame is difficult is allocate
among majorities and is ant-democratic.  Third, government lawyers
and their police enforcers  have not surprisingly demonstrated
gross inefficiencies in the area of controlling pollution.  In
summary, it is not possible to regulate clean air.
<P>
Sixty percent of the air pollution of this state is caused by
autos.  A small fraction of this total is caused by commuters
going to and from work.  (That is partly why the car-pool idea,
even when coerced, has not done much about air quality).  The
vast bulk of this air pollution is caused by housewives and other
individuals when they attend to their daily routines and affairs,
privately and efficiently, in their own autos.  These individuals
are very difficult to regulate-that is, it is not possible to
deny them the opportunity to move about by car.  It is this population
of users or buyers in the market that we must address.
<P>
Even though most of the individuals who cause the majority of
the air pollution would like to &quot;do something&quot; about
the problem, there are no opportunities for them to contribute
to the effort.  So, they go about wasting public resources without
regard to the true social cost of their activity other than to
perhaps experience some misguided guilt.  This situation is analogous
to the days when everyone talked about recycling as though it
was someone else's duty.  We all want clean air, but a public
commodity like air is hard to restrict, and is virtually impossible
to package for sale.  Air is the product, but it must be marketed
to the polluter / user.  How can this be done?  By putting a value
on air that is wasted.
<P>
Valuing a common resource poses a problem.  To John Locke the
waste of natural resources was immoral.  Locke's words regarding
the waste of common property are true today.  But, we live in
a relativistic society with little institutional regard for moral
sentiment.  To individuals, Locke's words probably still have
meaning, and I submit this is why they want to &quot;do something&quot;
about the problem.  To institutions, the notion that there is
some moral compunction limiting one's use of public goods is doubtful.
 Nevertheless, our government, which is to exist, &quot;by the
people, and for the people,&quot; may, even in this time of limited
moral accountability, be requested to follow the will of the people.
<P>
Who should put a value on wasted air?  Since it is a public resource,
the logical answer is that the state should initially put a value
on air that is wasted.  How is that value determined?  It should
be determined fairly, equitably and should not be influenced by
false notion that certain individuals have a right, because of
their social status, to pollute.  I suppose that the value of
wasted air could be set in some manner similar to rate setting
for other monopolistic enterprises, with public input.
<P>
How can the wasted air be quantified or sold?  The state of California
has at its disposal and use, extensive, detailed data on the amount
of pollution put into the air by virtually every one of the autos
in the state.  This data is provided by the Smog Check program.
 Each Smog Check testing device records all pertinent data from
each auto registered in the state and that data is stored in digital
memory storage in Sacramento.  Smog Checks are done annually or
bi-annually, depending upon the car's location, and upon each
transfer of the car.  Thus, there is an accurate means of measuring
the amount of air wasted by each auto in areas that do not attain
the standards set by the California Clean Air Act.  The state
should be able to bill each individual for the air that he or
she has wasted with precision during the period between Smog Checks.
 The bill for payment would logically come at the time the car
is registered or re-registered.
<P>
This program could be implemented with little cost of bother to
the state.  The state should alter its shopworn ad valorem system
of licensing fees and replace it with fees paid by the owners
of autos for the value of air wasted by each auto.  Obviously,
this would make low polluting cars very attractive to most people.
 This may not result in an immediate loss of state revenues, but
it most assuredly would have that effect over time because air
pollution from autos would decrease.  Many should cheer this result
on its own merit.  The cost to individuals would vary, according
to their use and wasting of air.  Thus, strong and symbolic incentives
would be given to the individuals to either drive lower polluting
vehicles or drive higher polluting vehicles less.  The choice
would rest with the car owner, not the state.  Like recycling,
wasting air will become not only a matter of conscience, but will
also carry a significant price to the individual choosing to pollute.
 The state would not have to regulate by coercion and thereby
restrict liberty, because the individual would choose how much
he could afford or wished to pollute.
<P>
Since the ad valorem system of taxation on vehicle license fees
is out of place in an age when autos are everyman's, and this
type of tax falls under Proposition 13, the first step to accomplish
this scheme would be for the state legislature to vote by the
supermajority of both houses to implement this program.  Failing
that, a vote of the people could implement this change.
<P>
As the author envisions this program, the cost of this new market
should be approximately equal in terms of dollars to our current
polluted/ regulated status.  In other words, there is no reason
for the state to establish a value for wasted air that is higher
or lower than the tax currently generated by the ad valorem system
of licensing fees.  This is based upon Ronald Coase's theorem
that market focus usually results in the same social cost as a
fault-allocating system.  Since there is presently no fault associated
with one's incremental wasting of air, the current total licensing
fee burden may initially set the value of wasted air.  The state
should not try to make a killing on this market just because it
will play a role in establishing it.  The price of wasted air
would thereafter be adjusted, depending upon the willingness of
the public to tolerate air pollution caused by cars.  Like cigarettes,
pollution may be literally priced out of reach. Or , we may find
a level of air pollution tolerable to the electorate.  Over time,
the improvement in air quality will offset the tremendous costs
of polluted air, enriching everyone.  But most importantly, the
individuals affected by the polluted air will now have a choice
in the matter.
<P>
One may anticipate that the ultra-egalitarians will argue that
individuals of lesser means will be shortchanged by this program.
 After all, under my program the poor must &quot;give up&quot;
something that God has provided them if they cannot afford to
pay for their wasteful use of it.  While I cannot agree with the
philosophy underlying such thinking, I can offer a solution to
this objection.  Presently some $100 millions are collected annually
from surcharges to vehicle registration fees.  These are supposed
to be spent on reducing air pollution caused by motor vehicles.
 Instead of spending all this money on air police employed by
the various air quality agencies, it should be set aside, invested
by private banks and used to provide low-cost loans and other
subsidies to qualified individuals who wish to get rid of their
belchmobiles and trade up into a new low pollution model.  Also,
there is no reason that the revenues raised by my air pricing
system cannot also be used partly for this purpose.  Putting poor
people into a new car may not make them rich, but it may help
them safely and reliably get to work.
<P>
I think that you will agree that this idea is practicable.  It
is timely. It is politically acceptable and realizable.  It would
be a good initial step  toward the establishment of individual
accountability for air pollution.  Best of all, by actually providing
individual incentives to clean up the air, it may mark the beginning
of the end to the ever expanding regulatory police state

<B>The Clinton Health Plan:</B>
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine For California's Ailing Economy</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION: A MANUFACTURED CRISIS</B>
<P>
 In 1990, state and federal governments spent $280 billion on
health care, amounting to over 42 percent of health care spending
in the United States.  This is up from just $24.9 billion in 1970.
 The nation's Medicaid bill in 1990 was $34.2 billion, up 150
percent since 1980.  MediCal cost California $9.9 billion in 1990,
up from $3.9 billion in 1983. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted,
government experts predicted that its 1990 budget would be $9
billion to $12 billion in 1990.  In reality it was $107 billion-almost
1000 percent higher than predicted. 
<P>
 Despite these statistics demonstrating government's inability
to control, much less predict, its own health care costs, the
Clinton administration proposes a radical <I>increase</I> in government
control.  To sell the idea, it must convince Americans that their
health care system is in a crisis.  Thus, for instance, we are
told that there are 37 million uninsured Americans. This is extremely
misleading.
<P>
 For one thing, the 37-million figure comes from a snapshot of
society which fails to account for people in-between jobs or recently
married.  In fact, &quot;half of all uninsured spells end within
four months, and only 12 to 13 percent of  the uninsured have
spells that last more than 24 months.&quot;  The Congressional
Budget Office itself has found that 51 percent of the 37 million
are uninsured for less than four months, and 72 percent less than
one year.  Realistically, then, we have 10.4 million Americans
who are without health insurance for twelve months or longer-nowhere
near the 37 million touted by the Clinton Administration.  
<P>
 For another thing, lack of health insurance does not mean lack
of health care.  By law, hospitals may not deny emergency health
care to anyone who walks through the door. Indeed in 1991, the
American Hospital Association estimated that hospitals provide
$10 billion annually in uncompensated care.  Fred Barnes memorably
illustrates the absurdity of the Clinton administration's claims
by revealing the free care now available to a poor uninsured AIDS
patient at a Washington D.C. health clinic: the patient would
be treated immediately, and if circumstances required it, he or
she would be given AZT, which costs $5000 a year.  The doctor
care, the AZT, any other required drugs, and laboratory work would
be financed, mostly by the federal government.
<P>
 In spite of the facts of the matter, the Clinton public relations
campaign has been effective.  The Center for Health Care Policy
and Evaluation examined 29 public opinion surveys over a two year
period and found that nine out of ten Americans indeed believe
there is a health care crisis.  When asked to relate health care
problems to their own personal situation, however, 70 percent
of Americans were &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;somewhat
satisfied&quot; with the quality and availability of coverage.
 Satisfaction levels increased with income, but even 61 percent
of those making less than $20,000 a year were satisfied.  A Gallup
poll in May 1993 showed that 81 percent are &quot;satisfied with
the quality of health care for themselves and their families.&quot;

<P>
 What explains the mixed signals given by public opinion polls?
 While there is no crisis in access to health care, some health
care costs are soaring.  The goal of health care reform should
be to lower these costs, including and especially the costs for
the uninsured who receive medical care from emergency rooms. 
We will suggest below how such cost containment might be accomplished
without the radical bureaucratization of the Clinton-plan, which
judging from the history of government intervention in health
care and other areas, would lead to soaring rather than lower
costs.
<P>
<B>HEALTH CARE REFORM IN CALIFORNIA TODAY</B>
<P>
 In 1993 California enacted a form of managed competition, establishing
a Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC) to negotiate
with insurance companies on behalf of small businesses.  Businesses
with between five and 50 employees are allowed to join on a voluntary
basis.  In 1997 eligibility will increase to businesses with as
few as three employees. 
<P>
 California's HIPC provides a wide choice of plans to member businesses.
 Early results are encouraging: 32,587 Californians are already
enrolled.  Twenty-one percent of participating employers didn't
previously offer health insurance.  The rest are obtaining coverage
at a lower cost.
<P>
 HIPC does use a form of price control-no insurer may charge 20%
above the average premium-but since the plan is voluntary, businesses
and insurance companies can choose to leave HIPC if they find
a better option.  The system's weakness is that it does not sufficiently
address cost containment.  Included in the HIPC bill were provisions
reforming MediCal and malpractice insurance, but one of the major
causes of inflated medical costs, third party payment for health
care, is left unaddressed.  Still, HIPC provides a good foundation
for any further needed reform.
<P>
 Already the California legislature is considering such reform.
 For instance, Senator Bill Leonard introduced a bill last year
to create Medisave accounts.  It died in the Revenue and Taxation
Committee, but Leonard will submit a scaled back version of the
bill again this year as a pilot program for some state employees.
<P>
 One of the worst consequences of the Clinton health care plan
is that it would cut short the innovations in health care reform
now taking place in the 50 states.  Here in California, for instance,
it would eliminate the existing improvements brought by the HIPC
and force the creation of quasi-governmental bodies called &quot;Health
Alliances.&quot;
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: EMPOWERING A NEW BUREAUCRACY</B>
<P>
<B>An Overview</B>
<P>
 The Clinton administration's claim that its health care plan
will help control costs was dealt a major setback on February
8, when the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified
to Congress that the &quot;premiums&quot; to be paid by employers
under the Clinton plan are, indeed, a tax, and that the plan will
add $74 billion to the federal budget deficit, rather than reduce
it by $58 billion as the White House has claimed.
<P>
 At the top of the pyramid of the Clinton health care bureaucracy
would be the National Health Board (NHB), comprised of seven members
appointed by the President to four year terms.  Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala described the proposed NHB as
a &quot;relatively minor oversight group.&quot;  In truth, it
would establish &quot;global budgets&quot; and &quot;premium targets&quot;
for state governments as well as establish and oversee a package
of  benefits which insurance companies would be required to offer
and which consumers would be forced to buy.  The NHB would also
&quot;certify&quot; individual state compliance with their specifications.
<P>
 Consider just the establishing of &quot;global budgets&quot;
by this &quot;minor agency.&quot;  These budgets-a form of price
controls; they set an advance limit on total health care expenditures-are
meant to encourage savings through increased efficiency.  The
history of price controls, however, teaches us clearly that they
end in restricting supply.  In this case, restricted supply coupled
with increased demand for health care-universal coverage-will
inevitably lead to some form of health care rationing.  (Canada's
provinces all operate under global budgets.  As a result, Canadian
hospitals close beds for part of the year, limit the number of
operations performed, or use what are known as &quot;bed blockers&quot;less
costly patients occupying beds that could be used to serve those
with more costly diseases.  Thus the infamous months-long waiting
lists for major surgeries.  Needless to say, in Canada as in Europe,
politicians in need of surgery go directly to the head of the
line, while everyone else waits, often in severe pain.)
<P>
 The Clinton plan creates several new bureaucratic agencies in
addition to NHB, including (but not limited to) the following:
<P>
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR):  collects
and analyzes data from Patient Outcome Research Teams (PORTs),
which gather physician and hospital medical practice patterns.
<P>
Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council (LTCIAC): a five-member
board appointed by the secretary of Health and Human Services
to &quot;monitor the development of the insurance market.&quot;
<P>
National Health Advisory Committee (NHAC): advises the NHB and
is comprised of  &quot;representatives of states, health providers,
employers, consumers and affected industries.&quot;
<P>
National Health Data Advisory Council (NHDAC): &quot;oversees
the information and data activities, including standard setting
and privacy protection, of the federal government under health
care reform.&quot;
<P>
National Privacy Panel (NPP): ensures &quot;privacy protection
as applied to health information.&quot;
<P>
Premium Target Advisory Commission (PTAC): appointed by the NHB
to recommend adjustments to the methodology for calculating premium
targets.
<P>
Risk Adjustment Advisory Committee (RAAC): institutes the &quot;Risk
Adjustment System&quot; which will set &quot;premium payments
to health plans to reflect the level of risk assumed for patients
enrolled in comparison to the average population in the area.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to creating new government agencies and expanding
duties of existing agencies such as the Departments of Labor and
Health and Human Services, the Clinton health care plan would
create programs to train physicians and to mandate what specialties
medical students will study-or whether they will study a specialty
at all-on the basis of &quot;national need.&quot;
<P>
<B>Health Alliances</B>
<P>
 The Clinton health care plan would operate on individual Americans
most directly through regional health alliances.  These alliances,
like the current HIPC in California, are non-profit bodies created
to negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of businesses.
The similarities, however, stop there.  For one thing, there is
nothing voluntary about participation.  Due to the so-called &quot;employer
mandate&quot; component of the plan, all businesses with under
5000 employees would be forced to buy their insurance through
their regional alliance. Each employer's &quot;premium&quot; would
be 80 percent of their employees' health insurance costs, although
no company would be obligated to pay more than 7.9 percent of
its payroll.  The Clinton plan currently offers federal subsidies
on a sliding scale to companies with fewer than 75 employees.
 For example, the smallest businesses will pay premiums of no
more than 3.5 percent of payroll, and others will be subsidized
at various rates up to 7.9 percent.  The Clinton administration
has proclaimed the exact amounts of the subsidies to be negotiable.
<P>
 Health alliances would have the sole power to determine which
health plans operate in their geographic area and to decide how
those plans are presented to the public, effectively limiting
choices and eliminating competitive advertising.  Alliances may
exclude a health plan for a number of reasons: for exceeding the
average premium by 20 percent, for failing to have the &quot;capacity
to deliver services,&quot; etc.  Obviously the government, not
the consumer, will decide these things.  (The Clintons maintain
against reason that health alliances aren't the government.  But
what else can one call not-for-profit agencies created by legislation
to carry out such functions?)
<P>
 Health alliances would also have the power of the purse, that
is, the power to levy taxes:  They would be authorized to assess
businesses and workers up to 2.5 percent of their insurance premiums
to provide for the alliance's &quot;administrative allowance,&quot;
plus up to 1.5 percent of premiums to fund federal academic health
centers and graduate medical educational programs.  And in order
to comply with the global budget set by the NHB, alliances are
authorized to impose fee schedules on doctor's services.
<P>
 At least one of the plans offered in each alliance must be a
fee-for-service plan, in which consumers pay directly for a doctor's
care.  But this plan would be subject to strict price controls,
and the absence of tax relief for such expenses would make it
untenable for all but the rich.  If an individual refuses to join
a plan from the health alliance, they may obtain other insurance,
but will be charged double the premium they would otherwise have
paid.
<P>
<B>Community Rating</B>
<P>
 The most egregious problem with the Clinton plan is what is known
as &quot;community rating.&quot;-a complicated way of saying that
everyone in a given alliance area is charged the same insurance
premium regardless of health risk or condition.  The top ten causes
of death in the United States are behavior-related; community
rating provides no incentives for people with unhealthy behavior
to change their ways.  And it would supersede a longstanding tradition
of fairness in the insurance industry which &quot;protects insured
persons from paying excessive amounts to subsidize high-risk policyholders
and groups.&quot;  One commentator has concluded that community
rating undermines the very idea of insurance:
<P>
Healthy people purchase health insurance because they fear the
possible financial consequences of illness.  People purchase health
insurance while they are well, so that they will have it when
they are ill.  However, if health insurance become available regardless
of health status, much of the incentive to pay for health insurance
while healthy will be removed.  For many people, it will be a
rational choice to do without health insurance until the need
arises.
<P>
 The Clinton plan's answer to this problem, of course, is to force
everyone to buy high-priced, standard-package benefits, thereby
subsidizing high risk patients in the same alliance region.
<P>
 Beginning in 1993, the State of New York has operated under community
rating.  As a result, the average price for commercial insurance
is up 18 percent, and has more than doubled for some New Yorkers.
 The table below dramatically demonstrates the economic effects
of community rating.

<P>
<B>The Divisive Politics of the Clinton Plan</B>
<P>
 Taken together, regional health alliances and community rating
are a recipe for political gerrymandering.  The Clinton plan tries
to account for this problem by mandating that &quot;the entire
portion of a metropolitan statistical area location in a state
shall be included in the same alliance area.&quot; But this will
not keep politicians from fighting and conniving to place their
constituents out of high health risk areas like San Francisco
or Los Angeles, or areas with acute illegal alien populations
such as San Diego, in order to get the lower community-rated premiums.
 
<P>
 As Elizabeth McCaughey has written,  &quot;Everyone will figure
out that you get more health care for your dollar or pay lower
premiums in an alliance without inner-city problems.  The plan
will bear an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate.&quot;
Real estate prices will be drastically affected by all this reshuffling,
as businesses and homeowners attempt to leave high risk alliance
regions.
<P>
<B>Impact on the California Economy</B>
<P>
 Most economic impact studies on the Clinton plan have had a national
focus, but one can extrapolate from them a dire prognosis for
California.  Lewin-VHI, a non-partisan research firm based in
Virginia, found that 67 percent of firms not now providing insurance
will be forced to pay at least $1,000 per year extra per employee,
and that half of all working-age households will pay more for
health care under the Clinton plan.  Professors June and David
O'Neill of Baruch College estimate that 3.1 million jobs will
be lost as a result of the employer mandate alone.  Seventy-five
percent of these jobs will be concentrated in service industries
such as restaurants and agriculture.
<P>
 The most prominent study to date examining the effect specifically
on California comes from the Legislative Analyst's Office.  It
estimates the Clinton plan might result in 75,000 lost jobs. 
At the same time it estimates an eventual annual savings to the
state of several hundred millions of dollars.  But most of this
savings comes from shifting the financial burden of health care
to the federal budget, and away from state and county budgets.
 That is, California's taxpayers will still foot the increased
bill for the Clinton plan through federal taxes.
<P>
 The estimated savings in the Legislative Analyst's study amount
to the federal government assuming the burden for some services,
while the estimated costs generally amount to new mandates on
the state government.  For example, the Clinton plan requires
that states share the costs of a new federal program for home
and community based long-term care.  The Analyst predicts a cost
of $200 million in 1996 and higher thereafter.  We must keep in
mind though that the federal government can easily unload its
funding responsibility for the plan onto the states at a future
date.  This occurred in the mid-1980s when federal &quot;Revenue
Sharing&quot; was the first item to get chopped when Congress
started cutting costs.
<P>
 The Clinton administration also plans to increase federal taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol, which the state already taxes, as a
way to help fund the plan.  The Legislative Analyst predicts the
new federal levies will reduce state revenue by $200 million.
<P>
 The Wilson administration is worried about several adverse effects
of the Clinton plan on the California economy.  First and foremost
is the devastating effect of the employer mandate on small businesses,
which account for 85 percent of California's new jobs.  A White
House official's recent response to an expression of concern about
California job loss was unsettling:  &quot;We haven't factored
that in at this point.&quot;
<P>
 A survey of the 48,000 California members of the National Federation
of Independent Business revealed that over 90% oppose the employer
mandate feature of the Clinton plan.  They do not believe that
the promised subsidies for the smallest businesses will work over
the long term.  Such subsidies will simply put more strain on
the federal government to provide something else for which it
doesn't have the means.  Moreover, the subsidies require new appropriations
each year, and can be easily reduced or eliminated by Congress
after the health care plan is entrenched, putting the burden on
the states, whose coffers are already depleted.
<P>
<B>The Death Knell of Federalism</B>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, by January 1, 1997, California must
submit a report to the National Health Board detailing how it
intends to comply with the Clinton plan.  If any state resists,
the secretary of Health and Human Services has two options: she
may withhold federal funds for hospitals and other federally funded
programs in the state or, failing that, she may do what is &quot;necessary&quot;
to make sure that the &quot;comprehensive benefits package is
provided to eligible individuals in the state during the year.&quot;
 In lieu of state compliance, she may also assess yet another
tax on premiums-up to 15 percent-to offset administrative overhead
in setting up one or more regional alliances in a non-participating
state.
<P>
 If the Clinton plan becomes law, the only option available to
the states besides compliance is a state-instituted &quot;single-payer&quot;
system.  Thus Assembly Bill 16, authored by Assemblyman Burt Margolin,
and Senate Bill 1098, authored by Senator Art Torres, which would
implement a Clinton-type plan on the state level.  These Clinton
clones include state global budgets, a seven member California
Health Commission responsible for creating a standard benefits
package, and are written &quot;in anticipation of federal action.&quot;
<P>
 In short, the Clinton plan will effectively usurp the authority
of state governments over health care policy.  Constitutional
justifications for like infringements on state powers in recent
years have cited the power of Congress to regulate commerce, a
power originally meant to override interstate trade barriers.
 In <I>Wickard v. Filburn</I> in 1942, however, the Supreme Court
used the commerce clause to rule that a farmer growing wheat for
his own consumption had an effect on interstate commerce.  Therefore,
Congress was permitted to bar him from doing so.  David Rivkin
warns that the Clinton plan threatens to stretch the commerce
clause to dangerous new limits:
<P>
 If the courts uphold Congress's authority to impose this system,
they must once and for all draw the curtain on the Constitution
of 1787 and admit that there is nothing that Congress cannot do
under the Commerce Clause.... For example, if Congress thinks
Americans are too fat-many are-and that this somehow will affect
interstate commerce, can it not decree that Americans shall lose
weight?  Indeed, under the new system, any activity that might
increase the costs of health care might be regulatable.
<P>
<B>MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B>
<P>
 The largest health-care cost-containment problem comes from the
fact that most medical bills are paid by third parties.  This
reduces efficiency because patients do not feel they are spending
their own money.  J. Patrick Rooney, Chairman of  Golden Rule
Insurance, employs an analogy to demonstrate the point:
<P>
Imagine if employers provided &quot;grocery credit cards&quot;
as a fringe benefit the same way they now provide employee health
care.  It would pay 80 percent of an employee's food bill after
a $100 per year deductible, then, 100% after the first $5,000.
 If that were a fringe benefit like health care, grocery stores
would stack only the highest-price food because that is all that
employees would want to buy.... People spend their own money on
food.... Hence, grocery prices are not increasing in the range
of 15 to 20 percent per year the way health care spending has
been.
<P>
 The use of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) can change this destructive
pattern. These are tax-free accounts, similar to IRAs.  Employers
would purchase high-deductible, lower-premium health insurance
policies, and put the difference in the MSA to cover the deductibles.
 Employees would contribute, for example, up to $3,000 a year
to cover routine medical expenses.  At the end of the year, money
not spent on health care can be taken out of the MSA (subject
to income taxes) or rolled over for medical expenses in the next
year.  Since Americans never spend on health care in a year what
they spend on health insurance, money will usually be left over
at the end of the year.
<P>
 As competition for the savings account money increases, prices
will fall, making health insurance affordable for more and more
businesses and individuals.
<P>
 Vouchers might be provided to the poor for MSAs instead of, or
in addition to, the MediCal coverage they now receive.  This would
have the immediate effect of allowing doctors to compete for MediCal
patients rather than struggling to avoid them, because they lose
so much money in treating them in the highly regulated MediCal
market.
<P>
 The main objection to MASs concerns the numbers.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the difference between the premiums
of high-deductible policies is insufficient to cover the deductible
that must be paid in the event of a catastrophe.  However, in
any given year, it is likely that the deductible will go unused.
 In Los Angeles in 1992, for example, health care costs for 88
per cent of the population were below $3,000.  In Chicago and
Cincinnati the numbers were 90 and 92 percent respectively. Even
if the CBO's estimate is correct, then, the contributions of one
year could be rolled over into the second year. As a last resort,
more of the employees' wages can be placed in the account to cover
the deductible.  While  the employee would see less take home
pay, the money could be removed at the end of the year if there
was no medical emergency requiring deductible payment.
<P>
 Another objection to MSAs is that people won't go to the doctor
as often if they know they are spending their own money.  But
this is the real key to cost containment.  Someone must decide
to spend money on health care or on something else.  Advocates
of MSAs believe the individual should do so-not the government.
<P>
<B>Medicare/ Medical Reform</B>
<P>
 As shown at the outset of this report, Medicare and MediCal costs
have exploded over the last 15 years.  The surest solution to
this is to inject competition into the system. For instance, vouchers
could be issued to both Medicare and MediCal recipients by which
they could purchase a private insurance policy or start a medical
savings account.
<P>
<B>Medical Liability Reform</B>
<P>
 Malpractice insurance cost hospitals and doctors $10 billion
in 1991, and that cost is estimated to rise to $15 billion in
1998.  The costs of &quot;defensive medicine&quot;- doctors ordering
unnecessary tests to guard against lawsuits-was $27 billion in
1993.  In a recent study of lawsuits filed against hospitals and
doctors in New York, 80 percent were found to be without basis.
To curb this trend we might adopt the rule that the loser pays
all lawyers' fees, a practice most other countries in the world
employ to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Insurance Mandates</B>
<P>
 The number of state laws mandating that insurance companies include
certain benefits rose from 48 in 1974 to over 700 in 1991.  These
mandates raise the prices of minimum benefits and make insurance
too costly for people with the lowest incomes-thus increasing
the number of uninsured.  This could be solved by offering a &quot;no
frills&quot; package of benefits to the public, absent the expensive
mandates.
<P>
<B>Occupational Licensing</B>
<P>
 By restricting entry into the medical profession, licensing laws
have increased the price of medical services.  While needed to
protect the consumer, these laws can be amended to increase efficiency.
 For instance, hospitals might be given more leeway in licensing
personnel for routine services.
<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE CLINTON PLAN</B>
<P>
<B>The Chafee Plan:</B>
<P>
 Senator John Chafee's proposal has the essential structure of
the Clinton plan, but injects some competition into the formula.
 It would eliminate the employer mandate and avoids spending caps
and global budgeting.  States would be required to set up purchasing
cooperatives similar to health alliances, but more than one would
be allowed in a given geographic area.  A national commission
would establish a minimum benefits package.
<P>
 Under the Chafee proposal, health plans &quot;may not discriminate
on the basis of  health status.&quot;  This amounts to community
rating and all the problems that entails.  Chafee would create
MSAs, but they are not central to the plan.  The main problem
with the Chafee plan is the potential for expansion.  Hillary
Clinton herself has said that the Chafee plan is a good first
step, since much of the structure (National Health Board, standard
benefits package, community rating) is already in the bill and
may be easily expanded later.
<P>
<B>The Cooper Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Congressman Jim Cooper's proposal has much in common with both
Clinton and Chafee.  It eliminates the employer mandate, but a
national commission would establish a minimum benefits package
and premiums offered by the cooperatives will be community rated.
 The Cooper plan has been supported by some business groups, most
notably the Business Roundtable.  But it contains provisions that
impose significant costs and constraints on business, and which
can be easily expanded once the program is in place. William Kristol
has pointed out that through changes in the tax code in the Cooper
plan, &quot;businesses that today offer their employees generous
health plans would effectively be forced either to accept the
government's more austere benefit limits or face stiff economic
penalties.&quot;
<P>
 Another onerous provision of the Cooper bill  requires all business
firms with fewer than 100 employees (about 93% of all businesses)
to register with regional Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives,
forward information about all their full- and part-time employees,
and deduct from all paychecks the cost of health care premiums-whether
or not the firms were providing health care coverage.  The Cooper
plan doesn't include MSAs.  Like Clinton, its implementation would
require a massive tax hike.
<P>
<B>The Nickles Plan</B> 
<P>
 Senator Don Nickles' proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, which serves 10 million federal workers,
and gives its members a choice of nearly 30 plans with a variety
of benefits and prices.
<P>
 Nickles calls his bill &quot;The Consumer Choice Health Security
Act.&quot;  It would outlaw exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
cap medical malpractice awards, and require only that Americans
buy catastrophic health insurance.  A potential drawback is that
&quot;underwriting&quot; would not be allowed beyond age, sex,
and geography, a restriction that is only slightly better than
a full community rating.  But insurance companies would be allowed
to give incentive discounts to promote healthy behavior.
<P>
 The focal point of the Nickles MSAs, into which participants
could put up to $3,000 per year plus $500 for every dependent,
tax-free.  Tax credits would be offered to the poor to purchase
their own MSAs.
<P>
<B>The Gramm Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Senator Phil Gramm's proposal differs little from Nickles.  It
would institute medical savings accounts and leave most choices
up to the health care consumer.  Unlike Nickles, Gramm does not
require individuals to buy catastrophic insurance; rather it institutes
a wage garnishing mechanism to punish those who abuse the system.
 The Gramm plan has no community rating, though it does offer
some relief for individuals with pre-existing conditions.  And
it would require that losers pay winners' fees in malpractice
cases.   
<P>
 All of the these congressional alternatives offer cuts in Medicare
and Medicaid, as well as malpractice reform.  A final bill will
likely have these included.
<P>
 From California's perspective, any one of these plans would be
preferable to Clinton, since all avoid the job-killing employer
mandate.  Only Nickles and Gramm, however, avoid the other major
problems of the Clinton plan, and clearly address the cost-containment
obstacle of third-party payment.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
  No one believes that the revolutionary Clinton health care plan
will pass without being &quot;melded&quot; to Cooper or some version
of Chafee-Cooper.  It is unlikely any of the plans can pass in
the Senate without some Republican votes or in the House without
moderate Democrats.  The key question is this:  Will Republicans
and moderate Democrats hold out for a genuine alternative that
avoids a federal takeover of the health care industry and massive
new taxes to finance it?
<P>
 The answer may depend on how coherent the Republicans' alternative
plan is, and how persuasive Senators Dole, Nickles, Gramm and
other Republicans can be in taking it to the nation.
<P>
 Rejecting the &quot;crisis&quot; atmosphere fostered by the Clinton
propaganda machine is the first step in resisting the Clinton-Cooper
juggernaut.  The second step is an insistence on honest numbers
and truth-in-packaging.  The third step is to show courage in
resisting and rebutting the White House demagoguery against the
health care industry.  If these steps are taken, it will be possible
to gain widespread public support for an alternative plan that
provides practical remedies to real problems.
<P>
 Some health care reform-changing the federal tax code to allow
for medical savings accounts and Medicare reform, for example-must
be done in Washington.  But aside from these federal actions,
health care reform should be left to the states.  The best strategy
is to support market-oriented plans at the federal level that
won't encroach on the right of California and other states to
implement their own modifications in the future.  The Clinton
plan closes the door not only to consumer choice but to California's
policy options as well.

<B>The California Teachers Association:</B>
<P>
<B>Power Politics vs. Education Reform</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Editor's Note
<P>
<I> This is the first in a series of reports on the California
Teachers Association and its role in the California public policy
arena. It sketches the outlines of a large and energetic organization,
and lays the groundwork for future reports on the CTA's pervasive
impact on California's educational system.</I>
<P>
<I> We will try to shed light on the CTA's record of opposition
to meaningful education reform-from alternative certification
and merit pay to charter schools, parental choice, and district
decentralization. We will explore its operations at the local
level-its collective bargaining strategies, its  relationships
with local school boards and superintendents, its role in the
fiscal mismanagement of local school districts, and its efforts
to obstruct charter schools. We will also spotlight CTA's not
negligible contribution to the state's budget and fiscal crisis
through Proposition 98 and other political stratagems. (Be forewarned:
the CTA is considering a &quot;Super-Prop. 98&quot;  initiative
measure that &quot;closes the loopholes&quot; and guarantees the
schools an even bigger slice of state outlays. It could be called
the Kevorkian Amendment: assisted suicide for the state budget.)</I>
<P>
<I> It is not accurate or fair to blame all of the state's education
woes on the teachers' union. Others have contributed and deserve
recognition. Some big city school boards (like Los Angeles Unified)
have failed at both management and leadership: those mammoth districts
need to be broken up.  The educational media have not been the
most vigilant watchdogs of the public interest in covering educational
matters: reporters' attention span is short and they often behave
like PR flaks for the education industry. What the PTA-or the
PTSA-stands for is hard to discern, but it is not parent empowerment.</I>
<P>
<I> Yet by far the most disappointing performance has been that
of the business community. With a few notable exceptions, business
leaders are surprisingly naive in dealing with educational matters.
Always seeking a safe &quot;middle road,&quot;  they're easily
coaxed  into supporting incremental add-ons and enhancements,
particularly if the new funds are targeted on &quot;at-risk&quot;
kids. (We should ask why the definition and number of &quot;at
risk&quot; students keep growing, and whether rewarding schools
with more money for finding more children &quot;at risk&quot;
is a good idea. In the business world, if you subsidize something,
you tend to get more of it. Is there any reason to expect anything
different in education?) The result is that nothing much changes
in public education except the price tag. Our schools aren't any
better than a decade ago, they just cost more.</I>
<P>
<I> Who is responsible for this state of affairs? California legislators,
State Board of Education members, the state school chief, elected
school board officials- are all accountable to the public, however
imperfectly. What about the CTA?  The CTA  is accountable only
to its members-which is fine; it is a private organization. The
problem arises when it claims to speak not for its members' interests
but</I><B> <I>for our children's future</I></B><I>. The point
was perfectly illustrated by American Federation of Teachers president
Albert Shanker's quip, &quot;I'll start representing kids when
kids start paying union dues.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I> The CTA can't have it both ways. If the level of  teachers'
salaries and benefits were the measure of school quality, California
would have the 7th best schools in the nation. Our public schools
rank 29th in math proficiency, 42nd in high school graduation
rates, and near the top only in one category-public disaffection.</I>
<P>
<I> It's time for our public officials to look beyond the familiar
rhetoric of &quot;more is better.&quot; More centralization is
not better. More categorical aid is not better. More strikes are
not better. More school district bankruptcies are not better.
More state debt is not better.  The only way to foster the needed
economies, innovation, and accountability is through a new kind
of thinking. Instead of trying to &quot;reinvent&quot; schools
from the top down, why not a revolution <B>from the bottom up-</B>through
radical decentralization, expanded charter schools and charter
districts, alternative certification of teachers,  and parental
choice? Such actions would set in motion a new dynamic:  local
communities could redesign their own schools without permission
from bureaucrats.</I>
<P>
<I> </I>
<P>
<I> The CTA stands across the path to such innovation, saying,
&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Born of the struggles of the 70s,
it fears change in the 90s, and it means to fight any threat to
its financial empire. But it cannot hold back the tide of change
forever. Parents will continue to flee government schools in search
of a better education for their children, especially in the inner
cities. Creative teachers and talented principals increasingly
will seek out charter schools and other escape hatches. And savvy
politicians will learn that the empowerment strategy pays dividends
for everyone.</I>
<P>
<I> The task of bringing fundamental change to public education
in California will require more than summits and public relations
wizardry. The good news is-it doesn't require more money. What
it does require is more leadership.     </I>

<B>Part I: Profile of a Political Machine</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
    &quot;Follow the money.&quot;
<P>
    - Deep Throat in <I>All the President's Men</I>
<P>
 The California Teachers Association (CTA) operates what most
observers consider the best organized and most effective political
machine in the state.  Affiliated with the National Education
Association (NEA), the CTA's influence on California government
is unmatched by any business or trade group. Its political clout
is envied by other special interest lobbies.  It wages ferocious
political battle when its vital interests are at stake-which is
to say, its economic interests. 
<P>
 CTA represents teachers in over 950 of the state's 1,006 public
school districts, at most community colleges, and in the 19-campus
California State University system.  CTA's 235,000 membership
includes 186,600 full-time teachers and 39,900 associate members.
 Another 8,500 non-members are required to pay &quot;representation&quot;
fees to CTA for contract negotiations and collective bargaining.
<P>
 CTA's affluence (and influence) arises mainly from its large
membership and regular source of income, consisting of mandatory
teachers' dues.  With membership of more than 235,000, its annual
budget approaches $74 million.  A CTA member pays $600 per year-$200
more than the national average-with the NEA netting $99, CTA $376,
and local chapters $125.  (A chapter is defined as a local unit
of self-governance, chartered through CTA and affiliated with
NEA.)
<P>
 More than a third of all school districts-and all major districts-operate
as agency shops, thus forcing non-union teachers to pay the CTA
for collective bargaining expenses (although not for political
activities, under current law).  As of September 1991, 357 of
the approximately 900 CTA-chartered locals operated under agency
shop rules.   
<P>
 In a &quot;fair share&quot; agreement, a teacher with religious-
or philosophically-based objections against CTA membership must
contribute the equivalent dues amount to a CTA-approved charity.
In 1993-94 the 8,500 non-union members will pay $2,350,000-or
3.6 percent-of CTA's current budget.
<P>
 The amount of such &quot;representation fees&quot; is determined
by the union, unless challenged in court by an individual teacher.
 According to the Public Employees Relation Board (PERB), CTA
set its representation fees for the 1991/92 school year at 81.5%,
or about $300.  For 1993/94, the CTA adjusted the amount downward
to just over three-quarters of its spending.  In other words,
the CTA claims (under oath) that it uses 76.1% of all revenues
for negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  
<P>
 The CTA also imposes special levies on its members.  A recent
levy will generate over $12 million over three years, with funds
going to pay costs of defeating Proposition 174, the voucher initiative.
 Another levy instituted in 1990 yielded over $2 million for a
television campaign to protect Proposition 98-the 1988 Constitutional
Amendment guaranteeing a minimum funding level for public education.
<P>
 The CTA's clout is due not only to its financial resources but
to its vast membership, which can be mobilized in every state
legislative district down to the precinct level.  It has become
adept at guerrilla warfare as well, as seen in efforts to obstruct
and sabotage signature gathering to get Proposition 174 on the
ballot.
<P>
 A discussion of the emergence of public sector unions is beyond
the scope of this paper. But it is important to understand that
the emergence of teachers' unions is part of a larger phenomenon,
the rise of public sector unions in state and local government.
Secondly, it is important to note that this rise has been simultaneous
with the <I>decline</I> of unionization in the private sector
since 1960. Public sector unions have inherited all the folklore
and political mythology of traditional unions, but they are in
fact far more powerful than their private sector counterparts
ever were. The reason for this is essentially the absence of any
external market constraints on the demands public sector unions
can make: the only constraints are political, not economic. Thus,
when politics becomes the handmaiden of  politicized unions, and
politicians are so tied to them that they fail to balance competing
interests, public policy and the public interest are the victims.
<P>
 That the self-interest of its members is the touchstone of CTA
policy is made clear by the CTA mission statement, in case anyone
had any doubts.  According to the CTA's &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives: 1992-94,&quot; its central mission is threefold:
 &quot;To protect and promote the well-being of its members; to
advance the cause of free, universal, and quality public education;
and to contribute to the establishment of a more just, equitable
and democratic society.&quot;
<P>
That the interests of its members come first in this trilogy is
not news, but it is good to keep it in mind when listening to
CTA rhetoric about the needs of children. And, of course, &quot;free,
universal ...education&quot; will be pursued all the more energetically
if the union is in the politically protected position of being
the sole provider of this &quot;quality&quot; education. The document
then lists 11 institutional goals for 1992-94 in order to pursue
CTA's mission:
<P>

<CENTER>
CTA'S GOALS FOR 1992-1994
</CENTER>

<P>
(1)  Assist local chapters in collective bargaining to secure
the maximum amount of money for salary increases, economic benefits,
and contractual gains; 
<P>
(2) Support CTA sponsored candidates and causes through political
action, lobbying, and CTA funded media outreach; 
<P>
(3) Promote professional and career development; 
<P>
(4) Provide economic benefits and resources for members such as
group insurance and reduced fees for travel and entertainment;

<P>
(5) Expand membership; 
<P>
(6) Promote broad membership involvement and democratic decision-making;

<P>
(7) Maintain leadership development and membership participation
programs; 
<P>
(8) Promote human and civil rights; 
<P>
(9) Maintain a Human Resources department that hires via affirmative
action principles and assists chapter CTA employees; 
<P>
(10) Keep members informed with an internal and external communication
system and improve relations with the public;
<P>
(11) Implement NEA policies within California.
<P>
CTA ASCENDANCY
<P>
 In the 1960s, certified teachers and classified school employees
(e.g., &quot;clerical&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; workers)
were represented by employee organizations within school districts.
 These organizations were limited to representing their members
only, and could meet and confer over a school board's policies
of employment without negotiating a binding contract.
<P>
 CTA rewrote its constitution in the early 1970s to exclude administrators
as members and became more involved in collective bargaining for
its teacher members.  In 1975, Senate Bill 160 (Rhodda) and the
Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) were signed by Governor
Jerry Brown.  The Rhodda Act required school districts to recognize
elected unions as the sole bargaining agents and to negotiate
binding contracts with them.  Under the EERA, a union could become
the exclusive representative either in certification by the Public
Employee Relations Board (PERB) or by voluntary employer recognition.

<P>
 Many of the pre-existing certified teachers and classified school
employees' organizations established in the 1960s and early 1970s
remained largely unaffected by the EERA's new collective bargaining
system.  That was the case until 1982, when Governor Edmund G.
&quot;Jerry&quot; Brown granted forced dues privileges to state
employee unions, including teacher unions.  And in 1983, automatic
deduction of non-member &quot;agency&quot; fees became negotiable
for teachers unions.  
<P>
 In 1978, the struggle over collective bargaining rights was eclipsed
by Proposition 13, which slashed property taxes-the major source
of school funding.  At that time CTA's political action committee
and fragmented state organization was ineffective against the
initiative's juggernaut.  CTA President Ed Foglia explained: &quot;We
came to understand that politics is not just a publicity campaign.
 Politics is door-to-door-the kinds of things that you have to
do in order to win elections.&quot;
<P>
 Subsequently, Foglia helped develop a &quot;Blueprint for Political
Action,&quot; which is CTA's centralized system of data retrieval,
voter registration, absentee canvassing and extensive member education.
 This fostered a consolidation and integration of CTA's campaign
apparatus and statewide lobbying infrastructure.  
<P>
 In 1983 Alice Huffman, a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, was hired as a lobbyist for CTA.  The following year she
was promoted to director of government relations, and soon after
CTA's political action committee was making the top ten lists
of state campaign donors.  Huffman's major accomplishment was
to help CTA better mobilize its economic resources and &quot;people
power&quot; in shaping public policy.  As Huffman points out,
she &quot;politicized&quot; CTA, overseeing the fine tuning of
a sophisticated grass-roots operation in which a chapter can,
on short notice, mobilize the people-power to man phone banks,
 walk precincts, or host media events.  Says Huffman, &quot;I
had to teach them that they [CTA] could do the right thing and
be successful.&quot;
<P>
CTA OPERATIONS
<P>
 Registered with the IRS as a 501(c)(5) non-profit labor organization,
CTA is exempt from property taxes. It receives tax deductible
contributions as well as government grants for educational research.
 With headquarters in  Burlingame, the thirty-one CTA offices
from San Diego to Eureka occupy 204,100 square feet of office
space.  
<P>
 CTA has approximately 480 full-time employees on its payroll,
nearly half the number employed by the state Department of Education
to direct the entire statewide education bureaucracy.  Included
in the CTA total are 21 managers and assistant managers, who are
paid an average of $110,000 per year (excluding benefits, which
are generous) to oversee CTA's 17 departments. These include Governance,
Governmental Relations,  Association for Better Citizenship (CTA/ABC
- CTA's political action committee), Group Legal Services, and
Training and Bargaining Services.  Three other departments-Communications,
Human Rights, and Instruction &amp; Professional Development-work
together to make up the Information and Development Division,
under the supervision of the associate executive director.  
<P>
GOVERNANCE
<P>
 There are two categories to CTA Governance: policy making and
policy implementation.  Policy making occurs at both the state
and chapter levels.  Smaller chapters hold regular meetings to
adopt policies and determine program direction, while larger chapters
delegate policy authority to an elected body, called the State
Council of Education. 
<P>
 The State Council is a 660-plus member representative body which
serves as the legislative and policy-making arm for the membership.
 Representatives are elected from among the state's rank-and-file
teachers.  The ratio of  representation is 1:350 members, so small
chapters share Council delegates while large chapters have more
than one.  The State Council has thirteen standing committees
that assist in developing recommendations to implement CTA policy.
 Policies are approved by a simple majority voice vote of Council
delegates.
<P>
 Among other duties, the Council approves the increasingly frequent
special levies, which is used to fund CTA's political action and
advertising efforts. Recently, the Council was asked to approve
a $6 dues increase, designed to raise an additional $1,000,000
annually,  &quot;for future political struggles,&quot; including
a possible 1996 initiative campaign for a successor to Proposition
98.  The Council is expected to approve the dues hike at its June
1994 meeting. This new levy would come on top of the $19 annual
surcharge approved in 1993 to fund the campaign against Proposition
174. A prior surcharge of  $12 in 1991 raised $2.4 million for
the advertising blitz that helped derail Governor Wilson's effort
to suspend the provisions of Proposition 98.
<P>
 
<P>
 Policy implementation is the responsibility of CTA's executive
body.  It has a 24-member Board of Directors (or Executive Committee),
three executive officers, 16 directors from various geographical
districts, an Executive Director, two Minority Directors-at-large,
and one NEA Director.  The board creates its own committees or
task forces to assist it in implementing policy.  Altogether,
these special committees and CTA leadership constitute the &quot;action
arm&quot; of CTA.
<P>
 The three executive officers-President, Vice President, and Secretary/
Treasurer-are elected by the State Council to a maximum of two
2-year terms.  The President serves as CTA's main executive officer
and official spokesman on policy matters.
<P>
LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY / REGIONAL SERVICES
<P>
 For administrative and organizational purposes, CTA divides its
statewide operations into four geographical regions.  Most CTA
programs and services to chapters are provided and coordinated
through an integrated system of offices and staff throughout each
region.  These regions, in turn, are divided into Directorial
Districts A through P, each producing one elected director on
the Board of Directors.
<P>
 CTA regional offices were established in 1971.  Regional Services
assists with chapter organization, trains chapter leadership,
and develops communication systems among members, local leaders,
and the community (e.g., phone trees, drop systems, local Association
Newspaper, Media Relations).  This department also helps chapters
with collective bargaining negotiations, contract monitoring,
membership recruitment, Group Legal Services, and political action.
 Hence Regional Services is part of the action arm of CTA in implementing
the association's policies.
<P>
 Included in Local Service Delivery are the 24 Service Center
Councils, a network of chapter presidents and State Council representatives
who inform membership of actions under consideration by the State
Council and Board and coordinate membership participation in regional
CTA activities (i.e. political activities and CTA/NEA representative
elections).  More importantly, this department develops regional
strategic action plans to organize regional membership for political
action.  This grass-roots corps is the fountainhead of CTA's political
activities. 
<P>
 With 159 full-time employees in the four Regions, Local Service
Delivery's share of CTA's  1993-94 budget is 41.5% or $30,040,556.
 This large allocation suggests that Local Service Delivery plays
a vital role in implementing and coordinating CTA policy.
<P>
GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS &AMP; CTA/ABC-PAC
<P>
 The Governmental Relations Department seeks to attain CTA's political
objectives and serves as liaison to government and private agencies.
 Alice Huffman, who heads this department, explains: &quot;The
job of this department...is to help CTA implement through legislation
and political action the goals set by CTA members and enunciated
by the State Council of Education, the Board of Directors, and
the elected officers.&quot;  This involves aggressive lobbying
and massive political expenditures.  The department oversees membership
political activity and regularly organizes rank-and-file teachers
to flock to Sacramento to &quot;inform&quot; legislators on issues
of concern to CTA
<P>
 CTA/ABC (Association for Better Citizenship) provides campaign
contributions to CTA-endorsed candidates for local and state offices,
coordinates and directs membership involvement in political campaigns,
offers political action training, maintains a membership database,
and conducts member and public opinion polls to support the CTA's
political agenda.  Since 1985, CTA's PAC consistently has ranked
among the top five contributors to state legislative campaigns,
according to California Common Cause. It ranked number one in
1989-90.  In the past eight years the  CTA PAC  has given out
nearly $3.2 million in legislative campaign contributions.
<P>
 CTA claims to be non-partisan, but of the nearly $1 million it
donated to legislative campaigns in 1991-92,  91% or $903,352
was doled out to Democrats with an astounding 81% win rate.  Just
9% ($89,343) was donated to Republican candidates, and of this
small amount only $7,500 was contributed <I>after</I> the 1992
June primaries. This means that  80% of the amount given to Republicans
was given to spend against other Republicans.  Less than 1% of
CTA's $992,695 PAC money was contributed to Republicans to use
against Democrats.  
<P>
 With this record in mind it is curious to note that, according
to the co-directors of NEA's &quot;Republican Educators Caucus,&quot;
42.8% of CTA's membership are registered Republicans, including
CTA President Del Weber.
<P>
 CTA has a second political action committee, devoted solely to
ballot measures and non-candidate campaign expenditures.  Since
1985, this CTA Issues PAC has forked over more than $10 million
to support or oppose various initiatives. This total includes
expenditures to pass Proposition 98, but also includes hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on measures completely unrelated
to education.  For example, in 1992 CTA spent almost $300,000
on behalf of failed Proposition 167, which would have raised taxes
on California businesses.  CTA has also expended funds to oppose
term limits ( Prop. 140) and prison inmate labor (Prop. 139),
to influence reapportionment (Props. 39, 118 and 119), and to
support Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird and Big Green (Prop. 130).
<P>
 CTA's success rate in political endorsements is impressive. In
November 1992, 99 of the 119 CTA-endorsed state and federal candidates
were elected-a whopping 83% win rate.  Of CTA contributions made
toward 181 local school board races and issues, CTA Secretary/Treasurer
Lois Tinson claims a 70% win rate.
<P>
 It is noteworthy that CTA dedicates at least 25% of its political
action money to local school board elections and requests that
local chapters' political action committees match these donations.
 Thus, while CTA/ABC  handed out over $1 million to state candidates
during 1991/92, it also gave over $300,000 to local candidates.
<P>
 School boards are considered the &quot;employer&quot; in collective
bargaining agreements (which set salaries, benefits, and other
working conditions), while the CTA is the bargaining agent. School
boards often give in to union demands for politically expedient
reasons.  This observation is underscored by the Little Hoover
Commission's study, &quot;Costs and Casualties of K-12 Education
in California&quot;:
<P>
The fact that school board members receive monetary contributions
from teachers' unions does...make for the appearance of a relationship
between unions and school boards and, at the very least, can contribute
to diminished public confidence in the board's independence.
<P>
 The Little Hoover Commission's study determined that this intermixing
of school board and union interests fosters a negative financial
impact on school districts and even the state budget:
<P>
Thus many of the agreements reached through collective bargaining
are not based on the long-term interests of the district and the
financial condition of the State...[such] decisions are not based
on the soundest of fiscal considerations [but] are arrived at
nevertheless because of political pressures.
<P>
 Such political pressures include the threat or execution of teacher
strikes, which force school boards to agree to unsound fiscal
policies regardless of the district's or State's financial condition.
 Indeed, teachers' salaries and benefits gobble up at least 83%
of the State's General Fund expenditures, reducing budgets for
textbooks, library books, maintenance, and other needs vital to
learning.  In 1991-92, a mere 3.87% of the school expenditures
went for vital learning materials like textbooks, computers, and
classroom supplies.  Moreover, during fiscal year 1991-92,  529
school districts-over half-ran budget deficits and four were so
miserably managed that they became wards of the state.
<P>
 In addition to its direct campaign contributions to causes and
candidates, CTA has spent millions on lobbying and other political
expenses.  According to California Common Cause, the CTA ranked
number one in political expenditures during the 1991-92 political
cycle, far outdistancing other moneyed interests such as the California
Medical Association, California Trial Lawyers Association, and
the Association of California Insurance Companies.  In fact, of
the $7.4 million that CTA spent on political purposes during 1991-92,
$3.9 million went for lobbying in Sacramento, making it the biggest
spending political lobby during the two-year session.  Moreover,
CTA's &quot;soft&quot; spending to run its political apparatus
handily doubles its total political expenditures.
<P>
 Perhaps more important than raw dollars spent on campaigns is
the extent of the grassroots political activism under the direct
control of the CTA.  CTA's Governmental Relations Department annually
holds a Political Action Institute in the first week of August,
designed to train teachers and local chapter leaders in effective
grass-roots politics.  Recently, the CTA claimed that more than
1,000 teachers received intensive training in political activism
to fight against Proposition 174, through the Institute and at
a Chapter President's Conference.
<P>
 Furthermore, a special department program of CTA/ABC, the Master
Plan for Political Action, actively promotes political involvement.
 The Master Plan provides workshops on political activism, internal
polling of members' political attitudes and participation in state
political parties, and instructional materials such as a political
action handbook. It  maintains a Political Action Database for
use in contacting and mobilizing members on political issues,
and hires outside political consultants.  Specific political contributions
and expenditures are recommended to the Board of Directors by
the CTA/ABC Committee to support the Master Plan.
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS
<P>
 The Communications Department's threefold task is public relations,
internal communications, and membership promotion. The department's
seven professionals and four full-time support staff issue numerous
publications, including tabloids, leadership newsletters, news
releases, feature and op-ed pieces, letters to the editor, and
the CTA Briefing Memo (directed to media professionals).  Its
primary aim is to boost CTA's public image and advance its political
agenda. The department coordinates the annual John Swett Awards,
given to newspapers, radio and television stations, and individual
journalists for what the CTA considers exemplary coverage of education
issues. 
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS
<P>
 &quot;Members can call upon Human Rights,&quot; explains Department
Manager Dolores Heisinger, &quot;for assistance in racial-ethnic
minority group concerns, equal rights for women, teacher/student
rights, affirmative action, sex equity issues, discrimination,
academic freedom, far right attacks, segregation and integration,
violence in the schools, comparable worth, and peace and international
relations.&quot;  With just six employees and only 1.2% of CTA's
budget, this department focuses on minority leadership development,
women's leadership training and, in its words, &quot;far right
awareness.&quot;
<P>
 In a 1984 CTA pamphlet entitled &quot;Guidelines for Academic
Freedom in the Public Schools,&quot; the CTA Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee expressed opposition to the &quot;New Right&quot;
as follows: &quot;Who dare take on religion, free enterprise,
patriotism, and motherhood?  We do, and we must!&quot;  When this
extreme statement is compared with the recent CTA-sponsored workshop,
&quot;Extremist Attacks on Academic Freedom,&quot; held at Madera
High School in February 1993, it appears to accurately encapsulate
CTA policy.  
<P>
 In the workshop booklet, CTA defines extreme groups and individuals
as those &quot;who attempt to set moral judgments for everyone,&quot;
and proceeds to list six &quot;far right&quot; organizations active
in California.  They are: Citizens for Excellence in Education,
American Family Association, Traditional Values Coalition, Concerned
Women For America, American Coalition For Traditional Values,
and Focus On The Family.  CTA claims that the policies of such
&quot;far right&quot; groups &quot;are detrimental to public education&quot;
and urges all CTA chapters to &quot;actively oppose&quot; them.
<P>
 Since CTA is an NEA affiliate, it is bound to support NEA resolutions
and policies and affirms this in its &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives, 1992-94&quot; (see page 5 above). In the
arena of human rights, the NEA, and by extension the CTA, supports
affirmative action quotas, gay and lesbian rights, the dispensing
of condoms in public schools, abortion-on-demand, in-school care
for teen-age parents, a nuclear freeze, drafting women in the
military, gun control, socialized medicine, and statehood for
Washington DC. None of these policies have ever been submitted
to rank and file CTA members for their vote.  CTA by-laws do not
require it.
<P>
INSTRUCTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (IPD)
<P>
 The goal of IPD, according to department manager Deborah Edginton,
is  to &quot;make the classroom work of our members both easier
and more productive.&quot;  IPD serves as CTA's liaison to dozens
of government agencies and private organizations, and thus provides
the basis of CTA's educational image. It spends only 1.4% of the
CTA budget on these instructional activities. 
<P>
 IPD sponsors numerous workshops and conferences to inform teachers
of their union rights, and synthesizes and disseminates information
that promotes the teaching profession.  IPD conducts research,
publishes studies on educational issues, provides research information
for other CTA departments, and works with a number of private
sector foundations providing funding for educational projects.
 
<P>
 As a non-profit labor organization, CTA is eligible for government
grants and tax deductible private donations. Thus IPD taps into
outside sources of revenue to finance its research.
<P>
 IPD staff works with three State Council committees, including
Curriculum and Instruction, Credentials and Professional Development,
and the Special Education Coordinating Committee. IPD has forged
a close relationship with colleges and universities to coordinate
and promote interaction between education departments and K-12
teachers on mutually beneficial projects.
<P>
GROUP LEGAL SERVICES 
<P>
 Providing free legal protection to CTA members and chapters,
Group Legal Services produces publications, conferences and workshops
on legal issues such as fair share, assists in agency fee reporting
and record keeping obligations, and maintains a comprehensive
labor-law library.  It fights teachers' lay-off notices, strengthens
probationary teachers' rights, comparable worth salary placement,
and defends CTA's right to strike.  At last count Legal Services
employed at least six attorneys and ten support staff in its Burlingame
and Los Angeles offices.
<P>
TRAINING AND BARGAINING SERVICES (TBS)
<P>
 Each summer CTA holds a Negotiations Finance Institute that has
trained thousands of contract negotiators.  Dick Odgers, Manager
of TBS,  explains, &quot;We've developed a Collective Bargaining
Reference Manual that serves as a guide for contract negotiations
around the state, and we were involved in the development of the
new State Budget forms which are in effect in 240 districts this
year [1991], all districts next year.  And we've developed training
for staff and chapters to help them understand these new forms.&quot;
<P>
 TBS maintains a Contract Master Index and Microfiche File to
provide chapters and negotiation teams with comprehensive contract
information.  Additionally, TBS furnishes ready access to California's
state budget, and often makes such information available to CTA
negotiators before it is available to school districts.
<P>
 CTA has developed a &quot;master agreement,&quot; containing
what are thought to be the best features of  all local agreements.
This functions as a template for local chapters to use in their
collective bargaining. Presumably, the CTA updates this template
each time new agreements are reached with desirable new features;
it is then redistributed to local chapters. Some of the features
of this master agreement will be examined in a future paper.
<P>
<B>SERVICE DEPARTMENTS</B>
<P>
 Service departments, operating from the Burlingame headquarters,
assist all other CTA departments.  They include the usual business
functions:  Accounting, Central Services, Data Processing, Governance
Support, Human Resources, and Management.
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to these traditional service departments there is
a budget category, &quot;Other Expenditures,&quot; which finances
the purchase of property, equipment, and computers. It also includes
three not-so-traditional funds-the Crisis Assistance Fund, Media
Advertising Fund, and the Voucher/Choice Fund.
<P>
 <B>The Crisis Assistance Fund </B> provides money to chapters
undergoing negotiations or &quot;representation&quot; problems.
 This fund provides interest free loans of $70.00 per day to CTA
members on a chapter sanctioned strike of five days or more. 
It also enforces CTA's &quot;Brezhnev&quot; doctrine of exclusive
bargaining representation for all CTA chartered locals. Should
a chapter opt for alternative representation in collective bargaining,
CTA would disqualify the chapter and its membership and use its
Legal Services department to maintain CTA control.  Conversely,
CTA provides &quot;crisis assistance&quot; to CTA chapters not
certified as sole bargaining representatives in order to achieve
this coveted status.  Hence the purpose of this special fund is
to consolidate and expand CTA's control-and prevent defections.
<P>
 <B>The Media Advertising Fund </B> is financed by a dues increase
of $12 approved by the State Council of Education in March 1990.
 Its purpose is to sponsor annual television &quot;blitzes&quot;
promoting public education or CTA and place advertisements and
commentaries in the print media.  In 1991 this fund financed a
television commercial telling Governor Wilson, &quot;Don't Suspend
Proposition 98,&quot; which is generally credited with turning
public sentiment against Wilson's proposal.
<P>
<B>The Voucher/Choice Fund</B> consists of income generated by
a $19 dues increase for a period of three years, beginning in
1992-93.  It will generate over $12 million of the approximately
$13 million that CTA spent in its fall 1993 campaign against Prop.
174.
<P>
<B>THE CTA AND THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION REFORM </B>
<P>
 Despite its record of political success and legislative clout,
CTA is not satisfied. We learn from CTA President Del Weber that
CTA's mission to promote &quot;the well-being of its members&quot;
is failing: &quot;California's teachers work under grueling conditions,
with little support, a lack of funding and too many students in
their classrooms.&quot; Weber has hinted  at the CTA's future
strategy: &quot;Several circles within this organization...are
discussing that CTA might have to carry a future initiative for
school funding. The one we have is not working.&quot;  According
to Weber, the guaranteed minimum funding level under Proposition
98 is too easily evaded. (Proposition 98 was amended by Proposition
111, which effectively reduces the original 40% to about 33%.)
<P>
 Teachers' pay and benefits absorb about 80% of classroom funds
but only 51% of total funds spent at the district and county levels.
Translated, this means that 49% of funds are going to non-teaching
costs. So has CTA challenged California's top-heavy system of
thirteen non-teaching staff to every ten teachers?  Not yet. And
CTA has consistently opposed attempts to break up the state's
gargantuan school districts or cap non-teaching positions.
<P>
 Despite CTA's on-going campaign to puff public education's image,
CTA's policies are failing miserably at improving the actual quality
of public education. 
<UL>
<LI>Student drop-out rates in California schools are topping 30%-worse
than 41 other states-and 50% of those who do graduate get a seventh
grade education or less, lacking the basic skills to fill out
a job application.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>More than one million students in California do not speak
English well enough to understand what is going on in the classroom,
despite (or perhaps because of) tens of millions of dollars spent
on CTA-backed bilingual programs.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  SAT scores in California are declining relative to other
states' scores.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Violent crime in California's  public schools is on the rise,
threatening the safety of students, administrators and teachers
alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 CTA's answer to any criticism of the schools is always the same:
We need more money. But &quot;more money for schools&quot; always
translates to more money for salaries and benefits. This is not
to say that teachers' salaries are too high, but it is noteworthy
that  they are 7th in the nation, and that salaries have more
than kept pace with inflation since 1980.  
<P>
 It's interesting that teachers who are parents behave much like
other citizens when confronted with the choices available in the
public schools. According to a statement by NEA president Keith
Geiger, 40% of urban area public school teachers send their children
to private schools. AFT president Albert Shanker disputed this
figure in a series of paid ads in national magazines. But whatever
the rate of teacher bailout, it is not an indictment of unions.
Teachers-as-parents are parents first, union members second. Bravo!
<P>
 But teachers <I>as political activists</I> are another story.
Do we fully understand the implications of a <I>teachers' union
</I>using 91% of its PAC money, nearly half of which comes from
the forced union dues from non-Democrat members, to support Democrat
candidates for state and federal office?  Thomas Jefferson rightly
observed, &quot;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money
for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors
is sinful and tyrannical.&quot; 
<P>
 In 1992 the CTA sent 365 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention and 25 delegates to the Republican National Convention-a
ratio of over 14 to 1. This cohabitation of CTA PAC funds and
political operatives within the California Democrat Party  raises
interesting questions.  Is this heavy commitment to a single political
party a healthy thing <I>for California classrooms</I>? Even if
one assumes that individual teachers will make a conscientious
effort at fairness in discussing current events, it is disturbing
to know that teachers <I>collectively </I>so closely identify
their interests with the fortunes of a particular political party.

<P>
 And what about &quot;fair share&quot; fees taken from non-union
members?  Is it really credible, as CTA claims under oath, that
it devotes 76% of all its dues to <I>collective bargaining</I>?
 When taking into account not only CTA's overt political expenditures
but also the CTA activities that support its legislative, public
advocacy, and communications programs, the 76% figure appears
to be inflated.  After all, collective bargaining per se is the
job of the local chapter.  Yet CTA claims to spend only 24% on
its non-collective bargaining activities-the political and legislative
activities that are in reality its heart and soul.
<P>
 The CTA believes it not only has a right to speak for its members,
it should speak for <I>all </I>Californians in deciding what is
fit for public debate and decision. Regarding CTA's blocking campaign
against the 1991 petition drive to qualify the school voucher
initiative for the November 1992 ballot, CTA President Del Weber
explained their new mandate:
<P>
[CTA] realized that we would be accused of acting in an undemocratic
manner.  What was wrong, after all, with letting people vote on
an issue?  Our answer was firm.  There are some proposals that
are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters.
<P>
 Arrogance and intolerance of this magnitude might be excusable
in almost any other interest group; after all, it's not unnatural
for groups to have strong opinions about the rightness of their
cause.  What is especially malodorous about the CTA's arrogance
is that these are the people who claim to know <I>better than
parents</I> what is best for California's children.  They claim
to teach citizenship, while trying to subvert the initiative and
referendum process. They claim to promote democracy, while suppressing
debate within their own organization. Through NEA and CTA Resolutions
they claim to speak for all teachers on dozens of controversial
(and often non-education) issues without polling their membership
to determine its views.
<P>
 The CTA, of course, is free to make claims and promote policies
as it sees fit. The public is also free to exercise some skepticism
about these claims and positions. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
 Teachers are entitled to representation in the legislative arena,
but so are parents and taxpayers. It is the job of  policy makers
to balance the professional views and economic interests of the
teachers' union with the interests of the public in improved educational
performance and expanded choices and opportunities.
<P>
 The test of sound policy in education should <I>not</I> be whether
a proposal meets with the approval of CTA or any other special
interest lobby. The test should be whether it expands choices
and opportunities for students and parents trapped in a failed
system.
<P>
 The dilemma facing the state's political leadership is as simple
as it is stark: The system that the CTA built hasn't failed the
CTA-it is doing quite well, thank you. But it has failed California.
That the state legislature is held in such low esteem by the voters
may have something to do with the public perception that special
interest lobbies are calling the shots. Whether in educational
affairs political leaders can change that perception without first
changing the reality is the question of the hour.

Taking Crime Seriously<BR>
An Agenda for the Governor's Crime Summit
<H1>Executive Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The increase in violent crime in California calls for new approaches
and a new directness in dealing with criminals.  Putting criminals
in jail-and funding the prisons needed to keep them there-must
take precedence over attempts to solve the &quot;root problems&quot;
that supposedly underlie criminal behavior.  While these efforts
have an understandable appeal, they have become a roadblock to
effective crime control policies because they allow politicians
to pretend to be solving a problem when they aren't.  Sound public
policy requires a sober admission that such &quot;root-cause&quot;
policies have failed; government must focus on putting criminals
in jail and keeping them there. Any policy that doesn't focus
on this goal is a fraud.
<P>
 We must put aside the misguided ideas that framed the social
policy approaches of the 1960s and 1970s.  We must realize that
although rehabilitation is a necessary and worthwhile effort for
many first-time offenders, habitual offenders need to be locked
up. To achieve effective crime control and restore public order
to acceptable levels, we propose a four point program:
<UL>
<LI>Reform the Juvenile Justice System
<LI>Expand Community-Based Policing
<LI>Secure Our Borders from Illegal Immigration
<LI>Reform Our Sentencing and Corrections Practices
</UL>

<H2>Juvenile Crime: Turn Off the Spigot</H2>

<P>
 Locking up all &quot;three-time losers&quot; will not halt the
rise in crime rates if our system continues to produce growing
numbers of young criminals to take their place on our streets.
 Children who are mere &quot;status offenders&quot; can be identified
and treated through community-based programs that do not involve
incarceration, while juvenile offenders who commit violent crimes
should be subject to adult penalties and incarceration.  Juvenile
court proceedings should be open to the public and juvenile records
shared across jurisdictional lines, and juvenile records must
be part of a criminal's record when he commits his first crime
as an adult. 
<H2>Road to Safe Streets: Adopt Community-Based Policing</H2>

<P>
 Until fairly recently in American cities, police patrolled on
foot and exercised broad authority to discourage a range of offensive
behaviors and petty crimes.  Such foot patrols also were effective
in discouraging violent crime.  As the police presence in urban
neighborhoods has declined, both community life and economic activity
have suffered, meaning a loss of jobs and opportunities for urban
residents.  Recent court decisions have reversed the prohibitions
against regulating anti-social behavior and improved the community's
ability to assure safe streets to its citizens.  California's
cities and counties should act to implement a range of policies
to restore safer streets and neighborhoods.  This is a necessary
first step toward restoring stable and livable communities that
will attract employers and halt the flight of middle-class families
to the safer environments in the suburbs.
<H2>Securing Our Borders: A Time for Leadership</H2>

<P>
 The rising tide of illegal immigration into California adds considerable
direct and indirect costs on the criminal justice and corrections
systems.  Concerted action is needed at both state and federal
levels to stem this tide. Illegal aliens arrested for minor offenses
should be fingerprinted and deported rather than tried and incarcerated
at taxpayers' expense.  Those convicted of serious crimes should
be subject to extradition through expanded prisoner-exchange programs.
 
<H2>Career Criminals: Lock Them Up</H2>

<P>
 Many politicians across the state bemoan the resort to an initiative
ballot to enact tougher sentencing guidelines for third-time offenders.
It must be recognized that such grass-roots efforts signal a failure
of public policy:  If legislators had provided leadership to address
the underlying problems, such initiatives would be unnecessary.
It is time for a total overhaul of our sentencing and corrections
practices that will assure citizens that offenders who commit
violent crimes are kept off the streets.
<H1>
<CENTER>
A New Agenda: Getting the Priorities Right
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I> </I>In a recent poll of Californians, crime was ranked as
the top concern. And with good cause.  Other surveys report that
Americans consider crime to be the number one problem in their
neighborhoods, with 60% fearing criminal assault in their own
homes. Although national statistics show that the overall crime
rate is slightly lower than last year, the reduction is due to
a drop in property crime. Violent crime is on the increase.  Few
areas of the country provide a more dramatic example of this than
California.  Between 1952 and 1992, as the state's population
has nearly tripled, the rate of violent crime has increased seven-fold.
 A person born in California today is five times more likely to
be murdered and ten times more likely to suffer serious injury
from criminal assault than one born forty years ago.
<P>
 Widespread public fear of crime first appeared as a public policy
issue in the 1960s.  Government's response to it was to accept
the advice of social theorists and adopt programs focusing on
its &quot;root causes.&quot;  These were identified as poverty,
ignorance and social oppression.  A corollary or logical result
of this was to emphasize rehabilitation over incarceration. 
<P>
 The broader policy framework for this change in criminal justice
policy was the massive investment in  the &quot;Great Society&quot;
approach to urban development.  Federal and state bureaucracies
were created to funnel tens of billions of tax dollars to programs
delivering services for the poor, particularly the residents of
urban areas.  Parallel to these &quot;urban strategies&quot; probation
and parole alternatives for those convicted of crimes were increased
dramatically.  California was at the forefront of this effort,
and it suffered immensely as a result: the explosion in crime
rates began in 1967, when the increase in crime was double what
it was five years earlier.
<P>
 Public officials  and bureaucrats have continued to fight to
preserve the social reform approach to criminal justice, despite
growing public anger and opposition. Their response to public
demands for tougher law enforcement is always the same: more calls
for increased attention to the &quot;root causes,&quot; which
are always found in social pathology rather than personal conduct.
<H2>The Citizens' Revolt Against Permissiveness</H2>

<P>
 Despite this failure of political leadership in California's
governing elite, California voters were successful in re-establishing
public safety as the top criminal justice priority in virtually
every area available to them.  California has adopted three death
penalty laws since 1972.  Since 1981, voters have passed five
general obligation bond measures authorizing $2.5 billion for
prison construction and anti-crime initiatives containing two
dozen major reforms which the state legislature was unwilling
to adopt. In 1986 voters took the unprecedented step of rejecting
three members of the California Supreme Court because of their
apparent unwillingness to enforce the death penalty and other
strong sanctions against criminals. 
<P>
 There has been no lack of public support for more comprehensive
reforms, but the California legislature's unwillingness to adopt
them has allowed remnants of the social reform movement to influence
the three important areas of the criminal justice system most
essential to the effective control of crime: handling of juvenile
offenders, policies concerning illegal aliens and public order,
and the rules governing sentencing and corrections.  Current practices
in these areas continue to contribute to the crime problem.
<H2>Unmasking the Funding Bogeyman</H2>

<P>
 Politicians who say Californians are unwilling to pay the bill
for more police officers on the streets and new prison construction
need a lesson in elementary arithmetic.  There is plenty of room
in a $57 billion state budget for funding the operations of our
criminal justice system and adequate prisons and corrections staff.
All politicians need to do is reread the Constitution and their
oath of office: the protection of life, liberty, and property
is the first order of business for democratic government-not something
government does if it has money left over after all the special
interests are taken care of. If citizens themselves were allowed
to rank the state's spending priorities instead of having it done
by Sacramento, many of the things government is doing with that
$57 billion would fall off the list. 
<P>
 The public's demand for effective crime control is not a passing
whim or product of media hype. It is an expression of the public's
justified concern and anger over failed leadership. Budget priorities
must be set straight. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Meeting the Challenge of Juvenile Justice
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Future crime rates in California will be greatly affected by
the state's ability to make the juvenile justice system effective
at preventing juvenile delinquents from becoming hard-core criminals.
In a 1989 study, juvenile justice expert Donna Clontz identified
attempts over the previous decade to &quot;graft public safety
concepts into a system designed purely for rehabilitation&quot;
as cause for the system's failure to succeed in either area:
<P>
The current system, in its effort to rehabilitate, actually contributes
to the delinquency of many minors by allowing them to commit multiple
crimes before taking any substantial action . . . . there is little
or no consequence until aberrant patterns are so ingrained that
it is very difficult to change them.
<P>
 A review of juvenile arrests seems to bear this out. Between
1987 and 1992 the number of adults arrested for violent crimes
increased by 35%.  Over the same period, the number of juveniles
arrested for violent crimes shot up 75%.  To combat this trend
California must first realize that its juvenile justice system
is failing to stem this flow of juvenile offenders into a life
of adult crime.  For the thousands who are today committing violent
crimes, the diversion of scarce resources for rehabilitation cannot
be justified.  In most cases the goal should be to remove them
from society, hopefully to a penal system which requires the development
of occupational skills and basic education as the criteria for
release.  The crime that a person commits, regardless of his age,
must become the primary basis for the length of his confinement.

<H2>Identification and Filtering</H2>

<P>
 The first priority of  any juvenile justice system should be
to protect the public.  The second is to act in the best interests
of the minor.  To accomplish this, children developing a pattern
of violating the law must be identified before they begin to commit
serious crimes.  The bulk of California's juvenile justice resources
must be focused upon those most likely to benefit, the youth at
the front end of the system.  The popular term for this is &quot;early
intervention.&quot;  The first step is to change the way the system
deals with status offenders.  Children who habitually run away
from home, who are truant or incorrigible, who roam the streets
at night, are displaying early behavior patterns common among
criminals.  Existing resources at both the state and local level,
including schools, juvenile courts, local offender juvenile programs,
and probation departments, must be pooled to help identify these
at-risk children and to monitor changes in their behavior.
<P>
 As a major step toward an overhaul of local juvenile justice
programs, California should require counties to develop community-based
programs which involve parental control and supervision while
applying a uniform schedule of increasing consequences for repeated
offenses. 
<P>
 An existing program which has been successful is the voluntary,
community-based effort to deal with truancy under section 601
of California's Welfare and Institutions Code.  The School Attendance
Review Board (SARB) program utilizes a team of local representatives
from schools, law enforcement and juvenile justice to identify
children who are habitually truant from school and require that
the child and the parent(s) participate in a counseling program
focused on preventing future delinquency.  Children and parents
who fail to participate are referred to the juvenile court to
face the possibility of more severe consequences.  At this early
stage of misbehavior, the specter of parental and official authority
has a positive effect on children.  An expanded version of this
program should be adopted in every county to identify and monitor
truants, runaways, incorrigibles and curfew violators.
<P>
 Every child who habitually commits these offenses, and the parents
of that child, should be required to participate in SARB-type
counseling as the initial contact with the juvenile justice system.
 This program should also be utilized to monitor the behavior
of juveniles who continue to commit offenses and have graduated
to more serious consequences.  This is the first step in a much-needed
identification and filtering process.
<H2>Increased Supervision of Young Offenders</H2>

<P>
 Presently, juveniles on formal probation for committing crimes
are supervised by a probation officer.  In some counties probation
officers have caseloads of over eighty offenders.  In a given
month these overburdened officers often find it difficult to communicate
with their charges over the telephone, let alone through visits
to their homes.
<P>
 California must make a strong commitment to increase the supervision
of its juvenile offenders.  This will necessarily require additional
expenditures, including funds for an increase in the number of
probation officers.
<P>
 Schools can play a major roll in this increased supervision for
students who are on probation. The assignment of probation officers
should be based on where juveniles attend school, and probation
officers should visit these schools on a regular basis.  At the
same time, schools must not be coerced into retaining juveniles
who are seriously disruptive.  Teachers should be notified when
their students are on probation, what the conditions of probation
are, and how to report violations of those conditions or other
suspicious behavior.
<P>
 In areas where there is community-based policing, officers should
also be notified of the juveniles on his or her beat currently
on probation and, when possible, become familiar with the juvenile's
home, parents and neighbors.  Under this system the young offender
will be constantly aware that someone is monitoring his behavior.

<H2>Sharing Information Across Jurisdictions</H2>

<P>
 Presently, in most parts of California, there is no way patrol
officers can quickly access the record of juveniles.  This means
that they may often be at risk of attack, release a serious or
chronic offender with only a warning, fail to detain a youth with
an active warrant, prolong investigations, or make other important
decisions without proper information.  Additionally, many agencies
working with juveniles have inaccurate or incomplete information
about their charges.
<P>
 Juvenile court judges, probation officers and the staff at county
and state juvenile facilities have many options regarding the
handling of young offenders.  Their decisions should be based
upon accurate information about a juvenile's previous contact
with the system and the evaluations of those who have been responsible
for him.  When a juvenile offender reaches adulthood the criminal
justice system is unaware of his history of juvenile offenses.
 In most cases the offender's fingerprints are not even on file.
 
<P>
 California must establish a system of documenting and sharing
the criminal histories of juvenile offenders.  At initial contact
with the juvenile justice system, every juvenile should be fingerprinted
and that print should be maintained by the state department of
justice.  A juvenile's future record of arrests, referrals, commitments
and treatment programs should be maintained and indexed to his
fingerprints and made available to law enforcement agencies and
other government entities responsible for him. 
<H2>Increased Consequences</H2>

<P>
 It is essential that all young people clearly understand that
the price for breaking the law goes up with repeated offenses.
 Regardless of where an offender is arrested, local authorities
should be able to quickly review his history and determine what
sanctions have already been applied for his prior offenses.  Donna
Clontz described the practice in her 1989 study:
<P>
In most jurisdictions, real sanctions are nonexistent early in
a juvenile delinquent's career.  The message to the minor is &quot;It's
okay to break the law.  Nothing happens to you.&quot;  The result
is a total disrespect for &quot;juvenile justice&quot;-because
it is not providing justice for anyone at all.  It is important
that people who fashion consequences for crimes and create solutions
to diverse youthful problems retain some discretion in decision
making.  However, they too must be held accountable for providing
consistent consequences as well as requiring parental participation.
<P>
 California must establish a basic schedule of increasing consequences,
incorporating programs generally available throughout the state,
including probation, community service work programs, suspension
of driving privileges, boot camp, counseling, and juvenile hall.
 Counties should be required to follow this schedule.  Changes
in juvenile court procedures and the evidence requirements to
prove violations of probation-making them comparable with those
in the adult system-would be a major step in demonstrating to
juvenile offenders that breaking the rules will not be tolerated.
<P>
 The California Youth Authority (CYA), which has increasingly
become a warehouse for serious juvenile offenders, should provide
a last opportunity for those who have gone through the basic schedule
of locally administered consequences to avoid the lengthy confinement
associated with adult habitual criminals. 
<P>
 A person should be sent to a CYA facility only once.  A juvenile
whose most serious offense is a misdemeanor should not be eligible
for CYA.  Violent offenders should be held and treated separately
from habitual, nonviolent juveniles.  While confined at CYA, juveniles
should be required to participate in programs designed to educate
them about the consequences of future criminal activity and other
programs designed to address specific categories of offenders.
 Currently available services include drug rehabilitation, development
of occupational skills, and sex offender counseling.  In most
cases, a CYA commitment should be no longer than it takes to administer
and evaluate the effect of such programs.  An appropriate goal
might be six months.  Offenders who fail to perform should be
transferred to state-run facilities for juveniles which operate
like adult prisons.
<P>
 Juveniles who commit additional crimes after a CYA commitment
should be referred to adult court and, upon conviction, sentenced
to adult-length terms to be served in the above-mentioned prisons
until they reach the age of 18 and can be transferred to an adult
correctional facility.
<H2>Opening Up the System</H2>

<P>
 The public knows very little about what happens in juvenile court
because most cases are decided in closed hearings.  With current
levels of juvenile crime, it is no longer prudent to allow such
proceedings to be conducted in secret.  The community-based approach
to juvenile crime, discussed earlier in this paper, requires the
full support of the local citizenry.  To assure this support and
that the system is working to protect the safety of the public,
juvenile hearings should be opened to the public.  In states that
have opened their juvenile courts on the same basis as their adult
courts, none have experienced increased expenses due to spectators
or had other negative side effects.  The individual juvenile's
desire for privacy is far outweighed by the public's need for
information about the operation of its juvenile courts and their
effect on public safety.
<H1>
<CENTER>
The Road to Safe Streets: Community-based Policing
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Until the latter part of this century the maintenance of public
order was a major priority of  American law enforcement.  In virtually
every big city and small town, police patrolled on foot and exercised
broad authority to discourage vagrants, rowdiness, public drunkenness,
and other offensive behavior.  This role of police changed as
the economic benefits of using patrol cars equipped with radios
to police growing urban centers were recognized.  The radical
changes in social policies of the 1960s included successful political
and legal efforts to strike down laws which had given police authority
to control the behavior of vagrants and panhandlers.  In the face
of these developments, prosecution agencies were reluctant to
test existing laws, political leaders were reluctant to enact
new ones, and municipal police departments completely abandoned
their order-maintenance duties. 
<P>
 This official tolerance of public nuisances had a dramatic effect
on serious crime.  In his book <I>Thinking About Crime</I>, Professor
James Q. Wilson discusses studies conducted in New York and Great
Britain between 1954 and 1965 reporting that increases in foot
patrols resulted in reductions of serious street crime by more
than thirty percent.  An article Wilson wrote in <I>The Atlantic</I>
in 1982 with George L. Kelling further established the link between
general order and serious crime. It and subsequent studies have
led many American cities to restore foot patrols (community-based
policing) and enact local statutes to discourage aggressive panhandling,
prostitution, sleeping in parks and on sidewalks, and other offensive
behavior which has converted prosperous urban business and residential
areas into filthy, open-air flophouses where the only commerce
is in drugs and violence. 
<P>
 While homeless advocates and civil liberties groups continue
to challenge these actions as class discrimination and unconstitutional
violations of free expression, some recent federal court decisions
to allow enforcement of laws punishing behavior rather than status
offer encouragement.  For instance, a 1992 United States Supreme
Court decision in <I>International Society for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc.</I> v.<I> Lee</I>  upheld a New York law prohibiting panhandling
in airports. In 1990  the federal Court of Appeals ruled in <I>Young
</I>v.<I> New York City Transit Authority</I> that another New
York law prohibiting panhandling in subways passed constitutional
muster.
<P>
 It is important to note that national studies have repeatedly
proven that estimates regarding the size and makeup of the &quot;homeless&quot;
population advanced by these advocates and accepted by the news
industry are highly inflated.
<P>
 In places where public order laws have been enforced, the effect
has been positive.  Since 1990, for example, following the Young
decision to allow enforcement of public order regulations in New
York's subway system, the rate for robbery has dropped by 41%
and the rates for felonious assault and grand larceny have decreased
36%.
<P>
 The arguments for reducing crime through enforcement of similar
laws on public streets are compelling.  The director of a homeless
shelter in Boston underscored this when he publicly requested
that people not give panhandlers money because it is used to buy
drugs, subverting any rehabilitative efforts the city provides
and increasing the expense for medical treatment.  In light of
findings that the bulk of America's street population consists
of drug-addicted and alcoholic males, this request makes very
good sense.
<P>
 In order to reduce crime and improve the economic environment
of its urban areas California must become an initiator and a supporter
of community-based policing and the maintenance of public order
as a law enforcement priority. 
<P>
 In <I>A Guide to Regulating Panhandling</I>, published last April,
public interest attorney Kent S. Scheidegger offers model laws
which give beat officers a means of controlling the behavior of
panhandlers.  Similar laws and others addressing sleeping in public
parks and blocking sidewalks have been adopted in many communities,
including several cities in California.  Some of these laws are
currently being tested in state and federal court.  State efforts
to encourage communities to adopt these policies, perhaps with
incentives, will speed efforts to make our streets, sidewalks
and parks safe and attractive for everyone.
<H1>
<CENTER>
SECURING OUR BORDERS
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The nonenforcement of immigration laws teaches those entering
California illegally, and others already here, the same lesson
that criminals learn from urban streets littered with drunks,
drug addicts and prostitutes, i.e., &quot;the law is not enforced
here.&quot;  Exacerbating the federal government's unwillingness
to enforce the law at the border, the local policy in some urban
areas has been to actually forbid police who discover illegal
aliens while investigating crimes from reporting them to federal
authorities for deportation.
<P>
 The annual cost of confining illegal immigrants who commit crimes
is estimated to be $500 million.  This does not take into account
the cost of arrest and conviction, which is borne by counties.
 The state suffers an even larger financial burden for social
programs delivered to illegal aliens.
<P>
 Governor Wilson has focused upon this problem and suggested several
steps to stop the flow of illegal aliens, and several members
of California's congressional delegation have expressed support
for some of these proposals.  Yet there is still no consensus
on the need for urgent action.  It is time for all of California's
political leaders-state and federal, Republican and Democrat-to
unite behind a demand that the federal government fulfill its
legal obligation to secure California's borders against alien
immigration.
<P>
 It may take time for the federal government to fulfill its obligations
in this area, but there are immediate steps that the state can
take to alleviate the problem.  As a first step, state and local
government agencies should be required to identify and report
illegal aliens among the populations they serve.  The cost for
such an effort would be far less than continuing to provide illegals
with services and process those who violate state laws through
the criminal justice system.
<P>
 With regard to illegals in the criminal population, there are
specific steps the state can take.  Illegal aliens arrested for
less serious crimes should be fingerprinted and deported rather
than tried and confined at the expense of taxpayers.
<P>
 The federal government must do its part.  California's political
leaders should ask the President to direct the State Department
to clarify and strengthen extradition agreements with foreign
governments to allow illegals convicted and sentenced for serious
crimes to be confined in prisons in their home country with a
similar understanding regarding the return of American lawbreakers
for confinement here.  The adoption of NAFTA leaves the United
States in a good position to make this agreement with Mexico.
<P>
 While the greatest benefits from these actions would be to reduce
state spending for social programs, the savings in local and state
criminal justice resources would be substantial.
<H1>
<CENTER>
Corrections and Sentencing Reform 
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 In December 1993, national headlines were dominated by another
abhorrent crime apparently committed by an habitual criminal.
 The kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas has brought
to the forefront the rules governing California's system for sentencing
and confining serious repeat offenders.  Robert Allen Davis, who
has been charged with the crime, had prior convictions for two
major felonies and was released from state prison four months
before the girl's kidnapping and murder. State laws granting convicted
criminals release after serving only half of their sentence undoubtedly
provided Davis with the freedom to commit other crimes.
<P>
 Under California law, a criminal sentenced to prison receives
credits for good behavior totaling roughly one-third of his confinement
upon entry to prison.  To lose part of this &quot;good time&quot;
the criminal must be found to have broken prison rules through
a time-consuming complaint and hearing process.  An inmate who
does lose part of his &quot;good time&quot; for attacking a guard,
for example, can earn it back by avoiding being caught and found
guilty of another offense over a fixed period of time.  In effect,
a criminal can continue to commit crimes while in prison and still
be eligible for early release so long as he spaces out his offenses
enough to regain his &quot;good time.&quot;  In addition, state
law provides that inmates who are willing to work receive one
day off their sentence for each day they are willing to work,
even if there is no work to do.  The maximum amount of credit
which can be earned utilizing &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; reduces a criminal's sentence by one-half.  Even convicted
murderers are eligible for these sentence reductions.
<P>
 The time to abandon this practice is long past. Strong truth-in-sentencing
guidelines must  require that habitual offenders serve the full
terms of their sentences.  
<P>
 While some correctional administrators have argued that such
sentence reduction credits provide incentives for convicts to
behave, and thereby become  easier to manage, correctional officers
actually working in prisons consider them useless in controlling
inmate behavior and actually a license to commit some offenses
with impunity.
<P>
 California must replace &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; credits with changes in the determinate sentencing
law to retain a minimum base term while creating an indeterminate
upper term.  Like the federal prison system, the overriding rule
in California should be, &quot;If you do the crime, you do the
time.&quot;  California's sentence for a first conviction for
forcible rape, for example, could be changed from the current
range of 3, 6 or 8 years, to an indeterminate term of 5 to 8 years.
 The new sentencing scheme would provide that only rapists who
avoid additional offenses and participate in work and other rehabilitative
programs would be eligible for release at completion of the five-year
base term.  Inmates who continued to offend or refused to participate
would not be considered for release until their behavior conformed
for a significant period (perhaps one year).  Those unwilling
to cooperate would remain in prison until completion of the upper
term of 8 years.  The key to this system is that the desired behavior
would be required for release at the end of the base term rather
than as a bargaining chip for a sentence reduction.   
<H2>The Discipline of Work</H2>

<P>
 Productive work should also be a requirement rather than an option.
 In the past, efforts to allow more meaningful work for inmates
have been blocked by labor interest complaints that working inmates
would take jobs away from law-abiding citizens.  The state of
California currently provides billions of dollars worth of services
to the public which are funded by the taxpayers.  The state also
owns and maintains buildings (including prisons), motor vehicles,
highways, dams and parks.  Inmates should be required to perform
these services (as attrition permits).  The savings would lower
the tax burden on California's economy, which has been shown to
encourage the creation of jobs in the private sector.
<P>
 Currently, many inmates are paid by the state for the work they
perform.  The wages can be used by inmates as &quot;credits&quot;
for the purchase of items from the prison commissary.  This practice
has not been proven to contribute to inmate rehabilitation and
can create problems in controlling them.  It should be abandoned.
 The savings realized from inmate labor should be used to help
pay for the cost of their conviction, confinement, and to support
programs and services related to public safety such as local courts
and delinquency prevention efforts. 
<P>
 The size of California's prison system has allowed for a wide
variety of living conditions among the various facilities.  The
state already utilizes these differences to separate inmates by
their level of criminal sophistication and behavior in confinement.
 This process should be continued and expanded to provide incentives
for inmates to behave well and participate in work programs. 
In the interest of rehabilitation, inmates who perform well should
be transferred to institutions offering work which can develop
proficiency in marketable skills, such as plumbing, carpentry
and computer programming.  Inmates with chronic behavior problems
should spend their indeterminate terms in institutions offering
work which relies less on skills and teamwork than on manual labor.

<H2>Habitual Criminals: The Cost of Prisons vs. the Costs of Crime
</H2>

<P>
 The greatest threat of crime is presented by habitual criminals.
 One survey conducted by the Rand Corporation found that the average
career criminal commits between 187 and 287 crimes per year, at
an average cost for each crime of $2,300.  The current cost of
confining a criminal in California is $25,000 per year.  This
does not include the expense of investigating crimes, arrest or
conviction.  Comparing the minimum $430,000 annual cost of keeping
an habitual criminal on the street with the $25,000 expense of
confinement makes a powerful case for the proposition that individuals
who continue to commit crimes should be imprisoned for increasingly
longer periods of time.  California voters demonstrated their
support for this with adoption of Proposition 8 in 1982, which
added five years to the sentence of a convicted felon for each
prior conviction.  With the above-discussed elimination of &quot;good
time&quot; and &quot;work time&quot; credits, California would
finally have an honest and effective process for confining most
habitual criminals. 
<P>
 California can further improve this process by taking three important
steps. 
<P>
 <I>Habitual criminals convicted for a third time of any major
felony should receive a mandatory prison sentence of life without
the possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 While a proposal currently being circulated in California, identified
in the press as the &quot;Three Strikes You're Out&quot; initiative,
does appear to increase confinement for habitual criminals by
requiring a mandatory prison term of twenty-five years to life
for a third felony conviction, the proposal retains a 20% &quot;good
time&quot; credit, reducing the minimum commitment to 20 years.
 After serving that term the criminal would be eligible for parole.
 A better alternative was adopted last November in the state of
Washington.  That state's Initiative #593, also labeled &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out,&quot; mandates a life without parole sentence
for a third violent felony conviction.  California should enact
a similar law.
<P>
 <I>Sentences for <B>violent</B> crimes should be increased across
the board. For example, persons convicted for a second time of
attempted murder should receive a mandatory prison sentence of
life without possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 Criminals with a history of violent behavior should not get 
&quot;three chances&quot; to repeat their crimes. Armed robbers
who demand that their victims lie face down and then fire bullets
into them should not be shown mercy because, by some miracle,
the victim survived. A would-be murderer who fails twice to kill
his victim should never receive another opportunity.
<P>
 <I>Elderly inmates who have been convicted of <B>nonviolent</B>
offenses should be considered for early release.</I>
<P>
 The recidivism rate for prisoners between the ages of 18 to 24
is roughly 22 percent, but it drops to only 2.1 percent for those
over the age of 45.  This dramatic reduction in the threat to
public safety, coupled with an estimated maintenance cost of $69,000
annually for older inmates (nearly three times the cost of younger
ones), raises questions about the benefits derived from their
continued confinement.  With many state prisons operating beyond
capacity and a large street population of young and violent repeat
offenders needing confinement, it is worth considering the early
release of inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses whose age
and behavior suggest that they can be managed outside of prison
with adequate parole supervision. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Postscript:  the Gun Control Experience
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The purpose of this paper has been to identify the major reforms
California must undertake to control crime and violence.  There
are many intermediate steps which can also be taken to correct
problems with post-conviction appeals, funding of courts, and
impediments to criminal investigations.  One proposal which is
conspicuous by its absence is for additional controls on the purchase
of firearms.
<P>
 For several years California has attempted to enforce a ban on
certain types of &quot;assault weapons&quot; purportedly popular
with criminals.  It has also had one of the longest waiting periods
for the purchase of handguns in the nation.  These restrictions
of hardware typically purchased illegally by criminals to aid
in their commission of other illegal acts do not appear to have
reduced the number and type of firearms used by criminals or the
rate of serious crime. 
<P>
 In large American cities with the most restrictive laws governing
the purchase and carrying of firearms, similar laws seem to have
had no appreciable effect on crime at all.  Of the five American
cities with the highest murder rates in 1991-Washington, D.C.,
New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit, and Birmingham-all but one, New
Orleans, are in states which have, for years, had strict gun control
laws requiring a license to purchase or carry a handgun and/or
registration of gun ownership.  The most restrictive gun control
law is enforced in Washington, D.C., which has, by far, the highest
murder rate of any American city.  
<P>
 While these figures do not prove that anti-gun laws are without
merit, they do indicate that energy and resources expended to
outlaw hardware might be better spent rounding up and confining
the criminals who are using it to threaten, injure and kill their
victims.

<B>California</B>'<B>s Private Schools:  </B>
<P>
<B>Survey Results</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
As the school choice debate heats up, the focus is on California's
private schools.  Anti-choice advocates vilify them as havens
for the wealthy and dens of discrimination.  Are these charges
true?  And if California should adopt a voucher system, how would
these schools react?
<P>
To answer these and other questions, the Claremont Institute commissioned
a survey of California private schools.  Approximately five hundred
schools responded, and the data permits us to reach some intriguing
conclusions about the likely consequences of a voucher system.
<P>
<B>The Survey</B>
<P>
The Private School Survey consisted of 25 questions which sought
to establish profiles of a cross section of California's private
schools.  Schools were differentiated by religious affiliation
(or non-affiliation), grade levels offered, type of property on
which the school sits, types and numbers of staff employed, length
of school day, parental involvement, size of student population,
admissions criteria, teaching methods, revenues and revenue sources,
and current expenditures.  The survey also asked private schools
to discuss their plans for the years ahead, with and without a
voucher system.
<P>
The results of the survey paint a picture of private schools far
different than the stereotype offered up by school choice opponents.
 They are diverse and varied, meeting the needs of widely different
segments of the population.  In other words, the educational marketplace,
like the marketplace for other goods, produces a wide variety
of products that meet the varying demand of consumers-in this
case, the needs of parents seeking an effective education for
their children.
<P>
<B>Private School Profiles</B>
<P>
Of the private schools that responded to the survey, about a third
were non-religious.  Of the remaining two-thirds, religious affiliation
ran the gamut from Catholic (22 percent of the total), Association
of Christian Schools (22 percent), general Protestant (7 percent),
Lutheran (6 percent), with smaller numbers of schools run by Seventh
Day Adventists, Jews, Episcopalians, and others.
<P>
In terms of enrollment size, a strong majority of the schools
fall into the medium range, with 56 percent having 100 to 499
students and 17.7 percent 50 to 99 students, followed by schools
with between 25 and 49 students (12.4 percent), very large schools
with more than 500 students (9.1 percent), and very small schools
with under 25 students (3.9 percent).  Although an almost equal
number of Catholic and ASC schools responded to the survey, Catholic
schools have by far the larger number of students (48 percent
of all the students in the religiously-affiliated schools).
<P>
Approximately four-fifths of the schools offer instruction in
grades K-6, 65 percent at the 7th and 8th grade level, and between
32 and 35 percent at the 9th to 12th grade level.  Although the
length of schools years ranged from very short to very long, nearly
64 percent said that it is between 175 and 180 days.  The average
school day is just over six hours.  Parental involvement in the
schools is not required by the 64 percent of respondents.
<P>
Schools in our survey obtained their buildings through various
means.  Fifty-five-plus percent constructed them.  Others bought
them (15.5 percent) or used a church or church property (13 percent),
a commercial property (9.3 percent), or a residential property
(8.9 percent).  The property the buildings stand on are most often
owned by an organization affiliated with the school (47.6 percent)
or by the school itself (36.1  percent).  Sixteen percent lease
their facilities.
<P>
In fact, the average annual revenue for the private schools responding
to the survey was just over $1 million, with nearly 64 percent
having revenues over $250,000.  Non-religious private schools
had a revenue average of $1.3 million, and religious schools $850,000.
<P>
Most revenues come from tuition and fees-nearly 84 percent of
the $1 million annual total (slightly more for non-religious schools,
slightly less for the others).  Remaining revenues come from parent/student
fund-raising, benefactor and alumni donations, and aid from affiliated
organizations.
<P>
<B>Teaching Methods</B>
<P>
The great majority of the schools responding to the survey (66.6
percent) employ interdisciplinary course work and instruction.
 This is the most familiar type of instruction:  instruction in
the sciences, math, English, social sciences, fine arts, etc.
 A significant minority (37 percent) use individualized courses
of study based on each child's ability rather than age or grade
level.  This includes a majority (58 percent) of the non-religious
schools.
<P>
Montessori teaching methods are used by 9.9 percent of the responding
schools, magnet-style instruction in a particular subject by 8.2
percent, and cooperative learning by 2.3 percent.  Although two-thirds
of the schools responding to the survey were religiously affiliated,
a bare one percent use religious teaching methods.  
<P>
Although few schools use religious teaching methods, 66.6 percent
engage in moral character training.  This includes 83 percent
of the religiously-affiliated schools and 32 percent of the others.
 
<P>
<B>Ratio of Teachers to Administrators</B>
<P>
One of the hottest issues in education is staffing.  In particular,
the public school system has been accused of being top-heavy with
non-teaching personnel.  In the California public school system,
the State Department of Education admits that non-teachers outnumber
teachers by a ration of approximately 13 to 10.
<P>
In their groundbreaking book <I>Politics, Markets and America's
Schools</I>, John Chubb and Terry Moe found &quot;an emerging
consensus among scholars and reformers that centralization and
bureaucratization are substantially at odds with the effective
organization of schools and the successful provision of education.&quot;
 The Private School Survey suggests that private schools are more
in line with this consensus:  Teachers outnumber non-teaching
staff in the private schools by a ratio of 2.2 to 1.  Adding classroom
aides into the picture, the ratio rises to 2.8 to 1.
<P>
Private school spending figures bear out this emphasis on the
classroom.  Of those responding to the survey, total spending
on teachers was three times that on non-teaching staff ($202 million
versus $65.7 million).  The numbers are even more dramatic in
private schools with per pupil expenditures under $3,000 per year,
where more than four times as much is spent ($58.7 million versus
$13.6 million).  
<P>
<B>Admissions Criteria</B>
<P>
Academic aptitude was listed by 74 percent of responding schools
as an admissions criterion.  This was especially true of religious
schools, with 80 percent of them (and 92 percent of Catholic schools)
taking academic merit into account.
<P>
Surprisingly, less than half of the religious schools (47 percent)
listed religious affiliation as an admissions criterion.  Indeed,
less than 38 percent of the evangelical-leaning ASC schools did
so.  The extremes on the scale were represented by Jewish schools
(82 percent) and Episcopal schools (11 percent), with 63 percent
of the Catholic schools considering religion.  Nor is having a
family member who is affiliated with a religion as important as
might be thought:  less than 23 percent listed this as a criterion
in their admissions process.  The same is true of &quot;connections&quot;:
 only 32 percent of the schools listed family affiliation with
the school as an admissions criterion.
<P>
Perhaps most surprising is the survey finding that a minority
of the private schools (41 percent) listed ability to pay tuition
as a criterion for admission.  The difference between non-religious
and religious schools in this regard was minimal (38 percent versus
42.6 percent).  Catholic schools were among the least concerned
with ability to pay tuition (34.7 percent).  
<P>
Other criteria used by schools included the catch-all category
of &quot;background of student&quot; (48 percent), student attitude
(14.2 percent), and learning disability/special needs (5 percent).
<P>
<B>Vouchers and Enrollment Growth</B>
<P>
Another hot topic concerns space availability in private schools.
 Critics of vouchers say that the private school system in the
state cannot expand quickly enough to handle the demand vouchers
will create.
<P>
First, according to the survey, an overwhelming number of the
responding schools (80 percent) would accept vouchers.  Just over
4 percent would not.  (The remaining 16 percent were unsure or
did not answer).  Schools with an annual per pupil expenditure
under $3,000 were more likely to accept vouchers (86.7 percent).
<P>
But what about space availability?  Of the schools responding,
49.6 percent said they had more spaces than applicants for the
1992-93 school year, while 46.5 percent had more applicants than
spaces.  Of schools with a per-pupil expenditure under $3,000,
nearly 52 percent had more spaces than applicants.
<P>
Thus clearly, existing facilities would not be enough to meet
the greater demand generated by vouchers.  And there are limitations
to expansion of existing schools.  Local zoning ordinances, for
example, limit the ability to expand facilities for 28 percent
of responding schools.  
<P>
If a voucher system is adopted, almost half (48%) of the schools
responding said that they would increase their size and capacity.
 Some would use portable classrooms to increase their capacity
(22 percent); others would build additional classrooms on their
current site (22.5 percent).  Thirteen percent said that they
would expand by opening an additional school at a new site, while
11 percent said they would expand by moving to a new site.  
<P>
In short, there will be an immediate and dramatic increase in
space and capacity in the state's private schools.  In 1995-96,
the responding schools would enroll approximately 8.6% more students
if the voucher initiative were passed.  In the outlying years,
this percentage increases.  In 1998-99, approximately 15% more
students, and in 2003-04, approximately 24% more students would
be enrolled if vouchers were available.
<P>
Of course, these enrollment projections do not account for the
building of <I>new</I> schools in response to increased demand
for private educational services.  Judging by the effects on colleges
and universities following passage of the G.I. Bill after World
War II, this proliferation of schools will be just as dramatic
as enrollment expansion in existing schools.
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
It is possible to make some broad generalizations based on the
Private School Survey.  The majority of private schools are medium-sized,
religiously affiliated, with budgets over $250,000.  Most of their
revenues come from tuition and fees, and are spent primarily on
teaching staff rather than administrators.  Academic merit, not
religious affiliation, is the most influential admissions criterion.
 The majority would accept vouchers, and nearly half would expand
their capacity to take new voucher students.  New private schools
will certainly need to be created to satisfy market demand under
a voucher system.  The best news is that if their profile resembles
that of existing private schools, California education can only
benefit.

<B>The Limitations of Land Use Planning:</B>
<P>
<B>A Warning for Californians</B>
</CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
 As California looks ahead to a resumption of the economic growth
and prosperity of the 1980s, the issue of how to manage its population
growth has returned to the top of the policy agenda.  The state's
population has topped 31 million and continues to grow by over
500,000 per year.  Projections are for  36 million by the end
of the century.
<P>
 This paper will outline and explain the inherent limitations
of long-range land-use planning, and recommend alternative growth
management guidelines.  It will pay special attention to SB 377,
Senator Robert Presley's key bill on growth management.
<H2>The Inherent Limitations of Planning</H2>

<P>
 Land-use planning is a variation of resource allocation.  The
same kind of general problems exist as in allocating other resources
through a governmental planning process.  Conversely, the case
<I>for</I> land use planning and regulation rests on the same
ground as that for any other kind of economic regulation:  the
argument that the marketplace, left to itself, will create negative
&quot;externalities&quot; or will use resources inefficiently.
 
<P>
 The inherent difficulty of trying to design a comprehensive,
long range land-use planning system is that it attempts to supersede
the decentralized decision-making system of the marketplace with
administrative judgment.  The practical problems facing planners
are extremely daunting:
<P>
* Information and projections about population and economic growth
are fundamentally unreliable and will place constrictions on land
use that further distort actual growth patterns.
<P>
* The various uses to which a parcel of land may be put, or the
relative attractiveness of alternative uses that are contingent
on surrounding land uses, are not possible to comprehend through
a comprehensive planning process.  Linkages between various land
uses and their effects (e.g., traffic congestion, business development,
compatibility of adjacent uses) are indirect, inconsistent, and
occasionally obscure.  Land is not a one-dimensional resource.
 
<P>
* Comprehensive planning underestimates, and cannot account for,
the uncertainties of the land-use market.  While land-use plans
tend to be static, the real market forces for land use are highly
dynamic.
<P>
<B>Population Projections</B>
<P>
 At the outset of any comprehensive planning, there must be long-range
population projections.  These must be segmented both demographically
and geographically.  In other words, the planner needs to know
not only the socio-economic status of the new population (to match
income and household size), but also exactly where this growth
is going to occur.
<P>
 California has a very poor track record with projections of this
kind.  Department of Finance (DoF) projections for growing areas
of the state have underestimated population growth by as much
as 10 percent within five years of the date of the projection.
 For example, DoF's 1977 projection for Riverside County underestimated
actual population growth for 1980-three years out-by 40,000. 
By 1990 this projection was off by nearly 400,000.  The 1981 revised
projection was still off by nearly 200,000.  In San Bernardino
County, DoF's 1977 projection for 1990 was off by 500,000, bringing
the cumulative error for the Inland Empire to 900,000.
<P>
 DoF projections are revised annually, but growth plans and urban
limit lines based on them are not.  This may have severe consequences.
 Consider:  Population projections for the greater-Los Angeles
area for the year 2010 differ by as much as 1.5 million.  The
use of an inaccurate projection of this magnitude in a growth
plan will lead to a mix of higher housing prices, overburdened
infrastructure, diminished opportunity (especially for the young
and the poor), and the displacement of growth to other regions.
<P>
 Had the state imposed a 20-year land-use plan in Riverside and
San Bernardino Counties in 1980 based on DoF population projections,
this growing region would have suffered dramatic constrictions
of land use, causing higher housing prices, inadequate infrastructure
capacity, and diminished economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
 Given that our ability to project population growth accurately
is limited to five years at best, most 20-year comprehensive land-use
plans (which require about five years to develop) <I>will be obsolete
just as they are implemented.</I>
<H2>Land-Use Judgments</H2>

<P>
 Even with reliable demographic information, long-range comprehensive
planning is highly problematic, given the difficulty of comprehending
all of the linkages among land use (e.g., traffic generation,
housing, and infrastructure usage).  In this, comprehensive planning
suffers on a larger scale the defects of traditional zoning. 
For instance:  A piece of land that is suitable for a particular
use one day may not be a year later, because of the uses to which
other landowners have put their property.  
<P>
 If a comprehensive plan lacks the flexibility to allow the market
to adapt to such changes, it will clog up the market, imposing
unnecessary and inefficient costs on the economy.  If the plan
allows such flexibility, on the other hand, it will necessarily
be less &quot;comprehensive.&quot;
<P>
 States with comprehensive regional planning, such as Florida
and Oregon, try to solve this dilemma with a rigorous plan-amendment
process.  Although in principle this provides a degree of flexibility
and local autonomy, in practice there is no flexibility.  All
plan amendments must be consistent with the comprehensive statewide
or regional goals.  The documentary requirements for a plan amendment
in Florida can stack up to six feet high.  This cumbersome and
time-consuming process imposes costs far in excess of benefits,
and imposes a heavy burden on local jurisdictions.
<P>
 The deeper point is this:  it is impossible for <I>any</I> system
of long-range planning to comprehend all of the factors that compose
the market for land-use transactions-lease rates, land prices,
shifting consumer demand, commodity prices, changes in the competitive
mix of the local economy, etc.
<H2>Does SB 377 Overcome these Limitations?</H2>

<P>
 If poor predictions, bad land-use judgments and lack of adequate
information for decisionmaking are problems inherent to long-term
land-use planning efforts, Californians must wonder whether SB
377, the highly-touted growth management legislation authored
by State Senator Robert Presley (D-Riverside), overcomes them.

<P>
 SB 377 requires regional agencies (e.g., councils of government
and air quality districts) within each urbanized region to propose
a regional growth management strategy by January 1, 1995.  These
strategies will be guided by state-mandated goals contained in
SB 377.  Underlying these goals is the Legislature's desire to
establish &quot;fundamental principles of resource conservation
and sustainable conservation and development to guide public policy&quot;.
 
<P>
 In fairness, it must be said that SB 377 attempts to avoid some
of the obvious pitfalls of central land-use planning.  For example,
it does not seek to create a new state land-use agency to direct
land-use decisions from Sacramento.  Also, it supports market-based
transportation pricing mechanisms, which would presumably include
peak-hour road pricing.  And it states that among its goals are
<P>
 (ii) reductions in development fees and other development requirements;
(iii) expedited project review procedures; (iv) reduction and
simplification of review, approval, and appeal criteria. . . .
<P>
 These nods to the market are laudatory.  But even a cursory reading
of SB 377 reveals the same problems that have doomed other central
land-use planning schemes.
<P>
 First , SB 377 adopts a typical long-term baseline:
<P>
Policies and actions to achieve this objective shall include,
but are not limited to, establishment in each region of land designation
system clearly identifying areas proposed for planned compact
development over areas proposed for <I>20-year period</I>, and
areas proposed for long-term or permanent protection from urban
development.<B> </B>[emphasis added]
<P>
 To repeat:  land-use plans that adopt 20-year base periods are
guaranteed to misproject the actual growth of the area in question.
 SB 377 would force such predictions to be made for all parts
of California.  Every city and county in the state would be forced
to live with the potentially disastrous effects of an off-target
projection.
<H2>SB 377 and the Misguided War on &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot;</H2>

<P>
 Despite the appearance of flexibility, SB 377 will lock land
into certain uses.  Its overriding goal is &quot;compact development,&quot;
a pattern of development &quot;with average residential densities
higher than those prevailing in the region in 1992.&quot;<B> 
</B>In other words, the bill seeks to force Californians to live
in more crowded urban areas.
<P>
<B> </B>SB 377 would break down all California land into four
categories: (1) existing communities suitable for maximum feasible
redevelopment, (2) communities suitable for infill growth that
will meet density standards for compact development, (3) urban
reserve areas that are not developed, but could be suitable for
development after 20 years, and (4) agricultural and other productive
lands and environmentally sensitive areas suitable for maximum
long-term conservation or permanent protection.<B>  </B>The idea
behind these categories is to increase density where people are
currently living and prevent other areas from being developed.
<P>
 Why force people to live closer together?  According to SB 377
it is to combat &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; i.e., the suburbanization
of housing patterns that has occurred since the 1950s.  The evils
that stem from &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; according to its enemies,
include increased traffic congestion and air pollution (both due
to longer work commutes) and inefficient use of land resources.
<P>
 Empirical evidence, however, clearly demonstrates that these
and other claims against suburbanization are false.  For instance:
 According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation,
most of the increase in peak-hour traffic congestion during the
1970s and early '80s came from <I>non</I>-work-related travel.
 As people have become more affluent, an increasing number have
been taking discretionary trips, especially during peak-hours.
 The survey also found that any growth in work-related commuting
has occurred during <I>non</I>-peak hours.  Urban sprawl, therefore,
is not the primary cause of increased peak-hour congestion or
air pollution.
<P>
 Ironically, increased densities of the sort sought by SB 377
will itself lead to increased congestion.  Why?  Because increased
densities will lead to more discretionary commutes in more densely
developed areas.
<P>
<B> </B>Like most central land-use plans, SB 377 also seeks to
increase the use of public mass transit-specifically light rail.<B>
 </B>What it doesn't detail is the enormous cost to the public
of mass transit systems.  Miami's rail system, for example, costs
a staggering $16.77 per passenger.  And according to a study by
the Congressional Budget Office, light rail is the most expensive
form of mass transit on a per-passenger-mile cost basis.
<P>
<B> </B>Another myth about urban sprawl-enshrined in the fourth
land category defined in SB 377-is that it is depleting beautiful
land and vital agricultural land.  But the facts show that urban
development constitutes less than 3 percent of the land in the
United States.  In California, there are now more acres under
agricultural cultivation than in the 1950s, even though the state's
population has doubled.  This is because irrigation and other
technologies have allowed more unused land to be converted into
farm land.
<H2>The Economics of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 Although SB 377 offers rhetoric about economic development, its
words ring hollow.  By attempting to counter urban sprawl by reducing
the supply of land that can be developed, the bill will almost
surely raise the cost of land.  Reduced developer fees and expedited
review procedures will not be enough to offset the fact that less
land means higher prices.  
<P>
 In Southeast England, which has its own version of &quot;compact
development&quot; and land categorization, an acre of urban land
is an unbelievable 235-times more expensive than an acre of agricultural
land.  In California, where land prices are already high, more
rising costs will cause another round of business flight, not
to mention misery to home-buying families who can barely afford
current government-distorted housing costs.  
<P>
 Already businesses cite California's high land prices as a prime
reason why they are relocating or thinking about relocating. 
SB 377 would only exacerbate this serious problem.
<P>
 SB 377 fails to recognize that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is actually
an important factor in business expansion and profitability. 
For instance, as urban ecologist John Kasarda has pointed out:
 &quot;Regarding cost effectiveness, it is well documented that
many modern industries operate more efficiently in outlying locations
than in densely built-up centers, and that the costs of living
and costs of local government soar in large population concentrations.&quot;<B>
 </B>This view is echoed by USC professors Peter Gordon and Harry
Richardson, who say that business and industry has followed people
out to the less expensive suburbs.  They warn:  &quot;Problems
are most likely to arise when restrictive zoning measures prevent
industrial deconcentration or when 'slow growth' or 'growth centers'
policies limit it.&quot;<B>  </B>What this amounts to is that
job-creation will be undermined severely by the imposition of
&quot;compact development.&quot;
<P>
 Gordon and Richardson's USC colleague Richard Peiser makes the
point that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is, over time, self-correcting.
 That is, in a freely operating land market, suburban areas promote
higher-density development and are converted eventually into high
density areas.  Central land-use planning of the sort envisioned
by SB 377 is therefore unnecessary.
<H2>The Wide Net of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 What is most troublesome about SB 377 is the wide net it throws.
 Through its planning mechanisms, it seeks to address public infrastructure
investment, social equity considerations, environmental quality,
natural resource protection, housing affordability, and a myriad
of other goals and subgoals.  And despite all its soothing talk
of &quot;coordination,&quot; &quot;consistency,&quot; and &quot;cooperation,&quot;
the bill admits the problem:
<P>
[C]onflicts may occur between one or more goals or objectives
referenced in this section.  Therefore, it is the intent of the
Legislature that these conflicts be resolved by locating the development
and infrastructure necessary to accomodate planned levels of growth
within more compact development patterns within designated urban
areas established through a local regional planning process. .
. .
<P>
<B> </B>A clue to the nature and intensity of the conflicts inherent
in the bill's far-reaching goals can be seen in the provision
to &quot;ensure that the decisionmaking process regarding growth
and economic development reflects the ethnic, racial, gender,
and occupational diversity of California&quot; and &quot;that
substantive decisions provide for a fair and equitable sharing
of benefits and burdens among all ethnic, racial, gender, and
occupational groups.&quot;  SB 377 offers only vague generalizations
about how these goals will be implemented, e.g., it speaks of
&quot;measures to ensure enhanced representation of and accountability
to the state's diverse population in the decisionmaking process.&quot;
 Would .......such measures include subsidies to certain groups
or quotas in housing and quotas on government land-use planning
boards?  It is ominous in this context that a laundry list of
activist pro-affirmative action organizations (e.g., MALDEF and
the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans) have lined up in support
of SB 377.
<P>
 In sum, SB 377, for all its good intentions, will not achieve
its goals and will dangerously impair intelligent land-use planning
by cities and localities.  It incorporates many of the worst features
of central planning.  If Californians wish to achieve the goals
contained in SB 377-economic development, cleaner air, less congested
roads, etc.-they would do well to turn instead to the many market-based
solutions on the table.
<H2>Market-based Solutions</H2>

<P>
 Instead of comprehensive land use planning, our goal should be
a growth-management framework that allows the market to be largely
self-regulating.  
<P>
 A more direct and effective state strategy for growth management
would work through changes in the state Standard Zoning and Enabling
Act, the basic charter for local land-use planning authority.
 Through amendments to this act, the state could establish the
following guidelines:
<P>
*  Allow the building of accessory units in or on the property
of single family housing.  This would generate additional density
in suburbs without radically altering their character.  The Kemp
Commission on Affordable Housing estimates that this policy would
result in over three million affordable housing units nationwide.
 That is larger than the whole stock of publicly owned housing
in the nation.
<P>
*  Require that all residential land be zoned at up to eight units
to the acre, or some other moderate density standard.  This too
would generate additional density in places where there is demand
for it.  And it could encourage the private provision of open
space by allowing a reduction in minimum lot size.
<P>
*  Adopt an effective measure to reduce planning delays.  In Massachusetts,
local planning bodies have 120 days to rule.  If they do not,
approval is automatic.  Extensions are allowed under extraordinary
circumstances that are tightly defined.  Approvals may not be
appealed.  Refusals may be appealed to a judicial body established
by the state.  That body, too, has a strict time limit under which
to operate.
<P>
*  Restrict the use of impact fees, especially for &quot;infill&quot;
development.  We should fund our roads, which are the most costly
component of the infrastructure problem, with tolls and user charges,
as mentioned above.
<P>
 In addition, we should pass legislation allowing direct user-charges,
especially in the form of variable-rate or peak-hour pricing.
 A direct road pricing scheme will be a powerful incentive, in
the form of spontaneous price signals, for infill development
and rural land conservation.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
 As Californians wrestle over what our state should like in the
years to come, the keen observation of Nobel laureate economist
Frederick Hayek in his <I>Constitution of Liberty</I> should serve
as a warning to policy-maker who seek further centralization of
the planning function:
<P>
We must not overlook the fact that the market has, on the whole,
guided the evolution of cities more successfully, though imperfectly,
than is commonly realized and that most proposals to improve upon
this, not by making it work better, but by superimposing a system
of central direction, show little awareness of what such a system
would have to accomplish, even to equal the market in effectiveness.

<TITLE>Trends Point To Chaos: California's Budget and California's Future

Trends Point To Chaos:<BR>
California's Budget And California's Future
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
When the 1993-94 state budget compromise was reached, a collective
sigh of relief arose from the Capitol.  The dread possibility
of a repeat of last year's budget stalemate was avoided.  But
this relief is shortsighted.  The fiscal and budgetary trends
of the past several years, taken with projections for the rest
of the decade, suggest strongly that unless dramatic steps are
taken to revive the state's economy, California is headed toward
an economic Armageddon.
<H2>Declining Revenues</H2>

<P>
For three years California's government has overprojected revenues.
 In 1990-91, the state's initial revenue estimate was $5 billion
too high.  In 1991-92 the overestimate was $7 billion.  In 1992-93,
it was high again by about $5 billion.  In other words, the aggregate
miscalculation of revenue projections over the past three years
was $17 billion-or 11 percent of that period's aggregate budget
total.
<P>
Why were these forecasts so grossly inaccurate?  Because they
were based on false predictions of a statewide economic recovery.
<P>
It is worth emphasizing that the decline in state revenues is
not the result of low taxation.  Indeed, in 1991-92 California
experienced the biggest tax increase in its history.  Still revenues
fell.  As the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded, &quot;Most
of this weakness in the performance of state revenues can be attributed
to the weak performance of the state's economy.&quot;  It continued:
 
<P>
The state's revenue forecasting models, which are based primarily
on historical relationships between economic variables and tax
receipts, are currently subject to greater-than-normal error margins.
 In part, this reflects the fact that the state has no relevant
historical experience to guide it in forecasting revenues under
severe recessionary conditions.
<P>
We must conclude:  The urgent question for the Governor and the
Legislature is <I>not</I> how to increase taxes, but how to revive
the state's economy.  Unfortunately, despite a lot of rhetoric
about making California competitive again, little positive has
been done to revive the state's business climate.
<P>
Early this year, California's Department of Finance (DoF) forecast
modest economic gains following the third quarter of 1993 and
continuing through 1994.  But its recent survey of state revenue
figures revealed June 1993 sales tax revenues of $121 million,
7.3 percent below its own earlier projections.  Reporting general
fund revenues through June to be $65 million below its forecast,
DoF acknowledged:  &quot;California's recession entered its fourth
year in June, with few signs of any sustained turnaround....&quot;
 
<P>
Independent experts agree.  Consider a May 1993 study by Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric:  &quot;California shows very few signs of
immediate recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.&quot;
 According to PG&amp;E projections, state unemployment in 1994
will remain between 9.0 and 9.5 percent, or 2.0 to 2.5 percent
higher than the national unemployment level.
<P>
If such independent analyses are accurate, one can expect another
state budget shortfall in 1994, in addition to the $2.7 billion
deficit rolled over as part of the 1993 budget compromise.
<P>
Since the end of fiscal year 1989, the state has had to borrow
money-despite the existence on paper of positive budget balances-because
of a hidden cash-flow problem.  It is estimated that this cash
flow &quot;gap&quot; will total $1.7 billion at the end of 1993-94.
 More ominously, the state has been borrowing money against future
revenues.  By the end of 1993-94, it will be saddled with a $2-billion
liability that does not show up in the normal budget numbers.
<P>
Furthermore, even with the state's optimistic economic forecast,
the Legislative Analyst's Office projects a budget shortfall for
1994-95 of another $5 billion.
<P>
In brief, the underlying ills of California's economy, as outlined
in last year's Council on California Competitiveness report, have
yet to be addressed by state policymakers.  Overregulation, high
taxes, and a Byzantine legal system continue to drive jobs and
industry out of the state.
<H2>Spending Growth</H2>

<P>
At the same time economic stagnation reduces revenues, state spending
continues to rise.
<P>
It is often said that 85 to 90 percent of the budget is &quot;locked
in.&quot;  This means that most of the programs in the budget
(such as education and welfare) are automatically fully funded.
 Thus, for instance, under Proposition 98 spending formulas, K-12
education must not only receive a minimum 40 percent of the budget,
it also receives an inordinate share of extra revenues.  Because
such programs are run according to automatic spending formulas,
any increase in the number of program recipients requires the
state to spend more money, regardless of whether it has any money.
 That is, as the numbers of public school students, welfare recipients,
Medi-Cal recipients, etc. continue to increase, spending must
increase regardless of the state's funding resources.  Alarmingly,
these increases are projected to accelerate for the rest of the
decade.
<P>
In the aggregate, there are now six taxpayers for every five tax
recipients in California.  By 1995, it is estimated that the state
will have more tax recipients than taxpayers.  And by the year
2000, the imbalance will worsen to the point where there will
be only four taxpayers for every five tax recipients.
<P>
The consequences are clear:  &quot;After 1993-94, the shortfall
continues to widen because of the on-going disparity between baseline
spending growth and the rate of revenue growth.&quot;  In other
words, deficits will worsen.
<P>
Consider education:  The K-14 student population will increase
by 85,000 from 1993 to 1994.  This represents an added funding
responsibility of more than $300 million.  Longer term, student
population is projected to increase 40 percent (three times faster
than the working and taxpaying population) through 2000.  Even
assuming that state spending remains at $4,200 per student, this
would translate into an additional cost of $5.8 billion.  Nor
does this include the cost of building new schools to accomodate
the additional students, which could add another $1.1 billion
to the total.
<P>
The fact is, in California, education has become an entitlement
program.  According to Prop 98 funding formulas, today's $4,200-per-student
state spending rate has become an effective spending floor.  Although
Governor Wilson has thus far prevailed over the public school
establishment in interpreting Prop 98, state spending per student
has not declined.  Also under Prop 98, when economic conditions
force the state to limit increases in education spending, drastic
increases are required when the economy recovers-regardless of
whether the public and its representatives believe such increases
are warranted.  Such requirements have placed the budget on automatic
pilot, in effect guaranteeing increased spending and widening
deficits.
<P>
Or consider welfare:  In 1992-93, approximately 2.46 million Californians
were on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the state's
principal welfare program.  This will increase by 114,000 to 2.57
million in 1993-94.  By the year 2000, it will have increased
to almost 3 million.  Costs to the state's general fund would
rise from $2.9 billion this year to $4-4.5 billion in 2000.  According
to 1992 DoF estimates, in 1980 there were 6.9 taxpayers for each
AFDC recipient.  By 2000, this ratio will be 2.94-1.
<P>
Medi-Cal is another entitlement program that is headed toward
unprecedented caseload growth.  In 1993-94, Medi-Cal will cost
the state's general fund $5.5 billion, with 5.4 million people
qualifying.  By the end of the decade, the number of recipients
is projected to rise to 6.8 million, costing the state general
fund $12.3 billion.
<P>
Finally, conservative estimates are that 100,000 foreigners per
year enter California illegally to join the 1.3 million illegal
immigrants already here.  The State Auditor General estimates
the net cost of the services provided by state and local governments
to illegal aliens to be a whopping $3 billion a year.  Nor does
this take into account the infants born to illegal aliens in the
state, who are then classified as U.S. citizens.  In California's
public schools, 866,000 students (17 percent of the total public
school population) are the children of illegal and noncitizen
immigrants.  These students cost the state and local school districts
$3.6 billion a year.
<P>
Although it is difficult not to feel real sympathy for the hardships
that these people are forced to endure in their homelands, the
cold, hard fact is that the costs they impose on state taxpayers
are just as real and are growing exponentially.  With guaranteed
spending formulas in place for education and other social services,
illegal immigration threatens to break the bank.
<P>
These spending trends, added together with declining revenue trends,
indicate that fiscal chaos lies just around the corner.  In fact,
state finance experts have openly discussed the possibility of
a $20-billion state budget deficit by the year 2000.
<H2>Dead-end Reforms</H2>

<P>
California's recurring budget deficits have spawned a couple of
proposed solutions.  One is multi-year budgeting.  Instead of
trying to balance the budget every year, multi-year budgeting
allows for the deficit to be spread over a two-or-more-year period.
 This is the so-called &quot;rollover'' of the deficit that was
agreed to in the 1993 compromise.  
<P>
Unfortunately, multi-year budgeting fails to address the real
budget trends described above.  It does nothing to revive the
economy or increase revenues.  Nor does it reduce caseload growth
in entitlement programs or government spending in general.  Multi-year
budgeting is a stopgap measure that only delays the day of reckoning.
<P>
The second idea to solve the state's budget problems is reducing
the legislative vote requirement for budget approval from two-thirds
to a simple majority.  The argument here is that by allowing a
simple majority to approve a budget, the majority party in the
Legislature will have to shoulder full responsibility.
<P>
Although this proposal is theoretically appealing from a democratic
point of view, it has several problems.  First, from a practical
perspective, it would give the current big-spending liberal majority
carte blanche to exacerbate the budget problem beyond repair.
 Second, it does not address the so-called &quot;trailer bills&quot;
which set specific spending totals for state programs.  Unless
these latter (which currently require a two-thirds vote) are also
subject to majority approval, a majority vote on the budget resolution
would be useless.
<P>
Finally, as with rolling over the deficit, this reform does not
address the root problems:  declining revenues and rising expenditures.
<H2>Radical Reforms Needed</H2>

<P>
Is it possible to avert fiscal chaos in California?  Yes.  But
several painful and difficult steps must be taken.
<P>
What is required is nothing less than a radical overhaul of the
tax-spend-and-regulate status quo in Sacramento.  In brief, the
state's economy must be revived through tax cuts and a wholesale
rollback of regulations.  
<P>
On the spending front, Proposition 98 must be amended or suspended
and parents should be provided vouchers to send their children
to more cost-effective private schools.  Whole bureaucracies should
be eliminated, either through privatization or by recognizing
that they are not needed.  Welfare should be cut significantly.
 The state should eliminate all services to illegal aliens, even
if it means challenging the federal government and the courts.
<P>
These steps are painful and difficult indeed.  But only such a
radical prescription will steer us clear of economic chaos.

REGULATING THE AMERICAN DREAM:<BR>
THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA
<H1>Conference Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I>To examine and evaluate California's current housing crisis,
the Claremont Institute and the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) sponsored a conference on June
1-2, 1993 in Newport Beach, entitled &quot;Regulating the American
Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California.&quot;  This is a brief
report on its major speeches, discussions and conclusions.  </I>
<P>
California's population continues to grow as the construction
of reasonably priced housing units is sharply declining.  The
state's housing is among the least affordable in the nation. 
What accounts for this?  Some say &quot;too much growth.&quot;
 Others point to regulation of the home building industry.  On
June 1-2, leaders from state and local governments, the academy,
the building industry and environmental organizations gathered
in Newport Beach to address this disagreement on panels dealing
with growth and demographics, regulatory barriers, environmental
regulation, impact fees, the credit crunch, and growth management.
<P>
&quot;Regulating the American Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California&quot;
featured luncheon addresses by Thomas Sayles, Secretary of the
California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and Anthony
Downs of the Brookings Institution.  Secretary Sayles demonstrated
that housing regulation is responsible for preventing development
in the inner-cities.  Builders who might consider financing larger
and more affordable projects are being driven away by over-regulation
and the huge costs associated with the approval process.  Mr.
Downs seconded this argument, explaining how those most hurt by
regulations are often those whom the regulations are intended
to help.  
<P>
A discussion of the Endangered Species Act dominated the first
afternoon.  Douglas Wheeler, Secretary of the California Resources
Agency and one of the original architects of the legislation,
argued that the law's original intent was to protect endangered
species on public lands.  Gradually the law came to include private
lands as well.  Mr. Wheeler suggested that governmental &quot;takings&quot;
of private property be eliminated in favor of a program that purchased
private lands inhabited by endangered species.  Claremont Institute
President Larry Arnn warned that if there were insufficient funds
for such a program, development would likely be stopped.  Property
owners would then be forced to pay the entire cost of species
protection.
<P>
On the second morning, Richard Sybert, Director of the California
Office of Planning and Research, presented Governor Wilson's Strategic
Growth Plan.  He noted that the plan purposefully avoids the phrase
&quot;growth management&quot; in order to reflect the fact that
better planning and regulatory reform would result in job creation
and economic development.  The Governor's plan does not arbitrarily
limit growth, but would enable the state to adjust to inevitable
population increases.
<P>
Most attendees expressed caution regarding state involvement in
land-use issues.  While the state should advocate reform of local
regulations hindering housing development, it should not replace
local government as the authority on land-use decisions.
<P>
The conference concluded with a plenary session moderated by HCD
Director Timothy Coyle and Claremont Institute President Larry
Arnn.  Its overwhelming conclusion was that immediate action is
needed to reverse the troubling trend toward over-regulation.
 Six adverse polices that should be reformed and four positive
actions to be taken by state and local governments were identified:
<H2>ADVERSE POLICIES TO BE REFORMED</H2>

<P>
1. CEQA REVIEWS-Under the California Environmental Quality Act,
construction reviews are concluded when the project is in progress.
 Mandated changes customarily involve enormous expense that is
passed on to the consumer.  It would be more reasonable for these
reviews to be conducted in the planning stage.
<P>
2. IMPACT FEES-As things stand, impact fees can exceed $25,000
per housing unit.  In addition to decreasing the number of affordable
units, these fees place a heavy and inequitable burden for public
works and local government services on new home buyers-primarily
the young and the poor.  These fees should be reduced in number
as well as amount and brought into line with the cost of the actual
service provided.
<P>
3. UNCOMPENSATED TAKINGS-Through regulation, state and local governments
are unjustly reducing the worth of private property.  The state
should develop means to ensure enforcement of the takings clause
of the Fifth Amendment.
<P>
4. DOWNZONING-Zoning ordinances which limit the number of units
built on a piece of property force home builders to overbuild
the high-price end of the housing market.  Inevitably, when that
surplus is realized, crashing property values have a severe economic
impact.  Downzoning should be discontinued through the adoption
of minimum-density standards.
<P>
5. DELAYS AND FEE INCREASES-A largely unrecognized problem faced
by home builders is the length of time required to obtain the
necessary permits and approvals.  Time is money, and the new home
buyer or renter is the one who will end up paying for that time.
 In addition, regulatory changes are sometimes made and fees increased
in mid-project.  The  permit process should be streamlined and
fees should be guaranteed at the project inception.  
<P>
6. FEDERALIZATION-Broad national standards fitting a certain theoretical
model are increasingly applied without exception to the many,
diverse communities of the country.  At best these regulations
are unnecessary or irrelevant.  At worst they are contrary to
their intended purpose.  The principle of allowing local people
to decide local issues should be revived.
<H2>POSITIVE ACTIONS</H2>

<P>
1. FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION-The state should shift its priorities
to focus on housing production rather than regulation.
<P>
2. UNIVERSAL 8 UNITS/ACRE-The state should adopt the recommendation
of the HUD Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing
to allow up to 8 housing units per acre.
<P>
3. TIME LIMITS-The state should set strict limits on delays, guaranteeing
that unless permits are denied within a set period of time, development
may proceed as planned.
<P>
4. USE OF AVAILABLE FUNDS-State and local governments should use
existing funds to compensate for unjust takings.
<P>
California's population will continue to grow and the demand for
housing in the state will increase.  It is time to recognize that
life in California will be different than it was in the 1950s.
 This is not to say it will be bad.  Market forces should be given
latitude in helping California adjust to changing demographics
and economic forces.  We cannot afford to stifle opportunity.
 We must encourage the private initiative that has always made
California great.

Environmental Protection through Market Incentives:
A Strategy for the Future
</h1>

</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental Protection
Agency sponsored a major conference, entitled &quot;Environmental
Protection Through Market Incentives: A Strategy for the Future,&quot;
at the Los Angeles Biltmore on January 20-21, 1993.  This conference
addressed the promise of market-based solutions to environmental
problems, as opposed to the command-and-control strategies of
the past.  The following two essays are adapted from the luncheon
speeches delivered at the conference.</I>
<P>

<P>
<B>&quot;That We Should Fix The Roof While The Sun Is Shining&quot;</B>
<P>
James M. Strock, California Secretary for Environmental Protection
<P>
 There are just a couple of points I'd like to make.  The first
concerns where this market incentive issue fits into what Cal/EPA
is trying to do overall to meet the Governor's agenda.  The Governor
made it clear from Day One that a key goal of his in creating
Cal/EPA was to help reconcile environmental improvement and economic
activity and also to change the dialogue in this area.  Clearly
market incentives are key opportunities for us in these very difficult
times.
<P>
 There are three key priorities: (1) reform and simplification
of the permitting process, (2) taking advantage of environmental
technology, and (3) moving toward better market incentive policies.
<P>
 Today, government <I>truly is</I> looking at market incentives,
because it simply cannot meet all of the mandates, much less the
expectations now before it, through traditional means.  Public
support will not be there when you look at some of the implications
of continuing along the lines of the past.  That's not to discredit
the past; it is merely to keep growing and go beyond it.
<P>
 The areas of market incentives which we are focused on at this
conference over these are very important, and we hope to leave
here with one or two proposals that, working with key legislators
and with the Governor's leadership, we might be able to be put
into practice in the next few years.  That includes tradable permit
systems.  And I'd remind people that there is a real potential
for a national debate on this concept in conjunction with the
Clean Water Act reauthorization this coming year.  Also, we intend
to continue to help in the RECLAIM efforts, and to look at the
use of market incentives in transportation areas and in informational
areas like Prop 65 and the toxics release inventory.  Finally,
state procurement efforts are already occurring for alternative
fuel vehiclesthe &quot;Green Lights&quot; program and others.
<P>
 That being said, why is this so important?  Why does this matter
to us so much right now?
<P>
 First, I think it's because market incentive programs, if they
work, empower people.  They give people more choicesthat is, better
choicesin how to produce things and how to meet environmental
standards.  They also lead to better informed decisions by consumers,
as will occur when Prop 65 meets its purpose.  
<P>
 A second reason market incentives are desirable is that they
hold the promise of reducing the number of middlemen or middlewomen
in the process.  There are two types of these that are most important.
 One is government itself involved in permit decisions.  The other
is the myriad of lawyers and consultants who now have to get paid
several hundred dollars an hour to figure out how to do these
things.  We all know that this is not value-added activity.  Here
is a key area where we can make progress on transaction fees consistent
with the need to protect the environment.
<P>
 So what are the implications of market-incentive programs that
we have to think about as we move ahead, particularly if we want
to get public support?
<P>
 First, it is very important that the early efforts be made to
work and be seen to work.  That, of course, is a big issue with
the very strong leadership moves by the South Coast Air Quality
District on RECLAIM.  There are very tough questions with respect
to the inventories being considered, and the baseline numbers
that result, and the enforcement and monitoring that will result.
 But these are not reasons to give up.  They are reasons to press
on very hard.  
<P>
 Second, we need to look at integrated pollution control.  The
existing divisions between air and water and waste and pesticides
really only make sense because of the way these laws were created.
 If we were starting today, for either environmental or economic
reasons, we would not proceed based on these divisions.  The fact
is that if market incentive programs are done totally without
regard to the effect of, for instance, air programs on water programs,
or programs in one geographic area on another geographic area,
we will not be doing a service but merely recreating the kind
of trouble we have had in the past. 
<P>
 Finally, there are very tough distributional issues among businesses
and among people in general.  But again, we can make these things
work and make progress.  The key is to work together now and to
focus on this very directly within the next few months.
<P>
 We all know there is very strong public support-as there ought
to be-for environmental protection.  But it is important, given
the tremendous resources California is putting into environmental
protection, that we fix the roof while the sun is shining and
improve the system.  We're being driven toward it by competition
both here and, of course, abroad.
<P>
 When The Claremont Institute was putting together parts of this
conference, it turned out that some international journalists
were going to come and cover it.  This is because market incentive
programs are something their countries might adopt.  They don't
come and cover our decisions on permitting because they don't
want to adopt our permitting system.  That ought to tell us something.
 What we are doing today is going to be a very real economic and
environmental benefitif it's done right.  The choice lies with
people like those at this conference and their willingness to
work with leaders like the Governor who seek to move forward in
this area.
<P>
 Finally, a personal point.  David Sive, of the Environmental
Law Institute, has made the point that the whole first phase of
environmental protection in this country was unique in being a
social movement driven by law and lawyers.  And so it was.  And
what a remarkable achievement it was.  But I think the next phase
will not be so dominated by laws and lawyers.  Now there are tremendous
opportunities to bring together the environment and the economy,
including the people who are creative in business and the people
who work in science.  
<P>
 In the future, we should keep the benefits of a legal approach
while also being mindful of at least one negative: lawyers tend
to get paid to go through a big document or a big problem and
come back with a whole list of more problems.  That is very useful
in its place.  But we can't let this kind of attention to detail
limit the greater vision or opportunities we have.  And I hope
that with strong leadership we can get to the next phase and do
something quite productive.

<B>Market Incentives and Market Opportunities:</B>
<P>
<B>A Fresh Look at Environmental Regulation in California</B>
<P>
Julie Meier Wright, California Secretary for Trade and Commerce
<P>
 At the heart of the long-term solution needed to strengthen California's
economy is the need for dramatic changes in our current method
of environmental protection.  While we recognize the need to safeguard
our environment, there also exists an opportunity for California
to benefit from our expertise as innovators in a $200 billion
annual worldwide market for environmental technology.
<P>
 If it is true that past is prologue, then we should look at recent
events in planning for the future.  An underlying dynamic in the
collapse of Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the
dramatic changes in the nations of Eastern Europe was the utter
failure of the command-and-control economic system in those nations.
<P>
 A command-and-control system cannot compete with a free market
system.  The economies of Eastern Europe and Soviet Union collapsed
because of their inability to meet the fundamental needs of their
people.  The free market economies of the West and the Pacific
Rim won an economic victory over communism.
<P>
 There is a lesson for us here.  The same is true for a command-and-control
based method of environmental protection.  The Wilson Administration
is proposing to move to a market incentive based system of environmental
protection.  We believe such a move will make California's economy
more efficient and competitive, while simultaneously providing
us with a cleaner environment.
<P>
 This conference has included some fabulous presentations on the
specifics of establishing a market incentive based program of
environmental protection.  I want to touch upon the economic advantages
for California and the opportunities to create California jobs
in both market-incentive based environmental protection and cutting-edge
environmental technology.  I also want to provide a business perspective
on the ways in which Governor Wilson and his Administration are
working to streamline California's environmental regulations to
make our state more competitive and on some of the initiatives
we are supporting to nurture our state's environmental technology
industry.
<P>
 California is a major player in the global economy.  Were we
an independent nation, we would have the world's eighth largest
economy.  Trade plays a vital role in our state's economy.  Since
1990, California has suffered a loss of 800,000 jobs.  It would
have been far worse if not for our growing international trade.
 During this period, California exports grew by $4.7 billion,
creating nearly 50,000 new jobs.  These jobs are just the beginning.
 California is ideally situated to take advantage of the explosive
increase in global commerce.
<P>
 At the turn of the century, American diplomat John Hay said,
&quot;The Mediterranean is the ocean of the past, the Atlantic
is the ocean of the present, the Pacific is the ocean of the future.&quot;
 For California, Hay's prophecy is coming true.  Today eight of
our top ten trading partners are Pacific Rim nations.  The importance
of this is illustrated by the fact that U.S. trade with the Pacific
Rim is greater than our trade with Atlantic Basin nations.
<P>
 In addition to looking west to the Pacific Rim, we must look
south to Mexico and ultimately, I hope, to all of Central and
South America.  A study by KPMG Peat Marwick estimates that the
North American Free Trade Agreement will mean the creation of
3,800 jobs per year and an additional $2.3 billion annually for
our state's economy.  
<P>
 Clearly, trade and the global economy are vital to our state.
 When Governor Wilson named me Secretary of the newly-created
cabinet-level Trade and Commerce Agency, he gave me a mandate
to expand California's role in international trade.  He recognizes
the inexorable linkage between trade and job growth, and the absolute
necessity for California to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
 For California businesses to compete in this global marketplace,
they must be what I call &quot;competitive at the bottom line.&quot;
 They need a cooperative relationship with California's regulators
to replace the adversarial relationship that too often exists
today.  Let me stress that I'm not talking about reduced environmental
standards-California's strong health and safety standards are
vital to our quality of life.  They are part of the reason we've
been able to attract a high-quality workforce.  And, for the most
part, it's not the standards that create the Excedrin-sized headaches
for our state's business community.  The problem lies in the command-and-control
regulations with which businesses must comply.  Our environmental
standards should be descriptive, not prescriptive; results-based,
not rules-based.
<P>
 Californians are the most innovative people in the world.  What
we need are clear standards that allow businesses flexibility
to meet them in ways best suited to their businesses.  We should
set limits, not mandate how businesses reach those limits.  I
think we would be pleasantly surprised at the results.  This approach
offers two clear advantages.  First, it makes our businesses more
competitive.  Second, it enables us to deploy cutting-edge technology.
<P>
 What is the competitive issue?  Primarily that for business time
is money.  The game of regulatory roulette some of our businesses
find themselves playing can quickly turn into a game of Russian
roulette: you never know when you may find yourself looking down
the barrel at a job-killing regulatory delay.  Sadly, but understandably,
we in the Trade and Commerce Agency find that some businesses
refuse to play this game.  They find it safer to move their jobs
and capital to other states or nations.  Not so they don't have
to comply with high standards, but so that they can have confidence
that they can bring their investments on-line in a timely way.
 The result for California is lost jobs.
<P>
 For this reason, Governor Wilson asked Secretary Jim Strock of
Cal/EPA and me to work together to streamline our system of environmental
regulations.  This state permit reform effort has been an inclusive
one, and several state agencies are exploring the feasibility
of market-based incentives.  The market-incentive program that
has been undertaken by the South Coast AQMD evolved from such
a process.  We support this program and are convinced that it
will provide us with an important body of knowledge as we seek
to apply market-based incentives to other environmental regulatory
programs.
<P>
 The Governor's Council on California Competitiveness found that
72 different agencies-local, state and federal-have environmental
authority in Los Angeles County alone, with a typical business
requiring a dozen or so permits.  A new business might have successfully
filed 12 permits, and then have their opening delayed due to problems
with required permit number 13.  For large companies, this means
overhead in the form of experts to work a complex process.  For
a small company, this could mean an inability even to get off
the ground-at a time when new small companies are key to bringing
California out of the recession.
<P>
 At a meeting with Sacramento business leaders earlier this month,
one entrepreneur told Governor Wilson, &quot;I'd rather get a
'no' in two months than a 'yes' in two years.&quot;  I can tell
you that if all we can promise is two years, we won't even have
the chance to try.  And more California jobs will disappear.
<P>
 What are we doing about it?  We're pushing through permit streamlining
and one-stop permitting.  In addition, we're working with Cal/EPA
to assign an environmental compliance specialist to each of the
Trade and Commerce Agency's four regional offices, as front-line
business assistance.  The Red Team approach I brought to state
government works, but it's only a temporary solutionand it's not
a substitute for sound public policy reform that makes compatible
a clean environment and a strong economy.
<P>
 Eliminating the command-and-control approach also enables us
to bring cutting-edge environmental technology to the marketplace
far more quickly.  The very nature of a command-and-control system
of regulation means that environmental technologies are often
obsolete by the time they travel through the regulatory gauntlet.
 We will all benefitin high environmental standards and in developing
new marketsif we create a system that gets cutting-edge technology
into the marketplace as soon as possible.  We will enable businesses
to better meet their environmental obligations and to do so more
quickly and less expensively, and we will create California jobs.
<P>
 As you may have detected by now, the California endangered species
that concerns me most is the high-wage job.  Nothing has a greater
adverse effect on one's immediate environment than losing one's
job.  The beauty of the regulatory reforms we're discussing at
this conference is that they will positively affect both our physical
environment and our economic environment.
<P>
 In announcing the creation of the California Environmental Protection
Agency, Governor Wilson said: &quot;Environmental protection and
economic progress should not be viewed as competing goals but,
to the greatest possible extent, as complementary.  Where traditional
command-and-control regulation can be effectively supplemented
or supplanted by protective and legally enforceable market incentive
arrangements, we should do so.&quot;
<P>
 Just as a market-incentive based economy enabled us to win the
Cold War, so too will market-based environmental regulation enable
us to win the economic battles we are now fighting.  The command-and-control
economic system of the Soviet Union couldn't compete with free
market economies.  By taking the global lead in moving away from
a command-and-control regulatory system, we will have the competitive
advantage we need to successfully compete for jobs and industry.

<P>
 In addition to making our existing industries more competitive,
moving California into the forefront of new environmental technologies
helps us to grow an exciting new industry in which we already
have a strong foothold.  At present, there is a $200 billion annual
worldwide market for environmental technology.  California's share
is $25 billion.  When I look at a $25 billion industrial base
for California, I see a lot of jobs.  I also see opportunity for
even more growth.  Just by maintaining our market share, we would
see some growth due to an increasing demand for environmental
technologya demand that has the market growing at a sustained
7-8 percent per year.
<P>
 One of the things I learned in the private sector is that you
never stop marketing.  And you don't just maintain market share,
you gain share or you lose it.  
<P>
 There are some other reasons why the environmental technology
field is well-suited to providing the jobs our state needs.  Environmental
jobs are first and foremost technology jobs.  California is blessed
with a rich technology heritage and a technologically capable
workforce that is a national asset.  Many of these high-skilled
workers have been hurt by the defense budget cuts.  We have lost
more than 90,000 direct jobs, and their ripple effect on our overall
employment is 200,000 jobs-nearly 25 percent of our job loss since
the recession began.  For environmental technology business growth,
this shrinking defense base is a good source of skilled professionals-managerial,
engineering, and manufacturing.  A number of our aerospace companies
have already moved into the environmental control area by, in
some cases, adapting space technology and, in other cases, bringing
to the challenges of environmental cleanup their strong systems
engineering talents.
<P>
 Technology jobs demand a strong educational base, and our public
and private universities will continue to produce the scientists
and engineers needed to help us keep our technological edge. 
This is a high growth industry, just what we need to provide the
jobs for a rapidly growing population.  Today's $200 billion market
doesn't come close to providing the environmental protection and
mitigation our globe needs, and I believe that the steady growth
rate of the past few years will escalate as countries have the
opportunity to do it right the first time. 
<P>
 Earlier this century, California enjoyed tremendous spurts of
growth as we assumed world leadership in technology-intensive
industries such as aviation and electronics.  Today, there are
more than a million jobs associated with the high-technology industries
in our state.  When we are in a position to apply technology,
and when we create a regulatory environment that will let us retain
manufacturing jobs, we can create large numbers of jobs in California.
<P>
 Our high environmental standards have created a strong local
market for technology solutions.  Combined with our understanding
of world markets, this places us in a good position to compete
on a global basis.  There is a worldwide market for environmental
technology.  International trade is going to play a major role
in California's economic recovery, and this industry is becoming
one of our most important exports.
<P>
 These competitive advantages in and of themselves are not enough
for California's environmental technology industry to reach its
full potential.  Government has an important role to play.  After
all, government-mandated environmental standards created this
market for environmental technology.
<P>
 Governor Wilson identified environmental technology in his State
of the State address as a major area for economic growth and job
creation, and outlined a series of business incentives that will
spur the growth of this and other 21st century industries.  These
incentives will be particularly helpful to small businesses, start-up
businesses, and technology-based businessesthree categories into
which many of our environmental firms fall.
<P>
 These proposals include: (1) Increasing the research-and-development
tax credit from 8 percent to 12 percent, and doubling it to 24
percent for university-based research.  (2) Last year, Governor
Wilson signed legislation which makes it easier for small companies
to issue stock.  This year, he is calling for a small business
investment tax credit, one which encourages patient capital. 
The investment tax credit would be on a sliding scalefour percent
for investments held two years up to 16 percent for longer-term
investments.  (3) Restoring the Net Operating Loss carry forward
provision in 1993.
<P>
 The Governor has also asked his newly formed Council of Economic
Advisors headed by former Secretary of State and Secretary of
Treasury George Schultz to determine how a sales tax exemption
or investment tax credit on manufacturing equipment purchases
can be implemented in a way that will create the greatest number
of new jobs and the highest return to the General Fund.  At a
time of continuing budget crisis, the decision to call for these
tax incentives was not easily reached.  However, the Governor
believes the answer to California's economic ills is jobs-and
that incentives to create job growth are vital.
<P>
 Finally, to lead our state's efforts in marketing environmental
technology, the Governor created a blue-ribbon task forcethe California
Environmental Technology Partnership-composed of business leaders,
environmental groups and research institutions and the continuing
partnership of Cal/EPA and the Trade and Commerce Agency.
<P>
 Regulatory reform and business incentives require the support
of the Legislature, and they need to hear from you.  I hope each
of you will support our efforts towards market incentive-based
environmental regulation, towards regulatory reform and permit
streamlining, towards a government-industry-academic-environmental
partnership, and towards the implementation of the kind of business
incentives which will provide a dynamic boost to the environmental
technology industry and other emerging companies in our state.
<P>
 We also need your help in supporting real workers' compensation
reform.  Our best efforts at creating new industries will be for
naught if our scandalous workers' compensation system drives the
jobs out of state.
<P>
 This is an exciting time in California.  Today we have the opportunity
not just to move toward market-based incentives to allow California
companies predictability and creativity to respond, but we also
have the opportunity to take the fruits of that creativity and
market it around the world.  Then California's high standards
will have paid off in not only a cleaner environment, but in sustained
economic growtha real win-win situation for the Golden State.

<h1>How California Can Lead the Way<BR>
Against Illegal Immigration</h1>

</CENTER>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<hr>
<p>

In a 1992 Roper Poll, 86 percent of Americans
said that illegal immigration is an important issue.  Yet with
a few notable exceptions, our political leaders have been silent
on the issue.  Why?
<p>

Part of the reason lies in the reluctance of
many of our leaders to violate the taboos of &quot;political correctness.&quot; 
 According to the standards of this code, law and common sense
are no excuses for opposing the growing tide of Mexicans flooding
into California each day.  Thus Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and
others have found that standing against this tide invites charges
of racism in the liberal media.
<p>

In addition, state officials
often dismiss illegal immigration as a federal problem, saying
that there is little they can do about it.

<p>

In this paper, we will
show, first, that the problem of illegal immigration is so dramatic
that the &quot;politically correct&quot; position is economically,
not to mention constitutionally irresponsible.  Second, we will
show that while <I>border control</I> is a federal responsibility,
there is a whole range of actions that California can take on
its own, now, to discourage illegal immigration.

<h3>The Economic Cost of Illegal Immigration</h3>

When confronted with
the immense scale of illegal immigration, opponents of get-tough
policies often claim that it represents an economic boon; that
illegal immigrants work and pay taxes, and that their net impact
on America's economy is positive.  In fact, illegal immigration
places a massive financial burden on California's taxpayers. 

<p>

In a recent report, the State Auditor General's Office has calculated
the costs of illegal immigration on San Diego County alone.  While
acknowledging that illegal immigrants lower the cost of locally
produced goods and services because of the reduced wages they
receive, and contribute $60.5 million in taxes to state and county
government, the report makes it abundantly clear that these benefits
are offset by staggering costs.

<p>

For one thing, more than half of
illegal immigrants do not have taxes withheld from their wages,
and only 19 percent file income tax returns.  For another, illegal
immigrants enjoy many expensive taxpayer-supported government
benefits.

<p>

Consider education.  In San Diego County schools, there
are between 11,000 and 13,000 illegal immigrant children.  The
annual average cost of their education is $49.2 million.  Add
the costs of General Education Grants, Limited English Proficiency
Grants, and tax-subsidized higher education services, and the
total annual cost to county and state taxpayers for educating
illegal immigrants in San Diego County comes to $60.6 million.
 This alone offsets the aforementioned tax revenues.

<p>

Illegal immigrants also enjoy various health-care benefits, including indigent medical
care at specified clinics, maternal health care, Medi-Cal-provided
emergency and pregnancy services, and ambulance and paramedic
services.  The price tag for delivery of these health services
to illegal immigrants living in San Diego County is a hefty $26.6
million per year.

<p>

Social services, especially welfare, represent
a third significant cost.  There were nearly 4,000 cases of illegal-immigrant
use of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)the state's
main welfare programin San Diego County during the course of the
Auditor General's study.  The annual cost runs to $11.7 million.
 Furthermore,

<blockquote>

<P>
It is thought that certain undocumented immigrants gain entry
into the United States illegally <I>for the express purpose of
giving birth to a child on United States soil. </I> Once born
in the United States, the child becomes eligible for a variety
of programs as a United States citizen, including AFDC. . . . 
Technically, under AFDC, it is the United States citizen child
who receives the aid, but the <I>de facto</I> recipients may be
undocumented immigrant parents or family members in guardianship
of the child. 

</blockquote>

<p>
The final large-cost area is the criminal justice
system.  In San Diego County, an average of 16,000 felony and
misdemeanor cases involving illegal immigrants pass through this
system every year.  Add police costs, court costs, district attorney
and public defender costs, probation investigation costs, and
incarceration costs, and the annual price tag amounts to an astounding
$105.7 million.  Of course the larger social costs are inestimable.

<p>

If one adds up the costs of state and local government services to
illegal immigrants in San Diego County, and subtracts illegal
immigrant tax revenues, the annual net cost to taxpayers is a
whopping $145.9 million.

<p>

Again:  this is just San Diego County.
 In Los Angeles County, it is estimated that the net cost of providing
health, education, and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants
rose by almost $70 million (a 34-percent increase) over the past
two years, to a total of $276 million.

<p>

Consider too that California's
state prisons currently hold some 15,000 illegal immigrant convicted
felons.  The cost of feeding and housing them comes to $300 million
per year.  This figure will no doubt increase given the fact that,
according to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, nearly one-third
of the hoodlums who looted and pillaged Los Angeles in the May
1992 riots were illegal immigrants.

<p>

What, then, is the total annual
net cost to Californians of illegal immigration?  By the Auditor
General's conservative estimate, a breathtaking $3 billion.

<p>

Although he was criticized by the liberal media for his comments, the cold,
hard facts support Governor Wilson's observation that illegal
immigration is a significant cause of California's fiscal woes.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

Illegal immigration is not exclusively a federal
problem.  Indeed, the root of the problem in California lies in
the incentives to illegal immigration which exist in the state
and which can be largely eliminated at the state level.  Below
we list the most important areas in which incentives exist and
numerous specific reform measures which should be taken.

<H4>Government Benefits</H4>

<P>
<B>1.  Implement the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement
computerized data system (SAVE) in all state agencies that grant
benefits.  </B>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service maintains
SAVE, which lists all legal residents in the United States.  The
federal government now uses SAVE to prevent illegal immigrants
from obtaining welfare and other cash benefits to which they are
not entitled:  If a person's name does not show up on the computer
lists, he or she does not get the benefit.  At this time many
state agencies in charge of supplying benefits do not use SAVE.
 They should be required to do so by executive order and/or legislation
without delay.
<P>
<B>2.  Employ SAVE to screen public housing applicants.</B>
<p>
State
government funds public housing, both by operating public-housing
facilities and by making grants to builders and others for the
construction or rehabilitation of homes and rental units.  Unfortunatelylike
the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington,
D.C.the state does not screen public housing applicants to determine
their residency status.  The officials and agencies involved should
be required to do so.
<P>
<B>3.  Employ SAVE at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </B>
<p>
Obtaining
benefits often requires valid identification such as a driver's
license.  Procuring such identification is far too easy.  The
Department of Motor Vehicles, for instance, rarely asks about
residency status when issuing a driver's license.  It should be
required to verify such status before any license is issued.
<P>
<B>4.  Require information-sharing between state agencies and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</B>
<p>
As things stand,
there is precious little sharing of information among different
agencies at different levels of government.  Procedures should
be established to require state and county agencies to notify
each other and the INS when they have information that illegal
immigrants are applying for benefits.


<H2>Education</H2>

<P>
<B>1.  Restrict admission to state universities to citizens and
legal residents.  </B>
<p>
Currently, qualified applicants are being
turned away from the public universities of their choice because
of budget limitations and overcrowding.  Yet these tax-supported
schools admit illegal immigrants.  In the Auditor General's report
mentioned above, it is estimated that the cost to the California
taxpayer of illegal immigrant students just at San Diego State
University and California State University-San Marcos is $635,000.
 This situation is absurd.  It can and should be stopped.
<P>
<B>2.  Challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Pyler
v. Doe, requiring the states to provide public education at the
elementary and secondary levels to illegal immigrant children.</B>

<p>
In California's ongoing budget crisis, rising education costs
represent the biggest problem.  To a large extent, the bloated
education bureaucracy is at fault.  Still, the fact is that a
new school has to be built each day to meet demand.  In this light
it makes no sense that California taxpayers are forced to finance
the education of children who are in our country illegally.  
The Supreme Court decision behind this requirementone of the oddest
and potentially most destructive decisions in the history of the
Courtpassed a decade ago by a slim 5 to 4 vote.  There is now
new blood on the Supreme Court, and this issue screams to be revisited.
 California taxpayers, school districts, county governments and/or
the Attorney General should initiate legal actions to bring the
matter back before the courts.


<H2>Employment</H2>

<B>1.  Initiate a statewide policy to transfer jobs from illegal
immigrants to unemployed American citizens and legal residents
who are now receiving welfare.  </B>
<p>
Unemployment in California
is nearing 10 percent and welfare costs are skyrocketing.  Cooperative
efforts should be established between county welfare departments,
the State Employment Development Department, and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to ensure that when illegal immigrants
are apprehended and removed from worksites, legal workers (particularly
those on welfare) are referred to the employer to fill the vacancies.
 Incentives, such as reduced fines, can be given to cooperating
employers.  Such action on the part of the Governor and/or the
legislature will at once reduce welfare costs, unemployment, and
the blackmarket job pool which represents a significant incentive
for illegal immigration.
<P>

<B>2.  Require the California Employment Development Department
to employ SAVE to screen out illegal immigrant job applicants.
</B>

<p>
Currently, while applicants for unemployment insurance are
screened to ensure that they are citizens or legal residentsand
while federal law requires private employers to screen applicantsan
illegal immigrant can walk into a state EDD office and receive
job-placement assistance.  EDD should be directed by the Governor
and/or legislation to remedy the situation immediately with strict
screening procedures.
<P>

<B>3.  Require similar screening practices at city job centers.</B>

<p>

Many cities operate their own tax-funded job centers to assist
people in finding jobs.  Like EDD, many of these do not screen
their clients to determine if they are illegal immigrants.  The
legislature should act now to require them to do so.  

<P>

<B>4.  Increase penalties for employers who fail to withhold taxes
from illegal immigrant workers.  </B>

<p>

As noted above, over half
of those employing illegal immigrants in California do not withhold
taxes from their wages.  Penalties for this practice should be
increased and the back-taxes collected should be forfeited to
the state.

<H2>Criminal Justice</H2>

<P>

<B>1.  Deport illegal immigrants currently in our court system,
jails, and prisons.  </B>
<p>

Illegal immigrants often pass through
our court system without ever being identified as illegal.  In
Orange County, the Superior Court recently invited the Immigration
and Naturalization Service into the courtrooms to identify and
process illegal immigrant defendants.  This approach worked and
should be initiated statewide.  The initial costs will more than
be repaid in a short period through increased deportations.Likewise,
state and county governments should work with the federal government
to provide hearing space and staff to conduct deportation hearings
for all illegal immigrant convicts now in California jails or
prisons.  Upon the end of their terms, these convicts should be
immediately deported.   
<P>
<B>2.  Pass state legislation to override so-called &quot;sanctuary
laws.&quot;</B>
<p>
In a number of cities such as San Francisco, local
laws have been passed which forbid local police from cooperating
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  State legislation
should be passed to prohibit and override these laws.  Federal,
state, and local law enforcement must be allowed to cooperate
to uphold immigration law as they do other kinds of law.


<H3>Conclusion</h3>

Human beings respond to incentives.  Current policies
in California that make it easy for illegal immigrants to enjoy
government benefits, receive free or tax-subsidized education,
gain employment, and take advantage of our criminal justice system
serve as incentives to illegal immigration.  Change these policies
to remove these incentives and illegal immigration will decrease.
 It's that simple.California must not hesitate to make these changes.
 Illegal immigration is exacerbating the state's crime problem
and represents an increasing drain on its financial resources.
 What is more, despite the new euphemism for illegal immigrants-&quot;undocumented
immigrants&quot;-these people are in our country illegally.  We
are a nation where law is king, and to openly allow and even encourage
a class of people to exist above the law is to subvert one of
our dearest constitutional principles.  Illegal immigration at
its current high levels is an economic disaster in the making
and a national disgrace.  California should take the lead in acting
to stop it now.

<h3>California's Public Schools Are Miserably Mismanaged</h3>

</CENTER>

IntroductionOver the past several years, no issue in Sacramento
has generated as much heated rhetoric as education spending. 
K-12 education represents the largest chunk of the state's budget.
 This makes it one of the obvious places to look for ways to save
money, given the urgency of addressing the state's growing deficit.
 But as soon as anyone even ventures to take a peek, the education
establishment comes out swinging.In defending their turf, education
bureaucrats and union leaders have resorted not only to the emotional
appeals we have seen on television, but to pure and simple disinformation.
 Consider:  In recent testimony to the Little Hoover Commission,
State Superintendent of Education Bill Honig characterized the
administration of public education in California as &quot;lean
and mean.&quot;  Indeed, he said that California schools could
use $4 billion more than the record $27 billion now being spent.1But
far from being &quot;lean and mean,&quot; gross waste and mismanagement
are fast becoming inherent characteristics of California's education
system.  Last year's revelations about the Richmond Unified School
District were just the tip of the iceberg.2  In recent months,
three separate grand juries have issued scathing reports on the
management practices of California school districts.  These reports
have wide implications for our public education system as a whole,
in which nearly half of the 1,068 school districts ran deficits
in 1990.
<P>

The Sacramento County Grand Jury ReportThe Sacramento County
Grand Jury's investigation of the Grant Joint Union High School
District (GJUHSD)-the fourth such inquiry in ten years-found an
array of questionable fiscal and management practices.[The District's]
problems were manifested in an almost complete breakdown of community
support and confidence; in poor business practices, especially
the management and oversight of legal counsel and consultant service
contracts; in questionable personnel practices; in the deterioration
of employee morale; and in routine, but essential, business not
being completed in a timely manner or not being completed at all.3
Just how bad were Grant's business practices?  In a special audit,
it was discovered that the District lacked bids or quotes for
contracted services; did not keep requisitions or purchase orders;
paid for services before they were completed; and issued inadequate
policies regarding business operations.4 Furthermore, the grand
jury found that the District maintained a slew of legal counsel
contracts &quot;involving many hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;
Some had no backup documentation such as signed contracts or board
minutes.  Some involved retired former District employees, which
may have violated sections of the state education code.  Others
did not indicate the specific source of District funding for the
contract.5With regard to the legal counsel contracts in particular,
the grand jury noted that in the past decade &quot;the GJUHSD
has had at least seven legal firms representing it, some in duplicative
or redundant capacities.  An audit stated, '. . . the District
had extraordinarily high expenditures for legal services.'&quot;6
How high?  In one instance, the District paid $700,000 to a law
firm for 15 months of work.  A subsequent audit found that this
amount was probably double what the work was worth.7   In another
example, the District was billed $297,773 by a law firm whose
contract had been terminated.  After an investigation by another
law firm, the District settled the bill for $16,326.  Yet despite
this outrageous overcharge of $281,447, the law firm in question
was subsequently rehired to do more work for the District.8 Additionally,
it was found that the District has hired, fired, promoted, and
demoted personnel without following established procedures.  These
actions resulted in embarrassing financial consequences:

<P>

<i>In 1986, GJUHSD paid $300,000 for a wrongful dismissal.  Currently,
there are tens of millions of dollars of 'wrongful' dismissal
or demotion lawsuits filed against GJUHSD.9 In sum, while it is
true that people are hurting in the District, the cause of this
hurt lies not with stinginess on the part of the taxpayer.  Rather,
it has been directly caused by the immoral waste of untold millions
in tax monies.
</i>
<P>

The Santa Cruz County Grand Jury ReportDown in central California,
the Santa Cruz County Grand Jury has issued a report detailing
the troubles of the Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD).
 Although this District has complained that declining state aid
has forced it to lay off teachers, the report suggests other causes:
 sloppy and incomplete record-keeping, gross cost overruns, and
poor management decisions.10 Some of the grand jury's specific
findings were incredible.  For example, it discovered that although
the elected school board has ultimate authority over the budget,
many budget decisions were simply &quot;relegated to the Administration
and the unions&quot;-the groups most interested in increasing
the District's budget.11 The District budget frequently omitted
information such as the amount of money actually spent at a school
site or at District headquarters.  Indeed, the grand jury found
that it &quot;reflected the amount the Trustees believed was spent
the previous year and what they thought should be spent the next
year, with no basis in fact.&quot;12.

<P>
Still lacking is any substantive information about which departments
are exceeding their budgets and which are within their budgets.
 Without detailed budget information, the Board of Trustees will
continue to be unable to control costs or make realistic reductions
in its budget as required by the State Education Code.13In other
words, teacher layoffs would likely have been unnecessary if the
District had been administratively prepared and willing to adopt
a rational plan to reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenditures.Where
might the PVUSD have looked to make some cuts?  For starters:

<P>
The Administration claims its costs have been cut by 400 percent
over the past two years.  Yet expenditures for the Superintendent's
and Business Services' budgets have far exceeded the amount budgeted.
 Actual cuts are not as great as they appear to be on paper. 
While the District office is exceeding its budget, many school
sites have been prudent with their money and actually spent less
than their budget.14Also, the grand jury found several large transfers
of funds between budget accounts, raising the question of &quot;whether
the funds are being appropriately spent for educational purposes.&quot;15
 This suggests that the instincts of the average citizen have
been right all along.  Bureaucratic fat at the district level
comes at the direct expense of the classroom.  The PVUSD also
wasted tens of thousands of dollars on its employee benefit package.
 Instead of joining a less costly plan with other county school
districts, it operated a self-insurance fund which covered medical,
dental, and vision benefits for employees and dependents.  And
the school board abdicated its oversight responsibility:
<P>

Until recently, the Trustees had no control over this fund.  It
was administered solely by the Business Services Director and
a group of union members who decided what benefits would be covered
and how much money would be set aside by the District to cover
claims.16Poor office management was another serious problem. 
Because the District consistently failed to complete its fiscal
paperwork on time, it was often late in receiving state education
reimbursements.  This caused cash-flow problems every June, forcing
the District to take out short-term bank loans to meet its payroll.
 These loans &quot;cost the District tens of thousands of dollars
in interest.&quot;17 Additionally, state and federal funds earmarked
for migrant and low-income students went unaudited, in violation
of requirements.  Questionable expenditures resulted.18  The grand
jury report concludes that &quot;an educational institution should
not operate in this manner.&quot;19   It is painfully obvious
that the PVUSD has been cheating the children in its charge, all
the while whining about the parsimony of the California taxpayer.

<P>

The San Diego County Grand Jury ReportFinally, in Southern
California, the San Diego County Grand Jury has just issued explosive
findings on the San Ysidro School District (SYSD).  For example,
like Grant, San Ysidro &quot;has paid out at least $1 million
in judgments and legal fees arising from the ill-conceived and
often illegal personnel actions of the Trustees.&quot;20More tax
dollars were wasted in the District's bilingual education program:

<P>
The Board has failed to direct or support proper use of funds
provided for bilingual education.  In several instances, students
were placed in the Bilingual Program or English-Only Program,
based on space availability, with no regard for parental request
or children's needs.21Worse was the grand jury's finding that
the program's goal-the assimilation of non-English-speaking children
into the schools and into American society in generalis being
ignored in the interest of a politically correct segregation:
 &quot;Currently, proficiency in Spanish with the preservation
of Mexican culture, at the expense of English learning, is the
governing philosophy [of the District].&quot;22Under this philosophy,
the prospect of English proficiency becomes a very dim possibility:

<P>
The almost universally Hispanic ethnicity of the student population
makes the English language transition a most difficult objective
for the school system.  The opposition of the majority of the
Trustees to this objective virtually guarantees its failure.23
It should come as no surprise that the test scores of San Ysidro
students are the lowest in all of California and that &quot;the
net result has been and continues to be children unable to communicate.&quot;24Nor
does the District brook dissent: 

<P>
Non-conformists are demoted, fired, or otherwise eliminated from
the system.  With very few exceptions, non-Spanish speakers are
purged from the system, regardless of qualifications or performance.
 So are those bilingual teachers who consider English proficiency
a matter of urgency.25 The response of SYSD's elected trustees
has been anything but forthcoming.  For instance, in the face
of evidence that one trustee's son was promoted from vice principal
to principal in violation of established selection procedures,
another trustee responded:  &quot;Favoritism, yes; nepotism, no.&quot;26
It is little wonder that Richard B. Macfie, foreman of the San
Diego County Grand Jury, concluded that:

<P>
At the current pace of irresponsible leadership, the San Ysidro
School District will soon be bankrupt financially.  Educational
bankruptcy appears already to have been achieved.27

<H3>Conclusion &quot;Lean and Mean&quot;?</h3>

These recent grand jury
reports supply further proof that although California is spending
more than ever on education, much of that money continues to be
wasted on special-interest programs or squandered through poor
decision-making.28 Governor Wilson's recent decision to put the
brakes on the spiraling education budget by limiting spending
to the minimum amount allowed under Prop 98 is a recognition that
fiscal discipline-not more tax money-is the critical first step
to fixing our education system.  In the long run, however, true
reform will require implementing school choice of the sort being
promoted by the Bush administration, restoring parental control
and injecting competition into the current centralized, monopolistic
education market.

<H1>The Deeper Lesson of California’s Budget Crisis</H1>

</center>

<I>

California faces an unprecedented fiscal crisis:  The 1991-92 state budget finds itself 
with a shortfall of at least $14.3 billion, out of a total budget of about $55 billion.  And 
the gap between reality and what is being said about this crisis is huge.
<P>

<LI>The state is said to face a Hobson’s choice between spending cuts and tax increases.  
Even the Governor has proposed some $6.6 billion of the latter.  But we must resist the 
steady drumbeat of pressure for higher taxes, understanding that the working people of 
our state are already overtaxed, and that justice requires that they retain as much as 
possible of what they earn.  
<P>

<LI>There is an urgent requirement to stop the incredible waste of the taxpayer’s dollar in 
California.  The Governor and his Working Group have come up with ideas that 
represent a good beginning.  The Little Hoover Commission and various private-sector 
groups have proposed others.  No stone should be left unturned.
<P>

<LI>The deeper lesson to be drawn from this crisis is that there is a systemic problem with 
our state’s budgeting process.  In short, centralized administration and the 
increasingly common practice of “earmarking” portions of the budget have rendered 
California’s government essentially unaccountable, not only to the people, but even to 
their elected officials.  
<P>

<LI>In addition to the spending cuts proposed by Governor Wilson and others, then, 
dramatic reform of the budgeting process is necessary, if future such crises are to be 
averted.   

</ul></i>

<P>

It is amazing that California is confronting a $14.3-billion budget deficit, even allowing 
for the severity of the recession.  One way of gaining perspective on the situation is to recall the 
words of Governor Ronald Reagan in 1973:  “Unless something is done to curb the government’s 
unlimited power to tax, this year’s $9.3—billion budget will grow to a staggering $47 billion by 
1989.”  California’s 1989 budget, of course, came in at more than $50 billion, with subsequent 
budgets jumping quickly to the $55-billion neighborhood.
<P>

What makes this amazing in light of Governor Reagan’s prophecy is that Californians did 
do something about the government’s power to tax:  they passed Proposition 13 (with its two-
thirds vote requirement for tax increases and a property tax limit) and the Gann spending limit.  
Of course, supporters of taxes say that this is precisely why we face such a massive shortfall:  
that we are undertaxed.  Yet inflation-adjusted government spending per capita still increased 
dramatically during the 1980s.  And tax revenues as a proportion of personal income have 
increased from 4.8 percent in 1962 to about 8.5 percent today.  
<P>

The early 1960s, we might recall, was the heyday of Governor Pat Brown’s great building 
programs, with huge investments in schools, state colleges, highways, and the state water 
project—the very sorts of public works that our government today is unable to deliver.  
Ironically, Pat Brown, the bete noir of fiscal conservatives in the 1960s, could be held up today 
as a model of fiscal responsibility.
<P>

This is all to suggest that previous attempts at tax-and-spending limitations have not been 
sufficient to control big government, or that they have not reached the heart of the matter of 
public spending.  The real lesson of the budget crisis is that the state’s bureaucracy, in tandem 
with powerful narrow interests, has been able to subvert the budget process to break the bonds of publicly mandated limitations on the size and scope of government.
<P>

There are three key factors at work:  Increased social-spending mandates, budgetary 
“earmarking,” and centralized administration. 


<H3>Shifting Budget Priorities and “Earmarking” </H3>

In California over the last 15 years, relative spending has shifted away from those basic 
public works necessary to accommodate population growth, e.g., transportation, and toward such rapidly increasing-cost items as health, education, and welfare (see Chart A).  In other words, the ordinary taxpayer is getting less and less for his or her money.  

<P>
Additionally, over 90 percent of state spending is “earmarked” by prior statute, judicial 
decree, or federal mandate, and rises inexorably without either legislative deliberation or rational relation to revenue growth.  Only about 8 percent of state spending is discretionary; that is, only about 8 percent is controlled by the governor and the legislature (see Chart B).  
<P>

<! -- whereis chart B?>

Source:  State Controller’s Annual Reports

<! -- whereis Chart A?>
<P>

If 8 percent is all there is to fight over, the people of California might very well wonder 
why they even bother to elect representatives. 
<P>

An important complement to earmarking is a procedure known as “workload budgeting” 
or “current services budgeting.”  Automatically each year, the costs of each program are notched upward; if the governor or the legislature reduces the automatic increase, the program is said to have been “cut,” even though absolute outlays will still be rising.  This effect is especially pronounced in social spending programs.  
<P>

The structural problem with the budget arises from the following facts:  While the 
average annual growth rate of personal income in California for the last decade has hovered 
around 8 percent per year and tax revenues have been growing at about 7 percent, spending has been growing at approximately 11 percent; and this year and next it is moving even beyond that, to about 13 percent.  If nothing is done, this trend will require endless tax increases until, in the fullness of time, the state of California would come to consume the entire income of its citizens.
<P>

The budgeting phenomena of “earmarking” and “workload budgeting” really mean that 
when it comes to budgeting—the bread-and-butter function of the legislative and executive branches—our representatives have abdicated or let slip away their responsibilities.  Missing from the current budget debate is the recognition of the extent to which government spending has ceased to be in the control of elected officials.  This is why the spending reforms proposed by Governor Wilson and others, by themselves, will not solve the problem.  

<H3>Centralized Administration</H3>

There is a third factor to be taken into account.  A broad review of the character of public 
spending and administration in California over the last two decades reveals that both have 
become increasingly centralized.  One good way to see this is to look at the shift in the relative 
share of the public dollar between state and county governments (see Chart C).  This 
centralization was accelerated by the passage of Proposition 13 and can be considered the major unintended consequence of that landmark event of the tax revolt.  
<P>

Indeed, the administration of all public spending has been centralized.  For instance, a 
special feature of Proposition 111, the gas tax increase of 1990, was a requirement that local 
jurisdictions have a state—approved transportation management plan before their local share of 
gas tax revenue could be distributed.  In hundreds of ways like this, the administrative apparatus 
of state government subjugates local governments.

<! -- whereis Chart C?>

<H3>The Systemic Problem</H3>

There are three key observations to make about this state of affairs.  
<P>

First and most obviously, “earmarking” precludes deliberation by public representatives 
and diffuses the responsibility and accountability of the legislature.  The public cannot put its 
finger on who is responsible for the character of public spending.  It is difficult to hold legislators 
accountable at election time for voting to appropriate funds, when the appropriation is done 
automatically as a part of a formula.
<P>

Second, “earmarking” enables special interests to organize more easily and effectively at 
the public expense.  Witness the political campaign currently being waged by the California 
Teachers Association on behalf of Proposition 98.  It is no exaggeration to say that earmarking 
has the low character of a raid on the public treasury by special, narrowly self-interested 
constituencies.
<P>

Third, in the end, the real needs of the taxpayer—for roads, schools, and other public 
works—get slighted, probably deliberately so.  
<P>

Why deliberately?  Think of it as a variation of the infamous strategy whereby the U.S. 
Department of the Interior responds to any proposed budget reduction by saying it will have to 
close down the Washington Monument.  Thus California working people, who as things stand 
pay a lot of money in taxes, are told that if they want roads, or schools, or prisons, or sewers, 
they will have to:  pay more taxes.  This is the Prop 111 gas-tax solution, the Prop 99 tobacco-tax 
solution, etc.  It becomes progressively nearer to impossible in such a regime to impose any 
discipline on public spending.  Those things which used to be the first priority of government are 
now, de facto, the last.  And no one, not even our representatives, seem to think they can do 
anything about it.

<P>

The interests of the administrative apparatus of government and of elected officials are 
increasingly connected to the interests of certain groups who might well be regarded as 
government clients:  public employee unions, regulatory bureaucracies, the business community 
(who are also invited to relate to government in the manner of supplicants), organized advocacy 
groups, and direct recipients of public aid.  Over time these combine to create the conditions 
whereby the taxpayers are forced to say “uncle” to new taxes, and the stage is set for a new wave of government growth.  Even fiscally conservative legislators, responding to the powerful 
incentives that now operate, have said that opposing any tax increase will mean that their districts will lose out when the budget pie is divided up.

<H3>Reform</H3>

These fundamental trends need to be understood before the budget can be sorted out in 
the long term.  And what will that require?  

<P>
n analysis of all 50 state budgets by former OMB Director James Miller and George 
Mason University economist Mark Crain found that spending in states that practice “earmarking” 
grew about 1.2 percent a year faster than in states whose entire budgets were subject to regular 
deliberation and appropriation. They also found that spending grew faster in states with single, 
unified, and thus very detailed budget bills, as compared to states which have separate, simple 
budget bills for each major component of government.  Here are two major reforms that should 
be considered. 
 
<P>
Above all, deliberation and accountability must be restored to the process.

<P>
In conclusion, tax-and-spending limitations are insufficient to solve California’s budget 
crisis.  What is required is control of the administrative apparatus, which can come about only 
through a coherent and forceful executive and legislative agenda.

<B>NOTE:  President Jimmy Carter was scoffed at when he proposed to institute “zero-based budgeting”— the spending needs for each program and department of the government evaluating from scratch every year—at the federal level.  Today in California, in the aftermath of “earmarking” Propositions 98, 99, 111, and the lottery, the idea of the legislature deliberating about the relative merits of various kinds of spending programs seems quaint, if not medieval.</B>

<H1>California Workfare Reform and Decentralization</H1>

</center>

<hr size=4>
<P>

Traveling in the United States in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville was 
struck that, unlike our European cousins with their aristocratic airs, Americans 
found no dishonor in work.  On the contrary, work in the United States was 
“regarded as positively honorable.”  This attitude toward work was a major 
ingredient in Americans’ renowned independent character and a great boon to 
democracy (since democracy requires an independent people).

<P>
A century and a half later, Americans still regard almost any kind of honest 
work as honorable, to be sure.  What has diminished, perhaps, especially in the 
aftermath of the Great Society welfare state, is the dishonor or shame that we once 
associated with not working.  That is, in the decades after 1965, refusing to take a 
difficult or low-paying job in order to support oneself or one’s family became 
increasingly acceptable and in some cases even profitable.
<P>

The ease with which the welfare system could be abused, the slothful (and 
sometimes criminal) behavior it encouraged in some who grew utterly dependent 
upon it, and its burgeoning cost to the private sector, especially during the 
inflationary late 1970s, led to frequent calls for welfare reform.  And in the next 
decade, one of the ideas most often discussed was “workfare,” mandatory work 
programs for recipients of welfare payments.
<P>

The idea behind workfare has deep historical roots in our country.  Long 
before America became centrally bureaucratized, the poor were routinely and 
adequately cared for by local governments and religious charities.  But except for 
the aged or infirm, those supported were required to perform useful labor, often in 
government-run factories, until they could find work on their own.  A free ride was 
definitely not part of the bargain.
<P>

Under Governor Deukmejian, California became one of the first states to 
institute workfare during the 1980s.  But from the start, California’s workfare 
program—called Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN)—has been beset with 
problems of its own, leading the Governor to call recently for its reform.
<P>

GAIN was intended to achieve a noble goal:  to wean the poor (many of 
whom were now being spoken as members of a “permanent underclass”) from the 
public dole and to prepare them for better-paying, private-sector jobs.  But GAIN’s 
track record since 1986 is unimpressive.  Over $850 million has been spent on, or 
committed to, the program, and California’s welfare caseload continues to grow—
and to grow even faster than the state’s steadily growing population.
<P>

GAIN’s problems stem, in part, from the many exceptions and loopholes 
allowing welfare recipients to get around its work requirement.  For instance, one 
provision which was added at the time of its passage provided that the requirement 
be waived if the man or woman on welfare required further education.  The stated 
purpose of this exception was that welfare recipients who needed minimal 
training—such as a high school equivalency degree or improvement in English 
language skills—would receive it before finding a job.  But instead, the provision 
has been interpreted broadly, allowing people to avoid work as long as they stay in 
school—through college and into graduate school if they wish—all the while 
receiving welfare payments.
<P>

Of course any and all attempts to close such loopholes and eliminate 
exceptions to workfare requirements are to be applauded.  But we should not be 
sanguine about the likelihood that such simple reform will fix the welfare system.  
GAIN is itself, after all—like its predecessor—a state program, directed by 
bureaucrats in Sacramento.  For one thing, the prevents the administration of 
welfare on a case-by-case basis; welfare policy in Temecula is the same as that in 
San Francisco, although the problems (and requisite solutions) may be altogether 
different.  For another, it means that the people in charge are not directly 
responsible to the tax-paying public for the program’s success or failure.
<P>

In the 1830s, Tocqueville marveled at how most problems in America were 
handled at the local level.  (This was anything but true in Tocqueville’s native 
France, where he reported that people looked immediately to Paris for help at the 
slightest sign of trouble.)  This was notable not only for its value in maintaining our 
independent, democratic spirit, but also for the fact the it worked so well.  
Especially in the 1960s, many Americans seem to have forgotten the simple truth 
(ask almost any Eastern European) that administration of policies by a distant 
bureaucracy is expensive and clumsy and inefficient, not to mention unaccountable.  
We have largely forgotten, that is, the old Yankee adage about having to do 
something yourself if you want it done right.
<P>

This is to suggest that until we decentralize the administration of social 
welfare programs, until we return the power to administer welfare to localities 
where it was and worked effectively for most of our nation’s history, even the best-
intentioned programs like GAIN will not likely be effective in actually reducing the 
number of people on welfare.

<H1>Why Not Criminalize Semi-Autos?</H1>
</center>

<hr size=4>

<P>

In The Federalist #46, Madison wrote that “the advantage of being armed, which the 
Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation” provides them with an 
almost “insurmountable” barrier to tyranny.  He knew, as did Americans generally, that 
potential tyrants would endeavor to disarm the citizenry—under the guise of providing 
public safety—as a first step to undermining democratic forms.  Indeed, Madison’s fellow 
Virginian George Mason declared that “to disarm the people . . . [is] the best and most 
effectual way to enslave them.”  Mason, although an active participant in the 
Constitutional Convention and a supporter of a strong national government, refused to 
endorse ratification of the Constitution because the Convention had failed to include in it 
a bill of rights.  Richard Henry Lee, author of the widely published “Letters of a Federal 
Farmer,” resolutely  declared that “to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body 
of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use 
them.”  Lee, too, opposed ratification because the Constitution lacked a bill of rights.  
Madison, although initially opposed to this idea, became the chief architect of the Bill of 
Rights in the first Congress.  He did so, he said, in order to “render [the Constitution] as 
acceptable to the whole people of the United States, as it has been found acceptable to a 
majority of them.”  And second only to the amendment guaranteeing the freedoms of 
religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition stood the following:  “A well regulated 
Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and 
bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

<P>

Today, California and the nation are witnessing a vigorous assault upon the Second 
Amendment in the form of regulations and legislation aimed at the importation, 
manufacture, and ownership of semi-automatic weapons.  Proponents, adapting many of 
the arguments used in the past for restricting handguns, tell us that the Second 
Amendment only protects the rights of organized militias to keep and bear arms, that 
individuals are accorded no such protection since the Second Amendment refers only to 
the people collectively.

<P>

But this all-too-common interpretation is directly at odds with federal law.  The 
United States Code [10 U.S.C. 311(a)] states that “[the] militia of the United States 
consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and. . . under 45 years of age.”

<P>

Moreover, such an interpretation of the Second Amendment stands in contradiction to 
the well-defined structure of the Bill of Rights as a whole.  It is beyond cavil that the 
rights adumbrated therein are individual rights.  When the First Amendment speaks of 
“the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances,” it obviously does not contemplate the assemblage of the whole of 
the American people; nor any ban on petition by individual citizens.  Similarly, when the 
Fourth Amendment guarantees the “right of the people” against “unreasonable searches 
and seizures,” it makes that guarantee to individuals, not to the whole body of the people.  
There is no textual evidence whatsoever to indicate that the Second Amendment, unlike 
the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, does not accord protection to individuals.  
The burden of proof rests with those who argue this to show why it is an exception.

<P>

A commonsensical reading of the Second Amendment is readily available:  “Since 
militias are necessary to the security of a free state, the people must therefore have the 
right to keep and bear arms.”  It is almost too obvious to point out that militias are 
comprised of individual citizens, and part of being a citizen of a free state is service in the 
militia.  Militias exist so that the people by dint of their own efforts can ensure their 
liberty; militias do not exist in order to secure the freedom of militias.

<P>

But today, so goes the response, public safety requires that the individual’s right to 
possess arms be curtailed.  But regulation and legislation to this end will create only the 
illusion of safety, since the net effect will be the disarming of law-abiding citizens and the 
granting of a monopoly of arms (or of certain kinds of arms) to criminals, police, and the 
military.

<P>

Legislators have learned in recent years that it is much easier to enforce the law upon 
the law-abiding than to enforce it upon criminals.  The Constitution, as misinterpreted 
and misapplied by judges and prosecutors, is too often used as a barrier to effective law 
enforcement.  The case of Stockton killer Patrick Purdy is illustrative.  He had previously 
been arrested for robbery, selling dangerous weapons in violation of federal law, 
receiving stolen property, drug possession, and sex crimes.  In each case, felony charges 
were plea-bargained to misdemeanor offenses.  Had existing laws been enforced, Purdy 
would still be in prison.  Plea-bargaining—a practice disdained by most Western 
nations—has become all too common in the criminal justice system.
<P>

A ban on semi-automatic weapons will do nothing to stop criminals; it will only make 
it easier for them to prey upon the law-abiding.  Most drug dealers do not use semi-
automatic weapons in any case; they prefer fully automatic firearms, the unlicensed 
possession of which is already a felony under both California and federal law.  At a time, 
then, when the police are either unwilling or unable to enforce the law— as appears to be 
the case in Washington, D.C., and other large cities—and when individual citizens 
become almost wholly responsible for defending themselves and their families and 
property—which is especially true of those forced to live in the inner-city—it is 
politically, indeed morally irresponsible to impose gun control policies of any stripe.
<P>

Battles over what has been called “gun control” are certainly nothing new.  The 
battles of the past, however, generally focused on one particular type of handgun or 
handgun ammunition.  The campaigns to ban “Saturday Night Specials,” “cop-killer 
bullets,” and “plastic guns” were each the subject of prolonged debate and media 
attention.  But most of the debate was desultory at best, since the definition of “Saturday 
Night Special” was more than a little nebulous; “cop-killer bullets” proved to have no 
greater powers than ordinary ones; and “plastic guns” turned out to be built mostly of 
steel.
<P>

The debate now raging here in California and elsewhere, however, aims squarely at 
the semi-automatic rifle.  As almost everyone by now knows, the rifles in question 
require no manual reloading after a shot, but chamber a new round automatically, and can 
thus be fired rapidly.  In most cases, they employ technology that has existed since the 
turn of the century.  Some, but by no means all, resemble or are related to the fully- 
automatic rifles used by most nations’ military forces.  
<P>

But misperceptions persist about these rifles, and those who oppose private ownership 
of firearms have been quick to note, and capitalize on, these misperceptions.  One 
prominent gun control organization informs its supporters that,
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The weapons’ menacing looks, coupled with the public’s 
confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-
automatic assault weapons—anything that looks like a machine 
gun is assumed to be a machine gun—can only increase that 
chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

Furthering confusion, the major print media, having prejudiced the argument from the 
start by attaching the label “assault weapon” to semi-autos, have prefaced editorials with 
pat phrases that are now familiar to all:  “no legitimate purpose,” “designed only to kill 
people,” etc.—epithets, interestingly enough, that were applied to handguns only a few 
years ago.  Likewise, television has offered nothing of educational substance about what 
these arms are or do, giving air time instead to footage of the effects of semi-auto rifle 
fire on melons or concrete blocks.  (Countless non-semi-automatic firearms are capable of 
splitting concrete blocks.  So what do these pictures mean?)  Often, too, to T.V. clips 
show fully—automatic weapons being fired, thus taking advantage of the aforementioned 
confusion over the difference between semi-automatic rifles and fully—automatic assault 
weapons.  These apparently had their effect on California Attorney General John Van de 
Kamp, who boasted to the California Assembly that he could mow them all down with a 
semi-automatic AK-47 in the space of two minutes.
<P>

Most of those appearing to defend semi-autos, on the other hand, whether on 
television or in print, have found themselves at a loss to provide any argument that would 
justify private possession.  To their discredit, they have failed to move beyond describing 
the pleasure they take in hunting, shooting cans and bottles, or the importance they place 
on having certain semi-autos in private collections—in other words, arguments that 
simply rest on the private right to have fun.  The argument for the role of gun ownership 
to civic responsibility has been completely neglected in those upon whom the defense has 
fallen.  Clearly, if this is the best the defenders of self-loading rifles can do, the strength 
of their opponents in the public forum is hardly surprising.
<P>

The passion of this most recent gun control debate, and the failure of either side to 
give reasoned argument, is especially unfortunate.  For unlike the handgun debates of 
years past, the present case points forcefully to the very serious purpose that informs the 
Second Amendment:  While hand guns have a proper role in the defense of one’s person, 
home, property, and family, their limited range and power make them of little use in 
protecting “the security of a free State.”
<P>

Let us be candid.  In The Federalist 57, James Madison praised the “vigilant and 
manly spirit which actuates the people of America—a spirit which nourishes freedom and 
in return is nourished by it.”  This reminds us that, in accordance with our founding 
principles in the stirring opening passages of the Declaration of Independence, we reserve 
the right to revolution in perpetuity.  But if the American people reserve this right, then 
surely they reserve as well the right to revolution’s means.  And these means must be 
adequate to the times.  Does the Second Amendment, in this age of superior weapons 
technology, mean that the people have only the right to possess muskets?  Despots and 
potential despots, of course, would argue so.  A free people will not be deluded.
<P>

Two events within recent memory are instructive.  Afghanistan may yet become a 
free country.  The Afghan people are a freedom-loving people with a fierce desire to 
determine their own political fate.  They are also a people who have made guns an 
important part of their national existence.  They have proven to the world that the 
possession of weapons of self-defense invokes the spirit of freedom in a people because it 
imparts the sure knowledge that their liberty is a product of their own efforts and 
sacrifice.  With their skill in firearms the Afghans were able to withstand, and in some 
measure even humiliate, the greatest force for despotism in the modern world.  They 
began their resistance with World War I vintage Lee Enfields; when their determination 
attracted the attention of the free world, their arsenal was supplemented by more 
sophisticated weapons, most notably the Stinger Missile.  But it was their expertise with 
individual weapons, primarily semi-automatic and automatic rifles, that won the day.  
<P>

In contrast, the people of Cambodia had no such tradition of gun ownership or use.  
They became easy prey for the well-armed and brutal Khmer Rouge.
<P>

Like the Afghans and the Swiss—all male citizens of Switzerland are required by law 
to maintain and to be proficient at using semi-autos—Americans have a tradition of 
respect for guns.  Thomas Jefferson demonstrated that he understood the relationship 
between self-reliance, liberty, and guns in a letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr:
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>A strong body makes the mind strong.  As to the species of 
exercises, I advise the gun.  While this gives a moderate exercise 
to the Body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to 
the mind. . . .  Let your gun therefore be the constant companion 
of your walks.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

In the United States, long after the Army had grown and assumed primary 
responsibility for the nation’s defenses, it continued to depend upon a civilian population 
trained in the use of arms from which it could draw men who would make good soldiers.  
Thus, the government of the United States in 1903 established the National Board for the 
Promotion of Rifle Practice.  The board’s principal mission was to see to the “training of 
U.S. civilians  in  the  use  of rifled  arms  who  might  be  called  into  service  in time of 
national emergency.”  The Board’s mission is reflected today in the U.S. Army’s Director 
of Civilian Marksmanship, whose office sponsors formal marksmanship matches across 
the nation and offers surplus semi-automatic M-1 rifles and ammunition to marksmen and 
clubs dedicated to marksmanship.*   
<P>

But even beyond the militia’s vital role with respect to foreign invasions, the deepest 
object of the Second Amendment goes back to the fundamental “Right of the People to 
alter or abolish [fundamentally unjust government]”:  it is to serve as a free people’s 
ultimate bulwark against internal subversion of civil liberty.  The authors of our Bill of 
Rights recognized that such a people are always susceptible to enemies of liberty—
particularly demagogues—and they sought some means to insure that no individual or 
faction could subvert democracy with impunity.  Retaining for the great body of 
citizens—the unorganized militia—the right to possess firearms provided that insurance.  
<P>

Consider the great Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story’s remarks in his authoritative 
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States:  
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been 
considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it 
offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary 
power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in 
the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over 
them.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

This is the central point that informs the Second Amendment, and should inform the 
present discussion of semi-automatic rifles.  Remarkably enough, it has been almost 
completely overlooked.  But foreign invasion, unlikely as it may seem at any given time, 
is an ever-present possibility, as is the corruption of constitutional forms—as much if not 
more so now, in an age of monstrously large and impersonal bureaucracies, as it was in 
the age of kings and queens.  (And dare we note that when Madison wrote of our “manly 
spirit,” he was explaining what would prevent the House of Representatives from 
unconstitutionally passing laws from which it exempts itself—as it now does routinely?)  
It has been, and will continue to be, individual Americans—armed with weapons 
comparable to those held by the state—who stand as the final guardians of civil liberty.
<P>

Semi-automatic rifles represent nothing more or less than the state of the art in 
firearms.  Among free men, and as a hedge against the corruption of government by 
freedom’s enemies, their private possession by law-abiding citizens and training in their 
use ought to be encouraged rather than prohibited.  Those who use them—or any 
firearm—in the commission of a crime, on the other hand, should receive harsh 
punishment and no quarter.
<P>

Lately, as in years past, the media has exhorted legislators in Sacramento and 
Washington to be bold and to “stand up to the NRA.”  Indeed the boldness and the 
foresight of the statesman are required of our leaders now.  But boldness should not, and 
keen foresight will not, have them standing up to a lobbying group in this case.  Rather 
they must stand for the Constitution—and for the moment against a hasty and unwise 
sentiment on the part of many citizens that represents a willingness to surrender the 
keystone of American liberty.

<center>
<H1>In Defense of Proposition 13<BR>
and the Gann Limit</H1>
</center>

<P>

Proposition 13 remains as controversial today as it was 11 years ago when 
California voters approved it by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.  Indeed, the Proposition 13 
property tax cut provoked the sound and fury of the apocalypse, with liberal critics 
warning that Proposition 13 would cripple government services, and conservative 
supporters cheered by that same prospect.

<P>

A decade later, the critics of Proposition 13 are claiming vindication.  The "I-told-
you-so" critics say Proposition 13 has deprived local government of badly needed 
revenue for new schools, new roads, sewers, water, and other basic services, and the 
constitutional spending limit, better known as the "Gann Limit," is blamed for the state's 
inability to step into the breach.  Proposition 13 is now commonly regarded as a major 
factor in state and local government's inability to keep up with growth, and is therefore 
blamed by developers and much of the business community for contributing to the slow-
growth movement that is gaining strength throughout California.  Today there are calls 
from the Legislative Analyst and many other leaders in the state to repeal the spending 
limit and raise taxes.

<H3>Background</H3>

In order to judge the wisdom of Proposition 13 and the Gann limit a decade later, it 
is necessary to review briefly the extraordinary circumstances that led to the landslide 
passage of Prop 13 in the first place, and it is necessary to separate and sort out the 
various issues and arguments about the present condition of state and local government.  
When you begin to look more closely at Proposition 13, you come to discover some 
ironies and surprises.

<P>

In the mid-1970s, housing prices in California were skyrocketing far faster than the 
surging national inflation rate.  Housing prices in the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
areas were rising at an average rate of 14 to 15 percent a year.  Assessed valuations for 
property tax purposes were climbing along with prices.  Because most counties 
reassessed property values only every two or three years, many property owners were 
seeing their property tax bill suddenly double or triple.  Between inflation and the sudden 
shock of the property tax increase, many homeowners thought thing were getting out of 
control.

<P>

But this shocking increase was deceptive because of several quirks in the property 
tax system, mostly having to do with the exemption on the first $1,750 of assessed 
valuation, which exaggerated the increase in property tax bills.  It turns out that as a 
proportion of personal income, the property tax was not rising at all, but in fact remained 
steady at about 5 percent of personal income all through the 1970s-about the same 
proportion of income as in 1960.

<P>

But although the property tax was not rising as a proportion of personal income, 
other state taxes (especially the state income tax) were rising fast, resulting in a sharply 
rising overall tax burden.  The total tax burden in California had risen from 11.29 percent 
of personal income in 1960 to 15.44 percent by 1978.  The state income tax in particular 
was a very elastic tax for the state treasury;  for every 1-percent rise in personal income, 
the state enjoyed a 1.6-percent increase in income tax revenues, making the state 
government the major winner from the high inflation of the 1970s.  By 1978, California 
was among the highest-taxed states in America (see Chart 1).

<P>

Meanwhile, the state had accumulated a huge budget surplus, estimated to be more 
than $4 billion, which added to the annoyance of taxpayers.  (Governor Jerry Brown 
denied for a time that a surplus existed at all.)  The legislature fiddled with some property 
tax relief measures, but could come to no agreement.  Repeated attempts by the 
legislature to fashion a property tax relief measure floundered in partisan wrangling.  
Even the prospect of Proposition 13 could not break the legislative deadlock.

<P>

And yet, in the months before the June vote on Proposition 13, public opinion polls 
found that the voters were evenly divided over the measure, with a large undecided 
segment.  Then an extraordinary bureaucratic episode tipped the scales in favor of 
Proposition 13.  One month before the June election, Los Angeles County residents 
received their new property valuation assessments and property tax estimates for the 
following year from the County Assessor, Alexander Pope.  There was a huge outcry 
about the large increases in taxes, which made news headlines statewide and prompted 
many voters to fear that they were next.  The interesting thing about this episode is that 
the new assessments for Los Angeles County were not due to be delivered to the 
taxpayers until July, after the election.  A rare case of bureaucratic efficiency was the 
proximate cause in helping to pass the measure to deprive the bureaucracy of tax 
revenues.

<P>

Even so, Proposition 13 terrified the liberal establishment, which planned to defeat 
the initiative with scare tactics, as they had previous tax -limitation initiatives. (Voters 
had rejected previous limitation measures, including Governor Reagan's 1973 tax and 
spending-limitation initiative, because they thought those initiatives would cause higher 
local taxes and reduced services.)

<P>

<center>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="/claremont/images/gsp02-1.gif">
</center>

<H3>Chart 1</H3>

<P>

The liberal establishment mounted an all-out attack.  The Los Angeles Times said 
Proposition 13 would cause the doubling or tripling of the state income and sales tax.  
John Van de Kamp, the Los Angeles District Attorney, called it "a gift-wrapped time 
bomb."  Governor Jerry Brown called it a "rip off" and a "consumer fraud."  The state 
Democratic party chairman said it would mean "turning the state over to the current-day 
anarchists."  Teachers threatened to go on strike in response to possible staff cutbacks.

<P>

Even national organizations got in on the act.  On the eve of the election, the 
National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National Association 
of Counties called a press conference in Washington D.C., to deplore Proposition 13, 
calling it a "wrecking ball" that would cripple local government.  One economic study 
said it would cost the state 450,000 jobs.  (Just the opposite, of course, of what actually 
happened.)  Even the Communist party called a press conference to denounce Prop 13.  It 
was all for nought, as the voters were unmoved by the parade of imaginary horrors.


<H3>The Effects for the Taxpayer</H3>

<P>

The results of Proposition 13 have been rather happy for the taxpayer.  Property 
taxes fell by more than 50 percent, which has saved taxpayers over $100 billion in the last 
ten years.  The frightened legislature moved to adopt indexing for the state income tax in 
the panicky aftermath of Proposition 13, which has saved taxpayers another $23 billion 
on their income taxes in the last decade.  Most importantly, these steps reversed the 
steady increase in the state's tax burden on personal income, which, as mentioned above, 
had grown from 11.3 percent in 1960 to 15.4 percent by 1978.  With the passage of 
Proposition 13 and income-tax indexing, the tax burden dropped back to 11.8 percent, 
and has remained steady since then.  But even at this rate, California remains one of the 
highest-taxed states in the Union.

<P>

The next most important result of Proposition 13 was the 1979 vote in favor of 
Proposition 4, the "Gann Limit," which was presented as a means of completing the 
reform begun by Proposition 13.  Then Gann measure limits state spending according to a 
formula based on population increases and inflation.

<P>

California came up against the spending limit for the first time in 1987, which led to 
rebates to California taxpayers.

<H3>The Effects on Local Government</H3>

The chief area of enduring controversy about Proposition 13 concerns its effect on 
city and county government.  Whether the sky has fallen on local government, as the 
Chicken Littles predicted, is still in dispute.  An analysis of city and county budgets 
reveals that their budgets have continued to grow steadily since Proposition 13.  The loss 
of property-tax revenue has been made up through a number of means.  First of all, 
Sacramento stepped in immediately after Proposition 13 passed and bailed out local 
government with the $4.4-billion state surplus.  This aid very nearly made up for the $5 
billion lost through the property tax reduction. State aid continues to be the single largest 
source of revenue for cities and counties.  Second, cities and counties moved to increase 
the use of fees and other special assessments to maintain service levels.

<P>

What Proposition 13 did was force city and county governments to run much more 
efficiently.  Local spending for public safety and health, adjusted for inflation, has 
continued to rise; spending for general government administration has fallen.  In the city 
of Los Angeles alone, the payroll today is 4,000 paychecks smaller than in 1978.

<P>

But understand that with state financing comes state control.  Liberals had long 
wanted the state to assume greater authority for local government because liberals have 
greater influence with state government than with the hundreds of local government units.  
Shortly after Proposition 13 passed, economist Frank Levy of the Urban Institute wrote: 
"The passage of Proposition 13 has caused almost the entire liberal agenda to be de facto 
adopted.  The state now pays for most county health and welfare costs, and state support 
of public schools has increased from about 40 percent of all expenditure prior to 
Proposition 13, to 67 today."  Economist William Oakland concurred: "Local control or 
`home rule' may become a thing of past in California."

<H3>The Growth of State Government</H3>

The aggrandizement of state government is, then, the greatest irony of Proposition 
13.  It must be remembered that the property tax is a tax for local government, and that 
Proposition 13 has done nothing to restrain the growth of state government, where is 
found the most obnoxious spending priorities and bureaucracy.  When you begin to 
examine the budget trends over the last 20 years, you begin to see that Proposition 13 did 
not slow the growth of state spending at all.  Way back in 1973, Governor Ronald Reagan 
warned: "Unless something is done to check government's unlimited power to tax, 
California's state budget will grow from this year's $9.3. billion to a staggering $47 
billion by 1989."  The 1989 state budget calls for spending $47.8 billion.  The state 
budget has nearly doubled during the seven years of the Deukmejian administration.

<P>

So it become plausible to wonder whether the reason the state does not build new 
roads and school classroom is a shortage of money, or because our state government has 
become very expensive and does not do the kind of things with the budget that it used to 
do, such as building roads and schools, or providing aid for local governments to do these 
things.

<P>

Twenty-five years ago, for instance, the state government spent nearly 16 percent of 
the budget on transportation.  Today California spends less than 6 percent, and ranks last 
in the nation in transportation spending per capita.  Moreover, that 16 percent we used to 
spend was largely for new road construction.  Today the majority of our transportation 
money is simply for maintenance.

<P>

Education is the other point of contention in state government.  But again, 
Proposition 13 and the Gann spending limit are not the real culprits.  Education received 
massive funding increases under Governor Deukmejian.  Spending per student, adjusted 
for  inflation, has risen by one-fifth since Proposition 13, from $3,046 per student in 1978 
to 3,793 next year. (Amounts are in constant 1988 dollars.)  Indeed, the next budget calls 
for spending almost as much for education ($23.4 billion) as we spent for all purposes 
when Governor Deukmejian was elected seven years ago (the 1982 state budget was $25 
billion).  The mystery over the seeming shortage of funds for education disappears when 
you examine the high administrative costs for many of the state's 40 categorical 
educational programs, or when you find that California has one of the highest ratios of 
school administrators to classroom teachers in the nation.

<P>

In other words, the passage of Proposition 13 did not really derail the liberal 
bureaucracy in Sacramento, as the rise in spending for welfare and education continued 
unabated.  But the decline in spending for roads and other basic infrastructure services, 
already declining under Governor Jerry Brown, accelerated after Proposition 13.  
Proposition 13, like the Reagan tax cuts, has made California's economy more 
prosperous.  It also made local government more efficient, but waste and bureaucracy still 
abound in Sacramento as they do in Washington.

<P>

California is a lot better off for having passed Proposition 13, the Gann spending 
limit, and income tax indexing-just think of how fast government spending would have 
risen without these measures.  But we are not as well governed as we should be.  
Proposition 13 was only the first battle in the war to cut government spending and make 
the government do what it used to do.  There are many more battles still to be fought in 
Sacramento.

<h1>Foreign Investment:</h1>
<h3>Benefit or Threat?</h3>
</center>

Remember about ten years back, when OPEC was riding high, gasoline was $1.25 
a gallon, and Arab merchants were buying seemingly every farm in Iowa and Kansas, 
along with downtown London?  So extreme was the paranoia that “<I>foreign interests</I>” 
would end up owning America’s heartland that many politicians and business leaders 
proposed that there be restrictions in foreign ownership of American assets.

<P>

Of course, the fortunes of OPEC and the Arab oil merchants suffered a swift 
reversal, and yet, despite the salutary lesson in the vicissitudes of world markets, the 
paranoia over foreign investment is with us again.  The chief culprits are the Japanese, 
and so strong has been the backlash to Japanese and other Asian investment that the joke 
has arisen that, should we go to war again, America will have to bomb Pearl Harbor, for 
the Japanese, having failed to conquer Hawaii in 1942, have come to own nearly the 
whole of it.

<P>

At the present time, the clamor for restrictions on foreign ownership of American 
assets is not sufficiently strong to bring the sentiment to effect—but it is there.  Aside 
from the Japan-bashing chatter you hear at cocktail parties, the theme of economic 
nationalism played a prominent role in the late Presidential campaign of the Democratic 
party, and economic nationalism was the preeminent issue in the recent Canadian 
election.  If economic nationalism can prove relatively potent in a time of prosperity and 
growth, surely it can become a decisive force if there is any wind of serious economic 
downturn.

<P>

If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel,  as Samuel Johnson has it, then 
economic nationalism—a mistaken substitute for patriotism—is the first refuge of 
paranoid politicians.  The kind of economic nationalism that resents foreign investment in 
the U.S. is mistaken not only on the facts, but also on the principles of economic 
rationality.

<P>

First of all, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. is not very large.  In fact, 
although you can say with great effect that “Japanese investment in the U.S. has increased 
six-fold since 1980,” the book value of Japanese investment in the U.S. came to only $33 
billion by 1987, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Guess what?  That is 
less than half the level of investment in the U.S. by Great Britain.  When was the last time 
you heard anyone worry about the level of British investment in the U.S.?

<P>

As a proportion of total assets in the U.S.,  foreign ownership is really quite small. 
Take California, a favorite spot for Japanese and other foreign investment, as an example. 
In 1987, total foreign investment in California came to $37.02 billion—about 3 percent of 
the total assessed valuation of all property and assets in the state.  That investment, by the 
way, is credited with creating more than 280,000 jobs in the state, 45 percent of which are 
manufacturing jobs.  Furthermore, in 1986 (the last year for which figures are available), 
foreigners owned only 2 percent of the state’s farmland—922,680 of California’s 47.3 
million agricultural acres.

<P>

To be sure, much of the emotional strength behind the paranoia over Japanese 
ownership comes from the anecdotal tales of Japanese businessmen paying huge sums—
often in cash—for American real estate.  Often, it is true, these buyers are paying far too 
much for American properties, at least by the standards of the American market.  But that 
is exactly the point. Remember that real estate in Japan is frightfully expensive.  Ours is 
comparatively cheap.  Combine that relative circumstance with the strong Yen, and 
suddenly the Japanese real estate rush here doesn’t look so outlandish.

<P>

The fact that Japanese investors are willing to overpay for American assets should, 
in fact, be regarded as good news.  The world presently stands in awe of, and is 
intimidated by, the Asian economies.  And yet it should say a great deal that Asian 
investors are sending substantial amounts of their capital here, rather than investing in 
their own economies.  In fact, the returns on investment are much higher here than in the 
Far East.  If the Asians really are the world’s shrewdest businessmen (a dubious 
proposition) then what does it say for the future of our economy—that they see the U.S. 
as one of the best places to invest their capital?

<P>

But even if it were true that Japanese and other foreign investors were succeeding 
in buying a significant portion of America’s assets, what would it really mean?  In the 
abstract, ownership of an asset is unrelated to the performance of the asset.  Critics 
suggest that foreign ownership of our assets somehow threatens our control of our own 
destiny, or even national security.  But there is no evidence to suggest that Japanese or 
other foreign management would make worse use of assets than American owners.  And 
the outcry against Japanese investment misses a fundamental point:  When an American 
sells an asset to a foreign owner, the American gets cash with which to invest in other 
assets or in creating new assets.  Often in our nation’s history, periods of economic 
growth correspond with net inflows of capital.

<P>

In fact, this one of the most important, yet largely overlooked, lessons about the 
present structure of international finance.  At the beginning of the 1980s, America was 
investing about $100 billion a year overseas—helping in large part to fuel the expansion 
in the Pacific Rim.  When the Reagan Administration cut taxes and improved the after-
tax yield on investment here, Americans not only stopped sending their capital abroad, 
but foreign nations found they could not  compete for their own capital, as it flowed into 
the newly attractive American economy.  The trade deficit that has ensued from all this, 
Milton Friedman has said recently, “is an economic blessing.  It has enabled us to have a 
higher level of investment.”  This circumstance has also led to a wave of tax reductions 
around the world.

<P>

What we have is a case of the shoe being on the other foot.  For decades, American 
investment overseas helped to foster often violent anti-American sentiments that were 
little better than a cover for envy and resentment.  Given the fact that there is no outcry 
against the much larger—and growing—British investment here, it would seem that the 
anti-Asian sentiment is motivated by the worst of reasons:  racism and envy.  Although it 
may be true that there are serious cultural frictions between Japanese investing and 
American business and labor, that is not an economic problem.  It would be regrettable if 
America, the nation dedicated to the proposition that “all men are created equal,”  were to 
act on ethnic frustrations and call it “economic policy.”

<html><head><title>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</title><body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><table border=0 width=85%><tr><td><center><h1>The Conservatism of the Declaration of Independence</h1><h5>Remarks given by Dr. Thomas G. West at a dinner for the Board of Directors of the Claremont Institute, May 10, 1996</h5></center>	The Claremont Institute seeks to restore the principles of the American founding to their former position of preeminence in American public life.  Surprisingly, some conservatives have doubts about that project.<p>	The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way:  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<p>	In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings.  On the one hand they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration.  On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is that we have too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy.  Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much they care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<p>	We at the Claremont Institute do not share the conservative ambivalence about the principles of the Declaration.  We believe that liberty and equality and rights are entirely good, as those terms were understood by our Founders.  A people that is a "good people" (as we called ourselves in the Declaration) cannot have too much of these good things.  The problem today is not that we have too much equality, too much liberty, too many rights.  The problem is that we are well along in a process of abandoning equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood.<p>	I will explain this from three points of view.<p>	First, our liberties are contracting, not expanding.  Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights.  What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past twenty-five years.<p>	Second, our liberties are also contracting in the area of government by consent--by elected officials accountable to the people.  Our country is governed less democratically now than it was in 1965.<p>	Third, our liberties are also contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom - namely, morality, family, and faith.<p>	Let me give examples to explain in each case how this decline of democracy, equality, and rights is taking place.<p>	Consider free speech.  Conservatives today sometimes complain that we have an excess of free speech.  But let us focus on the one area that the Founders regarded as the most important purpose of free speech: enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates for election.  In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office.  Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected.  This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of people with money in elections.  The idea behind this law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, the wealthy should be severely limited in what they can publish.<p>	What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest?  This is what the Revolution was all about:  government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who forbidden.  That had been the law in Old England.  Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic.  John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<p>	The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers.  What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws?  Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government,--in many cases, conservatives.<p>	Second example.  America doesn't have too much democracy, as many conservatives believe.  It has too little.  Government by the people has in a significant degree been replaced over the past century, especially in the past thirty years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate.  Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<p>	This has happened in two ways.  One, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments.  Two, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (president, governor, legislatures) to unelected officials (bureaucracies, agencies, and courts).<p>	One example.  How did we get wetlands regulation?  As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law on the subject.  The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the U. S.  Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U. S.  This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as little as 14 days a year, and land that accidentally becomes soaked by irrigation runoff or from undersized or clogged culverts.<p>	This wetlands example illustrates how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people.  This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent.  It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<p>	So much for our rights, and government by consent.<p>	Let us turn now to our third theme, the government's assault on the conditions of freedom--religion, family, and morality.<p>	The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare.  The Founders were the heirs of two thousand years of European history in which there was little or no protection of individuals rights, and little or no government by the consent of the governed.<p>	In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly.  Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another."  But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from?  The Founders' answer:  from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others.  Thomas Jefferson--the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity--was sensible enough to write in his Notes on Virginia that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<p>	Today's government is in a whole host of ways anti-religious.  When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational."  In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools.  Yet the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<p>	Government's ban on God is particularly striking in light of this fact:  the Declaration of Independence says liberty is our inalienable right only because we are "endowed" with that right by our Creator ("created equal").  Our principles (religious liberty) supposedly require us never to breathe a word to school children about where those principles come from.  But if we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on?  If liberty is not the gift of God, it must be the gift of government.  But what government gives, government may take away.  As Jefferson said: without God, liberty will not last.<p>	On the same topic of government hostility to morality and religion, consider the family.  Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem.  It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<p>	When government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood.  Government's generosity made it possible, for the time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more.  The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.<p>	At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage.  From sex education to legalized abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message:  just do it!  Sex exists for your personal fun and pleasure.  Don't worry about the consequences--if the fetus is inconvenient, kill it; if you would rather bring it to term, we'll pay you to raise it.<p>	Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<p>	America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated.  We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<p>	The Claremont Institute is devoted to the recovery of this healthy core of the older American tradition.  Let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<blockquote><b>Dr. Thomas G.

<h3>Foreword</h3>

<FONT SIZE=2>There are two reasons this booklet
is important.  One, it is immediately useful.  The majority of
Americans who favor restoring prayer to public schools will find
a way here to accomplish it.  It is a way which will pass the
muster of the courts.  It is a way which will be unobjectionable
to all fair-minded citizens.  It is a way that no one can criticize
as un-American.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second reason this booklet is
important is intellectual.  It teaches us about the key to America's
past greatness.  It warns us about the chief threat to America's
greatness today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One of the all-time best books about
our country is Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America</I>.  Written
in the 1830s, it explains the unique strength of our democracy
very simply:  In America the &quot;spirit of liberty&quot; and
the &quot;spirit of religion&quot; are intertwined.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, America's founders supported
the separation of church and state.  They enshrined it in the
First Amendment.  There would be no established religion here,
or preference by government to any particular religion.  But the
founders supported religion in general, both in speech and action.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Washington expressed the
consensus of the founders:  &quot;Of all the dispositions and
habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality
are indispensable supports.  In vain would that man claim the
tribute of partiotism, who should labor to subvert these great
pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties
of man and citizens.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for action, it is useful to recall
that Thomas Jefferson supported a bill prescribing penalities
for anyone doing business on the Sabbath.  He did so the very
same year that he wrote Virginia's Bill for Establishing Religious
Freedom, the greatest expression ever of freedom of conscience.
 Whatever any of us may think of blue laws, it is clear that Jefferson-who
also coined the phrase &quot;wall of separation between church
and state&quot;-was not anti-religious in the manner of the ACLU
and its liberal allies today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The conjunction of the &quot;spirit
of liberty&quot; and &quot;spirit of religion&quot; in America
was a two-way street.  The priests and ministers Tocqueville heard
preaching here were supporters of the rights of man.  They saw
God's will in the American Revolution.  Indeed, historically,
America's churches were the seedbeds of the Revolution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The veneration of religion by democrats
and of democracy by religious leaders in America was remarkable
to Tocqueville, because in his native France there was bitter
enmity between the Catholic Church and the supporters of democracy.
 The difference was critical to the opposite outcomes of the two
countries' revolutions in the late 18th century.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Harry V. Jaffa's understanding of
American democracy draws less on Tocqueville than on his hero
Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln spoke of an American political religion,
by which he meant reverence for the Constitution as informed by
the Declaration of Independence.  Using biblical language, Lincoln
spoke of the Constitution as a picture of silver surrounding the
Declaration, an apple of gold.  The Constitution supplies a democratic
structure with which we can govern ourselves.  The Declaration
supplies us with the understanding to govern ourselves well.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Professor Jaffa was responsible,
in the 1950s, for reviving the serious study of the Lincoln-Douglas
debates of 1858.  In those debates, Stephen Douglas defended the
Constitution as a procedural, majoritarian document.  It supported
what he called &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;-the idea that the
people in every state and territory of the U.S. have a right to
decide for themselves whether to allow slavery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lincoln understood the Constitution
to contain a moral component supplied by the Declaration.  The
&quot;laws of nature and of nature's God&quot; require that a
government be democratic to be legitimate.  At the same time,
however, they limit what democrats may legitimately choose.  The
power of Lincoln's rhetoric was always to show that extending
the definition of rights to mean the right to do wrong-as in the
right to have slaves-logically undermines the very idea of rights.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, the key to America's greatness
for Tocqueville was a religious spirit that fervently supported
liberty while guiding it clear of license.  For Lincoln it was
the Declaration, which sets forth the doctrine of rights but grounds
it in a doctrine of right.  The common element is the idea of
&quot;liberty under God.&quot;  For Tocqueville it is explicitly
the God of the Old and New Testaments.  For Lincoln it is the
God who is mentioned four times in the Declaration:  &quot;nature's
God&quot; who is the source of laws, the &quot;Creator&quot; who
endows men with rights, the &quot;Supreme Judge of the world&quot;
to whom the writers appeal for guidance, and &quot;divine providence&quot;
on whom free men must rely for protection.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just as &quot;liberty under God&quot;
is the key to America's past, the sundering of liberty from God
is the chief threat to our future.  We can see this threat in
the anti-religious attitudes among our elites that are more reminiscent
of Tocqueville's France than Tocqueville's America.  We can see
this threat in the licentious behavior that has eaten away at
the American family since the 1960s.  Restoring prayer in schools
may be only one step, but we believe it will be an important step
back from the precipice.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This booklet argues that Congress
has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation
allowing voluntary prayer in shcools.  The character of this prayer
would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the
preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions.  This would at once
recall the idea of &quot;liberty under God,&quot; and remind all
Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but
rather the formation of our unparalleled freedoms for two centuries.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We are a religious people,
whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is no better way to confirm
the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William
O. Douglas, than to take a tour through the state constitutions.
 Forty-six of the fifty stateshave preambles invoking the name
of Almighty God</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
 A joint resolution of the Congress-which would require no more
than simple majorities in both houses-could declare that children
in public schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing
only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present
in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any
of the other states.  When this resolution is signed by the President-and
it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it-it could
take effect immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that
the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution. 
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected
branches of government, but also would require it, in effect,
to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We submit herewith some examples
of the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental
laws of the states.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Alabama, in order
to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure
the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking
the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and establish
the following Constitution and form of government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of Arkansas,
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty,
and desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of California,
grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Colorado, with profound
reverence for the Supreme Ruler of the Universe . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging
with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted
them to enjoy a free government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>[Delaware] Through divine goodness,
all men have by nature the right of worshipping and serving their
Creator according to the dictates of their consciences . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Maine . . . acknowledging
with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler of the
Universe . . . and imploring God's aid and direction . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of New
Jersey, grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty
which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy, and looking to Him
for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the same
unimpaired to succeeding generations . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of
civil and religious liberty, and humbly invoking his guidance
. . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since through Divine Providence we
enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty, we the people
of West Virginia, in and through the provisions of this Constitution,
reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God and seek
diligently to promote, preserve and perpetuate good government
. . . </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This selection should be sufficient
to illustrate both the consistency in the patterns of all the
preambles, and the interesting variations that occur in some of
them.  Who could ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge
that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil and
religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant
reliance upon God to preserve and perpetuate it?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is notable that the state constitutions
have provisions equivalent to the &quot;no establishment&quot;
and &quot;free exercise&quot; clauses of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice
for present purposes is that of California.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion
without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty
of conscience does not excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent
with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From this it is apparent that the
people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees
of religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions
of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that freedom in the same
constitutions.</FONT>
<P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>*   *   *   *   *</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>American constitutions whether federal
or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration
of Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination
of a legal positivism which is simply unable to understand the
relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and
human law on the other.  Yet this relationship was axiomatic for
our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation-that
is to say, a moral duty- to obey the laws, either of our State,
or of the United States, there is only one answer.  It is because
those laws exist &quot;to secure these rights,&quot; rights with
which we have been &quot;endowed by [our] Creator.&quot;  Constitutional
governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights
whose origin is altogether independent of human will, rights which
are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in &quot;the
laws of nature and of nature's God.&quot;  Through the ages many
governments which did not respect the rights of the individual
have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But
the consent of the governed required by our republican constitutions
is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human
person.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Legal positivists deny to the Declaration
any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according
to the United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the
first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this is
not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that all
enabling acts since the Civil War have provided that the state
to be admitted must have a constitution &quot;republican in form&quot;
and that the constitution &quot;not be repugnant to the principles
of the Declaration of Independence.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States Constitution, while
guaranteeing to every state of the Union a republican form of
government, does not expressly say what that form is.  But the
Congress, in implementing that guarantee in the case of each new
state added to the Union in the last one hundred and thirty years,
does expressly define that form by the principles of the Declaration
of Independence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under this mandate from the Congress,
we find these principles affirmed over and over again in the state
constitutions.  Here for example is Alabama.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Article I.  Declaration of Rights
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>That the great, general, and essential
principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and
established, we declare:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sec. 1. Inalienable rights.  That
all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Rights of the
Constitution of the State of California has a similar provision,
which reads: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All people are by nature free and
independent and have inalienable rights.  Among these are enjoying
and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting
property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It can be seen that &quot;endowed
by their Creator&quot; and &quot;by nature&quot; are correlative
terms each implying the other.  It can also be seen that the rights
secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the
United States, are means of implementing antecedent rights whose
origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how
we can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating
in them an understanding of and a reverence for this origin. </FONT>

of his own religious sect or denomination, provided there be any
on whose instructions he attends: otherwise it may be paid towards
the support of the teacher or teachers of the parish or precinct
in which the said monies are raised-And every denomination of
christians, demeaning themselves peaceably, and as good Subjects

<h1>On the Front Line of the Culture War:</h1>
<h3>Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America</h3>
<b>William A. Donohue</B>
</center>

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center width=85%>

<h3>Preface</h3>

On May 24, 1993, Roberta Achtenberg was confirmed as U.S. 
Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  
This was a ballyhooed "historic first" of the Clinton era:  
Achtenberg is a homosexual activist.  
<P>

Less than two weeks later, President Clinton scuttled the 
politically-disastrous nomination of his long-time friend and 
political ally Lani Guinier for the nation's top civil rights post.  
More startling to the public was that he had nominated her in the 
first place:  Guinier had built her entire reputation on 
challenging the idea of majority rule, both in elections and in 
legislatures.    
<P>

These events are related, and their connection is related to the 
theme of this booklet.
<P>

What Winston Churchill and others have admired about 
Scouting over the years is that it supports the work of family, 
church, and country, attaching boys' loyalties to—in Churchill's 
words—"Right and Truth, however the winds may blow."  It 
stood against the strange 19th-century philosophical view  that 
winds (or history) is all there is—that right and truth change 
with time and circumstance.  This philosophy, called 
"historicism," animated both German National Socialism and 
Soviet Communism earlier in this century.  In a more benign 
form, it came to roost in American universities and is now 
making inroads in American government.     
<P>

We know this philosophy as moral relativism.  Its adherents 
speak not of morals but of "values," none of which are 
objectively superior to any others.  For instance, one person's 
values may tell them that the best kind of family consists of a 
man and a woman and children.  Others' values may say that the 
best kind of a family consists of a man and five women and 
children, or two men and children, or two women and children 
and a rabbit.  And no one can legitimately hold that any of these is 
superior, except merely subjectively.  Nor can the government 
take a legitimate interest in promoting one arrangment over the 
others.  That would be "legislating morality."  In fact, the 
government should legislate against morality, or against the right 
of private citizens and organizations to make moral distinctions. 
This is the view of Roberta Achtenberg who, in fact, gained 
fame as a San Francisco Supervisor with her heavy-handed 
efforts to force the Boy Scouts to reverse their ban on homo-
sexual Scoutmasters.  And it is the view endorsed by the Clinton 
administration, not only by the fact of Achtenberg's appointment 
to high federal office, but also of Clinton's Interior Department's 
official endorsement of a National Park Service ban on using Boy 
Scout volunteers in America's national parks.
<P>

But homosexuals and atheists (who have also dragged the 
Boy Scouts into court, seeking to outlaw the right of private 
citizens and organizations to make religious distinctions) have a 
big problem:  Most Americans, while not inclined to snoop into 
each others' private lives, believe that sodomy is wrong and 
want to raise their children in that view.  Most Americans, while 
not inclined to talk overly-much about it, believe in God and 
want to raise their children in that view.  And most Americans 
think our country is tops precisely because its principles, based 
on "the laws of nature and of nature's God," support their views 
and their right to raise their children as they see fit.
<P>

And there's the rub.  What the majority thinks of as freedom 
isn't what organized homosexuals and atheists and their modern 
(as opposed to Jeffersonian) liberal supporters think of as 
freedom—namely, freedom from all social constraints.  The 
solution, according to Lani Guinier—whose views President 
Clinton knew perfectly well before he nominated her, and whose 
views he shares, according to her, despite his public denials 
when he cut her loose under fire—is that judges and bureaucrats 
should rule us despite our druthers, according to their 
"enlightened" views.
<P>

Back in the Reagan years, Attorney General Ed Meese became 
embroiled in a remarkable running debate with Supreme Court 
Justice William Brennan, over how judges should decide cases 
involving the Constitution.  Meese said they should look to the 
original meaning of the Constitution and respect majority rule.  
Brennan, referring to the founding era as "a world that is dead 
and gone," explained why he would prohibit the death penalty 
despite its popularity and its explicit authorization in the Fifth 
Amendment:  "On this issue, the death penalty, I hope to 
embody a community striving for human dignity for all. . . ."  
With his use of the personal pronoun, Brennan suggested that 
he, an unelected judge, is better able to "embody the 
community" than Americans' elected representatives.  
<P>

The American Civil Liberties Union—a major player in recent 
attacks on the Boy Scouts, as Bill Donohue recounts in this 
booklet—stood foursquare with Brennan.  In a cover letter to a 
petition calling for Meese's ouster, ACLU Executive Director Ira 
Glasser wrote:  "It is only a very small and special group of 
Americans (less than 1%) who understand the importance of 
fighting to sustain individual freedom."  A friend and I 
responded in a newspaper editorial at the time:  "What 
arrogance!  And what a threat to liberty!"  
<P>

We continued:  Vladimir Lenin once made the argument that 
representative democracy was not really democratic 
at all, because the majority of people in democracies 
do not have the requisite knowledge to vote in their 
own true interests.  Democratic majorities are much 
too concerned with their families, for instance, and 
with obtaining better working conditions and better 
pay, with utilizing their right to start their own 
businesses, etc., ever to vote to abolish private 
property.
<P>

How stupid, said Lenin.  It's a good thing I'm here to 
"embody the community," because the people 
themselves would never vote for their true 
representatives.
<P>

That is how Lenin used to talk, and how communists 
still talk.  And it appears—by his suggestion that we 
should be embodied or represented, for our own 
good, by nine unelected lawyers with life tenure on 
the Supreme Court—that William Brennan considers 
the court to be something like an American Politburo. 
. . .  But if the "liberal" anti-democratic faction 
[represented by Brennan and the ACLU] ever gains 
full control of our government, then we will say, after 
Lincoln, that we would prefer emigrating to Russia, 
where we can take our despotism unalloyed.

<P>
What a goofy world:  Seven years later, Leninists have been 
expelled from the Kremlin and Brennanists have taken over the 
White House.  
<P>

This investigation of recent attacks on the Boy Scouts shows 
us clearly how the enemies of morality and religion operate 
pseudo-democratically, and suggests how to defeat them with 
the real thing.
<P>

<h2>On the Front Line of the Culture War:</h2>

<blockquote>
Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America
[The Boy Scout Movement] speaks to every heart its message 
of duty and honour:  'Be Prepared' to stand up faithfully for 
Right and Truth, however the winds may blow.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<b>Assault on the the Boy Scout Tradition</b>
<P>

"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and 
country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all 
times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and 
morally straight."  
<P>

For seven decades, the Boy Scout Oath was considered 
wholly unexceptional by almost everyone.  But in the 1980s it 
became the target of homosexuals, atheists and (to a lesser 
degree) feminists. Acting in concert with these groups is the 
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the legal arm of modern 
liberalism.  At stake is whether private organizations that 
support traditional morality are protected by the law against 
assaults by their enemies.  Despite its desire just to be left alone, 
the Boy Scouts of America has found itself on the front line of the 
culture war.
<P>

Scouting was introduced to America in 1910 by its founder, 
Lord Robert Baden-Powell.  In the first articles of incorporation, 
the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) defined its purpose:  "to 
promote, through organization, and cooperation with other 
agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and 
others, to train them in Scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, 
courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods 
which are in common use by Boy Scouts."
<P>

The Scout Oath, which was first published in 1911 in The 
Official Boy Scout Handbook, requires every Scout to obey Scout 
Law.  Scout Law provides that every Scout be trustworthy, loyal, 
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, 
brave, clean and reverent.
<P>

In addition to the Boy Scouts, for boys from 11- to 17-years-
old, there are the Cub Scouts and the Tiger Scouts, which begin 
in the first grade. There is also the Explorers, focusing on 
exploring careers, for young people of both sexes, ages 14 to 20.  
Scout troops are sponsored at the local level by churches, 
schools, and various civic organizations.  
<P>

The BSA has 4.3 million members and 1.1 million adult 
volunteers.  Approximately one-half of all American boys try 
Cub Scouting and about one in five become Boy Scouts.  
Gays, Godless, and Girls Want In
<P>

In 1980 a 17-year-old Scout named Timothy Curran decided 
to take a male date to his senior prom.  The Oakland Tribune 
published a photo of the couple and Curran was called to appear 
before the Boy Scouts' Mount Diablo Council office in Walnut 
Creek, California.  Executive Director Quentin Alexander told 
Curran that he could not continue in scouting, stating that 
"homosexuality and Boy Scouting are not com-patible."   Curran 
sued the Boy Scouts, seeking an injunction to prevent them from 
excluding him from membership and from being a troop leader.  
Curran enlisted the ACLU, which claimed that in barring him 
the BSA violated the "equal public accommodations" section of 
the state Civil Rights Act.  Similar lawsuits have subsequently 
been filed by James Dale and Chuck Merino, homosexual Boy 
Scout leaders in Monmouth, New Jersey and San Diego, 
California, respectively.     
<P>

In 1989 Elliott Welsh agreed to his 6-year-old son Mark's 
request to join the Tiger Cubs.  But when he discovered at a 
recruiting meeting in Burr Ridge, Illinois that Mark would have 
to abide by a religious requirement, he sued the BSA. Two years 
later attorney James Randall, the Anaheim, California father of 
nine-year-old twins, sued the BSA for a similar reason: he 
objected to the Cub Scout Oath for mentioning God.  He was 
assisted by the ACLU.
<P>

In 1991 an eight-year-old Florida girl, Margo Mankes, filed 
suit against the Boy Scouts for excluding her from joining.  
Though the ACLU was not active in her case, it did express 
interest in representing several girls from Quincy, California 
who sought to become Boy Scouts.
<P>

The immediate issue in these cases is whether the BSA can 
continue to function according to its own precepts or will have to 
abide by those of others.  The longer term question is whether 
traditional morality can be sustained in our democracy.  And as 
a corollary:  Can our democracy itself be sustained?    
Boy Scout Thinking on Homosexuality
<P>

At the Timothy Curran-BSA trial, a Scout official testified 
that, from the beginning of the Boy Scouts, "it was clearly 
understood that homosexuality was an immoral behavior and 
had no place in Scouting for youth or leaders."   Lee Sneath, a 
national spokesman for the BSA, explained that "as an 
organization that stresses the values of the family, we believe 
that homosexuals do not provide the proper role model for 
youth membership."
<P>

The idea that homosexuality is wrong did not originate, nor 
will it end, with the Boy Scouts of America.  As political scientist 
Harry V. Jaffa has written:  
<P>
<blockquote>
From ancient—and biblical—times, this practice has 
been regarded by the greatest legislators and 
moralists as a vicious sexual perversion.  It is 
condemned equally by the Old and New Testaments, 
and by Plato in his Laws.  Thomas Jefferson, in a 
criminal code written during the American 
Revolution, made it a felony in the same class as rape.  
In this he only followed the common law. 
Nor is the connection between this idea and the family 
unprecedented or unreasonable:
Mankind as a whole is recognized by its generations, 
like a river which is one and the same while the ever-
renewed cycles of birth and death flow on.  But the 
generations are constituted—and can only be 
constituted—by the acts of generation arising from 
the conjunction of male and female. . . .  Equally with 
rape and incest, homosexuality strikes at the 
authority and dignity of the family.  The distinction 
between a man and a woman is as fundamental as 
any in nature, because it is the very distinction by 
which nature itself is constituted.
</blockquote>
<P>

This philosophical (and common sense) view is of course 
compatible with traditional religious views:  As has been cutely 
(and acutely) noted about the biblical account of creation, God 
made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Thus The Official Boy 
Scout Handbook explains the meaning of "morally straight" in the 
Boy Scout Oath in these terms:  "[w]hen you live up to the trust 
of fatherhood your sex life will fit into God's wonderful plan of 
creation.  Fuller understanding of wholesome sex behavior can 
bring you lifelong happiness."
<P>

Practically speaking, of course, the BSA is also concerned 
about pedophilia.  Although most homosexuals may not be 
pedophiles, as BSA spokesman Sneath pointed out, the Scouts 
"provide a natural hunting ground for pedophiles."   Thus the 
BSA has launched an aggressive anti-abuse campaign, and 
guidelines now discourage such traditional practices as skinny-
dipping and forbid boys to sleep in the tent of adults other than a 
parent or guardian.
<P>

Article VIII of the BSA Bylaws states:  "Our membership 
standards have been developed to ensure that we have the best 
possible individuals in our organization, and the enforcement of 
these standards should not be construed to suggest that any 
individual in question is not a decent citizen.  It simply means 
that the individual does not possess the requirements necessary 
for membership in the Boy Scouts of America."  
This policy is comparable to that of the American Lung 
Association, which because of its principles on health probably 
would not want to be represented by smokers.
Judge Sally G. Disco of the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court understood that exclusion of homosexuals was critical to 
the Boy Scout mission:
<P>

<blockquote>
Inclusion of a homosexual Scoutmaster who has 
publicly acknowledged his or her homosexuality 
would either undermine the force of the Boy Scout 
view that homosexuality is immoral and inconsistent 
with the Scout oath and law, or would undermine the 
credibility of the Scoutmaster who attempts to 
communicate that view.   
</blockquote>
<P>

For Judge Disco—whose decision we will say more about 
below—the case against the Boy Scouts hinged on whether 
promoting traditional morality, like promoting public health, is 
protected by the First Amendment.

<h3>Boy Scout Thinking on Atheism</h3>

About 30 percent of all Boy Scouts are sponsored by churches, 
with support coming most heavily from the Church of Latter 
Day Saints, the United Methodist Church and the Roman 
Catholic Church.  This is not surprising:  The BSA promotes 
belief in God and a sense of responsibility to God.  On the other 
hand, it is nonsectarian in its attitude toward religious training.  
Boys are encouraged to respect other religions.  Indeed, God and 
religion are understood so broadly that in practice even 
Buddhists, who do not believe in a Supreme Being, are welcome 
to join.
<P>

Still Elliott Welsh found room to carp.  Of course Welsh is no 
stranger to courtrooms:  In 1970 he achieved notoriety when the 
Supreme Court threw out his three-year prison sentence for 
claiming conscientious objection status to the Vietnam War on 
ethical (as opposed to religious, since he is not religious) 
grounds.  
<P>

At issue in the Welsh-BSA case were the Tiger Cub Promise 
and the Declaration of Religious Principle.  The former consists of 
16 words: "I promise to love God, my family, and my country, 
and to learn about the world."  The latter says in part:  "The Boy 
Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the 
best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God and 
therefore recognizes the religious element in the training of the 
member."  Elliott Welsh characterized this as "bigoted, 
outmoded boilerplate." 
<P>

The burden of proof is on Welsh.  No less than George 
Washington held the opposite view.  He said in his Farewell 
Address:
<P>
<blockquote>
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are 
indispensable supports.  In vain would that man 
claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to 
subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these 
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. . . .  
Let it simply be asked where is the security for 
property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of 
religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the 
instruments of investigation in the Courts of Justice?  
And let us with caution indulge the supposition that 
morality can be maintained without religion.    
</blockquote>
<P>

Indeed, this view has been held by all of our presidents down 
to the modern day.   It is woven deep in the fabric of our 
national life.  Alexis de Tocqueville observed in 1848:  "An 
American sees in religion the surest guarantee of the stability of 
the State and the safety of individuals."   And Justice William 
O. Douglas in 1952:  
<P>
<blockquote>
We are a religious people whose institutions 
presuppose a Supreme Being.  We guarantee the 
freedom to worship as one chooses.  [We] sponsor an 
attitude on the part of government that shows no 
partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish 
according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal 
of its dogma.  When the state encourages religious 
instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by 
adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian 
needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then 
respects the religious nature of our people and 
accomodates the public service to their spiritual 
needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in 
the Constitution a requirement that the government 
show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That 
would be preferring those who believe in no religion 
over those who do believe. 
</blockquote>
<P>

The BSA prevailed against Welsh's suit, but not James 
Randall's.  Randall has not only sued the BSA on behalf of his 
sons, but a San Diego Girl Scout troop as well, for denying 6-
year-old Nitzya Cuevas-Macias entrance into meetings for 
refusing to pledge to serve God.
<P>

As we will see below, the issue here is whether Justice 
Douglas's worst case scenario will be enacted into law—whether 
the old liberal idea of freedom of religion will be replaced by the 
modern liberal idea of freedom from religion.  
Boy Scout Thinking on Girl Applicants
<P>

The Boy Scouts don't accept girls for the same reason the 
Girl Scouts don't accept boys.  Blake Lewis of the BSA explained:  
"The emotional, psychological and physical needs of young boys 
are very different in this age group from the needs of young 
girls."   Same sex programs and institutions have been a staple 
of youth organizations for decades.  There is no reason to 
interpret this as discrimination in the pejorative sense of the 
word.  Indeed, as mentioned above, the BSA's Explorers include 
girls.  And women now comprise three percent of Scoutmasters 
nationwide. 
<P>

This wasn't enough for Mark Rubin, the attorney who 
unsuccessfully represented Margo Mankes. "The Scouts are 
training boys to be successful," he said.  "The Girl Scouts' 
purpose is to make women better homemakers.  There is no 
alternative as good as the Boy Scouts."   
<P>

Clearly this is a less serious threat to the BSA, at least for now, 
than the threats from homosexuals and atheists.  So we will not 
belabor it except to point out that there are more reasonable 
alternatives than suing the Boy Scouts to admit girls, e.g., 
working to reform the Girl Scouts or founding a new 
organization for girls.  
<P>

That such an obviously unreasonable route was taken 
indicates an ulterior motive.  

<h3>The Culture War Against the Boy Scouts</h3>

Levi Strauss Company, Bank of America and Wells Fargo 
yanked their donations to the BSA in the summer of 1992 over 
the exclusion of homosexuals.  The United Way of DeKalb 
County, Illinois, has denied funding to the local BSA council, as 
has the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area, which used 
to donate nearly $500,000.  (Nationwide, the United Way con-
tributes roughly 25 percent of the BSA budget.)  In 1993, the San 
Diego school board voted unanimously to oust the Scouts from 
running school-day programs in the eighth-largest district in the 
nation. 
<P>

In an unusal effort, Lewis S. Albert, the western region  acting 
director of the National Park Service, told his sub-ordinates that 
they should terminate all agreements with the BSA, such as the 
use of Boy Scout volunteers in the parks.  This directive was 
overridden by the Bush administration, which told the National 
Park Service bureaucrats that it was not their business to 
interfere with the policies of private associations like the Boy 
Scouts.  But less than three weeks into the Clinton 
administration, Clinton's Interior Department rescinded the 
Bush override. 

<h3>How does one make sense of this?</h3>

Most Americans have never found the Boy Scouts to be 
anything but commendable.  Recently, however, a very 
influential group has come to find it anachronistic.  More than 
that, they want to force the BSA to change or (as they might say) 
"drag it into the modern world."
<P>
  
The term "new class," as employed by social commentator 
Irving Kristol and others, refers to modern liberals, usually 
educated at America's elite colleges and universities, who work 
in the media, the academy, government, and other non-profit 
sectors of the economy.  Ideologically alienated from 
"bourgeois" society, they are strategically placed—e.g., in New 
York, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, and on the faculties of most 
college campuses, particularly in the humanities, the social 
sciences and law—to undermine the traditional beliefs and way 
of life of the American middle class. This "new class" espouses 
"politically correct" thinking:  the view that any departure from 
the modern liberal agenda is racist, sexist or homophobic, and 
thus beyond the pale in modern society.  Increasingly they resort 
to the courts, in effect criminalizing politically incorrect (i.e., 
traditional or conservative) policies and even speech.
<P>

This tendency to resort to coercion to get their way is the most 
obvious behavioral trait distinguishing modern liberals from their 
classical liberal forbears.  Whereas liberals even a generation ago 
(like Justice William O. Douglas) believed deeply in the Bill of 
Rights and democracy, modern liberals use charges of racism, 
sexism, and homophobia as clubs to stifle free debate and bully 
the majority into submission.
<P>

These are the people who have singled out the Boy Scouts for 
extreme measures.  

<h3>Discriminating Discrimination</h3>

The attackers of the Boy Scouts draw some astounding 
comparisons.  Consider Jon Davidson, Timothy Curran's ACLU 
lawyer:  
<P>
<blockquote>
If the Boy Scouts claimed to espouse anti-Semitism, 
would that excuse exclusion of all Jewish Scout-
masters?  If they stated that they believed that blacks 
were inferior, would they have a 'right' to practice 
discrimination against African-Americans? 
Likewise, Elliott Welsh called the argument that the Boy 
Scouts should be able to exclude the nonreligious "every bit as 
compelling as the argument that because black players were 
excluded from major-league baseball in 1910 they should be 
excluded today."
</blockquote>
<P> 

Let us consider these points one by one. 
<P>

To compare the exclusion of homosexuals to the exclusion of 
Jews and blacks—from any organization—is illogical.  Those 
who object to Jews or blacks joining an organization may not 
rationally assert that what they object to is related to character or 
behavior.  The opposite is true of homosexuals.  To speak of 
homosexuals without addressing sodomy, which is what 
homosexuals do, is as irrational as talking about vegetarians 
without discussing vegetables, which is what vegetarians eat.  It 
is precisely their sodomite behavior that defines homosexuals 
and that the Boy Scouts and the great majority of Americans find 
objectionable. 
<P>

Curran explained his goal as being to secure "the same kind 
of opportunities as everyone else in this country and not be judged 
differently because of whom I love" (emphasis added).   
Understood this way, homosexuality is akin to adultery and 
incest and bestiality.  It is clearly not akin to being black or 
Jewish.
<P>

Nor does the analogy of black ballplayers and atheists work.  
Blacks were excluded from baseball not for what they believed 
or didn't believe, which is related to character and behavior, but 
for their skin color, which is not related to belief or character or 
behavior and which is not therefore a rational category by which 
to discriminate between people.  
<P>

A much more logical analogy to the Boy Scouts' exclusion of 
atheists is the exclusion by Honor Societies of students who don't 
maintain a certain grade point average.  In these cases, the 
exclusion is related to the purpose of the organization.  Not so 
with baseball before Jackie Robinson.  Quite the opposite:  It was 
contrary to the purpose of baseball to exclude talented players 
who could help their teams win games.   
<P>

When asked when discrimination is permissible, Jon 
Davidson answered that it "is only permissible under the 
Constitution when without it the reason for the organization 
would cease to exist."   But this point is in favor of the Boy 
Scouts:  The BSA is a private organization that exists to form 
boys to be "morally straight," "practice wholesome sex 
behavior," and love and serve God and country.  This purpose 
obviously precludes the membership of homosexuals and 
atheists.  
<P>

By seeking in the courts to force homosexuals and atheists on 
the Boy Scouts, its enemies seek to destroy the BSA as now 
constituted.  

<h3>Stands for Diversity? </h3>

Why don't those who are excluded from the Boy Scouts 
establish their own organizations?  Isn't that the American way?  
To found the Gay Scouts or the Godless Scouts of America?  Or 
the Girl Boy Scouts?  No doubt the BSA would only greet such 
news with relief, as its resources could go again to fulfilling its 
mission rather than to paying its attorneys.
<P>

The truth of the matter is that the modern liberal "political-
correctness police" are in the business of limiting choices rather 
than offering more.  What is perverse in their case is that, unlike 
real policemen, they pose and are portrayed by the media as the 
high priests of tolerance and diversity.  For example:  A task 
force of the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area 
recommended that the BSA "adopt a local policy that is in 
harmony with the social diversity, values and spirit of the Bay 
Area."   Ditto Time magazine:  "What is most troubling in the 
Boy Scouts' new emphasis on privacy is the hint that the group 
serves as a retreat for parents who dislike the diverse and 
tolerant world of today."   
<P>
He, of course, knows that the BSA's interest in privacy 
rights is not new; it extends to its origins in 1910.  As for who 
really supports diversity and tolerance, let's be real:  it is not the 
BSA which is suing gays, the godless and girls, but the latter, 
along with the ACLU, who are suing the BSA.
Culture and Politics
<P>

More than 90 percent of Americans proclaim allegiance to 
God.  A similarly huge majority finds sodomy objectionable.  The 
Boy Scout Oath, law, and mission are highly reflective of what 
most Americans hold dear.  It follows that, to a large extent, the 
BSA's status under the law reflects the status of the American 
majority.  In this way we begin to see the culture war as 
inseparable from current political and constitutional con-
troversies in America. 
<P>

Culture reflects the higher ideas, theological and 
philosophical, that unite society and inform politics.  Moral 
precepts drawn from these higher ideas instruct not only the 
mores of society, but the legal code as well.  "Thou shalt not kill" 
is at once a biblical commandment, an expression of the natural 
law of reason, and a positive or man-made law.  Such integration 
of religion's moral prescriptions with the moral tenets of natural 
and positive law went largely unchallenged until the late 1960s, 
when those who now form America's "new class" became hostile 
to American morality and religion.  
<P>

Today it is no exaggeration to say that America's cultural 
elite—another description of the "new class"—is at war with the 
actual culture.  This was clear during the controversy over the 
NEA-subsidized photography of Robert Mapplethorpe.  
Americans' anger at having their taxes used to create and exhibit 
pornographic and sacreligious art was routinely charac-terized 
by the media, academics and "progressive" politicians as 
censorious in the worst sense of the term.
<P>

The BSA has been targeted by modern liberals precisely 
because it promotes the morality that was offended by 
Mapplethorpe—the morality that upholds marriage and sees the 
family as the primary force for the elevation of character and 
thus culture.  Against this the cultural elite touts moral 
neutrality.  As we have seen, though, this "neutrality" is 
deceptive.  It claims to accept every faith and every creed, but 
tolerates no departure from its own relativism.  And to enforce 
its orthodoxy it supports big and intrusive government—
especially government's least accountable, nonelected branches, 
the courts and the bureaucracy.
<P>

From the perspective of the cultural elite, then, the central 
problem with the BSA is not its penchant for exclusivity, but who 
the BSA excludes.  Indeed, the elite itself seeks to exclude 
traditional morality and religion from American society.  

<h3>The Role and Significance of the ACLU</h3>

Coercion is the means of choice of the cultural elite.  It seeks 
to seize the legal arsenal of the state and impose on society a set 
of rules and regulations that run contrary to existing mores.  
Whether the issue is speech codes on college campuses, creches 
on public property, racial quotas in the workplace, male-only 
clubs or mother-daughter dinners, the coercive thrust of political 
correctness is evident.  Its motto is not "Inclusiveness or Bust," 
but "Inclusiveness or Else."
<P>

Since the rank-and-file that constitute the American public are 
not, like the elite, alienated from the traditional American 
culture—since, in fact, they are resistant to radical social 
change—the elite must work its will from the top down, using 
the club of the law.  And no one knows better how to swing this 
club than the American Civil Liberties Union. 

<h3>A New Understanding of Liberty</h3>

In 1920, ten years after the BSA was founded, Roger Baldwin 
founded the American Civil Liberties Union.  At one level the 
organizations have something in common: they are private, 
draw heavily on volunteers, and promote freedom.  The 
overarching difference is in their understanding of freedom.  Put 
simply, the ACLU promotes rights without duties and the BSA 
promotes the two together.
<P>

In the traditional view, there is no contradiction between 
rights and duties.  Both are needed in a free society.  As political 
scientist Francis Canavan has written,
The basic American ideal, in a phrase that the 
Supreme Court regularly uses, is "ordered liberty"    . 
. . .  It is a liberty that exists within and depends upon 
an order of law, of social institutions, and ultimately 
on moral principles that are widely enough accepted 
that we can say that they represent society's 
consensus. 
<P>

A new idea held by modern liberals is quite different.  
According to it, liberty connotes "a radical individualism that 
rejects all social norms and institutions that the individual has 
not agreed to."   Subscribers to this idea defend the right of 
Nazis (who themselves despise the idea of rights) to march 
through Skokie, Illinois but not the right of Skokians and their 
elected leaders to maintain order and defend the dignity of the 
principles and customs they hold most dear.  Likewise they 
support the right of homosexuals and atheists to invade and 
destroy the Boy Scouts.

<H3>The ACLU and Statism</H3>

ACLU activists and their supporters seek to restructure 
American society using the law as their weapon.  Their contempt 
for traditional America is not new:  the ACLU was named as a 
Communist front in the 1930s by Earl Browder, the general 
secretary of the Communist Party U.S.A.   Roger Baldwin spoke 
cynically of feigning loyalty to America as he was launching the 
organization:  "We want to get a good lot of flags, talk a good 
deal about the Constitution and what our forefathers wanted to 
make of this country, and to show that we are really the folks 
that really stand for the spirit of our institutions."   The ACLU 
became a vociferous supporter of Stalin's rule in the Soviet 
Union.   There was a period between 1940 and the mid-1960s 
when the ACLU moved to the center.  But today it is as radical as 
ever.
<P>

The most direct and lasting way the ACLU impacts American 
culture and politics is by lodging lawsuits against private 
associations like the Boy Scouts.  How does this work?
America is divided into state and society, or into public and 
private spheres.  As the state grows in power, the authority 
exercised by individuals in society declines.  As the public 
sphere grows, the private sphere shrinks.  We are used to 
thinking about this give-and-take in regard to the economy, but 
it operates as well in other areas.
<P>

Private associations such as the family, schools, churches, 
businesses, service clubs, and political parties and organizations 
stand or mediate in society between the individual and the state.  
They facilitate the workings of the free market and democratic 
politics.  They form character and transmit culture.  American 
government has traditionally supported them, to the extent it has 
not just left them alone.  Tyrannical states like the former Soviet 
Union seek to subvert and/or control them.  
<P>
The autonomy of these associations is as important to a 
country's political freedom as the free market is to a country's 
economic prosperity.  As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 
Democracy in America:  "The morals and intelligence of a 
democratic people would be in as much danger as its commerce 
and industry if ever a government wholly usurped the place of 
private associations."   This is the ultimate stake in the culture 
war against groups like the BSA.
<P>

When the ACLU wins a case against one of these private 
associations in court, it crows about gaining a right for some 
individual.  But at the same time it has transferred power from 
the association, thus from American society or the private 
sphere, to the state.  In some cases, when a legitimate right is 
involved, this is warranted, e.g., when the state removes an 
abused child from the custody of its parents.  But such 
interventions should be the extreme exception to the rule.  If they 
become customary, the state has superceded the family, to the 
great detriment—not gain—of liberty as traditionally 
understood.
<P>

This reduction of traditional liberty, and its replacement with 
modern liberalism's quite new brand of liberty, is the ACLU's 
goal.  For instance, it holds the view (with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton) that minor children should have standing in court to sue 
their parents.  This would open the family to the same kind of 
arbitrary regulation by judges to which businesses are now 
subject under affirmative action laws—in the name, of course, of 
the rights of children.    
<P>

The ACLU is driven by an atomistic vision of liberty.  It 
envisions solitary individuals, armed with rights and unen-
cumbered by duties.  This vision doesn't conform with reality.  
When we look at society we do not see solitary individuals.  
Rather we see constellations of people in association—in 
families, tribes, cities, churches, businesses, clubs, etc.  These 
groups arise naturally when people are left alone.    
This explains the great paradox of the ACLU:  its atomistic 
ideal is so unnatural that its realization (if possible) would 
require a great coercive power.  Thus it is that an organization 
devoted solely to individual rights seeks in practice the total 
aggrandizement of the state.

<h3>The ACLU vs. the Family</H3>

The ACLU and its modern liberal supporters do not consider 
any one type of family to be definitive.  They believe that 
children can be raised equally well in any sort of social 
arrangement.  This relativistic approach to marriage and the 
family explains why they believe that homosexuals should be 
Scoutmasters.
<P>

The ACLU objects to laws which proscribe adultery, 
prostitution (including street solicitation), cohabitation and 
polygamy, as well as homosexual marriages.  Its New Jersey 
affiliate has advanced a definition of the family that is so broad 
that it includes halfway houses for recovering alcoholics and 
drug addicts. 
<P>

In 1986 the ACLU became the first organization in the 
country to endorse the legalization of homosexual marriages.  
Among the other rights and benefits it has sought for 
homosexuals are foster parenthood, employee fringe benefits, 
insurance benefits, income tax benefits, survivorship, and other 
economic benefits that accompany the hospitalization of a 
spouse.  And its labors have born fruit:  in 1989 New York's 
highest court held that two homosexual men who had lived 
together for a decade should be considered a family under New 
York City's rent-control regulations.  
<P>

In addition to suing the BSA, the ACLU has gone after Big 
Brothers, whose central aim is to provide fatherless boys with 
appropriate role models.  Naturally, like the Boy Scouts, Big 
Brothers reasons that homosexuals do not fit that description.  
Columnist William Raspberry, for one, has taken the sane 
view that homosexuals "could very well destroy an organization 
like Big Brothers."  He notes that between 1982 and 1987 five Los 
Angeles-area Big Brothers were convicted of sex offenses 
involving boys to whom they were assigned.  He concludes that 
we should "draw the line at accepting gay couples as foster or 
adoptive parents and in positions in which the function of role 
model is primary." 
<P>

For both the Boy Scouts and Big Brothers, as for most 
Americans, children are best raised by a mother and a father.  
This arrangement is natural, moral, healthy, and holds the 
greatest promise for happiness.  Society has a manifest interest in 
promoting it.  Likewise those groups in society that supply role 
models. 
<P>

Modern liberals disagree.  The ACLU has successfully 
challenged laws, like one in Florida, that barred homosexuals 
from adopting children.  In 1992 it persuaded a Surrogate Court 
judge in New York to approve the adoption of a 6-year-old boy 
by the lesbian partner of the child's natural mother.     
Despite such victories, the Supreme Court ruling in Bowers v. 
Hardwick, the decision that failed to recognize sodomy as a 
constitutional right, buttresses claims that homosexuals may be 
excluded from positions as role models because their sodomite 
behavior renders them morally unfit.  As we will explain below, 
however, the courts are ultimately undependable when it comes 
to defending American morality.  

<h3>The ACLU vs. Religion</h3>

Given its atomistic vision of freedom, the ACLU and its 
supporters see the relationship between freedom and religion 
(especially monotheism, the antithesis of atomism) as essentially 
inimical.  Thus they intentionally misread the First Amendment 
as guaranteeing freedom from religion, rather than what it 
plainly says it guarantees and what so many have come to 
America seeking:  freedom of religion.
<P>
To get a sense of how far the ACLU would go in purging 
from society all public expressions of religion, consider the 
following list (it is not exhaustive) of practices the Union has 
opposed as unconstitutional:
<P>

<ul>
<li>the tax exemption of churches and synagogues
<li>creches and menorahs on public property
<li>the maintenance of chaplains by Congress
<li>the maintenance of chaplains by the Armed Services
<li>a city employees' Christmas pageant at a local zoo
<li>all blue law statutes
<li>the singing of "Silent Night" in the classroom
<li>Christian anti-drug groups who perform in public schools
<li>all voucher plans and tuition-tax credits
<li>the inscription "In God We Trust" on coins and postage
<li>government census questions on religious affiliations
<li>municipal funding of a platform to accomodate the Pope     
<li>kosher inspectors on the payroll of Miami Beach
<li>a statue of Jesus underwater off the coast of Key Largo
<li>the word "Christianity" on town seals
<li>prayers said in a huddle before a football game
</ul>

<P>
The ACLU's positions on church and state have become so 
unbending that even "strict separationists" like former board 
member and professed atheist Nat Hentoff have been taken 
aback:  "When I was elected to the national board of the 
American Civil Liberties Union some years ago," he wrote, "I 
thought I would be the most anti-clerical kid on that block."  
Three years later he left with a bad taste in his mouth:  "there are 
members of that board . . . who see the separation of church and 
state as so absolute that not a single religious word must be 
allowed to pass a schoolhouse door."   Yet recall:  the ACLU 
customarily defends the most obscene and profane words, in 
schools and everywhere else.
<P>

One of the major reasons given for suing the BSA for 
excluding atheists concerns Boy Scout meetings in public 
schools.  The latter should not be open, opponents say, to 
promoters of religious faith.  The question arises:  Why should 
young atheists and/or Marxists be allowed to meet after school, 
and not young believers in God and country?  
<P>

In 1984 a "Religious Speech Protection Act" was introduced 
in Congress to ensure students the right to voluntarily engage in 
religious speech.  The ACLU opposed it.  Rev. Barry Lynn of its 
Washington Office warned the House Education and Labor 
Committee that the bill would render it "hard to tell the 
classroom from the Sunday school room."   In the end the bill 
gained a majority but fell eleven votes short of the two-thirds 
majority necessary under the special procedure chosen for 
passage.  
<P>

After considerable negotiation an "Equal Access" bill was 
introduced, requiring that if a school permitted one 
noncurricular and student-initiated (i.e., non-school sponsored) 
meeting to occur before or after school, it could not deny other 
student groups the right to hold similar meetings.  It passed the 
Senate by a vote of 88-11, and won in the House by a margin of 
337-77.  The ACLU's Washington office remained warily neutral.  
This wasn't good enough for the national board, which came out 
squarely against the bill.  It was this decision that led Nat 
Hentoff to charge that the ACLU "has become a relentless 
opponent of student religious groups trying to secure their First 
Amendment rights under the Equal Access Act."   
<P>

Wherever there is a nexus, however indirect, between the 
public sector, however broadly defined, and the promotion of 
religion, however broadly defined, the ACLU and its modern 
liberal supporters swing into action.  The state grows more 
intrusive and Americans' natural and constitutional rights fall by 
the wayside.   

<h3>The Legal Case Against the BSA</h3>

"[T]he Boy Scouts are a public accommodation" according to 
ACLU executive director Ira Glasser.   This is the linchpin of the 
case against the BSA.  
<P>

Of course, none of its enemies charge that the BSA receives 
federal or state tax money.  That would appear to make it 
private.  But, they argue, the BSA receives indirect public 
subsidies from the United Way and the public schools, which 
provide free public space for Scout meetings.  (Indeed, public 
schools sponsor 1.1 million Scouts.)  The fine legal question, then, 
is whether every private organization that is allowed to use 
public facilities free of charge is thereby converted into a public 
accommodation and subjected to government regulation and 
control.

<h3>What is a Public Accommodation? </h3>

The most important federal public accommodations act is 
Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It prohibits private entities 
from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion or 
national origin if it can reasonably be shown that such 
establishments function as public accommodations.  This has 
come to mean, essentially, that places like restaurants, hotels, 
movie theaters, and establishments covered by the interstate 
commerce laws cannot discriminate on the basis of race.  
Title II uses the terms "place of public accommodation" and 
"place of entertainment."  According to its legislative history, 
these terms should be interpreted as commonly understood.  
Thus organizations that do not have a physical site are not 
covered.  Boy Scout activities do not depend upon or necessarily 
emanate from particular facilities or locations. Meetings typically 
take place at private homes, schools and churches.  Lacking any 
court finding that suggests that an organization can qualify as a 
"place," the Boy Scouts have not been found to fall within the 
framework of Title II.
<P>

State public accommodation statutes cover more classes of 
persons and, more importantly, define public accommodations 
more broadly.  This is especially true in California—the state that 
delivered the ACLU its victory over the Boy Scouts in the case of 
the atheist Randall twins—due to the uniquely worded Unruh 
Act:
<P>
<blockquote>
All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are 
free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, 
color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled 
to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, 
facilities, privileges, or services in all business 
establishments of every kind whatsoever. 
This was the crux of Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the  Boy 
Scouts of America.  Though the Unruh Act does not mention 
sexual orientation, the California Supreme Court had previously 
interpreted it to prohibit discrimination based upon sexual 
orientation as well as on the categories actually listed. The 
question remaining was whether the BSA constituted a "business 
establishment of [any] kind whatsoever" (a phrase obviously 
much broader than "places of public accom-modation").  The 
trial court ruled that it did not.  The appellate court disagreed 
and reversed.
</blockquote>
<P>

In the preliminary ruling in Curran, Judge Sally Disco 
homilized that to allow the BSA to discriminate against 
homosexuals in the name of "American values" would "send a 
stark message about what the ideals of this country really 
mean."   Nevertheless she ruled against the plaintiff on the 
grounds that the BSA's First Amendment rights took precedence 
over the Unruh Act:  
<P>
<blockquote>
[T]he issue, of course, is not whether the defendant's 
view is correct, or enlightened, or even best 
calculated to achieve the organization's broader 
goals. . . .  The Supreme Court has long recognized a 
right to 'engage in association for the advancement of 
beliefs and ideas.'  The converse, a right not to 
associate, or the right of the group to exclude 
unwanted members, is also recognized. 
</blockquote>
<P>

In overturning Disco's decision, the appellate court acted 
more in accordance with today's judiciary:  it ignored the 
Constitution, relying primarily on a series of cases that had 
interpreted the Unruh Act broadly.  The term "business" meant 
"everything about which one can be employed."  The term 
"establishment" included everything from "fixed locations" to 
"permanent commercial forces or organizations."  And non-
profit organizations had been included.  The BSA was nailed.   
Again:  Outside of California the definition of public 
accommodations is narrower.  In at least four states, courts have 
rejected the idea that membership in an organization in and of 
itself is sufficient to qualify as a "place" for purposes of state 
laws prohibiting discrimination in places of public accom-
modations.  This reasoning was critical in Welsh v. Boy Scouts of 
America. 

<h3>Law and Politics </h3>

The anomaly in the above legal account is the decision of 
Judge Sally Disco:  despite her openly stated opposition to the 
morality of the Boy Scout Oath, she ruled according to the 
Constitution.  It is far more common today for judges to rule 
according to their personal view of what the outcome of a case 
should be.  
<P>

This is no secret.  Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, the 
very model of a modern judge to modern liberals, said the 
following in a major public speech at Georgetown University in 
the fall of 1985:
<P>
<blockquote>
Those who would restrict claims of right to the values 
of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution 
turn a blind eye to social progress . . . .  For the genius 
of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it 
might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but 
in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with 
current problems and needs.  What the constitutional 
fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times 
cannot be their measure to the vision of our time.
</blockquote>
<P>

This reasoning opens the door to that new understanding of 
liberty mentioned above:  not liberty meaning that people are left 
pretty much alone to run their families and their businesses and 
their churches and to participate in other private associations, 
but liberty meaning that government (especially as composed by 
judges and bureaucrats) is left pretty much alone to regulate the 
private sector, according to the politically correct opinion of the 
day.  The converse of this is a new understanding of limited 
government:  not limited government meaning that the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches must stick to the 
powers assigned them in the Constitution, but meaning that the 
American majority must be limited in what it can do by elite 
opinion, operating again through the bureaucracy and the 
courts.  
<P>

Just how far modern liberals have departed from the 
principles of democracy has been pointed out by political 
scientist Thomas G. West:
<P>
<blockquote>
A view of judging that allows justices to consult their 
personal views of "American justice and fairness," in 
complete opposition to the majority, and without 
recurring to the Constitution except as a starting 
point, is nothing more than a return to the state of 
things that existed prior to the emergence of 
democracy in the modern world . . . .  In the medieval 
world, so-called experts unelected by the people—
kings, priests, and hereditary aristocrats—ruled on 
behalf of the majority because the majority could not 
be trusted to rule itself.   
</blockquote>
<P>

Understood in this light, recent attacks on the Boy Scouts 
have little to do with the law and everything to do with politics.  
The same will be true of the outcome of the culture war.  
The battle to defend the Boy Scouts will continue in the 
courts.  But if left on its own there the battle will eventually be 
lost, given the trend in the law schools and among judges to 
dismiss the Constitution and the principle of majority rule.  The 
battle must be won politically if it will be won at all.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h3>Defending the Boy Scouts and America</h3>

Let us recap what is happening:  Powerful groups in America 
are attacking the Boy Scouts of America, primarily because it 
teaches boys to believe in God and to follow a moral code that 
prohibits sodomy.  Strangely, these groups launch this attack in 
the name of rights.  
<P>

These rights aren't the natural rights in the Declaration of 
Independence, which were not open-ended and which clearly 
did not include an unnatural right to sodomy.  Nor are they 
constitutional rights:  As Judge Disco saw with regard to 
homosexuals, and Nat Hentoff with regard to atheists, the 
Constitution is plainly on the side of the Boy Scouts.  In fact, to 
modern liberals, in Justice Brennan's memorable phrase, natural 
rights and constitutional rights are relics of "a world that is dead 
and gone."  The rights in whose name they attack the Boy Scouts 
are new and different.  
<P>

As most Americans are by now aware, modern liberal judges 
have transformed the constitutional and statutory prohibitions 
against unequal protection of the laws based on race into a 
mandate for unequal protection of the laws based on race, i.e., 
affirmative action.  Fewer Americans are yet aware that this 
arbitrary designation of special rights and privileges is now the 
rule rather than the exception in most areas of American life.  
That is, the rights promoted by modern liberals and widely 
enforced by the courts are special rights that attach not equally to 
people as people, but unequally to people as members of special 
groups.

<h3>Does the Majority Have Rights?</h3>

Consider this ironic sidenote:  The ACLU has itself been 
found guilty of violating the very California statute under which 
it sued the Boy Scouts:  In 1987, it was forced to pay damages to 
Richard Long, who was arbitrarily ejected from a public meeting 
of the ACLU when he was identified as an off-duty police 
officer.   The moral is clear:  Because Mr. Long was not a 
member of a special group with special rights—whether 
criminals, atheists, homosexuals, or a racial or ethnic minority—
he was judged by these "civil libertarians" to have no rights.
Just as members of the majority like Mr. Long have no rights, 
the majority as a whole is deemed to have no rights under the 
modern liberal dispensation.  It is now customary for judges to 
tell American majorities that they can't do as they wish, whether 
it is putting convicted murderers to death or keeping 
pornography out of their communities or putting their kids in 
organizations which exclude homosexuals and atheists.
The culture war is being waged in the courts because it can 
not be won through elections.  It is anti-majoritarian.  It is a 
powerful elite minority against the large and increasingly 
powerless middle class.

<h3>Does the Majority Rule?</h3>

In the 1980s, ACLU activist and New York University law 
professor Sylvia A. Law succinctly captured the modern liberal 
vision of liberty.  It is regrettable, she wrote, that "the 
public/private distinction persists in constitutional doctrine" 
because in reality "the distinction between public and private is 
not sharp; it may indeed have no coherent meaning."   This is 
perfectly illustrative of what the culture war means politically.  It 
is also hogwash.  
<P>

In the American Constitution the distinction between public 
and private is very sharp and very coherent.  Government is set 
up to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness from threats foreign and domestic.  That the 
government may not become such a threat, it is limited in what it 
can do.  Within those limits, and through the institutions into 
which government is divided, the majority rules.  This 
arrangement provides for an immense private sector which has 
been the key to Americans' unprecedented personal freedom 
and unmatched prosperity for over 200 years.
<P>

It is important to remember that despite recent and even 
future setbacks, American morality and constitutional rights can 
still be defended.  This is true for a very simple reason:  The 
courts can not continue denying the constitutional rights of the 
majority without the support (whether active or passive) of the 
elective branches of government.  The so-called culture war can 
still be won by electing leaders at the local, state and national 
levels who support the traditional family, uphold freedom of 
religion, believe in limited government, and will appoint judges 
who respect majority opinion and the Constitution.
<P>

"If civil liberties are ever destroyed in this country," Midge 
Decter has written, "it won't be by boys taking oaths but rather 
by people intent on stretching the delicate and complex social 
fabric of this free society beyond its breaking point."   The BSA 
is a pawn in the culture war.  But it represents perfectly what 
modern liberals want to destroy and what Americans stand to 
gain, or save, by defending it.  
<P>

As Winston Churchill suggested in our epigraph, the Boy 
Scouts teach boys "to stand up faithfully for Right and Truth, 
however the winds may blow."  That is what Americans are 
called to do now, for the Boy Scouts and for the best in our 
tradition that the Boy Scouts uphold—the right and true laws of 
nature and of nature's God, the charter of our liberty.

<H1>Property and the Public Good: The Founders' View</H1>
<H3>By Thomas G. West </H3>

<p>
<hr size=4 width=100% align=center>
<blockquote>
<H3>Editor's Note</H3>

<P>
<I>State and local governmental regulations are increasing daily throughout the country.  These regulations often challenge traditional understandings of the institution of private property.  While it is argued that these regulations will defend something identified as in the wider interest of the public, this is not always the result.  Frequently, the property rights of some private person or entity are violated.

<P>
We today tend to look at situations like this as a straightforward contest between the public and the private, between the larger good and the selfish good.  Surely when we all gain something, the interest of only one person ought not to stand in the way.

<P>
This is the common view, but it misses something. It misses the public, as well as the private, purposes for which private property is rightly considered fundamental and unalienable. These purposes resound from the Founding of our country and from the greatest documents in it. 

<P>
In our time, the right of private property is violated in blatant ways and upon a huge scale. Bureaucratic red tape hampers nearly every activity and binds nearly every enterprise.  Officials interfere, and obstacles arise, wherever people seek to use their land productively. The effect of this is to raise costs--for example, the cost of housing--to unprecedented and unaffordable levels in many parts of the country.  

<P>
This does not affect a few people; it affects millions, millions who are not now property owners and who face insuperable obstacles to becoming property owners.  Because of this, we suffer a degradation in the quality of our lives, in our ability to be self-sufficient and therefore self-reliant citizens, in our ability to provide equal opportunity to all our people.  We violate something much more important than efficiency and good economics.  We violate the highest principles of our country.  We do not provide liberty and justice for all.

<P>
In the following article, Tom West restates the ideas behind property rights as they emanate from our Founding.</I>

<P>
The debate over the meaning of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment will continue to miss the point, until it addresses the <I>political</I> importance of the right to property.  The right to private property was central to the founding of America.  The Founders believed that it occupied a vital place in the system of free government they built.  In our time the right to property is widely misunderstood, above all by scholars who do not share the vision of justice that animated the American Constitution.

<P>
Contrary to a common belief, the right to property meant, to the Founders, something better and higher than a protection for established wealth. It was an instrument to defend common people from the power of the establishment.  It was an instrument to protect the security of their own labor and the property it generated.  And above all it was a shield for real merit, wherever it might be found, among the rich or the poor. 

<P>
For anyone familiar with the terms of the colonial debate with Britain during the 1760s and '70s, the omission of property from the Declaration's list of inalienable rights is surprising.  The dispute between Britain and America leading up to the Revolution began with property:  parliament had passed laws "imposing taxes on us without our consent," as the Declaration says.  When the Americans of the founding era listed the rights of man, the usual triad was life, liberty, and property.  Boston's <I>Rights of the Colonists</I> (1772) was typical:  Among the natural rights of the colonists are these:  First, a right to <I>life</I>; secondly to <I>liberty</I>; thirdly to <I>property</I>.1

<P>
We can only guess at Jefferson's and the Congress's silence on the right to property.  Jefferson may have thought that the dignity of the occasion was best served by omitting the low subject of money in the new nation's statement of principle, leaving it implicit in the right to liberty.

<P>
One common misconception can be dismissed easily.  Jefferson did not omit the right to property from the Declaration because he regarded it as less than a fundamental right, as some have said.2  Jefferson was a firm adherent of that right, which he regarded as a part of the right to liberty.  In 1774 he wrote:

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own.  The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time:  the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.3</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Jefferson held this view throughout his life. Forty-two years later he wrote:  

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.4</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Today the subject of property rights makes people wary about the founding.  Protecting property, it might seem, amounts to protecting the right of the wealthy to domineer over the poor.  Does the Founders' view of equality end up cementing in place an invidious class structure?

<P>
On the contrary, the Founders thought the right to property, properly defined, was a <I>protection</I> to the poor.  To be sure, the right protects anyone who already has wealth.  But equally important, in their view, is the protection of the right to <I>acquire</I> property.  The right to property means that those who have no wealth as yet may keep the property they earn.  The Virginia Declaration of Rights names, among the rights of all human beings, "the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property...."

<P>
In the Founders' world, the laws of old Europe, and to some extent even American law, favored established wealth and made it difficult for the poor to become wealthy by their own effort.  Talent and ambition everywhere had to defer to family and arbitrary privilege.

<P>
Under colonial law, the property rights of the wealthy were superior to those of the poor.  "The older claimant's usage [of his land] would be elevated to the level of a property right and a more recent claimant would have to use his land so as not to interfere with the older right."5  Ownership of property "conferred on an owner the power to prevent any use of his neighbor's property that conflicted with his own quiet enjoyment."  This right of established property could be and actually was sometimes used to prevent development of land adjacent to a wealthy man's land.  

<P>
By the nineteenth century it had become clear that, "because this conception of ownership necessarily circumscribed the right of others to develop their land," it was inappropriate to American society and a violation of the rights of the poor.  The older conception of property derived from medieval times, when the law protected the English gentry from competition from upstart artisans and manufacturers.  Feudal law treated existing property relations as rightful and permanent.  The rich were supposed to stay rich, and the poor to stay poor.  Therefore "the anti-developmental doctrines of the [old] common law ...clashed with the spirit of economic improvement."  In the years following the Revolution, "the idea of property underwent a fundamental transformation--from a static agrarian conception entitling an owner to undisturbed enjoyment, to a dynamic, instrumental, and more abstract view of property that emphasized the newly paramount virtues of productive use and development."6

<P>
Under the old common law, for example, it was difficult to build a dam or mill on any public river.  A mill owner could be sued for damages if he obstructed the flow of water, even temporarily, in the operation of the mill.  That rule began to change in the early 1800s.  One judge who held in favor of a mill owner observed that the old common law maxim--"use your own property in such a way that you do not injure another's"--"must be taken and construed with an eye to the natural rights of all."7  He meant the natural right, as stated in the Virginia Bill of Rights, of "<I>acquiring</I>...property."

<P>
Eventually the Founders achieved their goal.  Established wealth that was passed on from one generation of the same family to another gradually disappeared in America.  Money and positions circulated rapidly, as the efforts and luck of each succeeding generation determined their place in society.  Children of the poor frequently rose to wealth, and children of the wealthy often fell back into the mass of those neither rich nor poor.  Irish and Italian, Jewish and Oriental immigrants, who arrived without money or status, and who were often disliked by Americans already living here, produced children and grandchildren whose wealth now surpasses the average wealth of Anglo-Saxon protestants.  Unlike old Europe, the American rich and poor did not develop "class consciousness."  Historically, the poor and middle class have not looked on the rich with destructive envy, but with the confidence that one day they themselves or their children may also be wealthy.

<P>
The trend of twentieth-century law has been toward a return to the feudal approach.  Those who are already well off often support government regulation that makes it difficult for the poor to develop their properties.  Environmental regulation, for example, is often used by existing homeowners to establish barriers to the building of new houses, in order to limit the traffic and pollution that come from new residents.  Government licensing requirements protect those who already own taxicabs from competition from those who would like to drive cabs but cannot afford the medallions.  Zoning laws typically forbid the poor (who cannot afford to buy buildings in commercial areas) from using their apartments and homes for productive purposes.  Big business often opposed President Reagan's deregulation efforts in the 1980s because regulation hobbles would-be competitors.  The latter cannot afford the expensive lawyers and lobbyists that enable long-established businesses to shape regulation to their interests or otherwise survive in the regulatory environment.8

<P>
The danger in such developments is not primarily that the poor remain poor.  Poverty is a condition that people can live with.  A decent and happy existence does not require great wealth.  The greater danger by far is the threat to liberty itself.  Tocqueville anticipated this danger: 

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>[The despotic government of the future] covers the whole of social life with a network of petty, complicated rules that are both minute and uniform....  It does not break men's will, but softens, bends, and guides it; it seldom enjoins, but often inhibits action; it does not destroy anything, but prevents much being born; it is not at all tyrannical, but it hinders, restrains, enervates, stifles, and stultifies so much that in the end each nation is no more than a flock of timid and hard-working animals with the government as its shepherd.9</I></blockquote>

<P>
The protection of the right to acquire property was but one aspect of a larger American purpose:  to make honors correspond as closely as possible to real natural differences among human beings.  Just as the fighter with a chin prevails, and should prevail, in boxing, so those of real merit and ability would face no legal obstacle to thriving in a country that protects the rights of individuals.  Far from lowering the standards of public life, freedom allows true merit to shine.  In the old world, merit too often remained sunk in the obscurity of the low origin of its possessor.<BR><BR><BR>

<H2>The Politics of Dependence</H2>

<P>
To understand the Founders' view of property rights and the rights of mankind generally, consider in contrast a common view of today, according to which human rights are no longer based on human nature.  Franklin Roosevelt called for a "Second Bill of Rights," which included "the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation," "the right of every family to a decent home," "the right to adequate medical care," "the right to a good education," etc.10  For Roosevelt, this call may have been somewhat rhetorical.  His legislative program, at any rate, made no serious attempt to implement such "rights."  More recently, however, Laurence Tribe, a leading liberal constitutional law theorist, plausibly suggests that current legal developments point toward "a constitutional right to a decent level of affirmative governmental protection in...health and housing, work and schooling."11

<P>
Jennifer Nedelsky, a recent scholar who is frank enough to be an explicit critic of the Founders, would replace the natural rights of Madison and the Founders with "human autonomy," which in her understanding not only accepts but fosters dependency on government.  Nedelsky argues, persuasively, that constitutional scholars have been unwilling to face the fact that the new view of rights requires the abandonment of the natural rights theory of the Founders:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The egalitarian vision [of today's liberals] is practically a reversal of this founding conception:  whether the inequality of property is the result of liberty or not, it stands in the way of liberty and justice for all.  </I></blockquote>

<P>
For only the abolition of inequality by forcible redistribution of property can achieve this vision of justice:

<blockquote><P>
<I>[D]ependence is no longer the antithesis of autonomy, but a precondition in the relationships...which provide the security, education, nurturing, and support that make the development of autonomy possible.12</I></blockquote>

<P>
What Nedelsky means is brought out in <I>Harris v. McRae</I>, a Supreme Court case dealing with the right to abortion.  In that decision the Court ruled that the government was not constitutionally obliged to pay for free abortions.  The dissenters from that decision asked, What good is such a right for a poor woman who cannot afford to pay for an abortion?  Justice Brennan wrote:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The Hyde Amendment's denial of public funds for medically necessary abortions plainly intrudes upon this constitutionally protected decision, for both by design and in effect it serves to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children that they would otherwise elect not to have.</I></blockquote>

<P>
Thurgood Marshall's dissent agreed:

<blockquote><P>
<I>If...a funded abortion is unavailable, [poor women] must resort to back-alley butchers, attempt to induce an abortion themselves by crude and dangerous methods, or suffer the serious medical consequences of attempting to carry the fetus to term....  [L]egal abortion is not a significant option for such women.13</I></blockquote>

<P>
In other words, if government fails to fund a right, one cannot be said to have the right.  Extending the argument beyond abortion, it might be asked:  how can one be said to have a right to life if one is too poor to afford a doctor?  What good is a right to pursue happiness without government-funded education from kindergarten to post-graduate work?  How can one pursue happiness if one prefers not to work and ends up poor?  This way of thinking about rights culminates, as Nedelsky openly admits, in the demand for a redistribution of wealth so that all possess sufficient property to secure their "autonomy."  In this view, the only way human rights can be secured is by socialism, or at least by the constant seizure of wealth from those who produce it.  Had the Brennan-Marshall view prevailed on the Court, it would have become unconstitutional in principle to cut back on any aspect of the welfare state.  In fact, it would have given the Supreme Court the constitutional authority to mandate indefinite expansion of government programs redistributing the entire wealth of the nation.

The Supreme Court majority in the Harris decision, says Nedelsky, understood that if there are basic rights that can be enjoyed only with state economic support, we have prepared the way for unlimited incursions on property.14 If every person has a right to plenty, whether he works or not, then necessarily those who work must support those who do not. 

<P>
Nedelsky regrets that the Court failed to repudiate what she calls the "negative liberty" of the Founders.  The Court actually came within one vote of doing so in this case.

<P>
In the new conception of rights, liberty requires much more--and much less--than protection against being injured by others. It requires affirmative action, positive aid from those who have wealth to those who do not.  At the extreme, one scholar claims a global human right to subsistence and basic material needs, which wealthy nations ought to pay for.15  John Rawls has given a sophisticated argument in support of the position that those in need have a moral right to some of the possessions of those who are well off.16  

<P>
On the basis of Rawlsian ideology, today's courts routinely force businesses and governments to pay injured individuals even when they are not responsible for the injury.  In one typical example, a small business was held legally liable for the injury suffered by a car thief, when he smashed up the car he had stolen in an accident that admittedly resulted from his own negligence.  These developments in the law have arisen from the courts' rejection of the individual moral responsibility on which the older understanding of rights rests.17

<P>
In this new view, rights are no longer derived from human nature.  Instead, a new ideal of human autonomy, in which man is liberated from the restraints and guidance of nature, holds sway.  This human autonomy, far from being something that human beings possess by nature, can only be secured on the basis of the conquest of nature by human will.  Rights do not come from man's natural gifts.  They come from an assessment of the current state of society, with a view to maximizing each person's liberation from natural limits.  Rights come from an ideal of human autonomy created by the human will.  The realization of that ideal requires that those who have intelligence, ambition, sobriety, wealth, education, etc., be compelled to support those who do not have the same talents or fortunes.  Rights derive not from what one has in common with other human beings (the same human nature), but from what makes oneself inferior to others--"victimization."

<P>
The rights of human nature, as the Founders saw it, are based on what man is and has by nature--his life, his liberty, and his ability to acquire property and pursue happiness.  For the Founders, a "right to decent housing"--let alone a "right to recreation"--would be nearly unintelligible.  A natural right, to repeat, is a just claim against someone who would deprive a person of <I>what is naturally his own</I>.  No one possesses by nature food, learning, and free access to medical care.  No one possesses by nature the kind of autonomy demanded by Nedelsky.  The lack of such things does not create a rightful claim against others to provide them with food, medicine, free education, or "autonomy."  It does nothing more than leave each person free to provide such needs for himself.  But one <I>is</I> obliged by nature to leave other people alone in their reasonable pursuit of health, education, and property.

<P>
The presumption of the Founders is that normal human beings are capable of taking care of themselves, if only the artificial weight of hereditary privilege and legal restrictions--the legacy of medieval times--is removed.  "The political philosophy behind limited government affirms that nature is more important than nurture:  that humans have a fixed nature enabling them to overcome a background of poverty and deprivation."18

<P>
Just as people have the <I>nature</I> to provide for their own well-being, so they also face the <I>necessity</I> of making <I>themselves</I> good. The Declaration says we have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It does not say we have a right to happiness.  Unlike life and liberty, happiness is not something we possess by nature.  We cannot claim it as a right whenever we are miserable.  Likewise, there is a right to acquire and possess property, but no right to be wealthy.  Everyone has the capacity to <I>acquire</I> wealth and <I>pursue</I> happiness, just as everyone has the capacity to live, be free, and worship God.  To possess a right, even to exercise it, does not guarantee that it will lead to the end desired.  Happiness is earned by talent and effort, or enjoyed unbought through grace or good fortune.

<P>
All human beings by nature do possess life, liberty, the ability to pursue happiness, the ability to acquire property, and a mind that forms opinions by reason and conviction.  These natural possessions, the "property" we all own by nature, are the principal rights of man.  Madison, writing several years later about property, said:

<blockquote><P>
<I>In its larger and juster meaning, it [property] embraces everything to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and which leaves to everyone else the like advantage....

<P>
In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them. 

<P>
He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them. 

<P>
He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them. 

<P>
In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.19</I></blockquote><BR><BR>

<H2>A Return to True Human Rights</H2>

<P>
We conclude that contemporary legal and intellectual trends
<OL>
<LI>Restrict the right to property in such a way as to prevent the poor from developing their property so as to acquire more property; and 
<LI>Treat the poor as unable to acquire wealth by their own efforts, as victims.</OL>

<P>
These two trends reinforce each other.  When we place obstacles in front of the ambitious poor, the claim that the poor are a permanent underclass becomes more plausible.  When we teach young poor people that the cause of their poverty is victimization, not absence of responsibility and work or laws that limit acquisition by the poor, we discourage the effort that it would take to overcome that poverty.

<P>
The changes we have discussed here have real consequences.  The lives of a generation of children have been blighted, and a new generation is growing up in some places in America without even the memory of the older vision of a society based on real equality of opportunity.  Consider this bitter letter responding to a newspaper article on crime committed against children in Detroit:

<blockquote><P>
<I>Detroit's children who are being victimized by crime (page one, Dec. 12) suffer from a lack of moral courage in their parents and leaders. These children are taught that their economic situations are imposed on them from the outside.  If they do not succeed in school, something is wrong with the system.  If they have difficulty getting employment, racism is involved.  If there are no jobs available at the minimum wage, dealing drugs is an acceptable alternative.  Furthermore, they are taught that if there are any solutions to their problems, they will come from city, state, or federal programs.

<P>
The tragedy in Detroit is not just that so many children are being killed and maimed by guns.  The tragedy is that these children are not being allowed to grow up into responsible adults.  Most of them will indeed grow up physically, but they will forever be looking to others as their caretakers.  They will continue to behave as if they have no personal responsibility for the choices they make in their lives, and the cycle of violence and urban decay will continue.

<P>
My family and I moved away from the Detroit area four months ago.  We are happy and relieved to be gone.20</I></blockquote>

<P>
There are remedies for this situation.  Laws that stand in the way of the exercise of the right to acquire property must be removed.  In some cases those laws are unconstitutional violations of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Supreme Court can say so.  Above all we must teach ourselves once again the lessons we have forgotten. Protecting what is private, what properly is earned by each citizen with the sweat of his own labor, is not selfishness.  It is justice. And from that justice flows a capacity for self-government that makes freedom itself possible. That is the true basis of American democracy. 

<P>
The purpose of that democracy is not wealth.  It is, as the Declaration says, happiness.  We understand happiness to mean, for most practical purposes, the decent way of life lived by the majority of Americans throughout our history.  Family, work, neighborhood, responsibility, excellence--these things are rightly prized by most citizens.  It is government's job to enable citizens to achieve them, in part simply by getting out of the way. 

<P>
Every nation--even the Soviet Union at its peak--has laws that protect the right to hold property, at least for some people. The American Constitution is unique, in that it gives that right to <I>everyone equally</I>.  Above all, the Constitution secures the right to develop and use one's property in order to acquire wealth, without having to beg permission of the established rich or of government bureaucrats.  The new system in America, with its excessive and burdensome regulations, harks back to older and darker days. It locks in place an aristocracy of existing wealth. It builds the natural counterpart of the privileged few--the despairing underclass.

<TITLE>Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership</TITLE>
</head>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<center><table border=0 width=85%><tr><td>

<center>

   <H1>About Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership</H1>

</center>

This is to introduce readers to Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, a new project of 
the Claremont Institute.  The project is headed by Dr. Tim Wheeler, a practicing 
physician (a head and neck specialist) in southern California.  The following will 
explain who we are, why we have launched this project, and what we aim to 
accomplish.  

<H3>The Problem</H3>

The right of Americans "to keep and bear arms" guaranteed in the Second Amendment 
is under attack—now more so than ever before in our nation's history.  In any given 
year, one can expect dozens of bills to be presented in Congress, and hundreds more in 
state capitols around the nation.  All have one thing in common: further restrictions—in 
some cases proposing an outright ban—on the private ownership of firearms.

<P>

One of the most persuasive tactics employed by the gun controllers is the argument that 
guns present a threat to public health.  Accordingly, firearms are increasingly discussed 
by some in the medical community in terms of epidemiology.  Medical journals now 
routinely discuss firearms as if they were a type of dangerous bacteria.

<P>

Because these arguments originate with physicians and appear in respected journals, the 
media pass along their claims as undisputed facts.  They have become as well a central 
part of the strategies used by the ACLU and other anti-Second Amendment activists.  
But these arguments are contrary to the truth:  The idea that firearms are a disease to be 
discussed in pathogenic terms defies common sense.  The truth is that privately-owned 
firearms prevent more crimes and injuries than they cause, and are far more likely to 
serve the public interest than not.  

<H3>The Solution</H3>

Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership—a group of physicians, familiar with the use 
of medical statistics and quantitative analysis—has been formed to serve as an antidote 
to those who are twisting science to serve misguided ideological ends.  It will turn the 
tables on those who would control crime by managing the lives of honest citizens, 
directing attention instead to the means of crime control that is suited to a free people:  
that is to say, controlling crime by controlling (i.e. incarcerating) criminals.  

<P>

DRGO in now mounting a full-fledged assault on the poor medical scholarship—and 
the anti-gun bias behind it—that dominates the medical debate on gun ownership.  We 
have already made some headway in this project, most notably in well publicized 
testimony before Senator Howard Metzenbaum and the Senate Judiciary Committee last 
year (enclosed).  We are proceeding with policy briefings, amicus curiae briefs, and 
speaking engagements around the country.  

<P>

A word about organization and personnel:  DRGO is a project of the Claremont Institute 
for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy, a political research 
organization located in Claremont, California.  Dr. Wheeler serves as project director, 
with the help of board of advisors (most of whom are physicians) who oversee its work.  
Dr. Wheeler and the members of the board do the bulk of the writing and speaking; the 
Claremont Institute staff handles fundraising, and the publication, distribution, and 
promotion of our work.  Daniel Palm, Ph.D., a Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, 
serves as Project Coordinator.

<H3>DRGO Needs Your Support</H3>

DRGO has so far accomplished much good with the generosity of a handful of 
supporters.  But it is time to expand our work, and the only way we can do so is with 
support from our members.  We have become a nationwide organization with nascent 
influence—and now is the time for action.  Membership rates are as follows:  $100 
Sustaining membership, $500 Patron, and $1000 Presidents Club.  Please make your 
check payable to The Claremont Institute, noting that the contribution is to support 
DRGO.  The Claremont Institute is a 501 (c)(3) charitable organization, and all 
contributions to it are tax-deductible.  Contributors will receive all DRGO policy papers, 
fact sheets, amicus curiae briefs, copies of press clippings, and regular updates on 
activities.

<P>

Palm at the following email addresses:

<H1>Effective environmentalism uses a new shade of green</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>GALLATIN GATEWAY, MONT.--  Last week, 17 federal judges gathered at the Gallatin Gateway Inn.  This inn, the last of its kind, was built by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad to attract tourists en route to Yellowstone National Park.  The judges met to hear policy analysts explain a new environmentalism.  </P>

<P>Gallatin Gateway is a perfect setting for meetings.  It's on the geographic margins between Yellowstone National Park and Montana's &quot;Big Sky&quot; country, and on the cultural margins between the new and the old West.</P>

<P>The lecturers were diverse, but a coherent new vision emerged from their training and their shared desire to protect the environment while respecting other values.  The unifying theme was the rejection of top-down, command and control environmentalism.  All favored more flexible, decentralized approaches.  Guest lecturers came from academic institutions, such as the <A HREF="http://www.puaf.umd.edu/Faculty-Staff/nelson.html">University of Maryland</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cc.colorado.edu">Colorado College</A>, and the private sector, like <A HREF="http://www.battelle.org">Battelle Institute</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>.  </P>

<P>The first speaker, Lynn Scarlett, Vice President for Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and a Board Member at the <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/gallatin">Gallatin Institute</A>, set the tone for the conference.  She introduced a &quot;new environmentalism&quot;.  This new shade of green emphasizes the importance of incentives and the imperatives of dispersed information.  The value of market coordination and decentralized decision making is critical to guiding environmental reform.  </P>

<P>Ms. Scarlett led the judges through multiple cases of toxins and pollutants like NOXs, VOCs, and SO2.  For that churning cauldron of sludge, she sees no grand &quot;solutions&quot; to environmental woes -- only trade-offs.  The hundreds of pages in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will not contain &quot;the answer&quot;.  Instead, she claimed, complex and confusing regulations contain the ingredients for error and confrontation.</P>

<P>She described a recent example where <A HREF="http://www.hispanic.org/coors.htm">Adolph Coors Company</A> in Golden, Colo. voluntarily conducted a self-audit of its environmental impact.  The 17-month audit which cost Coors $1.5 million discovered previously unknown emissions in the brewing process.  These emissions were not covered by environmental regulations but far exceeded all of the company's other emissions.  When Coors disclosed this information as a step to obtain permits (which would have been required if environmental quality were the goal), the Colorado Department of Health and the Environment fined Coors more than $1 million for their troubles.  The message of these incentives was perverse: don't be a good citizen -- hide, don't divulge.</P>

<P>This story tells us a lesson.  Antagonistic environmental regulators stifle voluntary cooperation for environmental ends.  Nearly half of the companies recently surveyed by Price Waterhouse expressed reluctance to conduct self-audits because they feared possible punishment.  Slapping fines on firms that investigate their environmental impact, at their own expense and initiative, will effectively deter environmentally sound business practices.  Poorly designed regulatory schemes thwart environmental gains.</P>

<P>Voluntary activities like Coors' clearly foster environmental quality.  Since 1988, Coors has lightened its bottles, cans, and packing by 21% and reduced its contribution to landfills by 850,000 tons.  In 1994 alone, Coors re-used 964,359 tons of packaging materials.  And they saved money in the process.  As the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD">President's Council on Sustainable Development</A> recently reported, &quot;Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive.&quot;</P>

<P>Coors' environmental innovations came in spite of the punitive orientation of state and federal agencies.  Lynn Scarlett reminds us of the critical importance of incentive compatible environmental enforcement.  Coors' observation that &quot;voluntary initiatives are more effective than mandated actions because they create flexible solutions, foster innovation and promote collaboration rather than adversarial relationships&quot; merits the close attention of reformers.</P>

<P>Another speaker at the conference, Felix Romero, told a compelling story about old values of the West.  His story takes us just down the road from Golden, Colo. to a small village of <A HREF="http://www.rmii.com/slv/sanluis/sanluis.htm">San Luis</A>, Colo.  A Spanish land grant dating from the Mexican-American war settlement of 1848, the community owned the valley land in common until the Taylor Ranch cleared title for the land in the 1970s.  With the loss of community property, San Luis' livelihood is threatened by ecological degradation upstream on the Taylor Ranch and by the increasing pressures on what little land they retain.  To remedy this, the La Sierra Foundation of San Luis is attempting to buy the ranch and return property rights to the community.</P>

<P>The new West is one of protected spotted owls, subdivisions, and clashing values.  Each of these forces combine to threaten the rich heritage of Mr. Romero's community.  A strong and sustainable future demands that our &quot;new environmentalism&quot; finds a place for their traditions and practices.  The alternative is subdivided ecosystems, clearcut mountainsides, and dislocated farmers.</P>

<P>The conference brought disparate yet coherent voices to federal judges concerned with environmental values and legal traditions.  The speakers advocated a new paradigm, a different shade of green.  They emphasized property rights, market processes, and responsible liberty as key components of an effective environmentalism.</P>

<P>The judges realize that their role is to interpret the law, not to champion innovative policy changes.  They recognize the need for political entrepreneurs, people with the intellects and statures of U.S. Sens. like <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/senator/bond.html">Kit Bond</A> or <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~bradley/">Bill Bradley</A>.  Such leaders can encourage opportunities for harmonizing our environmental and economic goals.  They would find great support from the many Americans who value environmental quality, responsible liberty, and modest prosperity.</P>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<H1>Liberating National Parks from Political Dependency</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>"By establishing a nonprofit trust to manage the Presidio's property, it gives us a blueprint for national parks that one day will be able to sustain themselves without government funds,"</FONT> President Bill Clinton announced last month.
</P>
<P>
He was in part referring to legislation he signed which turned over management of the Presidio National Park in San Francisco to the Presidio Trust, a quasi-independent public trusteeship charged with making the park sustainable (in the green and in the black).
</P>
<P>
Clinton was also referring to a new chapter in the history of public lands management: public, nongovernmental trusts.  Since the early 1980s, a few scholars have argued for public endowment trusts to run our parks.  These places are too precious to be spoiled by politics.  In 1982, a colleague and I wrote "Endowment Areas: A Clearing in the Policy Wilderness."  In 1984, we proposed park and wilderness management by endowment trusts as "the opportunity to link conservation with fiscal conservatism."  In 1988, I asserted in the <I><A HREF="http://wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A></I> that, "to achieve ecological integrity in the parks, we need to buffer them from transitory political forces" using nonprofit conservation managers.  And, just this last July in the <I><A HREF="http://www.seatimes.com">Seattle Times</A></I>, I again urged employing trusts to "ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics."  Was somebody listening?
</P>

<P>
Public, nongovernmental "trusts" present sensible alternatives.  Endowment boards, like those running museums, hospitals, and private schools, would operate under a legal charter to steward individual parks.  After receiving a one-time Congressional endowment, each park's individual trust would be "on it's own".  The board, established by local environmental groups, business leaders, and citizens, would promote ecologically sensitive economic activities as part of their trustee responsibility.  Creative mechanisms such as a "Friends of Mt. Ranier" program could entice membership, dues, and democratic feedback from park lovers everywhere.  Park trusts would free our parks from their precarious dependency on national politics, encourage long-term planning, and reintroduce accountability in management.
</P>

<P>
Other innovative policies are being discussed.  Park supporters are beginning to see that the only way to ensure the long-term health of our parks, both financially and ecologically, is to make them dependent on their users and supporters -- not Congressmen in Washington or political appointees.  Some advocate charging businesses that using parks' features in their advertising, ending decades of free lunches for Madison Avenue.  Others advocate charging market prices for recreation in the park, and then letting the individual parks keep the bulk of the revenues.  Park managers would then have the incentive guarantee their park offers what the public wants, protected from politicians plundering their budget.  They would nurture the parks' highest values: scenery, preservation, recreation, and heritage.
</P>

<P>
No system is perfect, and some failures are expected.  Not all parks created by Congress truly deserve that label.  Parks like Steamtown (Penn.) and the Presidio face monumental challenges in paying their own way and proving their unique value.  The Presidio Trust hopes to make the park self-sufficient in 15 years.  This means cutting costs and finding $25 million in annual revenues to offset the federal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
But the reality of politics and parks probably won't let that happen.  First, the Presidio Trust isn't independent of the government.  The Park Service can still undertake construction on the land -- and it plans a whopping $611 million in improvements.  More subsidies to the Trust permit it to borrow from the U.S. Treasury and use the Justice Department's legal services.  Politics enter the fray because Clinton appoints the Trust's board members rather than having them elected by at-large supporters.
</P>
<P>
With subsidized rents, the costs of running the Presidio as a glorified office park may simply be too high.  Office rentals today cover just one-tenth of the park's operating budget, and recreation fees on the 740 undeveloped acres are unlikely to cover the rest.  When Trustees complain about the required restoration work, can Uncle Sam resist coming to the rescue?  If a waiting list for renters forms, we predict that politically "correct" groups like the Thoreau Center for Sustainability will go to the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that American politicians have the discipline and restraint to permit the Presidio to sink or swim on its merits.  However, the Omnibus Parks bill puts us on the learning curve.  Persistent failures, like the ecological and political problems so common with the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> (elk overgrazing, fire buildup, decaying infrastructure and buildings, radical simplification of ecosystems, etc.), demand alternatives to the political Park bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
There is a compelling need to divorce the national park system from federal budgetary politics.  Clinton declared that our parks should "be able to sustain themselves without government funds," and he pledged to "put our national treasures beyond partisan politics and put the people of America, their future and their environment above that."  Fiscal conservatives and environmentalists alike can support this movement and cheer our progress in harmonizing sound ecological and economic ideas.

This special issue of FREE Perspectives is focused on "managing the commons."  
<BR>This anticipates FREE's upcoming book of the same name, published 
<BR>by Indiana University Press.  Co-contributing editors John A. Baden and 
<BR>Douglas S. Noonan bring the classic literature on the "tragedy of the commons" <BR>together with recent insights to the theory and practice of managing the commons.  <BR>The book builds upon the twenty years of scholarship that has evolved since <BR>Garrett Hardin and John Baden originally produced Managing the Commons in 1977.  
<BR>Look for the second edition of Managing the Commons in 1997.</B></I>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT"  Vspace= 8 HSPACE=12 WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=151 ALT="John Baden" SRC= "/free/Images/John.gif"> The <I>Tragedy of the Commons</I>  is probably the world's best-known commentary on the political economy of natural resources.  
<BR>Garrett Hardin, its author, linked ecology and economics, our environment and our institutions.  The key insight is straightforward and profound:  tragedy strikes the commons when self interest andsocial interest diverge.  For example, without social constraints, a strictly self-interested rancher would overgraze his cows on the commons at the expense of the community.  A 
fundamental problem of social organization is to design effective, efficient, 
and resistent constraints.  It's a never-ending task.
<P>
The logic of the commons is evident throughout the world.  Ocean fisheries, 
national parks, and ground water are examples of commons.  Overexploited 
fisheries exemplify this tragedy of the commons.  Similarly, congestion in 
national parks arises from individuals taking advantage of unmanaged 
(and underpriced) access, even when the optimal number of visitors is 
much lower.  Highway rush hours also display classic symptoms of the 
commons tragedy.
<P>
Recent discussions have turned to more esoteric examples of commons.  
Computer processing capacity may be a commons for network users.  Users 
will demand processor energy because the cost to them is negligible, but 
too many individual requests will overload the system.  The national 
budget is a commons of sorts, where individual interest groups vie for 
greater benefits, even if it's over-allocated and we are running a deficit.  
Opportunistic politicians view government as an engine of plunder.  They 
see elections as struggles for the levers that control the flow.
<P>
Managing the commons is a persistent and pervasive challenge because: 
(1) implementing long-enduring management institutions is difficult, and 
(2) continual innovation leads appropriators to new common-resource 
pools.  Innovative technologies and entrepreurial ingenuity create new 
resources and make previously marginal ones profitable.  In avert to the 
tragedy, management institutions must evolve around the newborn 
resources.
<P>
One particularly complex, abstract, and problematic commons involves 
biological-evolutionary resources.  Consider the human capacity to resist 
disease.  Mankind's increasing resistance to environmental pathogens is a 
very valuable resource to society as a whole.  For instance, as a gene pool 
evolves a resistance to smallpox, its members benefit immensely.  The 
biological process of developing resistance, however, necessarily remains 
at least one step behind the pathogen.  The resistance is reactive.  This 
means that individuals are frequently adversely affected by the 
beginnings of epidemics before resistances are developed.  When 
individuals become infected by a life-threatening pathogen, their rational 
alternative is medical technology.  Today we seek "magic bullets" in the 
form of antibiotics.  
<P>
But this individual benefit imposes social costs.  The use of some antibiotics 
and anti-malarial drugs cause pathogens to evolve in a very short period 
of time.   The pathogens respond with ever-greater resistance; their 
version of armor.  Eventually, they can pose a growing threat.  Our 
resistances and drugs are considerably less effective against the "super-
pathogens".  Like ranchers putting too many cows out to pasture, the 
common "resistance" of society is degraded as some individuals benefit.
<P>
Another example of the "biological-evolutionary resource" commons 
relates to agricultural pesticides.  Spraying DDT in small quantities once 
had remarkable success.  Insects, however, have notoriously short 
reproductive cycles.  This allows micro-evolution to quickly reduce the 
usefulness of DDT and other pesticides.  Thus, in a very, very short period 
of time, increasing dosages were required to achieve constant results.
<P>
The pesticide-resistant bugs reflect a commons logic.  Any farmer can 
benefit in the short term from spraying.  But pesticides eventually create 
super-pests.  This divergence in interests, between the individual and 
society, is the key to the tragedy of the commons.
<P>
Bio-engineering increasingly poses another example of a new commons.  
Genetically altered crops like corn and cotton have been bred with 
resistance to pests, a resistance that could save farmers billions of dollars 
in crop losses each year.  But bio-engineered crops, like pesticides, may 
hasten the evolution of super-pests.  The emerging science of "resistance 
management" aims to optimize yield from these crops by diluting super-
pests with "unresistant" pests and other techniques.  It remains to be seen 
if the science of behavioral ecology and the restraint of farmers are 
sufficient to avert another potential tragedy.
<P>
The biological-evolutionary weakness of mankind's predators is a tricky 
common-pool resource.  Biological dynamics imply that the attributes of 
mankind's biotic enemies always change while our technology always lags.  
Often, the benefits of self-restraint, of not using high doses of antibiotics or 
pesticides, would be gained by future generations.  It is naturally very 
difficult to design institutions that value the varied and unknowable 
interests of the distant future.
<P>
This issue of <CITE>FREE Perspectives</CITE> introduces classic and new problems of 
"managing the commons". First, <A HREF="/free/FP/TragedyCommons.html">Hardin</A> and <A HREF="/free/FP/EconomicsEcologyExchange.html">Robert Taylor</A> each introduce 
the nature of the commons.  Following that are thoughts from the <A HREF="/free/FP/ViewfromAirlie.html"><CITE>View 
from Airlie</CITE></A>, a ground-breaking examination of <A HREF="/free/FP/ConservationPerformance.html">community-based 
conservation</A>.  They discuss the relationship between the community and 
public-owned resources.  <A HREF="/free/FP/NationalisationofLand.html">Matt Ridley</A> also examines the importance of 
secure property rights and the pathologies of state-encroachment on 
property.  Lastly, <A HREF="/free/FP/CostsofInnovation.html">Douglas Noonan</A> explores the role of entrepreneurs as both a 
trigger of and a solution to the "tragedy of the commons" in fisheries.  In sum, these essays clarify the dangers of the unmanaged commons and offer insight into some possible solutions. <center><img WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=163 src="Cows.gif"></center>

<H1>Wolf and Man in Montana</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden

<p>
<P><CODE>DATELINE:  ENTERPRISE RANCH, GALLATIN VALLEY, MONTANA</CODE></P>

<P>Our ranch lies in the northern reaches of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.  Calving has started, lambing will shortly follow, and soon we'll put the livestock out to range.  And wolves have just arrived in Yellowstone Park.</P>

<P>In Montana, and in Idaho as well, few issues are more complex and emotional than those concerning wolves.  For three generations people vilified, mythologized, and killed wolves.  More recently, many environmentalists, myself included, have sought to restore this ancient predator to Yellowstone Park and wilderness areas.  Returning the wolf replaces an important part of the ecological tapestry that humanity has unwoven.  But, given people's divergent values, it is not surprising that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) recent reintroduction of the gray wolf has fostered great fears and extravagant hopes.  </P>

<P>The controversy surrounding reintroduction is demonstrated by the 170,000 public comments received on the project's Environmental Impact Statement.  Lawsuits opposing reintroduction have been filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation and the American Farm Bureau Federation.  They indicate significant rural resistance despite widespread public support. </P>

<P>But wolves are already returning to Montana.  Seventy five arrived naturally, migrating from the Canadian Rockies.  Like glaciers of the last ice age, they are slowly expanding southward.  They are drawn by the dramatic increases in ungulate populations, primarily elk and deer, created by clear-cutting in public and private forests.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service's decade-long effort to reintroduce 100 wolves into the Greater Yellowstone area and central Idaho (which contains the largest unroaded wilderness in the lower 48 states) accelerates a process well underway.  </P>

<P>Wildlife biologists consider wolves one of the easiest species to manage.  Established wolf packs stay in well defined and fiercely guarded territories.  Thus they have low population densities and are easily located.  Wolves are also afraid of new things and tend to avoid them.  And if there is any doubt about who holds the upper hand in human-wolf coexistence, we might remember that wolves, once one of the most broadly distributed large mammals in North America, have been exterminated wherever they competed with man.  A decade ago, only remnant populations existed in wilderness areas or at the sufferance of humanity.  </P>

<P>With careful management, humans and wolves can coexist.  Even with 75 wolves in northwestern Montana, only two cow calves were killed last year.  None were killed in 1993.  Like members of religious groups, wolves learn what is appropriate to eat.  At Nine Mile Ranch near Missoula, wolves live with livestock and deer.  The trick is to keep them from learning to eat livestock.  At Nine Mile, radio collars allow researchers to monitor the animals' locations.  If a wolf kills livestock its punishment is swift and harsh:  It is shot with a tranquilizer gun and transported far away.  The trauma usually dissuades the wolf from future livestock predation.  Second offenses are punished by death, lest a problem animal teach others the joys of beefsteak and lamb chops. </P>

<P>The trials of Nine Mile Ranch hold another important lesson:  Coexistence requires experience, intensive management, and ongoing effort.  Reintroducing wolves is not a magical, effortless restoration of fairy tale ecosystems.  Yes, wolves will restore some balance to an ecosystem burdened by destructive numbers of deer, elk, and buffalo.  Without predators and Indian hunting, these animals are over browsing the land and eroding its beauty, diversity and health.  Nevertheless, wolves bring difficulties of their own.  </P>

<P>In spite of biologists' confidence in their ability to manage wolves and environmentalists' enthusiasm, ranchers and residents in the reintroduction areas have legitimate fears.  Wolves pose both a practical and a symbolic threat.  They do attack livestock and pets.  They also represent a shift in control of Western lands orchestrated from Washington, DC.  In short, people fear that the costs of this exercise in nostalgic ecotopianism are unfairly concentrated on their families, their stock, and their land values.   </P>

<P>Nor are their fears groundless.  On January 30, a few days after the release of the first 25 wolves, a dead wolf and a dead calf appeared.  The wolf was shot after eating the calf.  But this was no surprise, the Fish and Wildlife Service's environmental impact statement predicted wolves will kill several dozen cows and sheep each year, and several hundred elk and deer.</P>

<P>To address some of these concerns, Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group, has created a fund to compensate ranchers whose stock is killed by wolves.  But these funds are neither limitless nor eternal.  They do not cover lost pets, reduced opportunities for hunting, or the hurt associated with losing an animal to the brutal rending of a wolf pack.  To minimize these effects, ranchers should be free to shoot problem wolves and otherwise deter them from developing a taste for cattle and sheep. </P>

<P>Restoring wolves is a worthy project that reflects well on our evolving sensitivity to nature.  We are now wealthy and educated enough to afford such magnanimity.  But it will be hard.  Pretending these problems away is irresponsible.  It is also poor environmental policy to ignore ecological realities.</P>

<H2>Resource Politics Miss the Forest for the Trees</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John Baden and Pete Geddes</P>

<P>BOZEMAN, MONT.-  Snow is still ten feet deep on the Spanish Peaks just south of town, but summer is coming to the Gallatin Valley.  Greening fields and the sudden emergence of kayaks and mountain bikes tells us the annual crush of tourists will soon arrive in the region's national parks and forests. </P>

<P>Recreation is serious business in Montana. Locals aren't pleased with the U.S. Forest Service's latest proposal to sell timber in Bozeman's backyard.  The Forest Service plans to sell 4.7 million board feet of timber from the Gallatin National Forest, which borders Yellowstone National Park.  If the sale goes forward, approximately 1,175 18-wheelers full of dead trees will roll down Hyalite Canyon, one of the most heavily used recreation areas in the state. </P>

<P>The Forest Service first tried to offer this sale in 1990.  Planning proceeded until a 1995 judicial injunction stopped it.  But the Forest Service offered the sale again under a legal provision called the Salvage Rider, an amendment to the 1996 budget designed to speed the harvest of dead trees.  The Salvage Rider insulates sales like this one from citizen appeals and mandates the Forest Service offer almost 5 billion board feet of &quot;salvage&quot; timber this year.</P>

<P>The Hyalite sale exemplifies how Congress misses opportunities to harmonize sound economics with ecological values.  Freshman Republicans, who claim to favor markets over bureaucracies, instead require command-and-control agencies to mandate flows of commodities.  The laws treat Forest Service officials as if they are commissars of a socialized factory producing trees.  And Democrats offer nothing more constructive than the standard orthodoxy of &quot;improved&quot; regulation and oversight.</P>

<P>The Gallatin National Forest is one of the nation's premier recreation areas.  The Hyalite sale faces massive local opposition over aesthetic, economic and ecological concerns. As in typical, this sale will cost taxpayers far more than the timber is worth; even the agency's creative accounting describes the sale's profitability as &quot;marginal.&quot;</P>

<P>Increasingly, the highest economic use of national forests lies in recreation rather than commodity production.  In the Gallatin National Forest according forest economist Randal O'Toole, of the Oregon-based <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>, it costs taxpayers $50,000 per year to maintain a single timber-related job.  Mr O'Toole found that the recreation industry directly employed 1,200 people; timber jobs only 50.  By requiring the Forest Service to sell goods at far below their true costs, Congress undermines the region's natural transition from a commodity-based to service- and information-based economy.  What's more, government &quot;dumping&quot; of cheap timber makes the market unpredictable for private-sector commodity suppliers, reducing their incentive to manage land responsibly.</P>

<P>Such policies represent the last gasps of Progressive Era resource management identified with Teddy Roosevelt.  His well intentioned but naive idea that benevolent centralized bureaucracies would protect the nation's natural resources and provide a measure of economic stability has proved a failure.  </P>

<P>In 1905 Roosevelt's boxing buddy, Gifford Pinchot, created the Forest Service to protect vast tracts of Western lands.  The agency developed the image as a tough white-hat in a still untamed region.  Pinchot promised efficient, responsive and scientific management; the agency still poses as the model of bureaucratic efficiency.  But over the next 90 years the Forest Service mutated from a small, idealistic bureau of scientific managers into a growth-addicted agency intent on protecting and perpetuating its own budget and power.  Well intentioned and hardworking professionals are caught in a pressure cooker of conflicting values: central planning, changing social values, strict environmental regulations, new ecological science and an increasingly amenity-based Western economy.</P>

<P>In today's West the irony of the Progressive legacy is starkly clear.  Remote bureaucrats, allied with subsidized production interests, establishh mandates both insensitive to local values and insulated from market processes.  The results devastate both communities and ecosystems.  Meanwhile, Western senators and representatives, addicted to subsidies,  perpetuate the myth that the region is a land of rugged individualists.</P>

<P>It's time for the Forest Service to abandon its role as a producer of commodities.  Instead, the agency should focus its considerable expertise on the protection of wilderness and wildlife and the promotion of recreation and research in national forests.  Commodity production is best left to the private sector.   Rethinking Progressive Era approaches to natural resource management challenges politicians of all stripes.  Successful reforms must encourage harmony between ecology, sound economics and responsible liberty. These intellectual foundations are well established.  The politician who builds on them will earn the mantle of conservationist, in the best tradition of TR.  </P>

<H1>Lessons in a Supermarket</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Ramona Marotz-Baden

<p>
     Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, contains a
modest supermarket that offers valuable lessons.  This store has
tens of thousands of items of various sizes and brands, generic
labels, and bulk products.  Competition for the consumer's dollar
occurs among this and other stores, brands within the store, and
different products within individual brands.

<p>
     Among the stores in Bozeman, as elsewhere, the shopkeepers
compete in offering differing mixes of service and economy.  Each
grocer seeks to attract and satisfy consumers holding varying
degrees of wealth, economic sophistication, nutritional
knowledge, and body-type preference associated with differing
food groups.

<p>
     Competition responds to differing consumer preferences for
health, economy, convenience, and vanity.  In these stores we see
people as diverse as ranchers who survived the dust bowls of the
1930s, refugees of the counter-culture of the 1960s who look like
they are in a time warp, Park City blondes from Dallas summering
at Big Sky, and neo-Spartan hedonists of all ages who bounce
among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain
trails.  We find them all in Albertson's at the University Mall.

<p>
     Individuals representing all of these types shop cheek to
jowl, sample ice cream and fajita strips in the aisles, and
peacefully shuffle through the check-out lines at the supermarket
located between the Bonanza Steak House and Yogi's Vegetarian
Bakery.  Stores and suppliers who fail to satisfy are passed by
in favor of those who offer more attractive products.

<p>
     In this setting offered by a free and open market system,
each can satisfy his wants without imposing his preferences on
others.  In this manner, diversity, freedom of choice, and
innovations are all encouraged.  In this imperfect world, we can
hardly ask for anything more.  Yet, there is another huge
advantage we normally take entirely for granted.

<p>
     Surely the store in the mall provides a model for
efficiently responding to diverse and rapidly changing
preferences.  But this efficiency, marvelous though it is, is
only the minor miracle.  The benefits of harmonious interaction
fostered by market exchange in accordance with the rule of
willing consent is the greater benefit.

<p>
     Market exchange, subject to willing participation by fullfacultied 
individuals, permits people with radically differing
views to peacefully coexist.  In Bozeman there are a substantial
number of hard-core vegetarians.  They can shop peacefully and
amicably with rancher and logger meat-eaters who consume
vegetables only as a concession to their health.

<p>
     Bozeman is also a national center for teetotaling SeventhDay 
Adventists.  The supermarket accommodates their preference
for nonalcoholic wine, and they shop harmoniously with those
whose nightly ritual includes a bottle of French wine.  This
peaceful interaction occurs only because all transactions are
voluntary.  Imagine the uproar if the decisions to permit the
selling of wine were determined in the political arena!

<p>
     Nearly all analysts who have seriously studied the free
market agree that the market promotes efficiency, diversity, and
innovations which respond to consumers' changing preferences.
Few, however, appreciate the degree to which private property
rights and free exchange foster harmony and peace.  This set of
social arrangements renounces coercion as a means for making
choices.  These arrangements enable people who feel strongly
about such issues as vegetarianism or prohibition to coexist
constructively with people holding antithetical views.

<p>
     What if the stocking of a grocery store were determined
politically?  Think of the fights between vegetarians and meateaters; 
the teetotalers and those who enjoy wine with dinner; the
granola organics who argue against pesticides and the farmers who
find chemicals useful; the populists who are strongly opposed to
corporate agriculture and those with an interest in these firms;
employed mothers who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be
closed on Sunday.

<p>
     Fortunately, most of these decisions have been kept out of
the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their
consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the
force of law.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the
predictable results of a free market economy.

<H1>Taking the Folly Out of the Act</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan
</P>

<P> 	Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Regulations that generate poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P>

<P>	Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could freely use their land, even if endangered species habitat was harmed.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P>

<P>	While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences. The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species without compensation.  Even the Armed Forces during wartime cannot do this.  The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights protects us from being forced to shelter soldiers by requiring the military to pay its way.  Landowners get compensated when Green Berets invade, but not when spotted owls do.</P>

<P>	Forcing landowners to maintain habitat has made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P>

<P>	We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P>

<P>	They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P>

<P>	In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1,560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pay taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P>

<P>	Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevents them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P>

<P>	The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.  </P>

<P> [see chart data as appearing in <CITE>Different Drummer</CITE>]</P>

<P>	The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P>

<P>	Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P>

<P>	&quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P>

<P>	Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P>

<P>	Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P>

<P>	Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co. agreed and found dens for wolves.  As a reward, the Defenders of Wildlife paid them a cash bounty.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P>

<P>	With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species. </P>

<H2>Al Gore's Newest Horror Story</H2>

<P>As appearing in <CITE>The American Enterprise</CITE>, July/August issue.</P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>



<P><CITE><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> </CITE>  portrays a frightening world where synthetic chemicals assault our fertility, intelligence, and survival.  But instead of delivering substance, it capitalizes on hype.  It hit bookstores just in time for Earth Day and on the heels of the National Academy of Sciences' investigation of synthetic estrogens.  Thanks to the big behind-the-scenes boost given to the book by Fenton Communications-the same PR firm that ginned up the 1989 Alar-on-apples scare-the book received coverage in nearly all national media, and backing from hip cultural figures like Robert Redford.  </P>

<P>The book's message is dramatic, urgent, and personal:  In a terrible &quot;Faustian bargain,&quot; we have bought technological progress at the price of the environment, the well-being of our children, and perhaps even our survival.  Touted as a &quot;scientific detective story,&quot; the book combines suspenseful narrative and apocalyptic overtones into a real page-turner.  Ambiguous prophecies of &quot;fates worse than extinction,&quot; of terrible forces that are &quot;slow, invisible, and indirect,&quot; are bandied about darkly.</P>

<P>The villains are chemical manufacturers and profiteering corporations.  Synthetic chemicals, the authors say, are disrupting human hormones and causing widespread developmental abnormalities.  The authors suggest that synthetic chemicals could potentially be responsible for nearly every prominent social ill.  Poverty, educational breakdown, crime, homosecuality, deteriorating family life-these may all be the fault of corporations like DuPont and Dow Corning.</P>

<P>Actually, hormones disruptors are poorly understood, and there is no conclusive evidence linking developmental problems and environmental chemicals.  The science behind <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  is also unorthodox.  It indicts causality and other basic tools of the scientific method that have been used to challenge envirnomental claims.  Indeed, it rejects the scientific method itself as Enlightenment arrogance.  That kind of thinking, the book argues, is what got us into this mess in the first place.  A new wave of thinking, &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; is now required.</P>

<P>This brings to mind the debate over global warming.  Problems in human reproduction and development, like climate change, can only be reliably observed over long periods of time.  Links between plastic lining in beer cans and illiteracy are about as tenuous as links between chlorofluorocarbons and the 1996 blizzard in New England.  But the authors are very clever.  They display short-term tragedies and augur long-term catastrophes.  So none of their claims can be disproved in the near future.  </P>

<P>The marketing appeal of the synthetic chemical scare far surpasses that of global warming alarmists.  It is racy and anecdotal:  Synthetic chemicals affect our sexuality; they are so prevalent no one can escape them.  Painful, personal experiences pile up.  One couple's dreams of a family are ruined by DES, another sees their children's future spoiled by DDT, a third is rendered infertile by declining sperm counts.  Al Gore, who wrote the introduction for this book, invokes children three times.</P>

<P>Fortunately, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  Reputable responders trash the book for all manner of scientific and logical flaws.  And after repeated wolf-calling, the public has become more jaded and cynical about predictions of ecological catastrophe. </P>

<H2>Flying Blind or Running Scared?</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.LibertySoft.com/liberty"><CITE>Liberty Magazine</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>

<P>	In its foreward, Vice President Al Gore announces that <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> &quot;raises compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  The book has been promoted as the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>, Rachel Carson's 1962 book that spawned much of the environmental movement.  More likely, it marks the end of an era of gullibility, hysteria, and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and rhetoric are becoming pass&eacute;.</P>

<P>	The book was written by Theo Colborn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a journalist.  Their &quot;scientific detective story&quot; - provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot; - alleges that synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, Tide, etc.) disrupt hormones.  These hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, they claim, ranging from domestic violence to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  The cure?  Ban them.</P>

<P>	The book's timing was perfect.  The National Academy of Sciences had just convened to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrived on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day - and just as Congress was being taken to task over environmental issues.  It had a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It was, and is, a PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>	Yet it's flopping.  It has been thoroughly trashed by the <A HREF="http://www.nyt.com">New York Times</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com">Los Angeles Times</A>, Washington Post, and Washington Times for all manner of flaws, including panic-mongering, junk science, and poor writing.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> falls into a trap common to conventional environmentalism:  it ignores trade-offs.  Abandoning the 100,000-plus chemicals that play a role in the 45% of the world's economic activity would be extraordinarily costly.  The authors demand &quot;eliminating the use and release of hazardous compounds,&quot; setting standards to protect those most vulnerable, reducing the numbers of chemicals on the market and in given products, using only easily detectable and well-understood chemicals, and phasing out synthetic chemical manufacture.  Such &quot;broad government action&quot; doesn't come cheap.  Mandatory monitoring and disclosure laws for chemical manufacturers, water companies, grocers, and distributors will ultimately impose sizable costs on consumers.</P>

<P>	Implementing <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>'s recommendations would close off many valuable opportunities.  Immense benefits to food production and delivery systems would be lost.  The benefits of plastics, medical drugs, and synthetics would cease to be available.  According to Dr. Lorenz Rhomberg of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, &quot;a crash program of [hormone disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.  This could divert regulatory and research attention away from other, true causes of breast cancer, birth defects, and wildlife toxicity.&quot;  These lost opportunitites would be costly indeed.</P>

<P>	Costs alone do not invalidate a policy option, of course.  The costs and benefits of any policy must be acknowledged and reconciled.  We know that reckless proliferation of synthetic chemicals may bring reproductive ruin to affected wildlife.  Conversely, a ban may bring unbearable costs to economies and ecosystems worldwide.  Competing interests must be reconciled.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> fails to do this.</P>

<P>	Except once.  The authors do make an exception to their absolutist position when they acknowledge that breast-feeding is a primary source of contamination.  Breast-feeding &quot;exposes infants to disturbing levels of chemical contaminants ... levels ten to forty times greater than the daily exposure of an adult.&quot;  </P>

<P>	So the prime culprit in &quot;stealing our future&quot; is the sacred practice of breast-feeding.  It is easy, trendy, and politically correct to recommend organically growing one's own foods, avoiding animal fats, and giving babies unpainted toys.  It is not acceptable to bash breast-feeding.  In a rare instance of prudence, the authors write, &quot;We know too little to judge how the undeniable benefits of breast-feeding balance against the risks of transferring hormonally active contaminants.  While we have great concern, it is premature to advise women against breast-feeding.&quot;  The authors would do well to consider trade-offs in all their recommendations.</P>

<H3>Pseudoscience and Pseudo-Rights</H3>

<P>	Sifting through the morass of conjecture, innuendo, and propaganda in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is nearly impossible.  Its backwards methodologies and hysterical biases betray what might be valuable evidence.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> rejects classic ideals of scientific proof for failing to address the alleged hormonal threat.  Out with hypothesizing explanations for observations; in with &quot;eco-epidemiology.&quot; The weight of the evidence now depends on &quot;value judgments&quot; such as &quot;how much risk we are willing to entertain.&quot;  Of course, value judgments can't be disproven.  They are sovereign decrees, not testable hypotheses.</P>

<P>	Colborn, a leader in &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; tells us that chemicals, unlike people, must be judged guilty until proven innocent.  Basic logic dictates that one cannot prove a negative.  Unicorns may well frolic in the forest.  We cannot disprove that possibility, because someone can always claim we haven't looked hard enough.  Conversely, we could readily prove it if we saw them.</P>

<P>	Similarly, a presumption of chemical guilt places the burden of proof on chemical manufacturers, even though proving that their chemicals don't disrupt hormones is logically and technically impossible.  One could always claim that the manufacturer hasn't looked hard enough.  No harm to the first generation doesn't prove no harm to the second, or third, or tenth.  The infinite combination of varying chemicals, circumstances, and levels of susceptibility render the task absurd.</P>

<P>	Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers also offer a declaration of inviolable rights, starting with &quot;children have a right to be born chemical-free.&quot;  This epitomizes the book's irresponsible and naive rhetoric.  They authors do not identify who has the responsibility for guaranteeing those rights.  The judicial system is responsible for ensuring a right to due process.  Who can have responsibility for &quot;chemical-free births?&quot;</P>

<P>	To be born free from synthetic chemicals, the authors tell us, requires that mothers are themselves free from chemicals.  This requires &quot;that women minimize the consumption of animal fat from birth until the end of their childbearing years.&quot;  They must also avoid exposure to plastics, pesticides, and detergents.  Little girls playing with painted or plastic toys as infants, the authors note, may be violating their future children's right to chemical-free nativity.  </P>

<P>	Obviously, this &quot;right&quot; is for bumper stickers, not serious analysis.</P>

<P>	Another unequivocal right advocated in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is the &quot;right to know&quot;what chemicals are in one's food, water, and other consumer goods.  This is echoed by Al Gore, who writes, &quot;All of us have the right to know and the obligation to learn.&quot;  </P>

<P>	In practical terms, this &quot;right to know&quot; is an exceedingly expensive entitlement.  Its costs would first be brone by chemical manufacturers and distributors.  The costs would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher price tags and burdensome instruction manuals detailing the biochemistry of lettuce and businesswear.</P>

<P>	The authors want us to pay for this right by imposing a duty on manufacturers and distributors, because they have deeper pockets.  In this, they neglect the superior power of market forces.  With proper incentives, competition - not mandated disclosure laws and high transaction costs - will drive the market to satisfy customer preferences.  If the consumers really want to know, they can purchase that knowledge like they purchase organic lettuce.  And lettuce producers will find ways to communicate that knowledge flexibly, effectively, and inexpensively via certification.  The market rewards those who please customers.</P>

<P>	To be fair, there is one useful prescriptive message of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>: the admonition that we move beyond &quot;the cancer paradigm&quot;.  Too much research has been driven by the cancer scare of the 1970s, the War on Cancer, and hype over cancer rates.  In a way, our past experience with cancer helps explain why this book takes such a hysterical tone.  The politics of funding research pushes money toward trendy scares.  The mysterious role of natural and synthetic estrogens in the development of animals and humans does needs explaining, and a prudent, cautious, and scientific response to the important questions of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is definitely in order.  A &quot;War on Synthetic Chemicals&quot; is most definitely not - but the success of the War on Cancer, in attracting funding if not in curing cancer, speaks volumes about why Colborn and company might call for one.  </P>

<H3>Flying Blinded</H3>

<P>	Modern chemistry has brought benefits to society too numerous to list.  But this better living has had its costs.  </P>

<P>	DDT and CFCs prove that not all good things go together.   When DDT first arrived, Paul M&uuml;ller won the Nobel Prize for his seemingly miraculous chemical compound.  As Silent Spring and recent history have shown, DDT is not unambiguously wondrous.  It carries severe consequences for much wildlife and some humans.  Chlorofluorocarbons, similarly, were heralded as &quot;one of the safest substances ever invented.&quot;  Half a century passed before CFCs were blamed for imperiling life on this planet.</P>

<P>	So technological progress, while beneficial, is neither free nor without risks.  Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers take this observation much farther.  They find civilization plunging arrogantly into the future with &quot;dangerous ignorance&quot; and risky &quot;hubris&quot;.  The risks and realities of progress have always existed, they admit, but the scale of mankind's impact now encompasses the entire Earth.  The stakes have become too high.  The risks and trade-offs of advancement are now intolerable.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> claims that we are, in essence, &quot;flying blind&quot; towards our destiny.  What do we do when we see a dark, nebulous shape ahead?  Will we race through it, hoping it is a cloud and not a mountainside?  Will we slow down?  Or will we &quot;land the plane as quickly as possible&quot;?  The technophobic authors embrace the last option.  Phase-outs, bans on new chemicals, and safer ways to &quot;meet basic human needs&quot; are &quot;the only way to opt out of the experiment.&quot;  </P>

<P>	We are flying blind to the future, and the authors want off the plane as soon as possible. They long for an idyllic past, when synthetic chemicals didn't exist and mankind only satisfied its basic needs.  But renouncing modernity and stifling progress will mean taking away most of the twentieth century's benefits.  It takes a much more convincing argument than <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> to cajole a full plane to land, just because someone with a window seat sees a cloud and feels some turbulence.  Responsible analysts and policy makers will advocate policies based on sound science and the broad interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of crisis entrepreneurs.</P>

<H1>A Green Campaign Speech for a Better Environment</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
Some day, a politician will offer reforms harmonizing environmental quality with responsible liberty and modest prosperity. This niche in our political ecology is vacant. Incentives to fill it have been weak.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is rapidly changing. Republican representative Sherwood Boehlert of NY said, "There were some valuable lessons learned by some who ignored environmental policy at their own peril." Celinda Lake, a Democrat pollster, explained in the past election, "the environment played a very important role". The incumbents who were defeated came from suburban and upscale districts. She notes: "The environment played a very heavy role in those districts."
</P>
<P>
But the candidates haven't yet caught up to the electorate. Democrats prefer "Nanny State" solutions to community conservation. Al Gore's learning curve for effective, efficient, and equitable environmental policy seems as flat as a pre-Galileo Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, despite their 1994 "revolution", favor the exploiters and extractors. Dole was linked to ethanol-subsidy addict Archer Daniels Midland. Congress members including Helen Chenoweth and Tom DeLay bulldozed their favored corporate interests over environmental values. And Jack Kemp couldn't even pronounce the E.P.A.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are beholden to entrenched special interests. It seems elephants can't forget to plunder, and asses can't learn new ways.
</P>
<P>
Ross Perot's Reform Party doesn't even mention the environment. The upstart "Green Party" even with Ralph Nader, America's most famous professional agitator, won only 2.4% of California's vote. And <A HREF="http://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</A> candidate Harry Browne did great on Internet polls, with a landslide in Cyber-America. But, like Perot, Browne's platform ignored environmental topics.
</P>
<P>
Here is a green campaign speech, available to all candidates. It's provided to candidates from all parties. Longer versions are available in FREE's "Green Blueprint for America," and a shorter version is found in "The Candidate's Guide to Environmental Issues" by Joe Bast of the <A HREF="http://www.heartland.org/">Heartland Institute</A>.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=8><CAPTION><CENTER><H3>THE GREEN SPEECH</H3></CENTER></CAPTION>
<TR>
	<TD><P>
"I believe in protecting the environment. I believe in conservation and preservation, in parks and wilderness, in using, enjoying, and stewarding our natural environment. We all have a duty to make this world a safer and cleaner place.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our progress in improving the environment. Since the first Earth Day, air is cleaner, water is cleaner, and many animals are rebounding. Lead emissions have virtually disappeared and water quality, especially in the Great Lakes, has greatly improved. The bald eagle and peregrine falcon have made dramatic recoveries.
</P>

<P>
"We can do better still. Problems of disappearing habitat, ineffective regulations, and new pollution require innovative policy tools. The easy solutions have already been implemented. Next, we must address insensitive and inefficient public lands management, unnecessarily high regulatory costs, and unintended consequences of environemental mandates. We need a new environmentalism for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"My environmental vision sees a safer and cleaner world. Its foundation is sound science rather than hysteria. Citizens are demanding policies that deliver the biggest "bang for the buck." Policies that fail to respect people's liberty and property will fail. We must, however, recognize that, at times, rights conflict. Is my clean air worth your job? My cheap power, your salmon? We can't avoid such trade-offs. Here are seven principles that will help us wisely and fairly achieve a better environment.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
"<B>1. Demand sound science:</B><DD> Too often, crisis entrepreneurs create hysteria in order to drive their policies and increase their own budgets. Peer-reviewed science is critical to reform.
<DT>
"<B>2. Prioritize risks:</B> <DD>Our resources are limited, so we must get the most for our money. Cost-benefits analysis can help prioritize risk and first address the greatest risk to our health and to our environment. We want the most environmental benefit for the least cost.
<DT>"<B>3. Decentralize decision-making:</B> <DD>Command-and-control, one-size-fits-all, centralized planning falsely assumes that all communities are identical. This approach stifles creativity and wastes scarce resources. Distant bureaucrats can't manage local environments with sensitivity or efficiency. Letting locals make decisions encourages innovation, learning, and responsibility. But locals must recognize regional and national interests.
<DT>"<B>4. Carefully privatize some public assets:</B> <DD>Commodities should be produced by private interests who anticipate and respond to market signals. Amenitites should be preserved and made available by public trusts. The federal government should monitor and conduct research, not manage and redistribute to the well-organized. Bureaucracies tend to foster waste, corruption, and short-term political calculus.
<DT>"<B>5. Respect property rights:</B> <DD>The Constitution requires due compensation when government takes or restricts private owners' property. When government is used as an engine of plunder, the plundered usually react. Unjust environmental policies build enemies of those whose cooperation is vital, like farmers, ranchers, and forest owners.
<DT>"<B>6. Hold polluters accountable:</B> <DD>Courts can and should hold polluters responsible for the damage they cause. Let them scramble to find appropriate technology.
<DT>"<B>7. Promote prosperity:</B> <DD>Demand for environmental quality is like that for BMWs, foreign travel, and gourmet food; it increases with education and income.
</DL></P>
<P>"The American public is committed to environmental quality. We've made much progress in that direction. To do more, we need to promote prosperity, secure property rights, and responsible freedom. These are values worthy of America's heritage and a bridge to a greener future. Thank you for your vote next Tuesday."

<H1>Environmentalism Needs A Free Press</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The First Amendment of the Constitution safeguards that most essential feature of democracy: the liberty to communicate ideas and advocate alternatives to the status quo.  It protects freedom of the press, speech, assembly, and religion.  It guarantees our right to complain to and about the government.  
</P>
<P>
Environmental advocates use these freedoms to champion reform.  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace </A> has taken the right to assemble to an artform in their protests and demonstrations.  The litigious <A HREF="http://www.nrdc.org/nrdc">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund flourish with lawsuits against lethargic or misguided government agencies.  The paganism of <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/orgs/ef/">Earth First!</A> depends on freedom of religious expression.  Vibrant environmentalism requires free press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
But environmental advocacy prompts censorship by government agencies and private interests.  On the "left coast" this fall, two Eugene <CITE>Register-Guard</CITE> employees were arrested and their notebook, comeras, and film confiscated after the <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</A> closed the Warner Creek salvage timber sale site amid vocal protests by environmentalists.  According to managing editor Jim Godbold, "We think the issues raised by the arrest and confiscation of our material at Warner Creek are serious enough injuries to the First Amendment that they deserve to be heard in a federal courtroom."
</P>

<P>
The Forest Service is notoriously heavy-handed with its censorship, manipulation, and denial of information.  USFS forester Jeff DeBonis created <A HREF="http://www.afseee.org/">AFSEEE</A> (The Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics) in response to repeated Forest Service suppression of information.
</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> likewise censors and impedes outside investigations.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> recounts obstruction, inexplicable omissions, and other chicanery on the part of the Park Service.  It took a court order to force the Yellowstone Institute, an "independent" organization chaired by the then-president of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</A>, to add this challenging book to the visitor centers' publications.  Those advantaged by the status quo colluded to hide it.
</P>

<P>
Honest assessments are difficult to come by because, as Chase says, "The usual fate of whistleblowers kept many officials silent, and the threat of losing their prerogative to study in Yellowstone frequently inhibited university scholars."  That's exactly what happened to Professors John and Frank Craighead.  Before their highly critical research could be completed, the world's grizzly experts' Yellowstone cabin, with all their data, mysteriously burned down.
</P>

<P>
The need to protect whistleblowers is not limited to public lands agencies.  In June of 1996 the Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving landfill user fees, that independent government contractors, like government employees, are "protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory action" for failing to follow the agency's "party line".  According to Justice O'Conner, "[The threat of retaliation against contractors] may chill speech on matters of public concern by those who, because of their dealings with the government, are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work."  Threats to environmental whistleblowers are widespread.
</P>

<P>
Take the case of Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/">Washington State University</A>.  After he testified against expanding the subsidies of the Columbia Basin Project, State Senator Tub Hansen reportedly met with the dean of the School of Agriculture to have Whittlesey's tenured position eliminated.  When that failed, Hansen then tried to make Whittlesey's salary as a line item in the state budget so it could be eliminated in committee.  Speaking truth to power is hazardous duty.
</P>

<P>
In popular press, we can also see political interests shackling free speech.  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A> environmental reporter Keith Schneider was among the most prominent writers to be removed from his post for honest reporting.  He bucked the envrionmentalist orthodoxy by writing about trade-offs to environmental regulations and cleanup, and quickly found himself out of work.
</P>

<P>
And then there is Gregg Easterbrook, author of <CITE>A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism</CITE>.  He notes that his personal popularity plummetted after publishing the book:  "My book was blistered by enviro lobbies....  Wham!  I had hit the Al Gore glass ceiling."

Another "green-listed" author was Tom Wicker, a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> columnist.  Last February, John Flicker, head of the <A HREF="http://www.audubon.org/audubon/">National Audubon Society</A>, demanded that Wicker's article be pulled from the Society's <CITE> Audubon</CITE> magazine because it criticized the Clinton Administration.

<P>
Protecting First Amendment rights empowers environmental reform.  When federal agencies control information, abuses of authority often follow.  Environmental orthodoxy and bureaucratic expediency often trump honest and free reporting.  
</P>

<P>
If the environmental movement is to motivate innovative and scientifically sound reform, we must encourage dissenters to speak and be vigilant in keeping government agencies from controlling information.  
</P>

<P>
The alternative is to quietly slip towards an Orwellian nightmare with government as the "Ministry of Truth".  Too melodramatic?  Take a look the California EPA's recent "record retention policy":

<H1>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P>
<P>
A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P>
Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P>
Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P>

<H1>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>

<P>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>

<P>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P>

<P>
Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>

<P>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>

<P>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle.  
</P>

<P>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P>

<P>
A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>

<P>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>

<P>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.

<H1>Using a Green Thumb to Hitch an Internet Ride</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Deep ecologists urge us to "return to nature".  If we reconnect with nature in a primitive, spiritual way, we may spare mother earth.  Reject science, technology, and the market for small-scale, Edenic lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
I like their goals of environmental protection and sustainability, but their means are dangerously misguided.  A "return to nature" will increase our dependence and consumption of natural resources and our ecological footprint.  
</P>
<P>
In the real world, environmental quality must harmonize with economic progress and sustainable growth.  Entrepreneurs catalyze this harmony by innovating new and better technologies, business practices, and institutions and arrangements.  They distance mankind's activities from nature, leaving more room for both.  
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs often convert industrial waste into useful products.  In the last century, logs were "boomed" into rafts and floated to mills.  Some of the best, most dense old-growth sunk to the bottom of waterways.  Superior Logging Co. is planning to "harvest" 30,000 of these logs from the bottom of Lake Superior.  Company founder Scott Mitchen says, "We're not endangering any spotted owls.... This wood is totally PC.  Any environmentalist has got to love it."  
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Patagonia makes plastic trash into fabric for clothing.  Profitable recycling industries across the nation reduce our dependence on virgin natural resources.  A Vancouver, BC firm has invented a process to dispose of organic garbage (which accounts for 80% of an average American's rubbish) by superheating it into a fuel that, when burned with coal, produces low-pollution power.  Their eco-friendly enterprise relieves pressures on landfills, sanitizes coal power plants, and scores profits.
<P>
The Pacific Northwest is a prime example of how distancing ourselves from the environment can protect nature.  Now, more Northwesterners write software than log trees.  And, some privately owned forests are effectively modelled and managed with computers -- increasing productivity and reducing acres cut.
</P>
<P>
"Cyberfarms" exemplify entrepreneurial innovation fostering environmental quality and economic progress.  One pioneer in this field, <A HREF="http://www.ashtech.com">Ashtech Inc.</A>, operates from Belgrade, Mont.  They help precision farmers use satellite-based Global Position Systems (GPS) to receive essential agricultural data as they drive combines, fertilizer trucks, and spray rigs over their fields.  GPS information tracks variations in elevation, soil composition, weather, and productivity -- down to the square foot.  Cyberfarmers can then make minute adjustments in seeding, fertilizing, and irrigating their fields.
</P>
<P>
Precision farming helps improve crop yields, producing more food on less land.  In addition to being more productive, cyberfarmers have a "green" thumb. With GPS technology farmers no longer need to uniformly blanket their fields with pesticides, water, fertilizer, and other potentially environmentally damaging inputs.  Rather, they can target specific amounts to the areas where they'll be most beneficial.  They save money by reducing chemicals, fertilizers insecticides, herbicides, and water.  High-technology farming can help meet the growing demands of a hungry planet by reducing our use of the land itself.
</P>
<P>
"Cybercommuting" enables us to tread more lightly on the earth as workers ply their trade from home.  Improvements in telecommunication technology enable people to transmit projects and ideas instantaneously across long distances and develop "virtual offices".  Why drive into the office?  Shoppers can buy their fall wardrobe by phone from the <A HREF="http://www.landsend.com">Lands' End</A> catalog, have their <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><I>Wall Street Journal</I></A> delivered via email, or buy their next book from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">"Amazon.com"</A> on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Cybercommuting and the telecommunications revolution have enormous potential for reducing pollution, resource consumption, and environmental impact.  Technological progress makes possible new, environmentally friendly ways to work by decreasing costs and increasing productivity.  Concurrently, environmentally sensitive commuting and communicating leads to economic progress.
</P>
<P>
These entrepreneurial success stories imply an environmnetalism nearly opposite that of conventional environmentalists.  Rather than "return to nature", we must "decouple" ourselves from nature.  Divorcing economic growth from natural resources gives nature room to adjust and repair.  The decoupling also promotes the prosperity so strongly linked to environmental sensitivity.  Richer is not only healthier and safer (more nutritious foods and fewer occupational hazards), richer is also ecologically more sound.
</P>
<P>
Economic development increasingly comes from innovating technologies and business practices -- not exploiting more natural resources.  Entrepreneurs catalyze these developments.  By encouraging "green" entrepreneurs, we foster low environmental impact.  When green thumbs grow better crops with satellites or hitch a ride to work on the Internet, creative resources help nature.
</P>
<P>
We can learn from cyberfarms and cybercommuters.  Both harmonize economic progress with environmental protection.  They ignore or reject the "return to nature" dictum.  They generate economic progress through innovations with benign environmental implications.  Environmental policy will improve when environmentalists recognize that environmental protection increases with such economic prosperity.  
</P>
<P>
The first rule of policy analysis is simple: not all good things go together.  Fortunately, some do.  The task for the policy entrepreneur is to find responsible and sensible alternatives to regulations which stifle entrepreneurial success.

<H1>Entrepreneurs Harmonize Economies with Ecology</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> Let's celebrate our most creative laborers -- the entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs have been neglected by economists and ignored or derided by environmentalists.  Environmentalist Al Gore sees entrepreneurial innovation as &quot;alchemy of a very dangerous form&quot;.  Economist Mark Casson notes that economic modelling &quot;leaves no role for the entrepreneur.&quot;  The economics discipline has become ever more abstract and mathematical.  Economists are selected for their sophistication in math and statistics, not their understanding of how the world works.  They have no way of modelling the creative uncertainty of entrepreneurs.  Hence, economics neglects them.</P>

<P>This is too bad, because everyone works for love and money and no one gets enough of either.  It is indeed unfortunate that entrepreneurs aren't at least appreciated if not loved for they are the catalysts of progress and change.  They seek opportunities to create value--but the values sought need not be measured in dollars.</P>

<P>We find successful entrepreneurs in the environmental and human service contexts but more would be welcome.  They created Habitat for Humanity, the <A HREF="http://www.rmef.org">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A> and Eagle Mount (a Bozeman organization providing skiing, horseback riding and other outdoor activities to disabled children). </P>

<P>Here's one way entrepreneurs affected the wood products industry.  Just twenty years ago approximately 40% of the logs brought to mills ended as waste.  Processing and disposing of the unusable wood cost labor and money and resulted in pollution.  Teepee burners converted nearly half of each log into disposable wastes, toxic by-products, and sulphurous air pollution.</P>

<P>Radical environmentalists used such examples to advocate a &quot;return to nature&quot;.  They rejected capitalism, science, technology, and economic progress.  Mankind should break the shackles of urban decay and industrial blights like the paper mills, and become hunter-gatherers and organic farmers, living in peace with the land.  Their romantic solution ignores the power of the entrepreneur to bring economic progress and environmental improvement.  The next chapter in the timber mill story illustrates this.</P>

<P>Since the 1970s, entrepreneurial innovation has transformed forest products into a leaner, cleaner industry.  Entrepreneurs found value where waste and pollution once dominated.  They effectively processed the once unusable fiber into valuable goods like particle board.  Entrepreneurial energies created value while by reducing industrial impact on the environment.  The teepee burners were closed and industrial waste became useful products.  Today, less than 5% of wood rolling into timber mills is wasted and pollution has been cut 80 to 90 percent.</P>

<P>This entrepreneurial success story reveals a solution antithetical to radical environmentalism.  Bringing the masses closer to nature will make them more reliant on natural resources, like trees, soil, and rivers.  This primitive, decentralized dependency will lead to increasing, not decreasing, environmental pressures.  Professor Martin Lewis writes in his book, Green Delusions, &quot;If we were all to split wood, the United States would be a deforested, soot-choked wasteland within a few decades.&quot;</P>

<P>Alternatives to improving environmental quality require tapping entrepreneurial ingenuity and harmonizing our economies with our ecologies.  For example, copper mining once faced dual problems: massive pit mines scarred the countryside and a global copper shortage seemed imminent.  Now, pit mining is in decline and copper is abundant, because entrepreneurs found a better way.  They found sand.</P>

<P>To meet the demands of the the Information Age, entrepreneurs discovered and implemented a substitute for copper in the form of sand-based fiber optics.  A fiber optic cable made of 25 kilograms of sand can transmit the same information as a cable made from 1,000 tons of copper.</P>

<P>Such progress pinpoints the key entrepreneurial role.  Today, soft drink cans require only a fifth of the metal that they needed in 1975.  We adopt stronger metals, better energy efficiency, and smarter designs as entrepreneurs move up learning curves.</P>

<P>Entrepreneurs are also important in the policy arena.  Groundwater in the Los Angeles basin is valuable.  After World War II, the race to pump water from the West and Central Basins jeopardized the water supply.  In her study of groundwater management, Dr. Elinor Ostrom emphasizes &quot;how public entrepreneurship can be used as a strategy to transform the structure of incentives facing those jointly using a [natural resource]&quot; into effective, sustainable solutions.  Public entrepreneurs devised arrangements where water pumpers manage themselves to conserve the resource.</P>

<P>The growth of service industries in America, the Information Age, miniturization and the search for &quot;green technologies&quot; all point to a future where economic progress includes environmental protection.  Many perceptions of the old &quot;growth versus nature&quot; trade-off are false.  With institutions that provide regulatory stability and secure property rights, ecology, liberty, and prosperity become complements, not competitors.  We can hope that some year a political entrepreneur will understand these possibilities and mobilize reform. </P>

<H1>Conquest of the Columbia Carried Tremendous Costs</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P>Some books change our thinking about institutions long taken for granted. Marc Reisner's <CITE>Cadillac Desert</CITE> explained how Western water flows uphill toward political payoffs.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> exposed the politics which trump both science and economics in our national parks.  They herald fundamental reform by publicizing the gaps between intentions and results.  They show how agencies created to promote the public interest become part of an iron triangle of special interests.  The beneficiaries become accustomed to the arrangements and view them as entitlements and a way of life.  </P>

<P>Blaine Harden's new book, <CITE>A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia</CITE>, describes such a situation.  The series of dams throttling the Columbia River and its tributaries delivers approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of water each year to 4,000 farmers in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project.  The average Project Farm has received a taxpayer subsidy of at least $2.1 million in the irrigation infrastructure.  The government also guarantees electricity to Project farmers at one twenty-seventh the wholesale price.</P>

<P>Cheap power entices farmers to pump water to their crops, sell excess water to their neighbors, generate electricity from the water flowing through their irrigation canals, and then sell that electricity at market rates.  Ninety percent of the cost of a profitable farm in the Project is borne by taxpayers and electricity consumers elsewhere in the country.</P>

<P>Of course, Project farmers love this system; &quot;The more water they suck out of the river, the more profits they have.&quot;</P>

<P>In the Colmbia Basin, federal hydroelectric and irrigation programs from the New Deal have transformed once-arid farmland into a bountiful region producing alfalfa for Japanese cattle and 80% of America's fast-food french fries.  </P>

<P>In Harden's words, the Columbia &quot;was killed more than sixty years ago and was reborn as plumbing.&quot;  The river where Lewis and Clark encountered &quot;verry bad&quot; whitewater rapids is now operated to mimick a lake sufficiently placid and stagnant for hydroplane races.</P>

<P>Special interests tranformed the Columbia into plumbing.  According to historian Donald Worster, the Columbia was killed by dams and reborn as money.  Hydroelectric dams mean big money to farmers, utilities, electricity consumers, the federal Bureau of Reclamation, and barge operators between Portland and Lewiston, Ida.  New tourist and recreation industries, like windsurfing the Gorge, are inextricably tied to the river.</P>

<P>The federally subsidized conquest of the Columbia had its costs.  Indian tribes lost their culture, their land, and their river.  Today, 60,000 commercial fishing jobs are in jeopardy.  And taxpayers still foot the bill.  The last, and perhaps most pivotal, victim is the endangered salmon, for the conquest of the Columbia has decimated the region's wild populations.  Over a quarter of the Northwest's salmon stocks are extinct, and half are endangered.</P>

<P>We can learn from Harden's stories:  First, to restore the Columbia and its salmon, we must understand the diverse special interests surrounding the river.  And second, subsidies and powerful centralized government action create special interests and institutionalize and channel their support.  The result is overexploitation of both the environment and the federal budget.</P>

<P>Harden repeatedly demonstrates the effects of the &quot;iron triangles&quot; in the Columbia.  An agency embarks on a public works project, private groups organize to collect those benefits, and they in turn support politicians who continue funding the agency's projects.  </P>

<P>Harden tells how this political juggernaut brought pressure to bear on dissenters, like Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">Washington State University</A>, who testified against the inefficiencies and wealth transfers of massive Project subsidies.  Bureaucrats routinely suppressed evidence or simply ignored their deleterious effects on indians, salmon, and the environment.  Farmers, barge operators, and utilities remain in denial.  Harden quotes a teacher at <A HREF="http://www.bbcc.ctc.edu">Big Bend Community College</A> in Moses Lake, Brenda Teals, who says, &quot;Farmers think those irrigation ditches fell out of the sky.&quot;</P>

<P>The vast majority of worthwhile irrigation projects were built privately and without federal subsidies.  Only after the best sites were developed were government subsidies required.</P>

<P>Can taxpayers still afford the iron triangles created by grandiose government schemes?  The nation's taxpayers pay for 80% of most major irrigation projects.  The farmers are encouraged to draw as much water as they can, the federal agencies are encouraged to &quot;operate&quot; the river like a machine, and the politicians are encouraged to appropriate more funds for their contributors.</P>

<P>This iron triangle polarizes Northwesterners.  Harden relates &quot;the most enduring consequence of federal control in my home country was not pollution, but intolerance.&quot;  In Hanford, it was technocrats and technicians against indians and hayseeds.  On the river, it was barge pilots against windsurfers and fish lovers.  Inland, it was subsidized farmers against enviros seeking to dismantle the artificial foundation of the Northwest economy.  Along the Cascade Mountains, it is becoming &quot;East-siders&quot; versus &quot;West-siders&quot;.</P>

<P>The polarization has forest industries blaming dams, fishermen, and farmers. Farmers blame deep-sea gillnets.  Fishermen blame dam builders.  Barge operators blame bureaucratic meddling.  Federal agencies deny responsibility and point to hatcheries.  Utilities claim transporting salmon in trucks is better than letting them swim.  Consensus seems more distant than Lewis and Clark's past.</P>

<P>Salmon and Northwesterners cannot live in harmony when politics generate benefits.  The iron triangles produce toxic byproducts.  As President Clinton has proclaimed, the era of Big Government is over.  Blaine Harden's book tells why we should be grateful. </P>

<H1>Finding Defenses Against Parasitic Bureaucracies</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>More young Americans believe in UFOs than believe they'll receive Social Security.  Only 25% of Americans trust the federal government.  30 years ago it was 75%.  No wonder -- the federal government now runs trillion-dollar deficits, dedicates 15% of its budget to pay interest on the national debt, and spends two-thirds of what remains on entitlements programs.  One entitlement to <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa241es.html">Archer Daniels Midland Co.</A>, the nation's leading ethanol producer, costs taxpayers $30 for every $1 of ADM profits.  </P>

<P>Behavioral ecology helps explain these findings.  Governments become parasitic; they get their hooks into and drain productive individuals and groups.  </P>

<P>The authors of the U.S. Constitution well understood the problems of political parasitism.  They knew that the default position is for government to become a parasitic agent that feeds off involuntary hosts without providing commensurate benefits.  Constant vigilance is required to forestall this outcome.</P>

<P>Our government is a social arrangement legitimized by the consent of the governed.  The constitution sets the rules for making laws and regulations.  Citizens sacrifice certain rights to guarantee predictable, social order.</P>

<P>In principle, nearly all sane people find these sacrifices preferable to anarchy.  It makes little difference whether we drive on the right or left side of the road, as long as we all drive on the same side.  Having government select and enforce one side benefits society immensely at little cost.  In many ways, great and subtle, government is a social lubricant.  </P>

<P>But there is a profound tension inherent to political management.  The key social lubricant, government, is also the ultimate source of coercion.  Government can make life easier by establishing courts and minting currency, but can it stop there?  </P>

<P>When government becomes the Welfare and Nanny State its major functions are to redistribute wealth and opportunities.  Government bureaucracies generate no wealth on their own.  Unlike private, independent actors who must rely on mutually beneficial, voluntary agreements, federal bureaucracies depend on taxation and forced transfers.  Their lifeblood is siphoned from successful individuals and organizations.  There are huge temptations for government to expand its activities and become an economic parasite.</P>

<P>Michael Rothschild, in his book <A HREF="http://www.bionomics.org/text/resource/biobook.html"><CITE>Bionomics</CITE></A>, describes economic parasites as organisms that &quot;use secrecy, deception, brute force, and legal authority as their 'hooks'.&quot;  No doubt active government agencies use all of the above tactics, some more than others.  The <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us">U.S. Forest Service</A>, quietly loses a billion dollars a year managing lands it got for free.  It relies on an oblivious public who loves Smokey but is largely ignorant of how Forest Service operations deplete our forests, divide our communities, and depreciate our economies.</P>

<P>Federal subsidies to ethanol producers, championed by Bob Dole (&quot;Senator Ethanol&quot;, according to his own press release), are predicated on the deception that they save energy and improve air quality.  They epitomize corporate welfare and gross economic inefficiencies.  The <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov">Fish and Wildlife Service</A>, in forcing landowners to provide habitat for endangered species, is one of many agencies who implement brute force as its hook.  These parasitic agencies drain their host (taxpayers, landowners) usually without their consent.</P>

<P>Society needs defenses against parasites, just as our bodies do.  When economic parasitism comes from criminals, government is expected (and funded by taxes) to intervene.  What happens when government IS the economic parasite?  The Founders' question, &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; (who will monitor the monitors themselves) has no satisfactory answer.</P>

<P>Behavioral ecology can offer great insight here.  Humans, their pets, fruits, and other organisms have been plagued by parasites throughout history.  Society has devised many treatments to mitigate harm, especially when cures are not available.</P>

<P>Traditional treatments often include some form of quarantine.  Parasites need a host.  By isolating parasites from potential new hosts, the parasite will eventually die.  Quarantining fruits, pets, and the infirmed is an example of this.  Similarly, the Bubonic Plague was tackled by implementing waste management practices which separated rat habitat from human habitat.</P>

<P>Successes against biological parasites can be translated to political economy.  Imprisoning criminals effectively quarantines them.  Likewise, by quarantining an activist, parasitic government, its many bureaucratic tentacles will wither.  </P>

<P>This is what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind:  a limited government, based on a system of checks and balances and a Bill of Rights which protects individuals and states from incursions of a parasitic Big Government.  The limited, quarantined government could still do its essentials (like protect from invasions and select which side of the road to drive on), but couldn't engage in the parasitic behavior that is epidemic today.</P>

<P>Free speech and press are essential to stopping parasitism by secrecy and deception.  &quot;Just compensation&quot; and the Fifth Amendment prohibition on forcing citizens to house soldiers during wartime are examples of efforts to prevent parasitism of a police state.  And the Tenth Amendment's oft-neglected mandate that &quot; powers not delegated to the United States... are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people&quot; was meant to curtail parasitism of a totalitarian government.</P>

<P>The Constitution was designed to be our first line of defense against economic parasitism.  Yet today we see generalized disenchantment with both major parties.  This is a predictable consequence of parasitic government.  And the costs of lost efficiency are small when compared to those of lost civic virtue among national politicians.  We will not see faith restored in federal government while it's used as an engine of plunder. </P>

<H1>Helping to Build a Sustainable Next West</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>The Gallatin Institute links writers of the West with environmental economists.  Last weekend poets, novelists, historians and essayists spent three days exploring ideas and ideals with policy analysts at the Gallatin Gateway Inn, a beautifully restored railroad hotel between Bozeman and West Yellowstone, Montana.    </P>

<P>Such communication is something new because the participants come from disparate tribes.  Their brains seem programed to see and process different kinds of information.  Artists and analysts seldom mingle easily.  A shared commitment to help build a sustainable next West, based upon local communities and respect for the lessons of our history and bio-geography, brought them together.  </P>

<P>Why intermingle artists and economists?  Mixing cultures is difficult and dangerous.  It's a risky venture but one worth undertaking.  Writers sensitize us to values and to new ways of seeing them.  Analysts help us understand how we might better cooperate to realize those values.</P>

<P>I've known sensitive people who define economists as those who &quot;know the price of everything but the value of nothing&quot;.  At best, they are only half right; as Thomas Sowell observed, the variables which economists can measure are not those that matter most.  </P>

<P>This is inherent to the nature of the world.  No matter how smart, how well funded, or how powerful their computer, analysts will never put a good metric on friendship, beauty, trust or peace.  Good economists know the limitations of their discipline.  </P>

<P>Yet microeconomics, the study of choice in public and private arenas, has important explanatory power.  This discipline has great potential for improving environmental policy.  Any proposal for reform that violates economic principles or the laws of nature is doomed.</P>

<P>When we apply these economic principles to problems, we can make predictions.  Specifically, if some behavior's cost, in terms of reputation, comfort or money, increases, and the benefits of that behavior remain constant, then we'll see less of that behavior.  For example, if litterers were subjected to the lash and branded on their foreheads with a L, then we'd see less littering.   Conversely, if landowners were rewarded for attracting and harboring endangered species, rather than penalized as they are now, more species would be safe.  The principles are quite simple but have profound implications.</P>

<P>It is likely that the evolutionary process has hard-wired these responses into our nature; they are strong survival characteristics.  People who act in accordance with these principles are more likely to do well and enjoy a good life than those who do not.  I have long argued that economics so understood is merely a division of the more general field of evolutionary biology.  </P>

<P>Understanding of economic principles helps us separate hopes for the future from expectations about that future.  As smart people experience life, they are ever better at making these distinctions.  </P>

<P>This ability to distinguish hopes from expectations is an important measure of practical intelligence.  Those who lack it are most charitably described as naive.  But some old-line paleo-enviros still reject economic analysis.  As one said, &quot;the word economics makes me hiss like The Hobbit's Gollum: I hates it, I hates it, I hates it forever.&quot;</P>

<P>Is it ethically or intellectually responsible to remain willfully ignorant?  Thanks to the work of researchers such as Lynn Scarlett, Randal O'Toole and Tom Power, sincere environmentalists increasingly see the value of political economy and policy analysis. </P>

<P>This helps explain why environmentalists have become skeptical about utopian schemes.  As smart people experience life's successes and failures, they develop an intuitive sense of these economic principles.  They recognize that there are no perfect solutions, only many competing tradeoffs.   </P>

<P>Learning by trial and error is grossly inefficient.  Explanation of principles by sensitive and empathetic teachers works much better.  However, economists are selected for analytical skills and abstract logic, not empathy and sensitivity.  Economists are among the few who find Calculus a compelling form of communication.  Few economists communicate easily with artists.</P>

<P>Economists' powerful analytic leverage can help us deal with problems, but only if they connect and communicate with those who care deeply about environmental quality.  Most people need to know how much you care before they care how much you know.  If economists are perceived as calculating not compassionate, their contributions will be resisted.  </P>

<P>Rejection of analysis and economic reasoning retards environmental reform.  The success of dialogues, such as the one hosted by the Gallatin Institute, gives us prudent optimism as we contemplate the next West. </P>

<H1>Park Lovers Can Save National Parks</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>As Americans flock to national parks this summer, we can learn a lot from national parks around the world.  Field biologists the world over uniformly confirm the woeful conditions of national parks.  <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A> found many national parks in Latin America are at great risk.  Even closer to home, Canada's experiments with national parks hold important lessons for parks lovers.</P>

<P>Canadian parks are now suffering from their reliance on fickle politics.  The Canadian analog of the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov">U.S. National Park Service</A>, Parks Canada, just lost $100 million dollars from its budget to operate 38 parks.  The U.S. park system has ten times as many parks and a budget of only $1.3 billion.</P>

<P>U.S. park managers, already short funding, cut popular services such as the Norris Campground in Yellowstone.  Let's consider alternative managerial arrangements in the U.S. before mounting financial pressures in Washington, D.C. force a repeat of Canada's predicament.</P>

<P>Public, nongovernment endowment boards, one for each park, hold great promise.  They successfully manage private schools, nonprofit hospitals, and museums.  Board members have trustee and fiduciary responsibility for their organization's specific mission.  The boards would be charged to manage for highest values: habitat, preservation, primitive recreation, scenery.  An endowment board with regional and national members could ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics.</P>

<P>Petty politics puts national parks at risk.  The 104th Congress is considering eliminating unworthy parks.  Although park budgets rose every year from 1955 to 1977, Congress has cut funding in one out of every three years since.  A quarter of park ranger jobs have disappeared since 1987, and there is a $3 billion maintenance backlog.  Our parks are in terrbile shape, ecologically and operationally.</P>

<P>While not providing adequate funding for existing parks, Congress creates new parks of highly questionable value, like Presidio and Steamtown.  This political trap has caught Canada, which just combined massive budget reductions for Parks Canada with the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park, now Canada's fifth largest.</P>

<P>Government support for parks is problematic for many reasons.  Politicizing national parks leads to &quot;park&quot; barrel projects and poor management incentives.  Sound science loses out when special interests can order the Park Service to eliminate Yellowstone's wolves in the 1920s and fires since 1900.  Fuel loads build ever higher and dangers rise.  We can soon expect huge, destructive fires rather than many small, natural ones.</P>

<P>Making park budgets dependent on politics rather than the parks' net revenues also distorts decisions and encourages bureaucratic inefficiencies. Park Service construction budgets routinely include 50% extra for overhead and overruns.  Parks' user fees and concessionaire fees go to Washington.  The resulting underpriced or free access encourages overuse of our parks.  Increasingly, the park system is characterized by low quality new parks and degraded old ones.</P>

<P>Supporters of legislation now before Congress believe corporate sponsorship of national parks holds the solution.  The proposal's main stumbling block is public apprehension about commercialization of our parks.  It's understandable that, as the Olympics draw near, we guard against &quot;Disney-fied&quot; parks, like a Timex Old Faithful or a Ranier Beer Ranier National Park.  </P>

<P>How do we guard against such crass commercialization?  Endowment boards, with their membership, drawn from environmental, community, business, and science leaders have incentives to seek subtle, tasteful sponsorship and public support.  If trustees fail to honor a binding mandate to foster values specific to each park, then they suffer reputational and other losses.</P>

<P>As with other environmnetal issues, we face trade-offs not perfect solutions.  Even cynical observers note that the threat of commercialization is less serious than the current slide in services and sustainability.  Independence Hall is in desperate need of roof repairs and modern fire sprinklers.  Should we let 20th Century Fox put &quot;Official Sponsor of Independence Hall National Park&quot; on its &quot;Independence Day&quot; movie billboards?   What if the alternative is to let this park go up in smoke?</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship could make a huge difference.  Ford Motor Company recently purchased 20 pages in Newsweek dedicated to the national park system.  Ten were Ford ads, ten were travel brochures for various national parks like Crater Lake and Big Bend.  The ad space alone cost around $1.5 million. While pocket change to Ford, this sum equals the operating budget of the average U.S. National Park.</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship of the national park system is part of a larger movement to separate Park Service funding from Congress.  Only when park budgets are depoliticized will America have a vibrant and long-lasting park system.  Creating mechanisms for collecting payment from various park beneficiaries is an important step in this direction.  User fees, gifts from membership organizations, concessionaire contracts, and corporate sponsorships all have potential.  Instituting endowment boards to generate and manage these funds will foster the necessary trust, sensitivity, and responsibility.</P>

<P>National parks are failing to deliver the quality or stability park-lovers demand.  Support and management of our national heritage must come from the people who appreciate and benefit from those parks.  When parks must pay their own way through fees and friends, we'll see more responsible stewardship.  The parks are too precious for a precarious dependency on politics.</P>

<P>Americans are increasingly concerned about our wildlands.  Historically we looked toward federal custodians.  But, if you believe that Congress will respond with large appropriations, read no further.</P>

<P>The federal government has made promises it cannot afford to keep.  The implications preclude an expanded federal wildlands system.  What will happen when actual spending cuts become unavoidable?  As the 104th Congress demonstrates, environmental expenditures are prime targets.</P>

<P>Yet, as our ecological understanding increases, we realize that large, intact systems are important.  David Quammen, author of <CITE>Song of the Dodo</CITE>, notes that wildlands cannot exist merely as &quot;island ecologies&quot;.  Without linking large, diverse areas and populations, island ecologies are doomed to stagnate and fail.  But will wildlands be worth their political cost to politicians?</P>

<P>Already, half the federal budget goes to Medicare and Social Security.  This drain is projected to double in the next 40 years.  What will be left for wildlands?  And where would federal wildlands be if revenue-hungry Congressmen, pressured by retired baby boomers, propose selling off bits and pieces of federal lands to fund the boomers' retirement?  </P>

<P>According to a Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation report, <CITE>The View from Airlie</CITE>, such mischief is endemic to top-down control where local sites &quot;offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Allowing the political process to determine the priority of wildlands designations invites michief.  With the Presidio, an old naval base, becoming a national park, might the <A HREF="http://www.pmrma-www.army.mil/rma.html">Rocky Mountain Arsenal</A> be designated a Wilderness Area? (This would eliminate the required cleanup.)</P>

<P>We expect politicians' attention spans to reach only to the next election, but wildlands require long-term stewardship.  These two time frames are incompatible.  Politicians aren't held accountable for events after they leave office.</P>

<P>Yet, the stubborn reliance on command-and-control by orthodox environmentalists ignores these structural impediments to a federal wildlands program.  We need new institutional arrangements to protect massive tracts of wildlands.  Responsible and constructive proposals are required.  Here are a few ideas.</P>

<P>Across America, untold multitudes of environmentally sensitive landowners are eager to manage their land for environmental ends but are afraid of political entanglements and potential takings.  The Safe Harbor program in North Carolina is successful because it responds to landowner concerns.  It is expected to double the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker population through voluntary agreements with landowners. Previously, the arrival of these woodpeckers meant losing control of their property.  Landowners enrolled in Safe Harbor have their rights protected.  If they attract woodpeckers they may continue active forestry and agriculture.  Similar programs can link large tracts of wilderness without removing land from all productive uses.</P>

<P>Creativity, flexibility, and adaptability are essential in coordinating habitat and wildlands.  These are not attributes of governmental bureaucracies.  Environmental entrepreneurs, however, like leaders of the <A HREF="http://www2.rmef.org/rmef/">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A>, specialize in identifying conservation opportunities and building a constituency for wildlands.  Likewise, other conservationists could invest in wildlands based on voluntary agreements and mutual exchange.</P>

<P>When governments restrict use of private wildlands, landowners have strong incentives to develop their property before a bureaucrat comes locking.  In the voluntary sector, on the other hand, landowners are rewarded if their parcels qualify as wildlands and become attractive to a regional &quot;Wildlands Easement Trust&quot;.  </P>

<P>A regional Wildlands Easement Trust would have a board of trustees, similar in operation to those of museums and hospitals.  This decentralized approach allows caretaking priorities to adapt to increases in scientific understanding.</P>

<P>Such an approach wouldn't rely on massive federal land acquisition or regulatory intervention.  This different path to the same goal promises better results with less confrontation.  Dave Foreman founded <A HREF="http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/campaigns/ef/earthfirst.html">Earth First!</A> because of his frustration with the pro-environment but entirely statist Carter Administration.  He observes &quot;conservationists have relied too much on federal government law and regulation&quot;.  He reminds us that it &quot;has also been easier to pass federal laws than to work out good conservation through the free market or through voluntary agreements.&quot;</P>

<P>Preserving vast tracts of land, as Wildlands Easement Trusts promise to do, is a daunting task not amenable to quick fixes.  The dangerous temptation is to rely upon governments alone to constrain those who would gladly plunder our natural heritage.   America's heritage is not about coercing dissenters into obedient silence.  As Alexis de Tocqueville explained early in our history, Americans excel at building voluntary institutions that foster cooperative pursuit of shared interests.  </P>

<P>Saving wildlands by dipping deeper into the U.S. Treasury is doomed to frustration and failure.  Federal management predictably fails to deliver environmental goods--be they commodities like timber or amenities like habitat.  There is an important federal role to monitor against abuse and adjudicate conflict.  Mischief follows when it tries to manage.</P>

<P>A decentralized and flexible approach, and positive incentives can make Wildlands Easement Trusts happen.  Private and public, nongovernmental wildlands provide our best and most realistic opportunities to further protect nature's precious gifts.</P>

<P>We have many successful models all across America:  the R Ranch in California, the Iram Wild Horse Preserve in South Dakota, Pennsylvania's <A HREF="http://jasper.stanford.edu/OBFS/stations/PA_Hawk_Mountain_Sanct..html">Hawk Mountain</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.biddeford.com/~mcht/trusts/mcht.htm">Maine Coast Heritage Trust</A>.  These nature preserves offer important lessons in the new environmentalism. </P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/29/96</P><H1>The predictable perversities of bureaucratic behavior</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>There is a strong tendancy for such organizations to be run for the benefit of those in charge.  This has profound implications for those in the agency and for those they are to serve.  </P>

<P>A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial portion of its budget from transfers.  When the bureaucracy is a government agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent.  I do not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest.  It impairs my viewshed, silts my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities, and lowers the value of my property.  Unfortunately, we have no choice but to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of what is right.  </P>

<P>What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt.  Its programs pay off too many politicians and special intersts to prevent this economically rational and environmentally preferrable outcome.  Unlike Apple Computer, the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist.  So long as their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can mix good deeds with genuine plunder.</P>

<P>Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization.   Most corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers  within the company, e.g. public affairs departments.  These units, however, are rarely if ever dominant.  Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that generate income by selling products to willing buyers.  While research and public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's mission than that of government agencies.  Deviations are constrained by those who watch the bottom line.</P>

<P>This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.  There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.  Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced sense of purpose.  Few organizations have it.</P>

<P>When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies' self-serving tendancies to become more pronounced.  For instance, although both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be more corrupt than the BIA.  Fortunately for their leaders, we will never know.  </P>

<P>Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university parking with that of shopping malls.  In malls, employees, including managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way, inconvenient location.  The decision-makers who determine parking rules find it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.</P>

<P>In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots marked with titles if not names.  Even a former university president, driven from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his preferential parking privileges.  The perfidious president preserved his privileges.</P>

<P>In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and control over resources.  This logic trumps the purpose justifying their creation.  What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the dark and slog through through seven months of Montana slush if those who make the rules are spared these costs?  A mall based on such privilege would soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such pressures.</P>

<P>None of this is surprising.  And it would be as naive to rail against as to protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by politicians.  That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate.  By then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.</P>

<P>In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix.  Ration the parking spaces by price.  People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in a cheap or free area.  Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries.  Truly handicapped individuals can have reserved parking.  I've yet to hear a reasonable objection to this. </P>

<P>Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land?  Such a reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little cost to pay for their privilege.  It was indeed an aberration when Congress made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live.  This too will erode.  For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.  To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.  </P>

<P>This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu">Montana State University</A> in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus parking. </P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/15/96</P><H1>Fostering a new west that respects old values</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.  Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives. They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and bring with them an utterly different value system for the land.  A value system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities. </P>

<P>To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation.  They demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values.  Many locals are resentful.   </P>

<P>     Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation and cooperation.  Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard labor that traditional Western jobs require.  And long-time residents need to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers.  Both must recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.   </P>

<P>     Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and values that have long defined the West.  Here's a story from a recent trip to <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State University</A>, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames the debate for me.  I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.</P>

<P>         I used to work in the woods.  Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and Idaho.  I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific Northwest, and  in 1977, I finally got the chance.  On sabbatical leave from my regular university post,  I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State University.  This left plenty of time to work in the woods.   </P>

<P>    Nearly 20 years later  I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a few days of meetings.  Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks and other signs of fundamental change.  While Ramona worked with her fellow academics, I rode my bike.  One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber.  I wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and maintained.  In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner.   Also, I needed a new saw.</P>

<P>     The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.  I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop.  It spent its declining years on our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood.  That's an easy life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.  </P>

<P>Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy.  It's hard-core, a good place to find recipes for spotted owl.  My Lycra was on trespass in corked-boot territory.  Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust was the same.  The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter.  He looked up from his work as I entered.  </P>

<P>     &quot;Hi, Ken,&quot; I said.  &quot;Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around 1977?  Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days a week?  You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd known he was professor.&quot;  I took off my Bolles.</P>

<P>     &quot;Damn! Hi, John.&quot; He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand.  We exchanged news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong reasons.  &quot;With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees,&quot; he said. &quot;Less wood more saws.  Not many pros in the woods anymore.&quot;  He is looking towards  the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years.  The changing values of the new West aren't for Ken.</P>

<P>     &quot;Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out.  Will you send me a new one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me,&quot; I said, &quot;but I have a Visa card.&quot;</P>

<P>     &quot;Hell, don't bother.  Just send me a check when you get home.&quot;</P>

<P>     The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:</P>

<P><CENTER>
LEBANON<BR>
Saw Shop Lebanon,<BR>
Oregon</CENTER></P>

<P>I put it on to finish writing this essay.  And I thought about trust-about how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust.  Twenty years and a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work honorably done. </P>

<P>     I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old.  Trust that comes from working together is high on my list.  Its presence in my own life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.  </P>

<H1>Marking the End of an Era of Crisis Entrepreneurship</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>, Vice President Al Gore writes in the book's Foreward, discusses &quot;compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  He calls it the sequel to the first enviromental benchmark, <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  He's wrong.  </P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> marks the end of an era of public susceptibility to ill-founded hysteria and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, serious and intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and posturing are pass&eacute; in the environmental policy arena.</P>

<P>The book's authors are Theo Colburn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a former reporter, respectively. This &quot;scientific detective story&quot; is provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot;  It charges synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, and Tide) with disrupting hormones.  They allege hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, ranging from illiteracy to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  Their solution?  Ban synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The book's timing is immaculate.  It comes as the National Academy of Sciences convenes to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrives on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day.  <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> has a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It is PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>Yet it's flopping.  Reputable responders trash the book.  The <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://update.wsj.com"><CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com"><CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE></A>, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>, and <CITE>Washington Times</CITE> have criticized the book for all manner of flaws, from hysteria mongering to junk science and from faulty logic to poor writing.  It's a sign we're making progess.  Here's why.</P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  That's good news for those of us who rank environmental quality among our highest priorities.  We learn more from failure than success, and this failure offers important lessons for environmental reformers.</P>

<P>People in the environmental movement are far more sophisticated today than in 1962.  They recognize that greens attract both &quot;crisis entrepreneurs&quot; and genuine advocates for the public interest.  These crisis hustlers generate new support by touting an emergency and then providing avenues down which people can parade their good intentions and express their sincerity by sending money.  Conservative, quiet groups such as the Isaak Walton League and American Forestry Association lose to those that emphasize drama, apocalypse, and urgency at the expense of intellectual integrity.  </P>

<P>But hysterical environmentalism ultimately backfires.  Greenpeace International's mission against chlorine is an excellent example.  Their anti-chlorine campaign led to Peru reducing the chlorine it added to its water supply.  The result?  A cholera epidemic swept through insufficiently chlorinated water supplies, taking far more lives than the chlorine ban could possibly have saved.</P>

<P>Colburn and friends deride the cancer scare of the early 1970s for turning cancer into &quot;the ultimate measure of our fears.&quot;  They see our preoccupation with high cancer rates as &quot;more myth than reality.&quot;  Scientists and regulators in the &quot;War on Cancer&quot; wasted precious time and resources.  Colburn recognizes the perils of overstating cancer threats.  Ironically, she tells us that, compared to cancer, hormone disruptors pose a far greater danger.  Disruptors may destroy humankind.</P>

<P>But, after a few scares, people become jaded and cynical.  Short-term opportunism thwarts constructive outcomes.</P>

<P>Such opportunism may work in the short-run, but it antagonizes scientists and policy analysts.  For example, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> greatly exaggerates the scientific consensus regarding declining sperm counts.  The book's misleading science invites criticism and undermines its alleged purpose.  It's immediate supporters are likely to feel as foolish by the autumn of the year 2000 as those who predicted global cooling should today.</P>

<P>Also, environmentalists can learn that benefits normally imply costs.  Only when they recognize both, and acknowledge inescapable trade-offs, can they recommend constructive and effective policies.  This is not a cost-free world.</P>

<P>But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> considers only the negative effects of synthetic chemicals.  It offers no appropriate responses.  If plastics, pesticides, and paints merely sabotaged our biochemistry, Colburn's recommended ban might make sense.  But synthetic chemicals are integral to modern civilization precisely because of their benefits.</P>

<P>Good public policy must incorporate the risks, benefits, and harms of each issue. Lorenz Rhomberg, Ph.D. of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis writes, &quot;a crash program of [hormone-disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.&quot;  Colburn ignores these trade-offs.</P>

<P>Sincere, sophisticated and sensible environmentalists shun chicanery and irresponsible reforms.  They see these proposals are more dangerous than the synthetic chemicals Colburn pillories.</P>

<P>Insisting that chemicals be presumed guilty of hormone disruption until proven innocent by chemical manufacturers is terribly foolish.  Even undergraduates should know one can't prove the negative.  Anyone can always claim we simply haven't looked hard enough.  By requiring chemical manufacturers to do the impossible, she dooms the beneficiaries a modern chemicals to the 1800s.  Failing to acknowledge the huge benefits of modern chemistry is naive or disingenuous.</P>

<P>Savvy Americans expect misguided policy proposals from even gifted scientists.  We understand that for PR firms image trumps truth.  We expect and understand when crisis entrepreneurs with Greenpeace incite panics to build budgets.  But why do smart scientists recommend pathologically unwise policies?</P>

<P>When scientists leave the lab and enter the policy arena, thier body temperatures and IQ scores often seem to converge.  A future scientific detective story may explain this tragic phenomenon.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> already has the answer:  hormone disruptors. </P>

<P>	I just returned from the other Washington, the one on the Potomac.  I met with people in think tanks, universities, the federal judiciary, and intellectuals from the Reagan Administration.  A common question was, &quot;are the Republicans in the 104th Congress brain damaged or just cowards?&quot;</P>

<P>	We all wondered what could possess Republicans to blatantly attack three decades of increased environmental sensitivity. Everett Carll Ladd's American Enterprise Institute study demonstrates America's overwhelming sympathy for environmentalism.  How did the Republicans think the public would receive their anti-environmental rhetoric?</P>

<P>	According to Newt Gingrich, Republicans simply miscalculated on the language they used.  And language is very important here.  Republicans were portrayed as &quot;dismantling 25 years of environmental protection&quot; and &quot;rolling back 25 years of environmental laws&quot;.  These are serious accusations.  Fortunately, they contain only a bit of truth.  </P>

<P>	By and large, Republicans, like other normal people, favor environmental protection.  They just don't believe that federal micro-management and intrusive regulations are the best approach.  Their attempts roll back the &quot;laws&quot; were largely misunderstood as attempts to eliminate environmental &quot;protection&quot;.</P>

<P>	Here is a great lesson for voters and elected officials alike:  It is the bureaucratic regulatory approach that voters rejected in 1994, not the environmental goals.  Americans are tired of intrusive, insensitive, and inefficient bureaucratic means to environmental ends.  Almost everybody favors environmental protection; the big difference is in how we achieve it.  </P>

<P>	Most of the new Republicans arrived in Washington not hoping to destroy our environment, but rather to transform the process and preserve it from the corruption, waste, and politicking inherent to Washington D.C.  Their deregulatory, limited-government approach contrasted sharply with the traditional environmentalist agenda of greater bureaucratic powers, increased federal control, and heightened paranoia over environmental problems.  </P>

<P>	This reform required fewer stringent environmental regulations and far more freedom to find new ways to achieve environmental goals.  &quot;Green&quot; groups took this as an attack.  Since the first Earth Day most environmental groups have relied on the heavy hand of federal management, detailed regulations, and larger subsidies.</P>

<P>	Reform demanded that Republicans confront orthodox command-and-control environmentalism.  However, extreme spokespeople like Don Young of Alaska and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho undermine the credibility of their reform.  They and their &quot;Wise Use&quot; constituents paraded under the banner of free enterprise while demanding a continuation of subsidies for outmoded, environmentally destructive exploitation of resources on public lands.  The other Republicans were either ignorant of the damages and distortions of subsidies or too cowardly to stand up against the outspoken, but misguided, representatives of Wise Use.</P>

<P>	While the Republican agenda presented several innovative ways to better the environment (like property rights protections and Superfund reform), they failed to provide a cohesive and mature vision for environmental protection.  According to Lynn Scarlett, Vice President of Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, &quot;Would-be reformers adopted a mirror image of their opponents' technocratic, top-down approach without thinking seriously about how to ensure environmental protection.&quot;  For example, mandatory cost-benefit analyses can make regulations more efficient, but they do not address the fundamental shortcomings of the regulatory approach. </P>

<P>	Conventional environmentalism overstepped its bounds through excessive regulations, uncompensated &quot;takings&quot;, and centralized control.  It has imposed unnecessary costs on everyone and pitted the environment against prosperity, rather than harmonizing these two complementary values.</P>

<P>	Some environmental gains were well worth the costs.  But their means neglected what economists call &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot;.  Ever increasing environmental regulation ultimately costs society more than it benefits.  In <CITE>Breaking the Vicious Circle</CITE>, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer identifies the rising costs of regulations like CAFE fuel economy requirements, EPA restrictions on benzene, and Superfund.</P>

<P>	Inflexible and exorbitantly expensive regulations are predictable consequences of separating power from responsibility.  When pollution is free to polluters, we get too much pollution.  Likewise, when regulations are free to the regulators, we get too much regulation.  But it's irresponsible to ignore trade-offs inherent in every policy.  Pursuing environmental goals with what Justice Breyer calls &quot;tunnel vision&quot; will squander billions of dollars.  This process will also trample individuals, communities, and even endangered species.  </P>

<P>	The high costs and ineffectiveness precipitated the voters' demand for fundamental changes.  The Republicans of the 104th Congress are indeed cowards if they ultimately accept a milder, more gentle orthodox environmentalism or continue the old, pork-barrel subsidies.  They also seem dim-witted when they fail to articulate an alternative environmental vision based on sound science, positive incentives, regulatory stability, responsibility, and secure property rights.</P>

<P>	Some political entrepreneur, Democrat, Libertarian, or Republican, will catalyze a new era of environmentalism -- a new shade of green.  Taking control away from bureaucracies and their advocates (be they industry or environmentalist) means allowing flexible adaptation to govern environmental stewardship.  The Nature Conservancy demonstrates flexible, innovative responses to Americans' demands for stewardship.  TNC has successfully tripled the acres it protects in the last 10 years by stressing its decentralized, local approach.  </P>

<P>	Features which characterize ecological systems, such as evolution, decentralization, and adaptability, can guide policy reform.  Ecological systems are much like economic systems.  Shared principles provide the key for a new environmental vision. The Republicans just haven't found it.  They must find courage to begin looking and exercise wisdom to use this key.</P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>4/3/96</P><H1>Thirst for Private Water Suppliers Grows</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>Water is precious to life on earth.  Healthy organisms, ecosystems, and weather cycles depend on it.  A sufficient supply of clean water is the critical first step to improving public health in every society.   Just because everyone needs water, however, doesn't make managing it easy.  Developing countries are struggling for water.  The <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</A> says $600 billion is needed in the next decade to avoid water shortages.</P>

<P>Even though Earth is mostly water, only about 1% of it is available freshwater.  And with global water consumption tripling since 1950, some claim it's only a matter of time before the strain on  the world's water supply becomes too great:  29 years according to Paul Ehrlich, Sandra Postel, and Gretchen Daily.  If you live where the Colorado River used to drain into the sea, or where the Aral Sea once existed, the time may already be now.  How we manage scarce water resources is increasingly vital, for public health as well as the health of wetlands, salmon runs, and other ecosystems.  That makes water delivery systems among the most important enterprises.</P>

<P>America's water management ideology flowed from the Progressive Era doctrine of a century ago.  Political leaders used tax-exempt government bonds to fund facilities and enabled bureaucracies to provide their burgeoning cities with water. As a result, 85% of Americans drink water from government-owned companies.  Public water companies, they thought, could easily, efficiently, and reliably supply municipal water.</P>

<P>The Progressives were wrong.  Time, and a recent study of California's water industry by the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, has proven them wrong.  The Reason Foundation surveyed private and public water companies in California and discovered that both offered comparable services.  To provide those same water services, however, the government-owned companies relied on tax exemptions and subsidies.</P>

<P>The private companies fended for themselves, and did so more efficiently.  Their water cost consumers only three-fourths that of public water.  Inefficiencies of government-owned water companies go beyond cost to consumers.  Their operating expenses per connection were 21% higher.  They required more than double the number of employees per connection.  Accordingly, salaries of public water companies ate up almost three times as much of the operating revenue as the private companies.  Public companies also spent nearly double their private counterparts on maintenance.</P>

<P>The good news for Californians is that even their wasteful government water companies are more efficient than some third-world water companies.  Most Latin American utilities require between ten and twenty employees per thousand connections (compared with 1.62 for private- and 3.49 for government-owned firms in Calif.).  No wonder that developing countries which are dominated by government-owned water industries &quot;require&quot; massive bailouts.  No wonder the specter of water shortages looms so closely.</P>

<P>The bad news is that 78% of Californians receive their water from wasteful public authorities.  The <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> finds that subsidizing public water passes no savings on to the consumer.  The subisidized inefficiencies effectively flush public funds that could instead be spent on more worthwhile undertakings or reduced taxes.</P>

<P>Public water companies are protected from competition.  Bloated payrolls, extravagant expenditures, and addiction to subsidized capital characterize government water works.  Government-owned agencies in California notoriously accumulated large cash and investment incomes.  The Irvine Ranch Water District, for example, invested $32.5 million in an apartment complex and another $12 million in two other real estate developments.  Allowing government agencies like water companies to speculate with public money leads to the financial nightmare that vexes Orange County today.</P>

<P>Privatization presents an attractive alternative in the U.S. and elsewhere.  England privatized its water industry in 1989.  French cities has been contracting their water systems since the 19th century.  Some international firms found great success in supplying water to developing nations badly in need of competent and competitive water systems.  In Buenos Aires, the government water authority was so inept that privatizing offered huge benefits.  Privatization has brought $4 billion in infrastructure investment, improved government pipelines that previously leaked half of their water, and resolved the chronic summer  water shortages.  This approach conserves the environment while promoting healthier and wealthier consumers in Brazil.</P>

<P>In America, municipal budgets are tightening.  Mayors increasingly seek new capital.  And proliferating environmental regulations make the water business ever more difficult for city bueaucracies.  These factors make change certain.  Privatization of much of the water industry is likely.  </P>

<P>Ironically, public water companies were intended to protect the sacred municipal water supply.  What really happens in socialized water systems, however, is something quite different.  Water and other resources are wasted and public health is at risk while political interests are protected.  Now, as Mr. Clinton claims the &quot;era of big government is over,&quot; we can find support for innovative ways to provide public goods.  It takes courage to overcome the outmoded Progressive thinking.  Fortunately, thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and others, the common sense to see the benefits of privatization is becoming more common. </P>

<P>	Economic analysis can promote environmental quality.  By identifying subsidies, inefficiencies, and new opportunities, economists apply their powerful analytical tools to environmental ends. </P>

<P>	Yet despite its great potential, economic analysis has failed to improve environmental policy in many areas.  Environmental regulators often ignore the importance of secure property rights and advocate regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of property with predictable and oft perverse consequences.  The Progressives of the early 20th Century, who established the federal land management bureaucracies, completely failed to understand why America's founders were so skeptical of activist, intrusive government.  The persistent failures of bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management illustrate the founders' wisdom.  And too often American ideals of limited government are ignored by agencies and special interests, both of whom gain through wasteful central planning that corrupts good intentions.</P>

<P>	Economists have failed to deliver their message because they are neither naturally inclined nor trained to communicate with intelligent non-specialists.  The language of economists, calculus and econometrics, are alien to most people.  Even when economists share environmental goals and interests with conventional greens, their message is unheard or misinterpretted.</P>

<P>	This communication gap between economists, environmental activists, and decision-makers inspired a new organization, the Gallatin Institute.  This non-profit, educational and research foundation links essayists, poets, and novelists with economists and policy analysts interested in environmental quality and sensitive to an emerging environmentalist culture.  Gallatin works with these purveyors of culture to forge innovative cultural and intellectual foundations for an emerging West.  </P>

<P>	Shared goals of sustainable economies, ecologies, and cultures would be at the heart of such a New West.  To get there, Gallatin first fosters exchange between writers and policy experts. Gallatin Fellows next take these messages to communities.  </P>

<P>	Environmental concerns increasingly affect the West.  Technically complex and highly emotional, they often pit ecological against other human values.  These ingredients for error and acrimony provide opportunities for demagogues to work their mischief.  Lies go undetected, truths untold, opportuism fostered.</P>

<P>	In pursuit of ecological integrity and viable economies, Gallatin Fellows respect the ideals of free and responsible individuals, the importance of community, and the value of voluntary cooperative actions. They agree productive and just economic and social coordination is rarely achieved through force, and never by fraud.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute develops thoughtful foundations for constructive policy reform.  With support from the Ford Foundation and others, Gallatin hosts working conferences and seminars and provides modest support for writers to produce popular and scholarly articles and books.  Its varied ideas and proposals respectfully recognize differing cultures and traditions of the old while articulating a vision for a new West. </P>

<P>	When a group of writers met some years back, they envisioned a West moving away from federal dependency, factious division, and unsustainable land use.  The Gallatin Institute emerged as one vehicle for ushering in a new West.  Its aim is not to provide &quot;the answer&quot; for the New West.  Rather, Gallatin promotes an ecumenical, constructive dialogue among leaders of rural communities, Western writers, and policy analysts.  Gallatin recognizes that the West must determine its own identity, its own future.</P>

<P>	The Institute's emphasis on fostering harmony and responsibility reflects its namesake, Albert Gallatin, the secretary of the treasury under Thomas Jefferson.  Albert Gallatin had coherent and yet diverse interests.  A fiscal conservative, he stressed simple government and ending public debt.  In spite of the Louisiana Purchase and preparations for the War of 1812, Gallatin cut the federal debt by 38% in eight years.  He strongly opposed war and was instrumental in negotiating peace with Britain.  Gallatin funded the Lewis and Clark expedition and founded New York University and the American Ethnological Society.  Like its namesake, Gallatin Institute fosters constructive and peaceful exchange to find a new identity in the West, based on responsibility, cultural and ecological harmony, and self-governance.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute brings eclectic writings to the media and general public through several avenues.  A new<CITE> Gallatin Journal</CITE>, based on writings brought to seminars and community gatherings, will be launched in mid-1996.  Two forthcoming Gallatin books, <CITE>The Next West</CITE> and <CITE>Writers on the Range</CITE>, were generated by the seminars.</P>

<P>	A series of op-ed pieces are published in local, regional, and national print and electronic media are produced by the Institute.  Under the banners of &quot;Range Writers&quot; and &quot;Writers on the Range&quot;, Gallatin's writers produce columns and articles to promote this dialogue in the West.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute is one of many examples of environmental entrepreneurship in action, this one in the intellectual arena.  The Institute recognizes the important morality, ethics, and the analytic power of economics to explore an emerging West.  When writers begin using the potent tools of economic analysis, and if even a few economists return to their ethical/moral roots in Moral Philosophy, then the 21st century will yield a West whose public policies equal the quality of its scenery.  For once, I am not keeping my hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P>

<P>	Beneath Greater Yellowstone, powerful thermal energies relentlessly shift tectonic plates.  The subsurface motion creates rifts and faults, occasionally volcanoes and earthquakes.  The fundamental tensions are always there.</P>

<P>	The tectonic plates of culture and political economy are also shifting and generating profound tensions in the new American West.  In Oregon and Idaho, hi-tech industries now provide more jobs than wood products industries.  In Washington, 4,900 lost timber jobs were replaced by three times as many software jobs.  As standing trees become more valuable than logs, it is apparent that values are evolving. Different cultures, polities, and economies collide, occasionally with catastrophic results.  The Yellowstone wolf reintroduction illustrates these changes.</P>

<P>	The wolf is mediagenic, an icon of the changing West.  But icons have varying interpretations.  Those insulated from rural traditions see the wolves as displaced natives who must be returned to the ecosystem. The wolf icon combines their romantic vision of an untamed past with a feel-good mission to set things right.  Conversely, many native Westerners view wolf reintroduction as the imposition of an alien culture that threatens ranching and the traditional economy.</P>

<P>	These traditional interests prompted the National Park Service to exterminate the wolf from Yellowstone in the 1920s.  Now, another federal agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is charged with undoing that misguided &quot;progress&quot;.  However, the imported wolves don't easily coexist with local ranchers and hunters.</P>

<P>	Montanan Chad McKittrick, an unemployed carpenter, just received a six-month sentence in the slammer for killing &quot;Alpha One&quot;, a reintroduced wolf.  The U.S. Magistrate called the shooting, &quot;an intentional, thrill-seeking act in direct violation of the law.&quot;  McKittrick boasted a T-shirt saying &quot;Northern Rockies Wolf Reduction Project&quot;.  In the battle over the wolf icon, some locals in Montana made McKittrick a hero.</P>

<P>	When Park Rangers exterminated wolves Yellowstone lost a key component of its ecosystem.  Since then our ecological knowledge and sensitivity have increased while ranchers' economic and social influence have waned.  New people and interests are colonizing the West.   Nike, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard are moving in.</P>

<P>	Loggers, farmers, fishermen, and miners feel their industries wither.  8,000 logging jobs are expected to disappear from the region in the next two years.  Despite this, the Pacific Northwest has led the nation in new job creation based on a diversifying economy and high quality of life.  In many National Forests, standing trees have greater value than decked logs.  Progressive-era bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Park Service, however, are caught on the fault line between amenity and commodity interests.  Federal agencies cannot manage to the mounting tensions.</P>

<P>	In Oregon, environmentalists chain themselves to trees to stop logging.  But loggers, whose wages have fallen 22% since 1978, miss that income.  In Nevada, a state comprised of 87% federal lands, counties are suing feds for control.  In Idaho, militia concoct conspiracy theories linking federal agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife Service with the U.N. and a New World Order.  </P>

<P>	Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho describes the friction between the traditional West and &quot;a government-sponsored religion&quot; based upon &quot;New Age mysticism, Native American folklore, and primitive Earth worship.&quot;  She sees an invaded West, where &quot;Easterners dream of preserving it, but in the process they're driving our people off the land.&quot;  The Yellowstone wolf symbolizes this conflict.</P>

<P>	Elsewhere, wolves are quietly and naturally recolonizing their former ranges in the Glacier National Park region of Montana.  The Glacier wolf has rapidly proliferated.  Why don't Glacier's wolves attract the same attention, debate, and tension as Yellowstone's?</P>

<P>	The difference between Yellowstone and Glacier is one of means.  The wolves naturally recolonized Glacier, following their food source.  Cut-over forests with booming deer populations are excellent wolf habitat.  These wolves have learned to survive near man.  The wolves that kill livestock are shot.  Vigilant ranchers with rifles provide an evolutionary filter which selects out wolves that won't adapt to man, the supreme predator.</P>

<P>	In contrast, the Yellowstone wolves were caught in the wild, caged, drugged, and then airlifted into the Park.  Federal &quot;caretakers&quot; short circuited the adaptive process.  The transplanted wolves lacked the &quot;training&quot; to coexist with ranchers.  They're not passed through the filters of accommodation with people.  Predictably, Yellowstone wolves are more troublesome than those in Glacier.  The Yellowstone reintroduction may still succeed, but it will be costly in terms of dead wolves, dead livestock, taxpayer money, and cultural conflict between new and old interests.</P>

<P>	The cultural tectonic plates have shifted from 70 years ago when Westerners demanded wolf extermination and the government complied.  Old, native values are undergoing a process geologists call &quot;subduction&quot;.  As one tectonic plate submerges below another, it quietly heats up and eventually returns to the surface through volcanic eruption.  If we are not careful, the &quot;subducted&quot; traditional political economy might one day erupt as it did with Chad McKittrick.  The consequences preclude a harmonious West.</P>

<P>	Long ago, Progressives believed that federal government would foster community harmony.  Instead, it has fueled passions and amplified conflicts near Yellowstone.  And if we're not careful, rare bumper-stickers like &quot;Wolves: Gut Shoot 'Em At The Border!&quot;  and &quot;Hungry And Out Of Work?  Eat An Environmentalist&quot; will become as common as gun racks. </P>

<TITLE>Entitlements and the Everglades Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/28/96</P><H1>More subsidies in the age of corruption entitlements</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>&quot;<EM>Don't Gore us with new taxes</EM>&quot;, picketters in Miami shouted last week.  They opposed Vice President Gore's plan to &quot;tax&quot; the sugar industry in Florida.  A sugar &quot;tax&quot; would be used by the federal government to purchase Everglades land for ecosystem restoration.  In addition to the penny-per-pound &quot;tax&quot;, Gore announced a $1.5 billion environmental cleanup initiative for the Everglades.</P>

<P>	The Everglades ecosystem is clearly degrading.  Environmentalists accuse the sugar industry of despoiling the Everglades.  Economists such as Jonathan Tolman of the libertarian <A HREF="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> counter that government subsidies have encouraged the destruction.</P>

<P>   	Predictably, environmentalists demand a higher tax, and sugar growers want lower taxes.  The debate misses the mark entirely, because the &quot;penny-per-pound tax&quot; is no &quot;tax&quot;.  It is a subsidy reduction.  Gore's plan reduces federal price supports by a penny per pound.  Over $250 million in sugar industry subsidies and an import quota on sugar cost consumers over $1.4 billion a year and harm the Everglades.  </P>

<P>	Subsidies foster destructive agriculture in the Everglades.  Such subsidized destruction of environmental quality is the norm, not an isolated exception.  But politicians of both parties remain blind to opportunities to link fiscal responsibility with ecological integrity.  They and their constituencies have a parasitic relation to taxpayers.  Recipients of wealth transferred from others think they have a right to handouts.  This exemplifies a disturbing trend in American political culture: the conversion of subsidies into entitlements.</P>

<P>	Robert Samuelson of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> describes this in his new book, <CITE>The Good Life and Its Discontents:  The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement</CITE>.  He describes the conflicting and paradoxical nature of entitlements--the notion that we are all entitled to progress and prosperity which government can provide.  The mirage of entitlements, he rightly concludes, shakes the very foundation of American culture.  The problem with entitlements, aside from their conflict with the American ideal of individual responsibility, is the logical consequences of assuming that government can and should provide.</P>

<P>	Should government guarantee us income security and high-quality health care?  If it does, and then what?  What are the predictable consequences of such entitlements?  Entitlements require that government take citizens' scarce resources and distribute them to various interests.  Once government allocates any valuable resource, corruption of purpose must follow.  Here's why: 	</P>

<P>We can never precisely specify what the bureaucrat must do. Some discretion must remain.  And that discretion will normally reflect a political calculus.  The decision maker has incentives to make those determinations that advantage himself, those he favors, and his cause.  <A HREF="gopher://gopher.npr.org:70/11/NPR_Online">National Public Radio</A> programming provides an excellent example.</P>

<P>	When spending the money of others, discretionary power corrupts.  We then see resources going to corporate welfare projects like Senator Bob Dole's ethanol subsidies for Archer Daniels Midland and to the Clintons' friends who wanted to handle travel arrangements for the White House press corps.  With a constituency in place, &quot;subsidies&quot; harden into &quot;entitlements&quot;.</P>

<P>	In the booming postwar years, Samuelson reports, Americans began &quot;to take propserity for granted.&quot;  Times have changed, but our expectations haven't.  We still demand our Social Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing.  These goals necessarily imply trade-offs among competing demands.  The 'right' to farm subsidized sugar comes at the expense of taxpayers and intact ecosystems.  Potential entitlements are endless, but resources are finite.  It's morally and intellectually irresponsible to ignore this reality.</P>

<P>	A century ago, the Progressives did just that.  They claimed that government can and should not only monitor, but also manage resources and provide material benefits.  They and their modern liberal followers believe that social problems can be fixed if only the &quot;right&quot; people were making the decisions.  They thought more discretion by the right bureaucrats will ensure good policy that advances the public interest.  This counsel of perfection was grossly naive.</P>

<P>	America's Founders knew better.  They believed mankind is not perfectible, but rather self-interested.  Therefore they designed institutions to prevent people from harnessing government as an engine of plunder.  They chose a constitutional, limited government with strong checks and balances.  The rights they &quot;entitled&quot; Americans to are found in the Bill of Rights -- mainly freedom from abuse of government power.</P>

<P>	Federal budget deficits, national debt, and actuarial deficits symbolize our Age of Entitlement.  This simply cannot continue indefinitely.  Samuelson suggests we return to the Founders' vision of a limited government that only makes promises it can keep.  Otherwise we'll crash on a runaway system that favors the election of opportunistic, short-sighted politicians with extraordinary abilities to lie in a convincing manner.  All competitive systems favor certain talents.  Political systems that run on claims to welfare favor the best liars.  </P>

<P>	When we consider reform in this Age of Entitlement, remember a constant of political economy: in all systems at all times, wealth and political power go together.  Expanding government entitlements ultimately hurts the poor and debases the moral quality of politicians.  In an Age of Entitlement, civic virtue is an endangered attribute. </P>

<P> 	Public policy failures can take their toll on economic efficiency, ecological integrity, and even human lives.  These failures are endemic to fisheries commons the world over.  Recent issues of Field and Stream, Scientific American, and National Geographic all featured stories about the dire straits of our fisheries.</P>

<P>	Now the Bering Sea brings tragic news of a third outcome of poor policy: dead fishermen. The seven crewmembers of the Seattle-based Pacesetter were safety conscious.  They fell victim to callous policies which unnecessarily endanger lives of fishermen.  The Alaskan crab fishery's open-access nature encourages a mad scramble for catches in excess of sustainable yield.  The scramble is &quot;mad&quot; not only because it's exceedingly dangerous but because society is left worse off whether the risky fishermen succeed or fail.  The system rewards overfishing, and it biases how and when to fish - even if fishermen die in the attempt. </P>

<P>	Peaceful government policies kill people all the time (e.g. CAFE standards which trade blood for oil).  Seldom are they so obvious and direct as in the fishery.  When lost lives are compounded with squandered resources and fears of a global fishery crash, even politicians might place public interest above parochial advantage.</P>

<P>	The tragedy of the fisheries commons became apparent after the 1960s, when world fish stocks collapsed under increasing fishing pressure.  Reform proposals include banishing foreign fishing fleets, quotas, requiring primitive fishing techniques, and satellite surveillance.  By examining the successes and failures of various efforts, we see what makes institutions succeed or fail.</P>

<P>	They usually fail for one reason:  appropriate responsibility for conservation lies not with beneficiaries -- fishery communities.</P>

<P>	There are many examples of bureaucrats regulating from afar, legislators ruling from on high, and monitors watching from a distance.  Remote institutions neglect local conditions.  When central planners set rules, quotas, and limits, alien practices trump local traditions and customs.  </P>

<P>	Distant legislators, central planners, and bureaucrats rarely manage effectively.  Regulations have adverse consequences, quotas lead to waste, and limits are broken.  Policing and sanctioning of fishermen by outsiders is often misguided or absent.  Low-cost means of monitoring and resolving conflicts can't be provided by underfunded state policemen and international courts.  Local fishermen too easily subvert regulations, and foreigners make off with whatever fish they can while filling the coffers afar.  Alien systems generally fail.</P>

<P>	But some got it right.  In Alanya, Turkey, a fishing village evolved an ingenious solution to their fishery in jeopardy of overfishing.  By drawing lots for fishing locations at the beginning of each season, and then rotating to a new position each day, the number of fishermen in each spot is controlled.  If anyone crosses into another's site, the fisherman there will certainly notice and has incentive to report it.  No outside enforcer is required.  Every fisherman's vested interest in their 'spot of the day' provides incentives to monitor.  Limited entry and effective enforcement are low cost, stable, and local.</P>

<P>	In the Philippines, reef fishermen using explosives and cyanide to capture exotic fish have sewn the seeds of the ecosystem's destruction by both overfishing and killing the coral reef.  Establishing offshore marine sanctuaries, where explosives and cyanide are prohibited, has reversed the tide.  Fishermen are behaving responsibly, and empty nets are starting to fill.  Illegal night fishing by foreign fleets jeopardizes the rebounding fish sanctuaries.  Local communities' authority to protect their resources must carry force and respect. </P>

<P>	Managers of the South Pacific fisheries are widely credited with success.  Vast ocean stretches are dotted with tiny island nations whose national incomes are dwarfed by the foreign companies fishing their waters.  But those nations, against the odds, have formed an institution from the ground up.  They implemented an integrated and coordinated management approach and avoided overcapitalization, wasteful regulation, and international conflict.</P>

<P>	These cases provide valuable lessons.  The stories of communities in Turkey, the Philippines, and the South Pacific, teach us that those with long-term vested interests in fishery viability usually act responsibly.  People with a stake in the future, won't act like there's no tomorrow.  In contrast, open-access fisheries invite disruptive outsiders with little incentive for sustainable behavior.  That is why enduring institutions tend to flow from the community level.  Fishing villages recognize the importance of preserving this resource.  Their very livelihoods depend on it.</P>

<P>	Successful reform links the economic health of the fishermen and managers with the biological health of the fishery.  The fishermen and the fish both lose out if decisions about when, where, and how to fish are made by those not held accountable.  Fishermen know more about local conditions and have stronger incentives to improve them.  Bureaucrats and politicians don't benefit from a healthy fishery the way a fishing community does.  </P>

<P>	We can apply the important lessons of successful institutions to prevent future tragedies.  Reforms can't bring back the Pacesetter.  But their sacrifice might motivate responsible reform.  This would be a great tribute to good men lost.</P>

<P>	The epicenter of Ecotopia lies somewhere in the area encircled by Bellingham, Eugene, and Bozeman.  Four colleges of forestry, dozens of environmental groups, and busloads of environmental writers are based there.  Hence, the federal land management agencies are under intense scrutiny.  But even here, the institutional arrangements are so perverse that often management is grossly pathological, ecologically insensitive and economically wasteful   Many analysts now question the justification for federal management of commercial timber land.</P>

<P> 	The woeful performance of agencies like the Forest Service is not due to incompetent or evil people within those bureaucracies.  Rather, bad institutions generate incentives and information which lead smart, well-intentioned people to do harmful things.  The real need is for better economic and legal arrangements, not better people.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service came from progressive era fantasies a century ago.  In <CITE>Public Lands and Private Rights</CITE>, Robert Nelson of the University of Maryland describes the progressive's religion.  Their philosophy requires centralized management by scientifically trained professionals.  They believed that good management can only come from the government, from trained professionals in the Forest Service.  In their view the private sector was incapable of responsible forest management.  Increasingly, evidence mounts that the progressives had it exactly backwards.</P>

<P> 	Professor Nelson points out that, despite this conviction, &quot;the history of the public lands is filled with laws that had lofty purposes and achieve dismal results&quot;.  Bureaucratic politics trumps ecology, economics, and ethics.  Recent events in our Ecotopia illustrate the general problem. </P>

<P> 	275 acres of scorched or burned trees were sold in a remote pocket of the Thunder Mountains in the Okanogan National Forest, Washington.  The salvage logging rider to the 1995 Recissions Bill keeps the public from appeal the timber sale.  Politics exempted salvage sales from environmental regulations.  Logging this area imperils rare lynx habitat and salmon runs.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service spent over $200,000 to plan the Thunder Mountain timber sale.  Its first offering in October yielded no bids from industry.  The Forest Service re-offered that sale two months later, after lowering environmental standards.  This time Omak Wood Products, Vaagen Brothers, and Acord placed bids.  However, they were outbid by the <A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~nwea">Northwest Ecosystem Alliance</A> (NWEA), an environmental group.  Their $29,000 bid marks the first time an environmental group has outbid timber companies for logging rights.  This is a milestone in the co-evolution of environmentalism and economics.  </P>

<P> 	The USFS is likely to reject NWEA's high bid because they vow to let the trees stand.ÊÊAccording to Mitch Friedman, NWEA's Executive Director, &quot;The best result for all concerned would be for the Forest Service to take our money.... and allow us to protect the trees for the length of a rotation - maybe 100 years.&quot;  Unfortunately, federal regulations mandate that purchasers be &quot;responsible for&quot; cutting the trees.  The Forest Service says it will disqualify purchasers who lack such &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot;.</P>

<P> 	Throughout time and across cultures, wealth, education, and environmental concerns are positively correlated.  As education and prosperity levels rise, so do environmental sensitivities and interests.  But environmental amenities have long been thought of as luxury goods.  Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service chief, argued with John Muir that material considerations must trump all others.  The national forests were to be federally run as an efficient and responsible business.  </P>

<P> 	While resource extraction drove the American West's economy in 1897, diverse environmental values are helping drive the &quot;new&quot; West's emerging economy in 1997.  Recreation, biodiversity and scenic vistas, along with traditional commodities, represent vital economic resources.  Wildlands surrounding cities contribute to the high quality of life and attract businesses to Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies communities.  And, contrary to expectations of progressive era zealots, private timberland owners have proven far more efficient, innovative, and progressive than federal agencies.</P>

<P> 	Here's how the amenity economy evolves.  Public, non-governmental entrepreneurs identify the interests of those valuing the non-commodity features of forests.  But when environmental entrepreneurs aggregate these interests, they are often stymied by the bureaucratic politics of federal caretakers.  NWEA's high bid on Forest Service lands exemplifies this.  Professor Nelson, a U.S. Department of Interior economist for over 20 years, finds that, &quot;it is most of all the old scientific management theories of the progressive era that stand as a barrier to the development of new institutions for the public lands&quot;. </P>

<P> 	The Forest Service effectively blocks the evolutionary path of the forest economy.  The centralized planning imposed last century has failed to keep pace with the success of private forestry and with the complex and changing values of our modern economy.  Politics and the budgetary process systematically reward federal 'scientific managers' for losing money on environmentally destructive activities.  The Thunder Mountain salvage sale will cost the U.S. Treasury at least $171,000.  The costs of environmental amelioration will follow.  And the non-financial costs to lynx, salmon, lovers of these natural systems, and fiscal conservatives will be even higher.</P>

<P>	As we approach the centennial of the national forest system, it's time to ask if the federal government should even be involved in managing commercial timber.  Central planning fails in the Forest Service as it did in the Soviet Union.  It's time for second thoughts about sylvan socialism.</P>

<P>	The feuding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hooters chain of restaurants results from government overstepping its bounds.  Government has made &quot;Hooters&quot; a household name by stimulating confrontations between market forces and those who abhor sexism and their allies in the Nanny State.</P>

<P>	People become hot and bothered over Hooters simply because &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; leave so little to the imagination.  Thus, the EEOC has targeted them.  The very thought that a business could provide an opportunity for waitresses to serve Buffalo wings with a side order of sex appeal infuriates the P.C. crowd at the EEOC.  How can the politically incorrect restaurant that provides &quot;Bunnies for Bubbas&quot; be allowed to operate?  The EEOC's calling is to bring enlightened social engineering to the masses.  Hooters' success demands their special attention.</P>

<P>	And that's precisely what happened.  No disgruntled male job applicant filed a grievance prior to the controversy.  But Hooters' very existence irritates 'Nanny State' regulators at the EEOC.  So the EEOC initiated its own three-year investigation.</P>

<P>	At an Indianapolis Hooters, for example, waitresses routinely earn from $425 to $600 for their 20-hour work week.  And in the last three years, this Hooters has tossed out a total of five people for offensive language.  And once, only once, a man inappropriately touched a Hooters Girl and spent two weeks in jail for assault.  Look, enjoy, but behave yourself.  The system seems to work.</P>

<P>	The Reno Hooters provides another excellent example.  This restaurant is a bastion of conservatism in a city ruled by casinos, showgirls, and genuinely scantily-clad cocktail waitresses.  But the EEOC is scrutinizing Hooters, not Caesar's Palace.  This is because the law recognizes that some positions are intrinsically gender-biased.  Cowgirls and showgirls are girls, Lady Macbeth is a lady, and women's restroom attendants are women.</P>

<P>	But Hooters Girls can be boys, according to EEOC investigators.  They concluded that Hooters is just a restaurant.  In their estimation, men can fill a Hooters' tank top and serve appetizers just as well as women.  Hence, the EEOC fines Hooters $22 million, mandates that 40% of Hooters Girls be men, and demands that Hooters provide scholarships and sensitivity training to benefit men.  What country are we living in? </P>

<P>	Some people support the EEOC's ruling, some would leaveÊHooters alone, and others would simply wipe Hooters and its 13,000 employees off the map for its insult to politically correct sensitivities.  Ironically, regardless of one's feelings about Hooters, the EEOC is doing a great disservice to everyone.  Here's how.</P>

<P>	EEOC rulings penalize Hooters.  Hooters responds by rejecting the EEOC determination that they are merely a restaurant.  Hooters asserts, and is prepared to vigorously defend, that their primary mission is &quot;providing vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;  The EEOC transforms the food and drink into side dishes.  The Hooters Girls must be the main attraction.  Only then can Hooters justify its hiring practice.</P>

<P>	That's Hooters' escape route.  When the EEOC forbids Hooters Girls from using sex appeal to sell food, then Hooters must prove that they are using sex appeal to sell sex.  The EEOC transforms Hooters from a gimmicky restaurant into a flesh-peddling bar.  The law protects the hiring practice of strip clubs, and Hooters can find sanctuary in that status.</P>

<P>	Thus, as usual, the Nanny State's efforts backfire.  Shielding the prudes and politically correct who cannot tolerate establishments like Hooters pushes Hooters even farther down a scurrilous path that further debases America. </P>

<P>	It is a familiar and predictable result.  Prohibiting some behavior causes perverse and unintended outcomes.  Coercing Hooters to fall into line with the Nanny State's singular vision of how to serve beer will do two things: (1) rob a great many people of benefits as employees, managers, and customers of Hooters; and (2) force Hooters to make selling sex its first priority.  </P>

<P>	The EEOC and the Nanny State would do well to learn an important lesson from the queen of all nannies, Mary Poppins, who sang, &quot;Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot;  Incentives make the unpalatable palatable.  This is how Hooters uses Hooter Girls to make their burgers and wings appetizing.  In the restaurant business, as in the environmental business, market forces encourage entrepreneurs to innovate enterprises that meet the market test.  Whereas coercion is counterproductive, we should recognize that market incentives often provide the best means to coordinate social actions.  Even when we find the result distasteful, the result is usually preferable to coercion.</P>

<P>	The fundamental problem with prohibiting Hooters Girls is that people want them and other people want to become them.  The managers support them.  The clientele rewards them with their hard-earned money.  And the Girls clearly prefer this work to other work.  With such powerful advantages, Hooters won't swallow the EEOC's 'medicine' without a fight.  By defying these incentives, the EEOC's command-and-control approach yields harmful and perverse results.  This is evidenced by Hooters' newfound emphasis on &quot;vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;</P>

<P>	Hooters maintains 175 restaurants in 38 states and is growing.  It is no wonder that the EEOC, an artifact of the Nanny State, cannot stand to see success based on individual liberty and sexist behavior.</P>

<P>    Here's a benchmark to evaluate environmental policy: economic security and environmental protection go together. Conversely, when environmental policies thwart material wants, green goals languish.  Only when environmental policies foster economic security and productivity can we reasonably expect long term protection.  This understanding helps us protect environmental values.</P>

<P> Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Garrett Hardins' &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; are bench marks of environmental history.  Both works were in process for years, noted only by a few professionals and by a elite audience.  In October of 1993 a new benchmark of environmental thinking was established at Airlie House, a conference center near Washington D.C.  Under the auspices of the Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation, a group of 60 people from 20 countries met to reconsider environmentalism.  The group included anthropologists, field biologists, tribal leaders and donors.  </P>

<P> Their thinking is summarized in a brief, attractive booklet, The View from Airlie House.   They concluded that despite elaborate efforts, the conventional approach to conservation wasn't working.  One critical reason is strategic:  </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The chief strategy of conservationists for more than a century has been exclusionary and implicitly misanthropic....establish protected areas  ...and then safeguarding these areas by carefully limiting human use....The methods of this strategy have been proscription and enforcement--laws and penalties, wardens and guns, in some cases fences and gates....Biological diversity can't be preserved...by setting it aside within protected areas.
&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The participants identified five flaws in this approach.  First is the problem inherent to &quot;island ecology&quot;.  Small protected areas lose diversity over time.  Second, this protected area strategy is too costly and scattered to protect the world's biologically rich landscapes.  Third, governments lack the means to protect borders of sanctuaries.  Fourth, &quot;The protected-area approach, dependent on centralized power and top-down planning, has often robbed rural communities of their traditional user-rights over forests, waters, fisheries, and wildlife, without offering appropriate remuneration.&quot;  Hence, local people see conservation efforts as anti-development and anti-people.  </P>

<P> Finally, this strategy amplifies conflict.  &quot;Blockading rural people against the use of their own landscape without offering them viable alternatives will always, to the blockaded, seem perverse and intolerable.  And will always, consequently be futile.&quot;  Although the focus at Airlie House was upon the Third World, this is also a good but incomplete explanation of the origins of the Wise Use Movement in the American West.  The institutions that yield anti-protection sentiments throughout the Third World operate in the rural areas of the US and Canada.</P>

<P> The approach developed at Airlie is based on a series of case studies from around the world.  It features positive local participation, not proscription and enforcement alone.  It seeks ways to make local communities the beneficiaries and custodians of conservation efforts.  The phrase &quot;community-based conservation&quot; captures the essence of their approach.  </P>

<P> Earlier conservation efforts to protect public goods were based on exclusion and enforcement.  This approach isn't viable over the long term.  Communal use rights and systems of tenure are ignored.  Resources go to the politically favored.  This is the prevailing outcome when ever politicians can buy favor by granting access to natural resources.  </P>

<P> What's true in America is even stronger in third world nations.  Absence secure tenure, rural communities lack standing in decision making.  As a result, they lack incentives to manage for sustainability.  Their incentives are to consider short term interests and immediate gain.  Over the long term, environmental protection is impossible with out recognition of property rights and markets.  </P>

<P> It will be difficult for many greens, however sincere or intelligent,  to accept the View from Airlie, i.e., the positive linkage between use by local people and the  protection of biodiversity.  In today's environmental culture economy and ecology don't often mix.  The Foundation for Deep Ecology wants us to ignore the laws of economics.  Unfortunately for them, economic behavior seems &quot;hard wired&quot;  into our nature by the evolutionary process.  </P>

<P> But fortunately, well off, well educated people normally consider environmental quality an essential goal for a responsible culture.  According to Evert Ladd of the American Enterprise Institute, nearly three quarters of American voters consider themselves environmentalists. </P>

<P> Politicians who ignore this pervasive pro environmental feeling are in peril.  Voters did not reject environmental goals in the 1994 election.  Rather they found  repugnant the statist, bureaucratic, command-and-control means to green ends exemplified by the EPA's approach to wetlands and its management of Super Fund sites.  </P>

<P> Free market and free trade advocates are also challenged by the View from Airlie.  Strong local communities are often eroded by international trade.  Local markets involve personal relations and feelings.  Can they be protected from the relentless workings of the market process at the international level?  It's not clear that the answer is yes.  The drive toward bottom line efficiency usually erodes traditions--including the sense of place so critical to preservation.</P>

<P> The View from Airlie offers an innovative perspective on effective and viable protection of ecological values.  This is progress.  We've tried command and control and found it wanting.  It's time for community-based conservation and for rethinking environmentalism.  </P>

<LI>``If the [Republicans] don't come around, we'll use children's health the way we used Medicare, and that's a promise and a commitment,'' AFL-CIO president John Sweeney told the American Public health Association recently. We have been warned: an alleged upsurge in the number of children without health insurance will figure prominently in the liberal establishment's Winter-Spring Offensive. But Merrill Matthews, writing for the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, points out that a) the ``upsurge'' is still quite small; b) costly mandated benefits, like compulsory maternity leave, are forcing employers to cancel health-insurance policies, exposing children; and c), uninsured children are disproportionately immigrants and the children of immigrants -- overall, 40.6 per cent of foreign-born non-citizens were uninsured in 1995, versus only 13.6 per cent of the native-born. ``Any nationwide program for children threatens to evolve into an entitlement program primarily benefitting legal and illegal immigrants,'' writes Matthews. he and the NCPA are to be congratulated for exposing liberal-establishment hokum -- and for ignoring conservative-establishment blindness about the immigrant dimension of  many American policy problems.

<LI>The Clinton Administration wants legalized pot out of California and Arizona and in the White House where it belongs.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Soon enough it will be gut-check time again for congressional Republicans on race preferences. Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) is set to re-introduce his bill banning racial discrimination in federal hiring, promotions, and contracts early in the 105th Congress. Judiciary Committee Chairman henry Hyde is willing to give the legislation an airing in his committee, which would probably pass it in one form or another. The outstanding question is whether the House leadership will get behind the bill and allow a vote on the House floor. memories of last year, when leadership not only sat on the Canady bill but countenanced the reauthorization of federal programs shot through with quotas and set-asides, are not encouraging. Since then, of course, California voters dramatically demonstrated their opposition to state-sponsored discrimination. When will Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey?

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Moderate Republicans, as everyone knows, are trying hard to pull their party back to mainstream America. So what's their top priority this year? According to John McCaslin in the Washington Times, the congressmen in the ``Tuesday Lunch Brunch'' want to restore funds to the National Endowment for the Arts. Memo to the members: if crucifixes in urine represented mainstream America, there wouldn't have been a GOP majority in the first place.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Having had an attack of common sense when ``Ebonics'' first hit the news, the usual suspects are now engaged in revisionism. The Oakland school board wasn't really going to teach Ebonics; it wasn't really suggesting that Ebonics had a basis in black genes; it wasn't really trolling for federal cash from bilingual programs. Instead, the board was looking for a ``bridge'' between Ebonics and standard English, as teachers under the new dispensation would teach the latter, but not ridicule the former. Never mind that any fair reading of the board's original resolution makes it clear that it was doing exactly what it was accused of doing. And never mind the fact that bilingual education, as currently practiced, means teaching ``native'' languages, and not English. Ecen the mild, revisionist proposal makes no sense. In other periods of American history, waves of immigrants have learned English without teachers who were ``sensitive'' to their first language. The kids will get over being told they be doing something wrong. They won't get over being told they're doing something right when they aren't.

<LI>On Meet the Press, Anthony Lake, the Administration's nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, was asked whether he believed Alger Hiss was a spy. His answer: ``I've read a couple of books that certainly offered a lot of evidence that he may have been. I don't think it's conclusive.'' Report from the late CIA: ``The U.S.S. Maine -- Sunk, or Afloat? You be the judge.''

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Texas GOP Chairman Tom Pauken is running better than expected in his bid to succeed Haley Barbour as chairman of the Republican National Committee. Pauken pledges to uproot the Washington-based consultants responsible for the party's ``poll-driven policy'' and to tend the grassroots. At a Washington press briefing, he appeared ready for the national spotlight, polished, sure-footed, and articulate. Neither of the leading candidates, ex-Gov. Steve Merrill of New Hampshire and RNC General Counsel David Norcross of New Jersey, has enough votes at present to win election at the January 17 meeting. Committee members fear that a Merrill chairmanship would be a full-employment program for the Dole campaign and that Norcross would represent Christine Todd Whitman's Northeast wing of the GOP. Pauken's prospects are hurt by the opposition of Barbour himself and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, but if he can put together a coalition with conservative competitors like Jim Nicholson of Colorado and Chuck Yob of Michigan, he has a shot -- and deserves to win.
<P>

<LI>Sen. Christopher Dodd, eight days before the elections, expressed his weariness with the campaign and said that in a week plus one day he could tell the truth ``again.'' We're following this story closely and will let you know when he does.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


<LI>What could be more American? According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, at least 19 non-citizens voted in November's race between Rep. Bob Dornan (R., Calif.) and Loretta Sanchez, which Miss Sanchez won by less than 1,000 votes. The illegal voters were registered by the group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional (National Mexican Brotherhood), which registered roughly 1,300 people this year, nearly 600 of whom voted in the Dornan - Sanchez race. The Times found its 19 illegal voters out of a random sample of a mere 64 registered voters. How many more were there? No one knows. Small wonder a non-citizen feels comfortable voting in American elections: they are fast becoming as secure and reliable as those back home.

<P>

<LI>Mrs. Shucheng Huang, 55, had to look up the word ``strike'' when the United Auto Workers local called one at Abex Friction Products in April. But since then she has learned quite a bit about the real meaning of ``organized labor.'' When she continued to work, one of her car windows was broken. Two weeks later, a severed cow's head was left on her hood. A slingshot was used to smash her windshield while she was parking. Other workers had their tires slashed and windows broken, or awoke to find cattle heads in their yards. Someone shot at a window of Thomas Jones's house, and a message on the men's room wall at the plant said, ``Tom Jones, you're going to be dead before it's over with'' (quote courtesy of Tim Sullivan, Northern Virginia Daily). The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation has filed suit on behalf of ten workers who were targeted by the UAW's terror campaign. Such coercion is commonplace. What's especially scandalous is that under federal law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, union violence is legal if directed toward ``legitimate union objectives'' (U.S. v. Emmons, 1973). Abuses are inevitable under a regime of forced unionism. But if Congress is not yet ready to pass a National Right to Work Act, it should at least hold hearings on union thuggery and pass a Freedom from Violence Act removing union officials' status as a class above the law.
<P>

<LI>We have been asked to explain how Mr. Newt's problems differ from the Administration's. Easy. Mr. Newt is accused of an ethics violation, whereas Mr. Clinton's wife, friends, associates, fundraisers, business partners, Cabinet members, lawyers, White House staffers, political operatives, cronies, and ``Arkansas mafia'' are seldom accused of anything worse than felonies. Next.

<LI>Chinese Premier Li Peng paid a holiday visit to Moscow December 26 - 28, meeting with Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and setting the stage for an April summit in Moscow between Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Ever since Yeltsin's triumphal visit to Peking last spring, the relationship has blossomed into what both sides call a ``strategic partnership.'' The Chinese endorse Russian stands on Chechnya and NATO enlargement; the Russians return the favor by endorsing Chinese positions on human rights, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The Russians are selling SU-27 jet fighters and related production technology to China. Both sides condemn the notion that any superpower should dictate to other countries. (In case you wondered, that means us.) Meanwhile, the Clinton Administration proceeds on the assumption that Russia and China are our friends.
<P>

<P>


<LI>Slobodan Milosevic has tried hard to shut down B-92, Serbia's only non-government-controlled radio station. Newly independent media in Poland and the Czech Republic struggle for survival. Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, those working to plant democracy look to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to keep broadcasting the unfiltered truth -- as a check on unreconstructed Communists, as a standard for fledgling free media to emulate, and as a symbol of the West's support for their democratic future. Yet RFE/RL is embattled in Congress: budget cuts have eliminated its Hungarian service and threaten to curtail its Czech and Polish services. Serbo-Croatian broadcasting urgently needs to be expanded, but the money isn't there. All federal funding for RFE/RL is due to end in December 1999. This makes no  sense. Eastern Europeans -- and we -- need RFE/RL.

<LI>What do Shakespeare, Mozart, and Leonardo have in common? Each is a towering figure in European culture and each has been rejected as too controversial to appear on the new Euro currency. The Bard slammed Jews, Mozart puffed the Masons, Leonardo might have been homosexual. Despairing of famous Europeans, the European Monetary Institute has decreed that the new currency will feature architecture -- gateways, windows, bridges. Or, as one Euro-skeptic put it, ``It will remind people that a single currency is a gateway to mass unemployment, a window to misery, and a bridge to civil unrest.''

<LI>Sterling Burnett of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas has dug up a nice 1990 quote from Timothy Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, who is generally credited with giving U.S. foreign policy an increasingly Green hue: ``We've got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.'' It is interesting to know that the Administration's top Green doesn't really care whether the theory of global warming is correct. It's a good scare, and that's enough.

<LI>Maryland (which never seceded from the Union) allowed the Sons of Confederate Veterans to buy specialty license plates showing the Stars and Bars -- until black and liberal politicians objected. South Carolina properly removed the Confederate battle flag from its Capitol dome, where it implicitly claimed the respect of all South Carolinians, and where it recalled the state's open support of slavery 136 years ago. But a specialty license plate allows individuals to honor the memory of other individuals, whose actions were often gallant, and whose motives were mixed. Robert E. Lee had freed his slaves. Some Confederate soldiers were ex-slaves. It is peculiarly modern to despise losers. The ultimate losers are ourselves.

<LI>Even for liberalism in its late, decadent stage, it's a stretch to make a hero out of a racist, sexist scumbag like Larry Flynt, but the nation's opinion leaders are managing. Director Milos Forman has made a film, The People v. Larry Flynt, that portrays the Hustler publisher as a charming, witty man and a passionate defender of First Amendment freedoms. Forman makes Flynt lament not being able to have more children, though he abandoned five of them, one of whom accuses him of having sexually molested her. The film skips over the racist cartoons and the violent, degrading depictions of sex in the magazine. The only odious characters in the film are nuns, Jerry Falwell, and anyone else offended by Flynt's product. That The People v. Larry Flynt is being hailed as ``timely,'' ``important,'' and even ``patriotic'' art just marks another step in the American elite's slouch toward Gomorrah.

Vexing indeed. Some would call it dysthanasia. Or homicide.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>O</font> live as a religious believer in the terrestrial city is necessarily to experience divided loyalties. Short of the Kingdom of God, complete justice can never reign, and all temporal allegiances must be provisional. The modern American social order is sufficiently benevolent that we are usually only dimly aware of this tension. For the editors and contributors to a symposium in <I>First Things</I>, an increasingly influential conservative journal on religion and public life, however, recent judicial decisions have put the issue in stark relief.
<P>
The November symposium was entitled ``The End of Democracy?: The Judicial Usurpation of Politics.'' The symposiasts -- Robert Bork, Russell Hittinger, Hadley Arkes, Charles W. Colson, and Robert P. George -- condemned recent judicial activism, particularly regarding abortion, euthanasia, and homosexuality, as both procedurally undemocratic and substantively immoral or unjust. Hittinger, a professor at the University of Tulsa, argued that these decisions not only ``deny protection to the weak and vulnerable'' and ``systematically remove the legal and political ability of the people to redress the situation,'' but raise the invidious principles to the level of ``essential features of the constitutional order.'' Further, the Supreme Court has set itself against religious believers by nullifying laws allegedly motivated by religion or even the belief that ``there is an ethic and a morality which transcend human invention'' (Justice Antony Kennedy's words in <I>Romer</I> v. <I>Evans</I>).
<P>
While most conservative analyses of the courts stop at or before this point, <I>FT</I> also discussed possible responses to this ``usurpation.'' What troubled most of those who have since commented on the symposium was the editors' introductory statement that we may ``have reached or are reaching the point where conscientious citizens can no longer give moral assent to the existing regime.'' The very legitimacy of the ``regime,'' they argued, was in question, and those conscientious citizens might eventually -- perhaps soon -- have to consider civil disobedience or even ``morally justified revolution.'' This use of the word ``regime'' was confusing: some critics took ``regime'' to mean something illegitimate by definition, like ``junta.'' Further, did illegitimacy attach to the Federal Government itself, as some paramilitary groups suggest, or merely to the practice of judicial rule? This confusion caused many commentators to miss the conditionality of the editors' position: that ``we are witnessing the end of democracy'' and will have to consider lawbreaking <I>if</I> the courts are not restrained, by themselves or others.
<P>
Of the symposiasts, only Colson went as far as (if not further than) <I>FT</I>'s editors. Writing that ``a showdown between church and state'' -- for which believers should prepare but not hope  -- ``may be inevitable,'' Colson surveyed the key Christian texts on the limits of political obligation, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s <I>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</I>. His conclusion: ``I have begun to believe that . . . we are fast approaching [the] point'' at which ``a believer must resist'' the government. Such resistance would, in the first instance, take the form of <I>persuasion</I>. ``Through her teaching and preaching office, the Church would need to expose the nature of the state's rebellion against God -- in effect, bringing the state under the transcendent judgment of God.'' If that failed, active disobedience would become necessary. The next step would be revolution, but ``this point, I believe, we have not yet reached.'' Unless that point is reached, religious conservatives must ``work relentlessly within the democratic process,'' and discussions of resistance should remain academic.
The others offered less drastic suggestions. Bork repeated his recent call for a constitutional amendment to allow the Congress to review court decisions by a majority vote or to eliminate the courts' power of constitutional review. He also suggested that elected officials not comply with unconstitutional Supreme Court decisions -- a position with a long history in American politics. Hittinger urged conservatives to treat issues like abortion as part of a ``broader constitutional crisis'' and, like Bork, advocated legislative remedies. If these measures did not work, he thought non-violent civil disobedience, presumably on the model of the civil-rights movement, would become necessary. 
<P>
Arkes, a professor at Amherst College and longtime <I>NR</I> contributor, offered no prescriptions. His distinct contribution was to focus attention on the implicit threat of the new judicial activism to people of orthodox faith, who he believes could find themselves excluded from the academy and the professions as the principle behind <I>Romer</I> -- that traditional moral views on homosexuality are tantamount to bigotry -- unfolds to the limits of its logic. Lastly, George, a professor of politics at Princeton University, labeled the current situation a ``crisis'' and ``a failure of American democ- racy.'' He called for ``conscientious objection,'' as when physicians in U.S. military hospitals refuse to perform abortions. He concludes that citizens must ask ``whether our regime is becoming the democratic 'tyrant state' about which [the Pope] warns.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he</font> reaction to the symposium was as sharp as it was swift. Leading neoconservatives Gertrude Himmelfarb, Walter Berns, and Peter Berger resigned their affiliations with <I>FT</I>. Bork wrote a letter disavowing any doubts about ``the legitimacy of the entire American 'regime''' (his article used the term ``illegitimacy'' only in connection with the Court's usurpations). <I>NR</I> [``First Things First,'' Nov. 11] also editorially criticized the suggestion that the regime was illegitimate. Norman Podhoretz, among others, detected in the symposium a whiff of the anti-American radicalism that had made the New Left so noisome in the Sixties. In the <I>Weekly Standard</I>, David Brooks relayed many of these charges and added two more: 1) that the symposiasts' fealty to abstract principle cut against the Oakeshottian ``Temper'' he took to be essential to conservatism, and 2) that their pessimism was neither warranted nor likely to serve conservatism's political prospects.
<P>
In her resignation letter, Miss Himmelfarb had issued her own tactical warning: <I>FT</I>'s ``irresponsible'' conduct would make it easier to portray ``any attempt by conservatives to introduce moral and religious considerations into 'the public square''' as dangerous. Liberals promptly sank to the challenge. Garry Wills, attentive to nuance as ever, claimed in a <I>New York Times</I> op-ed that the symposiasts ``made arguments indistinguishable from those advanced by the militias.'' (Evidently Mr. Wills knows militias that cite classical philosophers and papal encyclicals and worry more about assisted suicide than gun control.) It was probably inevitable that some journalist would take the caricature a step further.
<P>
Which brings us to Jacob Heilbrunn. According to ``Neocon v. Theocon,'' his cover story in <I>The New Republic</I>, <I>FT</I> brought into the open ``a full-fledged war between two leading groups of conservative intellectuals.'' In one corner are ``the mostly Jewish neoconservatives,'' followers of political theorist Leo Strauss, who believe that ``America was founded on an idea -- a commitment to the rights of man embodied in the Declaration of Independence.'' The ``theocons,'' on the other hand, are<P>
<blockquote><small> mostly Catholic intellectuals who are attempting to construct a Christian theory of politics that directly threatens the entire neoconservative philosophy. This attempt, in the eyes of at least some of the neocons, also directly threatens Jews. . . . The theocons, too, argue that America is rooted in an idea, but they believe that idea is Christianity. In their view, the United States is first and foremost a Christian nation, governed ultimately by natural law.</small>
</blockquote>
<P>

Heilbrunn describes the theocons as ``Thomists, would-be prophets of a new Age of Aquinas.'' Their ``founding father'' is the theologian Germain Grisez, their public face that of Alan Keyes.
<P>
Heilbrunn's <I>New Republic</I> article is directed not so much against the ``theocons'' as against the neocons. Michael Lind, Heilbrunn's sometime collaborator, has cast crafty neoconservative Jews as having opportunistically ascended to the intellectual leadership of a conservative movement whose rank-and-file is made up of anti-Semitic evangelical Christians. Heilbrunn's article is perhaps best seen as the second installment of this ``sellout of the neoconservative Jews'' thesis: now they've opportunistically allied themselves with even craftier anti-Semitic Catholics.
<P>
It's a well-constructed story line: gripping, coherent -- and entirely fictional. The <I>First Things</I> symposiasts included two Catholics (Hittinger and George), true, but also two Protestants (Bork and Colson), and one Jew (Arkes). Heilbrunn doesn't mention that Bork is not a Catholic, but takes note of ``his staunchly Catholic wife.'' (George's staunchly Jewish wife doesn't make an appearance.) The editors responsible for the introduction to the symposium included one Catholic (editor-in-chief Fr. Richard John Neuhaus), one Lutheran (editor James Nuechterlein), and one Jew (managing editor Matthew Berke).
<P>
A more central flaw in Heilbrunn's story is his utter (and at times laughable) incomprehension of Thomist natural-law theory, which is a branch of philosophy and not of theology. Indeed, it reminds me of the classic academic put-down to empty arguments: ``That's not right; it's not even wrong.'' 
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font<font size=+1>DHERENTS</font> of natural law believe that moral truths can be discovered through reason alone. As Prof. George puts it, ``What people like me are arguing is that the standard of public policy should be what reason can understand. So a view should stand or fall based on its reasonableness. Biblical tradition can be the carrier of wisdom on matters like same-sex marriage, as can the Talmud. But we don't appeal to the authority of the Bible or of the Catholic Church in making our case. We appeal to principles of rationality that are available to all people.'' So, for instance, when George and John Finnis of Oxford University testified in <I>Romer</I> -- an incident Heilbrunn records -- not once did they invoke the Bible or any authority other than reason itself; their reasoning was available to, and arguable by, non-believers. Indeed, natural law's Protestant critics have disparaged it precisely for its reliance on human reason in matters of moral consequence. If Thomism were merely a stalking horse for a ``Christian nation,'' then people like David Novak -- a rabbi who is also a natural-law theorist, student of Grisez, and member of <I>FT</I>'s editorial board -- shouldn't exist.
<P>
Similarly, Heilbrunn's account of the conservative ``battle over the identity of the American nation'' doesn't even rise to the level of being wrong. If there is a distinctively conservative theory of American nationhood, it isn't any sort of ``idea nation'' thesis, let alone a ``Christian nation'' idea, but rather the culturalist view of nationhood adumbrated by <I>NR</I> and in particular by John O'Sullivan (a Catholic, for those keeping score). Heilbrunn provides no evidence for his claim that the ``Christian nation'' thesis is central to ``American Catholic conservatism,'' because there isn't any. Perhaps R. J. Rushdoony or John Lofton believes in religious tests for office, but no prominent mainstream conservative intellectual does. <I>NR</I>'s David Klinghoffer, in some of his writings, seems to endorse the view that divine law should sometimes be imposed on non-believers; I can't think of a contemporary conservative Christian intellectual who agrees. Fr. Neuhaus and Prof. George both subscribe to the ``neoconservative'' view that the principles of the Declaration of Independence constitute American nationhood. It is Heilbrunn who can't make up his mind about the Declaration. Judge Bork and the theocons are damned for rejecting it, Alan Keyes for embracing it too closely. (It does, after all, speak of people being ``endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.'')
<P>
The attempt to cast Germain Grisez as the <I>eminence grisez</I> of the Catholic conspiracy against democracy is singularly inappropriate, since Grisez isn't primarily a political theorist and indeed did not hear of the <I>FT</I> symposium until after publication. Moreover, Grisez, George, and Finnis (who believe moral truths can be derived from self-evident first premises) are heterodox among Thomists (most of whom think moral truth can be derived from human nature). Prof. Hittinger wrote an entire book, <I>A Critique of the New Natural Law Theory</I>, rebutting Grisez.
<P>
And Fr. Neuhaus belongs to neither camp. As one might expect of a convert from Lutheranism, he's drawn more to Augustine than to Aquinas. Meanwhile, Alan Keyes, the supposed champion of the Catholics who are supposedly at odds with Jewish Straussian neocons, is a Straussian -- and one who devoted a pre-primary speech in New Hampshire to blasting the idea of a ``Christian nation.'' Finally, Norman Podhoretz -- who is surely a neocon if the term means anything any more -- is no Straussian. Heilbrunn's map of the Right just doesn't do justice to the intellectual geography he tries to cover. It's rather like those early maps of Africa that, though topographically unreliable, confidently declared: ``There be lions here.''
<P>
Heilbrunn's journalistic malpractice extends to his use of quotation and paraphrase. He describes Miss Himmelfarb's letter as having ``warned that Catholics threatened to undermine the very thing they claimed to want, the ordering of American society according to Judaeo-Christian ethics.'' In fact, her letter said <I>nothing</I> about Catholics; Heilbrunn was putting words in her mouth to make it seem that she accepted his Jews-v.-Catholics framework. He deploys his shoddiest tactic, however, on Prof. George. In his <I>FT</I> essay, George wrote that the ``doctrine of the necessary conformity of civil law to moral truth long predates the rise of modern democracy. It is present in both Plato and Aristotle, and was given careful, systematic expression by St. Thomas Aquinas. It has been a central feature of the tradition of papal social teaching.'' George's reference to Plato and Aristotle is inconvenient to Heilbrunn's argument that Catholic ``theocons'' are trying to impose their religious views on the nation. So he simply uses ellipses to eliminate it. (In his article, the second sentence of the passage reads, ``It . . . was given careful'' etc.) Heilbrunn also chooses not to quote George's comment a few paragraphs later: ``These are no mere sectarian teachings. Belief that laws and the regimes that make and enforce them must be evaluated by reference to universal standards of justice is shared by people of different faiths and of no particular faith.''
<P>
Heilbrunn's cascading confusions would matter little (except to those whose views he distorted) were they not coupled with astonishingly reckless charges. Take the claim, quoted above, that the so-called ``theocon'' enterprise ``in the eyes of at least some of the neocons, also directly threatens Jews.'' No on-the-record or even off-the-record quotes are provided for that incendiary remark; nor is any argument for the plausibility of the underlying claim.
<P>
Toward the end of his article Heilbrunn casually slanders Thomists, about whom he demonstrably knows nothing, as ``not so much anti-American as un-American.'' Insinuations of Catholic disloyalty to America, reckless charges of Catholic anti-Semitism, slanderous portrayals of Catholic elites plotting to build a theocracy: Heilbrunn traffics in the most cliched forms of anti-Catholic bigotry. Perhaps he should have entitled his article <I>Protocols of the Elders of Rome</I>.
<P>
Presumably almost all conservatives, and other people of good will, will reject <I>TNR</I>'s attempt to drive a wedge between Catholics and Jews. But that is not to deny that the <i>FT</I> controversy has revealed real intra-conservative divisions. One of these divisions has less to do with Leo Strauss or Thomas Aquinas than with Thomas Hobbes, the early modern theorist of absolute sovereignty. The Hobbesian streak among conservative critics of the symposium was most evident in <I>NR</I>'s editorial, which argued, ``Our general obligation to obey the laws rests upon the fact that the laws protect us (against our fellow man), not upon the ultimate justice of the government's founding, still less (fortunately) upon its general moral character.'' Whatever else might be said of this view, it does seem at the very least in tension with the principles and spirit of the American Revolution, in particular with the principle of majority consent.
<P>
But the influence of Hobbesianism can also be detected in the insistence of many conservatives that the ``legitimacy'' of a political status quo should not be the subject of sustained public argument. To be sure, not every proposition is worth discussing. But once one has been raised, to say that it should not be discussed is self-defeating. More importantly, as <I>FT</I> has noted, the Supreme Court has itself raised the question of the legitimacy of the law. As Notre Dame Law Professor Gerard Bradley observes in his brilliant essay ``Shall We Ratify the New Constitution?'' recent Supreme Court decisions (most notably <I>Casey</I> and <I>Lee</I>) can reasonably be construed as asking the American people ``to ratify and thereby legitimate'' a constitution of the Court's devising. In that light, the <I>First Things</I> symposium was simply a resounding, ``No!''

The editors' reference to Nazi Germany -- which outraged many of the critics -- is a dicier issue. Quoting the papal encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> on the general point that a law's binding force on the conscience depends on its morality, they noted that the footnotes in the encyclical refer to earlier papal statements that specifically condemned Nazi crimes. The editors add, ``America is not and, please God, will never become Nazi Germany, but it is only blind hubris that denies it can happen here and, in peculiarly American ways, may be happening here.'' The passage, in other words, was intended as an antidote to an uncritical version of American exceptionalism that denies the possibility that human rights could ever be tyrannically violated here. Whether or not the argument was tactfully made, it ought to be openly debatable.
<P>
For many of the neoconservative critics of the symposium, the anti-American rhetoric of the 1960s was a formative, and traumatic, political experience. But the parallel is weak, the result of analyzing arguments formally rather than materially. Quips Bradley, ``Except for the hair, Hadley Arkes doesn't have much in common with Abbie Hoffman. Nor is Jerry Rubin the same as Dietrich Bonhoeffer.'' Or as Fr. Neuhaus puts it, ``There is nothing so elementary as that there are criteria for just and unjust government. It astonishes me that people think that we came up with something new or something retrieved from the ash heap of the Sixties.'' 
<P>
A very mild anti-American strain does indeed exist on the Right -- think of the number of conservatives who interpreted President Clinton's re-election as a verdict on the intellect or morality of the American public -- but conservatives remain more likely to make the opposite mistake of uncritically embracing populism. I'll get worried about anti-Americanism on the Right when I see Neuhaus burning a flag.
<P>
If anything, the symposium could be faulted for laying insufficient stress on the <I>permanent</I> nature of the tension between the demands of God and those of Caesar. Putting the symposium in such a context would have raised the needed alarms without being alarmist. It might then have reminded conservatives that liberty requires eternal vigilance -- without apocalyptic rhetoric. 
<P>
Meanwhile, if the Right is repeating an error of the late Sixties Left, perhaps it's factionalism: a tendency for intellectuals to get caught up in theoretical disputes while ignoring points of concordance that have far more practical relevance. Almost all conservatives agree that the federal judiciary has needlessly and destructively intervened in the nation's social and moral controversies (most recently when it blocked implementation of the California Civil Rights Initiative). Almost all conservatives agree that it's important to address the problem. If this debate concentrates the conservative mind on a program to rein in the courts and a strategy to advance that program -- if it makes efforts to curtail judicial review respectable -- all conservatives would have reason to cheer. Some conservatives may balk at delegitimizing the courts, but an aggressive campaign to <I>demystify</I> them is long overdue. Justice Scalia's recent dissents offer a model of how to do this.
<P>
<I>First Things</I> may also have performed another public service. After more than 16 years of sitting in the back of the Republican bus, social conservatives are getting restive. Already, important players like Gary Bauer and Phyllis Schlafly are taking shots at Ralph Reed's accommodationism and moving into Pat Buchanan's orbit -- which is to say, out of their alliance with the rest of the Right. Something good will have come of this debate if conservative intellectuals are awakened to grassroots discontent with the party's handling of moral issues, most importantly abortion. If the conservative coalition is to be kept together, that sentiment is going to have to be responsibly accommodated.

<H2>Remembering Mozart</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 20<br>


Events crowd around, and the journalist/commentator is especially aware of imminent developments. Will the hostages survive? Will Bill Clinton resign? Between this deadline and the appearance of these words, reflections on minute-by-minute crises run the risk of appearing rancid, or insensitive, or outside any general concern.
<P>
At home, before the deadline, we tuned in to A&E for its daily biography and got -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart! That roaring genius! And so my mind went back to my one very direct touch with Mozart.
<P>
It was some years ago, and the club I go to for a few days every summer imposed on me, as is its habit in its dealings with amateurs, a challenge. Would I perform on the harpsichord a stretch of music by Mozart?
<P>
One is conditioned to say yes, in such circumstances, the governing muse being: Everybody has to do his (not her) bit in order to fly the banner of amateur art.
<P>
I selected to conquer Mozart's 12 variations on the theme of ``<I>Ah, vous dirais-je, Maman</I>.'' That was one of the musical trifles Mozart brought off in his 21st year, taking a few hours off between operas, concertos, and symphonies. The English version of the French tune is ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'': Tum tum TUM TUM tum tum TAH, Tum tum tum tum what you are.
<P>
Mozart lovers can imagine him, perhaps on his 21st birthday, in a crowded salon:<P>
``Wolfgang, give us a tune!'' Wolfgang: ``On what theme?''<P>
``Oh, how about . . . 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'?''<P>
So he has another drink and then sits down at the keyboard and thrums out the theme. But Mozart being Mozart, he then improvises a variation on it. The crowd is delighted. ``Wait!'' he says. ``I've just started!'' He goes on to a second variation. And on and on, finishing with a 12th.<P>
The young crowd is ecstatic over the variations, which go from playful to solemn, from grand to sleepy, from sweet and simple to a crashing finale. More drinks are served and other things occupy the company, but the next morning an admirer says, ``Wolfgang, you really ought to write down what you did last night.''<P>
Two hundred years later I am slaving away, trying to stuff his extemporaneity into my fingers, spending more time in the effort than Mozart would have taken to write five symphonies and four operas.<P>
The dreadful moment approached, and there were 1,500 happy people there, warmed up by a dozen episodes preceding my nervous ordeal: rousing comedy sequences, songs, jokes, laughter. During that period I was backstage, struggling to keep my fingers warm and my heart stable.<P>
I had read that the great Glenn Gould nurtured his fingers before concert time by immersing them in bowls of warm water. I asked, imperially, for the same treatment, and a high official of a major U.S. corporation, doing his service to the muse, was designated to keep me supplied with warm water during the agonizing hour awaiting my tribulation.<P>
I could hear, through the heavy curtains, the roars of delight from the audience. The awful moment arrived when the master of ceremonies announced, ``And now we will have something really unusual! Our camp mate will perform on the harpsichord [the what? -- I could almost hear the crowd wondering] Mozart's 12 variations on the theme, 'Ah, vous dirais-je, Maman,'' which, folks, translates into English as, 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star.'''<P>
The stage wheeled around, and suddenly I was front and center, and the temperature dropped from 80 degrees backstage to 50 degrees in the California redwood country. My limpid warmed fingers turned to ice. I started in. ``Tum tum TUM TUM tum tum TUM, How I wonder what you are.''<P>
I hit as many false as correct notes, and was sustained only by the hope that the mistakes did not affront a permissive audience, most of whom had not heard a harpsichord before, many of whom patiently assumed that Variation Two would feature a kangaroo jumping out of the instrument and everyone would roar in amusement, and they could go on to the next act.<P>
You know about the speaker who goes on and on? Adlai Stevenson once quipped, ``What happens after a Saturday-night speech by Hubert Humphrey? Sunday.'' Mozart's 12 variations take a certain amount of time to get through. A lot of time, by the measurements of hyped-up audiences who are treated to a joke or a jazz exuberance every minute or two. A few months before my ordeal, the people of California had voted yes on the famous Proposition 13, which would require the legislature to limit taxation on property. ``Vote Yes on Proposition 13'' was the great rallying point of the political season. After about five minutes of tortured effort, with another five minutes to go, a voice rose from the crowd, ``Vote no on Variation 13!''<P>
Aaahh. A huge squirt of ice water in mid-performance. But I got through it, and the crowd was very kind, and I thought then, as I did after listening to A&E, how wonderful was Mozart, and how many, underendowed, have suffered from attempting to imitate him.

A few years ago, you asked me to help you out with your research in the Brazilian rainforest, and, as you'll remember, I said, ``Sure, no problem.''
<br>
So I cut you a check for my donation, and then I asked if maybe it would be possible to use some of the findings of your research in my soon-to-be-bestselling book, <U>Earth in the Balance</U>.
<br>
Now what I need to know is a) whether the check I wrote to you was a personal check; b) whether it was (more likely) a check drawn on the foundation I created with the money I had left over in my senatorial campaign war chest; and c) if it had ``for research'' in the memo section.<br>
I also need to know whether you and your research organization are a 501(c)(1), 501(c)(2), 501(c)(3), or 501(c)(4) corporation. <br>
I need all this pretty fast, by the way. At least by Sunday-morning talk-show hour.<br>
See, this thing with Gingrich is kind of unsettling. Don't get me wrong: I'm all for trying to undermine the guy. But I'm sure there's a more . . . how do I put this? . . . a more surgical way to get him.<br>
I wasn't really worried about it until Dad called. ``Gleetings, my number one son. How many Chinese businessmen have been in today?'' he said.<br>
``Cut it out, Dad,'' I groaned.<br>
``C'mon, Al! What'd they serve at lunch today in the mess? Moo Shu Pork? General Tsing Spicy Scallop?''<br>
``Dad, I'm hanging up the phone.''<br>
``It's a joke, boy! A joke! Lighten up!'' he cried. I could hear the ice rattle in his highball glass, which means he's finished his drink. Last week, I could hear the ice tinkling in a full glass, which meant I had to endure two whole verses of ``We Are Siamese if You Please,'' with Mom in the background banging a trash-can lid with a hammer, to simulate a gong.<br>
``Well it's not funny, Dad. In this first place, it's racially insensitive.''<br>
``Not as insensitive as fleecing those poor fellas to the tune of $300,000 for a five-minute White House sit-down and a doughnut.''<br>
``And we've given most of the money back.''<br>
Dad burst out laughing. ``I know! I read it in the paper! I mean, son, what are you running up there? A Chinese fire drill?''<br>
``Dad, I swear to God I'll hang up this phone.''<br>

``Simmer down, boy. You know, in my day, if we took three million dollars from a fellow, you'd better believe we'd keep it. Oh yes. And give him something for it, besides. Now I see you fellows on the news swearing up and down that all that money had absolutely no effect on policy. No effect on policy? Use your head, boy! Don't tell the customer that! If a man wants to pay three million dollars for a car, don't go on TV telling folks that it's okay, 'cause the car don't run. What are you, nuts?''<br>

``I'm not following your analogy,'' I said.<br>
``And then I read about this Gingrich character, and how he's in trouble because he used money from the wrong account to pay for a college course he was teaching. A college course! He didn't steal the money, or buy himself a Cadillac, or send his girlfriend to Hawaii. No. He taught a college course.''<br>
``Dad, I have to go.''<br>
``How do you trust a man like that? How can you trust a man who doesn't take a little for himself?''<br>
``Dad, I'm late for a meeting.''<br>
``Well, you just watch out. You guys in D.C. have so many tax laws and ethics investigations you've turned everyone into a crook.''<br>
``Bye, Dad.'' And I hung up. But Dad's point is well taken: I've got to start cleaning up some loose ends before the '00 campaign starts in earnest.<br>
I called up David Bonior. He's spearheading the battle against Newt, so I figured that he's an expert.<br>
``Hmmmm,'' he said, after I had laid out the situation. ``This doesn't look good!''<br>
``It doesn't? But isn't it, at most, just a technical mistake? A minor oversight?'' I asked.<br>
``Ooohhh no no no. This kind of malfeasance -- ''<br>
``Excuse me. Isn't malfeasance kind of strong?''<br>
``Call it what you will, sir. But it's a Gingrich-sized oversight. The good news, if you're interested, is that Dick Gephardt has some similar, though slightly more serious, problems.''<br>
``Well, I appreciate that, David, but I really think we've all gone too far with these rigidly picky ethics attacks for purely personal gain.''<br>
Bonior clucked his tongue. ``Spoken,'' he said, ``like someone who has some serious violations of the tax code to explain.''<br>
``Oh, come on, David,'' I said. ``Everyone has a few mistakes on the books.''<br>
``Not me,'' he said. ``See you in New Hampshire.''<br>
So, please, Rusty, hurry up with those receipts!

<FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><font size=+1>aving</font> written off Bill Clinton for most of 1995, Republicans are now tempted to ascribe supernatural powers of persuasion to him. Neither attitude encourages constructive thought on how to counter his strategy. But despite the image of an Administration adrift, President Clinton has arrived, through a mixture of accident and design, at a strategy for Democrats to survive and perhaps even prosper in ideologically uncongenial times. While there may not be a Clintonian ideology, it is possible to speak of a Clintonian style of politics.
<P>
Its most important feature has been the attempted retooling of the Democratic Party as the servant of middle-class interests through the mechanism of government. Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg explained the reasoning in a much-noted essay in the Fall 1991 <I>American Prospect</I>: ``Democrats need to rediscover broad-based social policy that sends a larger message: Democrats are for 'everybody,' not just the 'have-nots.' That means defending and enlarging social insurance initiatives that reach the lower and middle classes rather than constructing safety nets that protect only the poor.'' Means-tested programs stigmatize recipients and are, Greenberg thinks, easy to cut; middle-class entitlements are forever.
<P>
National health insurance, a longstanding goal of the Left, was thus also a means of expanding the Democratic voter base and creating a permanent Democratic majority. It would do to the middle class what Social Security had done to the elderly: make a majority of them beholden to the Federal Government and its political champions, in this case for their very lives. As Grace-Marie Arnett points out, the Clintons have pursued this objective with essentially Fabian tactics. They have tried to establish beachheads within the health-care market from which to launch new government interventions. The Clintons' 1993 - 94 health-care ``reform'' effort would have been a large, and probably irreversible, step toward socialized medicine. Time is already beginning to obscure just how close they came.
<P>
Clinton's repeated proposals to expand subsidies for higher education are a smaller-scale version of the same entitlement strategy. The government will now step forward to finance increased access to the very sectors of the economy the government has most inflated. It's a proposal well crafted to help Clinton make inroads among traditional GOP strongholds in the middle class and even upper middle class. The Republican Congress has forced Clinton to spend more time playing defense: instead of increasing public dependence on government, he has been vigilantly blocking cuts in government programs that benefit people who work. Clinton's massive expansion of the earned income tax credit, and subsequent determination to protect that expansion from Republican budget-cutters, is a case in point.
<P>
Even on welfare, where President Clinton has felt it necessary to appear responsive to middle-class demands for reform and retrenchment, he has assiduously avoided policies that would reduce the scope and power of government or its allied institutions in liberaldom. Indeed, as Robert Rector observes, Clinton originally sought window-dressing reforms that would actually increase the power of the welfare establishment.
<P>
After the Republicans took Congress, he moved toward a liberal version of welfare reform, which, geared as it is toward processing people through welfare rather than keeping them off it, creates opportunities for expanding state services: child-care subsidies, job training, transportation assistance, child-support enforcement. Clinton has followed a similar pattern on education: he has a long history of supporting the least reform the public demands and the most the education establishment will tolerate. So, for instance, he's all in favor of charter schools, as long as they don't escape the burden of federal regulations or threaten the power of teachers' unions.
<P>
To woo the middle class, Clinton has also had to tack center-right on ``values.'' Greenberg readily acknowledged the point in his 1991 essay: ``Democrats cannot win over the average family,'' he wrote, ``unless there are some limits on the party's moral agnosticism.'' Clinton's cultural rhetoric is now to the right of George Bush's. We know that President Clinton read Ben Wattenberg's <I>Values Matter Most</I>, and he has talked incessantly about ``values'' ever since. (The popularity of that word ought, incidentally, to depress conservatives. ``'Values' beat 'virtues' eleven to nothing in a focus group we did,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's amazing Bill Bennett sold any books.'')
<P>
On social and cultural issues, Clinton has used the bully pulpit quite effectively to signal that he shares the public's values. And if, when Clinton says that he supports introducing school uniforms or firing incompetent teachers, some people are misled to believe that he has some policy initiative to translate the rhetoric into reality, well, that's no skin off his back. He has struck a particularly tough pose on crime, though, as David Kopel observes, there is much less to his record than meets the eye. Clinton's gauzy communitarian rhetoric is also deployed on fiscal issues. During last fall's budget showdown, he was constantly claiming to be defending ``our values'' from Republicans intent on taking medicine away from the elderly and protection from the environment. This kind of values-laden talk is probably necessary for parties of the Center - Left for the foreseeable future. (Tony Blair, leader of Britain's Labour Party, does it too.)
<P>
In addition to pulling more middle-class voters into the Democratic coalition, President Clinton also wanted to co-opt parts of American business. In some respects, ClintonCare was a failed attempt to do so: it offered major financial benefits to large manufacturers and insurers. The Administration's support for high-tech subsidies was a play for Silicon Valley. The re-orientation of American trade policy toward bilateral deals, sometimes company-specific, enabled the Administration to dispense favors to exporters at its discretion. And the ultimate logic of the ``corporate responsibility'' themes many Democrats are pushing is to transform American businesses into docile servants of the welfare state.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N HIS</font> zeal to expand his base, Clinton has not forgotten more reliable Democratic constituencies. So federal funding of labor unions has increased (and it has been made easier for them to use compulsory dues on political activity). The Violence Against Women Act has funneled money to feminist organizations, and ``AIDS education'' programs to the gay Left. The 1993 ``stimulus'' bill was a payback to big-city mayors; when it failed, much of its substance was included in the next year's crime bill. Restrictions on the politicization of the federal work force have been loosened considerably.
<P>
Clinton's sheer political talent should not be underestimated as a factor in the success of this strategy. Nor, for that matter, should the frequency and facility of his lies. He is able to call high-mindedly for bipartisan statesmanship and then, in the next breath, launch a furious attack on the motives of his opponents -- who, we are to believe, <I>want</I> children to drink dirty water, eat diseased meat, and smoke. Yet Clinton is simultaneously a soothing figure. He is able to appeal to that strain of public sentiment that wants the noise and bickering from Washington to stop. His rhetoric is also appealing because it tells the voters they can have it all: a balanced budget without cutting entitlements; environmental regulation without economic costs; welfare reform without anyone suffering. He's the perfect practitioner of the politics of painlessness: for everything that's good, against everything bad. (In fairness, some Republicans, particularly of the Gingrich - Kemp brand, are prone to this as well.)
<P>
Another reason for Clintonism's success is that, as many commentators have noted, this White House focuses on its political health to an unprecedented degree. American foreign policy toward Ireland and Haiti has been driven largely by domestic political considerations. The church-burning issue was basically a whipped-up hysteria designed to persuade black voters that white racism is still the chief threat to their well-being. And the Administration skillfully orchestrates the appearance of a constant flurry of activity -- no matter how microscopic the initiative or gesture, how inadequate the rapid response. The Administration provides motion without progress, a perpetual campaign. President Clinton hasn't declared for re-election; would anyone notice if he did?
<P>
The chief vulnerability of Clintonism is that even the boldest New Democrat cannot afford to cross some constituencies that are out of sync with the public. Clinton can't sign legal reform because of the trial lawyers. He was willing to anger organized labor over NAFTA, but he has done its bidding on striker replacement and other workplace issues; if the Democrats do well this November, they will be greatly indebted to the AFL-CIO's vigorous campaign on their behalf. And Clinton would not have dared to sign the bill banning partial-birth abortions for fear of incurring the wrath of feminists, a calculation that highlights the vacuum where Clintonism's moral core should be. But the issue that most devastatingly gives the lie to Clinton's pretensions of conservatism -- his support of race and gender preferences -- appears to have been dropped by his opposition.
<P>
The consolation for conservatives is that Clinton doesn't move the debate; he merely positions himself within it. In the first year of the Administration, William Kristol compared the condition of American liberalism to that of Soviet Communism in the late 1970s: both were seemingly dominant, both utterly hollow. For a time it was fashionable in conservative circles to describe health-care reform as liberalism's Afghanistan, the fatal overreach that would precipitate the empire's collapse. Yet in neither case has the old order been unequivocally defeated.
<P>
Now, writes Johnathan Sunley in the summer <I>National Interest</I>, ``Communism as a dogma is dead. . . . The problem facing supposedly 'post-Communist' societies is not a revival of that ideology, but the survival of power structures that escaped the 'revolutions' of 1989 more or less unscathed.'' Just so with contemporary liberalism and the ``revolution'' of 1994. If Bill Clinton wins re-election, his legacy could be that America enters the twenty-first century shackled by the institutional residua of an ideology almost nobody any longer believes.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> pledge to ``end welfare as we know it'' was the centerpiece of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Voters were blitzed with TV ads promising to put welfare recipients to work and proposing an apparent two-year time limit on receipt of benefits. But on no topic has the Clintonian chasm between word and deed been broader than on welfare.
<P>
Americans have lived through many an ``end to welfare.'' In 1988, Congress passed the ``Family Support Act,'' a mammoth bipartisan reform that was promised ``to replace welfare with work.'' In reality, the bill required almost no one to work; AFDC caseloads ballooned by 30 per cent.
<P>
Nearly 90 per cent of voters still want welfare recipients to work for benefits. Their antipathy to the existing welfare system creates a real hurdle for liberal legislators seeking to preserve and expand it. Hence, even the most left-wing proposals now come well armored in conservative slogans. By the mid Eighties periodic sham reform had become welfare's life blood, assuaging public discontent while masking the growth of the system.
<P>
Initially, it seemed Clinton might break this pattern. In his first month in office, he repeated his promise to end welfare and to make recipients work. In addition, in a speech before the National Governors' Association, he promised to encourage state welfare experimentation through waivers. Critically, he proposed to ``approve waivers that I did not necessarily agree with . . . the nature of the experiment is that one person has an idea different from another person.''
<P>
Reality quickly began to jostle the political rhetoric. President Clinton appointed, as head of HHS, Donna Shalala, who had served with Mrs. Clinton on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, an organization that had opposed even the token reforms of 1988. Charged with implementing Mr. Clinton's key campaign pledge to end welfare, Miss Shalala gave only a single grudging sentence to the topic in her confirmation testimony. Senator Moynihan felt compelled to upbraid her for her indifference.
<P>
Conservatives willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt on welfare, including this author, had their illusions dispelled abruptly when the President unveiled his first budget. Work had disappeared from the agenda. Clinton had stated that the ``reform'' of 1988 had been well designed but had been crippled by a lack of funds for JOBS, the program that nominally enforced work requirements.
<P>
By Washington standards, JOBS was a dwarf program costing about $1 billion out of an annual welfare spending pot of $234 billion. Thus, if lack of money were really holding up reform, it would be easy to jump-start ``work, not welfare,'' by giving it more.
<P>
But Clinton's budget didn't add one thin dime to the work program. He did propose large increases in almost every other type of welfare spending. Proposed new spending initiatives in conventional welfare programs (food stamps, housing, Head Start, etc.) amounted, over five years, to $100 billion above the already explosive growth in baseline spending. Having, on the campaign trail, trumpeted ``ending welfare'' and making recipients work, Clinton in office did exactly the opposite: ignoring workfare while seeking to expand traditional welfare spending.
<P>
Bolder reversals followed. The 1988 reform, pathetic though it was, included some minute work requirements squeezed in, with great effort, by conservative legislators. Avoiding undue haste, the liberal Congress decreed that these work requirements were not to take effect until 1994 (six years after passage) and would affect only some two-parent families comprising 6 per cent of the AFDC rolls. These provisions were the first and only work requirements passed into law. The Clinton Administration quietly sought to abolish them, through a change hidden deep within the vast Omnibus Budget Act. This maneuver outraged even the <I>New York Times</I>, and the attempted repeal failed.
<P>
While retreating at full speed on the work issue, President Clinton did break decisive new ground on another, unexpected front. Although he had predictably attacked Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech on illegitimacy, Clinton reversed course once in office. He began to speak out against rising illegitimacy, warning that the collapse of marriage was a root cause of crime and other social problems. On television, he acknowledged that Charles Murray was right: welfare promoted out-of-wedlock births. In his first State of the Union address, Clinton warned that society was threatened by an illegitimate birth rate that would soon hit 50 per cent.
<P>
Of course, Clinton never intended actually to do anything about illegitimacy. But, often, a President's words do count. And no President, including Ronald Reagan, had ever spoken this way against illegitimacy. Like Nixon's trip to China, Clinton's speeches about marriage and illegitimacy permanently altered the national debate. An issue which many politicians had been afraid even to mention was now raised to prominence, even urgency. For this, the country owes Bill Clinton a profound debt of thanks.
<P>
In the realm of deed rather than word, however, the Clinton Administration continued to drift left. While still arguing that more funding was the key to reform, Clinton again failed in his second budget to provide more money for workfare thus ensuring that his campaign pledge to make welfare recipients work would not even begin to take effect until 1996, if at all. Finally, in the summer of 1994, Clinton unveiled his grand welfare-reform plan. Not surprisingly, it was a parody of liberal anti-reforms parading in conservative prose. It didn't require work, and effectively prohibited states from doing so. There was no ``two years and off'' rule. In its place was the following provision: no one would be required to work for the first two years on welfare; among those exceeding the two-year limit, some tiny portion would be required to do community-service work but only under restrictions that would make dependency reduction impossible.
<P>
Although 70 per cent of the AFDC caseload at any given time have been on welfare for over two years, the bill required only 7 per cent of the caseload to work by 1999. These welfare recipients would work only 15 hours per week and would receive an effective wage of $15 per hour (counting all benefits). The bill allocated $4,000 in administrative overhead for each workfare participant. At many job sites, recipients doing community-service work would become members of public-sector unions. The Clinton Administration had been truthful on one point: ``ending welfare as we know it'' in this manner would cost a lot more than the status quo. The real costs of the proposal were discreetly hidden, off budget, in future years.
<p>
On illegitimacy, the bill proposed the status quo and triumphantly called it reform. To obtain welfare, unwed mothers under age 18 would have to live with their parents. But 90 per cent of out-of-wedlock births occur to women over 18, and most young teen mothers already live with their parents. Moreover, it is quite likely that the teen's mother had once been an unmarried welfare mother herself, and was thus more a cause of the problem than its solution.
<p>
In attempting to conceal the policy vacuum on illegitimacy the Administration's press releases made bold proclamations about abstinence and teaching young people to delay sexual activity. But the bill itself mentioned neither marriage nor abstinence; instead it offered tired liberal nostrums: condom distribution, self-esteem building, values clarification, ``life skills training,'' etc. This was no surprise, since Donna Shalala abhorred abstinence education and had spent the prior year trying to abolish the government's single tiny abstinence program.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT> short, the 622-page ``end of welfare'' bill was nearly a carbon copy of the bogus reforms of 1988. It would have ``ended welfare'' by enlarging it.
<p>
For decades, the welfare state had rested uneasily on this sort of deception: the ability of liberal politicians to say one thing while doing another. As long as Democrats controlled Congress, Clinton could talk tough and still satisfy left-wing interest groups. Then came the 1994 election. After years of rhetorical philandering, Clinton suddenly faced a shotgun wedding with a Republican Congress eager to do the things Clinton only gabbed about. The House advanced legislation to establish work requirements and time limits, slow the automatic growth of welfare spending, reward states for cutting dependence, combat illegitimacy, and end the entitlement status of welfare. In the new political context, Clinton's bill was so liberal that Democrats never bothered to bring it to the floor of the House or Senate. Finally, the President himself disparaged his own legislation in an interview with Ben Wattenberg, a fitting end to a farce.
<p>
Clinton was now stretched in a three-way tug of war between his own rhetoric, the liberals who controlled most of his party and Administration, and the Republican Congress. The result was incoherence and a series of policy reversals, culminating, last winter, when Clinton supported the welfare-reform bill passed in the Senate and then vetoed virtually identical legislation a few weeks later, during the night of the record blizzard. After the veto, White House operatives sought to burnish the President's image as a reformer. Clinton, they claimed, had already fulfilled his pledge to end welfare by granting waivers to reform-minded governors (mostly Republican). Again the facts were otherwise: while Clinton had specifically promised to grant waivers for ideas he did not agree with, Secretary Shalala garrisoned HHS like Stalingrad; many conservative proposals were simply rejected, others greatly curtailed. Each conservative waiver had to be fought out clause by clause. California and Massachusetts simply rejected the modified waivers offered them.
<p>
The flip-flops continued. In May, in an effort to upstage Bob Dole, Clinton praised Governor Tommy Thompson's new reform plans, even though Wisconsin's initiative was several light years to the right of the legislation the President had vetoed four months earlier. Within 24 hours, White House spokesman Harold Ickes had indicated that the Administration had serious reservations about the Wisconsin waiver. Then came a reversal of the reversal, and another reversal, and so forth. But the substance of the debate continued to shift rightward. In July the White House backed the Castle - Tanner bill which ended the entitlement status of AFDC and copied many features of the legislation Clinton had vetoed in January. A lid was also put on the more extreme members of the Administration eager to prove ``scientifically'' that ending the entitlement status of welfare would yield millions of starving kids. Press spokesman Mike McCurry admitted that such studies (which had provided justification for the earlier veto) were sometimes ``a worthless exercise.''
<p>
At the end of July Congress passed a softened version of last year's legislation. Critically, Congress omitted Medicaid reforms to avoid a threatened veto. The President had apparently promised liberal groups he would ``save'' Medicaid; having kept his promise, he may have felt more free to reform AFDC, the least popular welfare program. After a debate within the White House, the President declared he would sign the bill. Although vacillating wildly on policy, Bill Clinton the politician has always grasped one simple idea: standing, sword in hand, as the final defender of the fortress of welfare is not a route to long-term popularity. And Bill Clinton does like to be liked.

 health-care plan proposed by the President and Mrs. Clinton demonstrated the scope of their project for socializing a major segment of the U.S. economy. In fact, Hillary Clinton revealed her statist philosophy during a speech in Washington in 1993 when she said, ``It's time to put the common good, the national interest, ahead of individuals.''
<P>
The liberal agenda wasn't just to make health care more affordable and accessible, but also to seduce the middle class into allegiance to the welfare state with a sweeping new entitlement. Fortunately, as Americans learned the details of the plan -- thanks to a network of fax machines, radio talk shows, the internet -- the majority of them saw through it.
<P>
The Clinton plan would have created at least 200 regional alliances, staffed by more than 50,000 bureaucrats, and added more than $70 billion to the federal budget deficit (according to the Congressional Budget Office's February 1994 estimate). The whole scheme would have been enforced with a plethora of fines, penalties, and jail terms for physicians and their patients. Voters registered their displeasure at the polls in November 1994.
<P>
The defeat of ClintonCare was a famous victory -- but an incomplete one. While Clinton-style health reform has receded into the shadows, no stake has been driven through its heart. During her visit to Estonia this July, the First Lady told reporters that government regulation of health care was needed and would happen eventually. Referring to the plan she had spearheaded two years earlier, she said, ``I think that basic model is still the right model.''
<P>
Ira Magaziner, the plan's principal architect, also yearns for vindication. This spring he told a meeting of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island that the American public still cries out for comprehensive reform, and added that President Clinton remains committed to the idea and will try again if a more receptive Congress is elected.
<P>
Having learned their lessons from the delays of the last round, liberal advocates expect to have a bill ready for speedy passage if Clinton is re-elected; their strategy is to strike before opponents have time to mount a campaign. Models currently being developed would begin with universal health coverage for all children, delivered through the structure of health-insurance purchasing cooperatives, government-defined benefits packages, and premium subsidies that characterized the original Clinton plan. The cynical calculation is that legislators would not dare vote against ``KidCare,'' and, once the foundation was in place, liberals could construct, brick by brick, the statist structure they originally envisioned.
<P>
This scenario could be dismissed as a paranoid nightmare -- except that Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) has forthrightly claimed it as his strategy. He openly acknowledges that he views the insurance-regulation bill he is co-sponsoring with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) as a down-payment on a federally controlled health-care system. Experience in several states indicates that this attempt to expand access to health insurance would drive up costs, destabilize the market for private health insurance, and leave even more Americans without health insurance, leading to more and more legislation. Which Sen. Kennedy is more than happy to provide. He says, ``We're going to get this done, and we're going to keep coming back at it. . . . If we have a big sweep for Democrats in the House and Senate, we'll get single-payer.''
<P>
The current liberal strategy, in short, which Clinton would continue in a second term, is to offer ``security'' in exchange for incremental losses of freedom, seducing the middle class step by step into dependence.
<P>
Conservatives, meanwhile, have their own incremental strategy. By offering individuals more control over their health-care costs through devices such as medical savings accounts (MSAs), they expect that market incentives will restructure the medical industry from top to bottom, and prove so popular that more and more Americans will demand the savings, efficiency, and security of owning their own health-insurance policies.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the White House and Sen. Kennedy have led the charge against MSAs. Conservatives have fought for months to include MSAs in the Kassebaum - Kennedy bill, but Democratic intransigence and Republican pusillanimity have left MSAs so bound and gagged with restrictions that many conservatives think passage of the bill would do more harm than good.
<P>
Both sides understand that, as with a great battleship, a small shift in the heading can over time lead to a vastly different destination. The competing visions of where Americans should be headed could not be more starkly opposed: in one, health care becomes a state-provided entitlement; in the other, individual freedom and responsibility allow a properly functioning health-care marketplace to evolve. The combatants can be expected to fight to the last breath -- in the 1996 elections and beyond.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font>  Clinton crime record is a centerpiece of the President's re-election campaign. And not surprisingly. After all, the Administration has had major legislative successes and has effectively controlled the policy debate.
<P>
Not that the victories have been cost-free. It was against the strong advice of then - Speaker Tom Foley and then - Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell that Clinton insisted on keeping the ``assault-weapon'' ban in the crime package. The decision may have had profound political effects. Several weeks after the 1994 elections, Clinton told the <I>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</I> that ``the fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their seats in Congress. . . . The NRA is the reason the Republicans control the House.''
<P>
In exchange, the President won a very small policy victory indeed. The banned guns look ugly, but they fire no faster than other guns, and generally use ammunition less powerful than do ordinary hunting rifles. According to gun-seizure statistics, they are almost never used in crime. Because the ban defines ``assault weapons'' in terms of cosmetic factors such as whether the barrel has a bayonet lug, gun manufacturers are currently selling nearly identical firearms, minus the offending bayonet lugs.
<P>
In placing form over substance, the gun ban perfectly illustrates the whole thrust of the Administration's crime policy. The much-vaunted funding for ``100,000 new cops on the street,'' for instance, actually provides funding for about 20,000 police and leaves localities stuck with the tab for the others. In a jurisdiction like Denver, the bill may add a half-dozen officers to a given shift -- hardly enough to make a real impact on crime control.
<P>
Similarly, the Administration's recently announced plan to trace guns illegally sold to juveniles was actually a long-standing program, trotted out as ``new'' for election purposes. And Clinton's current pet gun-control proposal, a ban on armor-piercing ammunition, was enacted by Congress in 1986. The proposal simply plays off media attention to an inventor's pipe dream about a new type of ammunition he said he was going to create.
<P>
Which isn't to say Clinton has had no impact. No President in American history has done more to promote electronic surveillance of the American people. The Federal Government is conducting wiretaps at record levels. The overwhelming majority of conversations tapped are innocent; of the guilty ones, most involve matters such as drugs and gambling; they are almost never used for bombing cases, the ostensible justification for the new grant of authority.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>O</font> President has been so consistently hostile to the separation between the Federal Government and the states. The Brady Act is an unfunded mandate on overburdened sheriffs and police chiefs to perform background checks on handgun buyers. Curfews, school uniforms, midnight basketball, automatically expelling students who bring guns or knives to school -- whether these policies are wise or unwise is debatable, but they have no business coming from Washington, D.C.
<P>
Centralization of law enforcement undermines accountability. As former Attorney General Edwin Meese put it, ``If voters are dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate officials out of office.'' Federal agencies, in contrast, are several steps removed from democratic control. Local control also means fiscal responsibility: federal anti-crime spending tends to tilt heavily toward programs -- such as DARE and the McGruff crime dog -- that sound good on the Senate floor but are proven failures. And federal law enforcement's priorities are not on the crimes against persons and property that most concern Americans, but instead on statutory offenses: controlled substances, firearms, and the like.
<P>
To make matters of centralization worse, Louis Freeh is working to make the FBI a national police force (sending G-men to enforce child-support orders!) and indeed an international one, as it sets up overseas offices and develops close working relationships with the KGB's successor.
<P>
In terms of demagogy, Clinton's performance on crime issues is exceptional. After the Oklahoma City bombing, the Administration began pushing a list of greatly expanded powers for federal law-enforcement agencies -- despite the fact that not one provision in the bill could even arguably have prevented the bombing. Thanks to the Administration's ``anti-terrorism'' initiative, the Federal Government can now, without any need to show probable cause, order credit bureaus to disclose parts of consumer credit records, wiretap radio modem communications, and deport or imprison aliens on the basis of secret evidence. Clinton's original proposal was even worse: it would have greatly expanded the definition of ``terrorism,'' eviscerated restraints on use of the military in domestic law enforcement, and abolished requirements that federal law-enforcement agencies act only within their jurisdiction.
<P>
There is no reason to doubt that a second Clinton Administration would follow a crime policy much like the first: to go as far as politically possible in using crime control as a pretext for constricting privacy and increasing the power of the Federal Government. These policies will not reduce street crime, and they will leave Americans much more vulnerable to the types of crime our Founders most feared: the depredations of a lawless Federal Government.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>S</font> a youth Bill Clinton rejected the segregation of his native South and embraced the series of federal laws that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, education, employment, and voting. Clinton believed that racial discrimination was morally wrong, but his view was not simply a product of reason. To put the President's own hackneyed phrase to perhaps its best use, he ``felt the pain'' of segregation. Thus, while not a civil-rights activist, organizing and demonstrating, Clinton became a race healer. He made a point of associating with blacks, and continued to do so even when black separatism started gaining strength.
<P>
At the Yale Law School, according to David Maraniss's biography, <I>First in His Class</I>, a table in the cafeteria that black law students (including Lani Guinier) claimed as their own sometimes had a white visitor -- Bill Clinton. One reason so few whites sat at this ``black table of solidarity'' is that they didn't know how to ``enter that world.'' Maraniss reports that while at first some blacks stared at Clinton ``as though he was an unwanted interloper,'' he soon won them over through his willingness to ``talk about whatever the black students were talking about, or tell his own tales about life in Arkansas, or joke about how he had not gone to class or read any of his law books.''
<P>
Clinton continued this winning way. As a young law professor at the University of Arkansas, Clinton, writes Maraniss, ``quickly became the friend and champion'' of black students. His ``relaxed style'' was a comfort to blacks in the classroom, and outside it Clinton went the extra mile by tutoring them. The black students nicknamed Clinton ``Wonder Boy.'' Said one, ``It was a miracle the way he was.''
<P>
It has proved a miracle relevant to Clinton's political career. He has always been more than the ordinary Democrat who by virtue of being a Democrat gets most of the ``black vote.'' He has indeed been the Wonder Boy, a white figure who enjoys exceptional black trust. As a result, Clinton has been positioned to do extraordinary things. And since 1992, when he burst onto the national stage, he sometimes has done them.
<P>
In June of that year, Clinton repudiated rap singer Sister Souljah for her comment, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, that ``if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people? . . . why not kill a white person?'' Clinton said these remarks were ``filled with hatred'' and that ``if you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.'' Sister Souljah's remarks, Clinton added, contributed to a noxious political environment ``of pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.'' There was a strategic calculation in what Clinton did: seeking to demonstrate his willingness to challenge core Democratic constituency groups, the candidate made his comments about Sister Souljah in a speech to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But his criticism of her also served to define his ``new covenant'' message in a way consistent with the best principles in American life. Thus, the new covenant was not merely a statement that ``we (whatever color we are) are all in this together,'' as Clinton said elsewhere in 1992, but also a recognition that, all of us being together, there's no place among us for racism of any variety, white or black. Though Jackson defended Sister Souljah against Clinton, many black leaders, including some who had backed presidential runs by Jackson, said Clinton was right to say what he did.
<P>
In late 1993, Clinton gave a speech in Memphis to black pastors. The speech was remarkable for its focus on the cultural problems afflicting black communities -- a taboo subject for white politicians. Clinton was so confident that he could handle this subject and still retain the approval of blacks that he even dared to imagine what Martin Luther King might be saying today -- namely, that ``I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others . . . I fought for freedom but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don't amount to anything. . . . I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.'' Clinton preached to the preachers that ``It is our moral duty to turn [this state of affairs] around,'' adding, ``We have to make our people whole again.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> use of the first-person plurals, ``our'' and ``we,'' made Clinton at one with his audience and the families they minister to. It was a dramatic demonstration of his solidarity with blacks. And it is this solidarity that has freed Clinton to endorse welfare reform, a project that could hit poor blacks harder than any other group. With the legislation of welfare reform, Clinton has now performed the Democratic equivalent of Richard Nixon's going to China.
<P>
There is not a chance, however, that Clinton will do the same with affirmative action. This, of course, was the great hope of New (and some old) Democrats. Early in 1993, the distinguished historian C. Vann Woodward wrote that Clinton ``rejects . . . racial preference'' and ``makes no separate case for the rights of racial minorities.'' Those have proved words to be eaten. Through 1994, the Clinton Administration was unable to find a racial preference it could not support, whether as a matter of policy or law, and in litigation (notably in the <I>Adarand</I> case and in voting-rights cases) it supported doctrine in effect making a separate case for the rights of minorities. But for the 1994 election results, which put affirmative action in the political dock, Clinton would not have felt compelled to review a single federal program containing preferences. Not that the Administration has greatly diverged from the left-lying affirmative action path it was on, although the press continues to report that Clinton has steered ``a middle course'' on affirmative action.
<P>
In his July 19, 1995, speech announcing the results of the Administration's review of affirmative action -- a speech given at the National Archives to an audience made up largely of civil-rights activists -- Clinton, wishing to ensure Jesse Jackson would not burden him with a primary challenge, announced his intention to ``mend, not end'' affirmative action. While the statement could be construed as a sign of progress -- to say that affirmative action needs ``mending'' is a concession that at least something about it is wrong -- there has over the past year been very little mending of affirmative action, and the only ending of an actual preferential device (two, by my count, have bit the dust) has occurred as a result of litigation. (See ``Don't Mend It, Defend It,'' by <a href="/nationalreview/clinton/therns.html">Abigail Thernstrom</a> .)
In practice, ``mending'' affirmative action has entailed the nurturing of a politics that, as the Democratic Leadership Council recognized in a statement critical of Clinton's policy conclusions, ``divides Americans most dramatically along racial lines,'' making it ``more rather than less difficult to transcend racial difference.'' According to Administration policy, found in policy papers, legal memos, and court filings, minorities need affirmative action, on the one hand, because non-minorities discriminate against them on account of race and, on the other, because their race and ethnicity are in themselves valuable commodities, providing ``diversity.'' Clinton's affirmative-action Presidency has left him unable to say with moral clarity why Louis Farrakhan, who has ascended into a position of black national leadership during the past four years, is wrong on matters of race.
<P>
Notwithstanding his 1992 admonition against pointing fingers across racial lines, Clinton has not been above doing that himself. In late 1993, campaigning in New York City for incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, he accused whites of being unwilling to vote for someone different from them, even though many whites had voted for Dinkins in 1989; in effect, he accused whites of racism. Two months ago, in a speech suggesting (against known evidence) that the black-church burnings were ``fires of [racial] hatred,'' Clinton warned against the raising of ``divisive'' issues during this election year. ``Every time you hear somebody use race or religion as an instrument of division and hatred, speak up against it.'' Subtly but unmistakably, Clinton suggested that anyone who questions affirmative action is using ``race as an instrument of division'' -- is a racist, in sum, no different from those who burn black churches. Republican timidity on the matter suggests that this effort to intimidate is succeeding.
<P>
On welfare Clinton may now be able to call himself a New Democrat. But on race he cannot say that. Instead, he has been aiding and abetting a politics of victimization and racial identity that threatens individual rights, denies the equal protection of the law, and divides the races. Wonder Boy, indeed.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> July 19, 1995, Bill Clinton gave one of the most-watched speeches of his Presidency. With a live television audience tuned in from around the country, he pledged to maintain affirmative-action programs. But he also promised to reform those programs that did not meet the constitutional test laid out by the Supreme Court just a month earlier, in <I>Adarand Constructors</I> v. <I>Pena</I>. ``Mend it, don't end it,'' the President said of affirmative action.
<P>
``Defend it'' would have been a more forthright description of the Administration's response. As Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, put it: ``It is important for us all not to be intimidated by <I>Adarand</I>. We have to take <I>Adarand</I> on.''
<P>
What the Supreme Court did in <I>Adarand</I> was to extend to federal programs its demand that race-based action meet the demanding test of narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest. Such programs would henceforth be subject to ``strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of judicial review.
<P>
Within three weeks of this decision the Administration had launched an all-out offensive to limit the Court-inflicted damage on its program of racial preferences. The first step was a June 28 Justice Department memo, written by Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger and intended to provide ``preliminary legal guidance'' to the general counsels of the executive agencies. The Dellinger memo was followed by a long-delayed White House review of federal affirmative-action programs that the President had ordered in February; written by Christopher Edley Jr. (special counsel to the President) and George Stephanopoulos, it promised ``a candid and balanced description'' of these programs, as well as a set of policy recommendations.
<P>
The Edley report was released the same day the President gave his ``Mend it, don't end it'' speech. Two months later, Deval Patrick testified before a House subcommittee on the proposed Equal Opportunity Act (the Dole - Canady bill), which had been introduced on the heels of the Edley review. And then on February 19, 1996, Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt issued a directive spelling out the implications of <I>Adarand</I> for federal employment. That memo was supplemented by still another on May 22 entitled ``Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement.''
<P>
The Administration had been hard at work. This was a fight from which the President could not run, he had said in a closed-door get-together with House Democrats on February 22, 1995. ``We have to outsmart the Republicans,'' he had declared -- and once five Supreme Court Justices had at least partially tied his hands with the <I>Adarand</I> ruling, his task included outsmarting the Court.
<P>
Only in retrospect was the Dellinger memo a hint of things to come; at the time, it read like a legitimate attempt to put the best face possible on <I>Adarand</I>, emphasizing the limits of the ruling and urging no precipitous action. But Dellinger's quick read of the decision was the Administration's last careful and lawyerly analysis. The Edley report, less than a month later, basically ignored the Supreme Court's holding. A brief on behalf of every federal affirmative-action program (the authors did not recommend eliminating a single one), it put the Administration on record as intending to carry bravely on.
<P>
As Edley and Stephanopoulos described them, these programs were above legal, political, or ethical reproach; the Court's concerns in <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions were thus woefully off base. The plurality in the Supreme Court's 1989 <I>Richmond</I> v. <I>Croson</I> decision had warned of the danger of ``stigmatic harm'' and ``racial hostility.'' Edley and Stephanopoulos spoke of policies that simply offered ``every American a fair chance to achieve success.'' They were a needed tool ``to move us away from a world of lingering biases . . . toward one in which opportunity is equal.'' The voice of these White House aides was, of course, precisely that of the President's. ``Affirmative action has been good for America,'' he said in his July 19 speech. ``When . . . done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration clearly has had a mission: saving the whole panoply of racial preferences that pervades government employment and contracting. That was fully apparent in the Schmidt memos.
<P>
In the first of these memos, <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions are treated as minor annoyances -- roadblocks that require a bit of ingenuity to get around. Schmidt concludes: ``nothing in <I>Adarand</I> requires a retreat.'' What the decision demanded was ``a demonstrable factual predicate'' for an agency's race-conscious actions. Those actions could be justified by statistical evidence indicating minority underrepresentation (a ``lingering effect'' of historic discrimination) or perhaps by ``an agency's operational need for a diverse workforce.'' It encouraged agencies to increase minority participation through race-neutral means, but said that if these failed, then race-conscious means were acceptable.
<P>
<font size=+3>S</font><font size=+1>OME</font> background is needed to understand Schmidt's second memo, which is actually the more interesting of the two. In 1994, Congress had enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), which constituted a bipartisan effort to streamline federal purchases of goods and services, ranging from construction to paper clips. Included was a government-wide extension of two tools that had previously been available only to the Defense Department -- namely, the so-called ``rule of two'' and a bidding preference. The ``rule of two'' allowed the Pentagon to remove a contract from competitive bidding any time there were at least two minority businesses eager to do the work. The bidding preference allowed the Pentagon to award a contract to a minority-owned company as long as the cost was no more than 10 per cent above that of the lowest bidder.
<P>
FASA could not take effect until final implementing regulations were issued -- a process complicated by <I>Adarand</I>. Schmidt's second memo offered a ``model'' for these regulations.
<P>
Once again, the Clinton Administration made clear its commitment to the entire edifice of federal race-conscious programs. The title promised ``Proposed Reforms.'' And yet Schmidt himself said his starting ``premise'' was ``a need for affirmative action in procurement,'' and George Stephanopoulos agreed that ``we want to do everything we can to promote minority contracting.'' Moreover, the memo's stated aim was to create ``a structure for race-conscious procurement . . . in a manner that will survive constitutional scrutiny.''
<P>
The entire report, in fact, can be read as an exercise in deception. The government had an indisputably compelling interest (a Fourteenth Amendment demand) in ``affirmative remedial efforts,'' the memo stated at the outset. Discrimination is a given, remedies thus a necessity -- remedies that are ``affirmative.'' The only issue was whether they were sufficiently ``narrowly tailored'' to meet the second half of the constitutional standard.
<P>
The question of narrow tailoring was thus the memo's focus. And to that end, Schmidt proposed several alleged ``reforms.'' For instance, white firms should be able, with slightly more ease, to prove their eligibility for participation in programs that give small, disadvantaged businesses a break. On its face, a limited but good suggestion; a month earlier, however, the assistant attorney general for civil rights had (with refreshing candor) admitted he was ``not convinced that means anything in practical terms.''
<P>
Likewise, the memo suggested that the usual goals and timetables should be replaced by ``benchmarks'' that would establish the appropriate level of minority contracting in each industry. There would be no fixed, permanent 10 per cent goal for highway construction, in other words. But the benchmarks would be set by determining ``the level of minority contracting that one would reasonably expect to find in a market absent discrimination or its effects.'' In other words, by figuring out how many minority businesses would get what sort of contracts had history been different -- had discrimination never occurred.
<P>
There were two problems with this proposal. The first was the fact that such allegedly exact calculations were the stuff of pseudo-scientific dreams.  The second problem was Schmidt's assumption that a paucity of minority firms in a particular sector of the economy always indicated discrimination or its ``lingering effects.'' Together they meant that procurement officers would continue to set goals (in effect quotas) that seemed ``fair.'' And to meet those goals, as the memo acknowledged, the government could continue to use such race-conscious mechanisms as bidding credits and bonus points for prime contractors who used minority subcontractors for part of the work. There was more, none of which changed the bottom line: <I>Adarand</I>, as the Justice Department had interpreted it, had been a waste of the Supreme Court's breath.
<P>
Times have changed. Preferences cannot survive the court of public opinion. Raw racial exclusion has almost disappeared, and the majority of Americans have never, in any case, viewed discrimination as the remedy for discrimination.
<P>
Federal set-aside programs and federal coercion to ensure the use of minority-owned firms have never been more vulnerable. And yet the Clinton Justice Department is still intent on keeping them safe and sound. Unless the public wakes up to the Administration's unabashed defense of racial preferences, four more years of President Clinton are likely to mean four more years in which such preferences remain alive and very well.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T THE</font> beginning of the twentieth century, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot entered the United States. American Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed on two basic goals: teach the newcomers English and make them Americans. The clear aim was to strengthen our national identity -- to reinforce the <I>unum</I> in <I>E pluribus unum</I> -- by assimilating the new arrivals into American civilization.
<P>
As the twentieth century nears its end, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot are, once again, entering the United States. Today, however, the American President, William Jefferson Clinton, promotes policies that are directly opposed to the strategies advocated by Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Instead of promoting Americanization and emphasizing the learning of English, the current occupant of the White House favors policies to weaken our national identity -- de facto anti-assimilation measures, anti-English-language initiatives, and an indifference to substantive citizenship training.
<P>
President Clinton and Education Secretary Riley tell us that their goal in supporting bi-lingual education is ``transitional.'' Schools should teach basic subjects in the children's ``primary language,'' so that they do not fall behind in math, science, history, and the like while they are learning English. Education professionals, however -- the people who actually run the schools -- strongly emphasize ``cultural preservation.'' Thus the Los Angeles Unified School District advises teachers ``not to encourage language-minority'' parents to speak English at home, but instead ``to encourage them to strongly promote development of the primary (non-English) language'' in their children. Current law buttresses the bi-lingual establishment by requiring that 75 per cent of all programs for newcomers be taught in the student's native language. This is at odds with proven principles of learning a second language, which is best done by writing and speaking it as much as possible, not simply by attending a one-hour class five days a week.
<P>
Even measured by its own criteria, bi-lingual education is a failure. It neither teaches English well, nor keeps students from falling behind in other subjects. A recent and comprehensive evaluation reported in the major research journal sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English found that ``there is no body of research evidence to support the notion that non-English-speaking children will read, write, and do academic work in English better if they learn to read, write, and do academic work in their home language first.''
<P>
The dismal failure of bi-lingual education to teach children English has led to open revolts by Hispanic parents in New York, California, New Jersey, and Nebraska. In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, 150 Latino parents organized to fight for English instruction for their children. Sister Kathy Maire, a Roman Catholic nun working with the parents, stated: ``The bottom line is these kids are being robbed of their futures.'' In Los Angeles some 100 Hispanic parents pulled their children out of a local school to protest bi-lingual education. Indeed, a U.S. Department of Education survey of Mexican- and Cuban-American parents revealed that four-fifths opposed teaching their children in Spanish, if this meant that less time would be devoted to English. Unfortunately, the education bureaucracy has a vested interest in keeping children in bi-lingual programs, because as the students ``transition out'' of native-language instruction, the schools lose government funds.
<P>
In this fight the Clinton Administration has from the beginning stood on the side of the bi-lingual establishment. Even before he was elected President, Bill Clinton, in an article in <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I> (October 1992), blasted the Bush Administration for not spending enough money on bi-lingual education. Once in power the Clintonites have not simply advocated more money for existing bi-lingual programs; they have expanded multi-lingual education. For example, the Administration's major education bill, the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, authorized federal funds to develop written grammars for previously oral American Indian and Native Alaskan languages. Thus instead of merely ``preserving'' primary languages, bi-lingual education under Clinton may include inventing what are essentially new written languages.
<P>
For the first time, the congressionally mandated National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), the ``Nation's Report Card,'' will be given in Spanish as well as in English. Deputy Education Secretary Madelein Kunin sent a memorandum to the civil servant in charge of the tests stating that ``excluding'' children whose English is limited violated the Civil Rights Act and ordering that these students be accommodated by providing them with Spanish versions of the math and science tests. The irony in giving the tests for the ``Nation's Report Card'' to American students in a language other than English appears to have gone unnoticed by either the Clinton Administration or the Republican Congress, which has remained mute on this issue. As Jorge Amselle of the Center for Equal Opportunity put it, ``If [the students] ace a history test in Spanish and flunk it in English, it's not going to do them any good when they go to get a job.''
<P>
Although Bill Clinton signed an official-English bill when he was governor of Arkansas, the Clinton Administration has opposed efforts by Republicans and by moderate and conservative Democrats in the 104th Congress to declare English the official language of the United States. The Administration also opposes congressional efforts to stop requiring states to provide ballots in other languages as discrimination against Americans who don't speak English.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, in a brilliant new book, <I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship</I> (to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press next month), chronicles in painful detail the steady diminution of naturalization -- the once meaningful process of immigrants' becoming American citizens. While the ``dumbing down'' of citizenship did not begin on January 20, 1993, it has clearly accelerated under the Clinton Administration. In December 1995 the Administration expanded the use of foreign languages on citizenship tests; four hundred new centers give the test in Spanish. Plans are under way to offer tests in Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> attitude toward the importance of English for American citizenship is reflected in the comments of Jess Nieto, a director of one of the ``community organizations'' authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to give citizenship tests. Nieto declared, ``Many of these people [resident aliens applying for citizenship] have been here a million years. Why should they have to take the test in English?''
<P>
The citizenship tests themselves have been stripped of much of the rich historical, civic, and patriotic content that once made studying for and passing the test a truly gratifying experience in the life of a new American citizen. Even the dignified and moving court ceremony for swearing in new immigrants is no longer mandatory. Besides the INS, over eight hundred organizations are now eligible to give citizenship tests. Leftist advocacy groups such as the Asylum and Refugee Rights Project, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under the Law, and the Mexican - American Legal Defense and Educational Fund are working closely with the INS. Ironically, activist lawyers who spend their working hours litigating against any legal distinctions between citizens and non-citizens are often running the official process that makes resident aliens American citizens. Even the Heritage of Aztlan Educational and Cultural Foundation -- a group which romanticizes irredentist Mexican claims to the ``lost territories'' of the Southwestern United States -- is busy giving tests in American history and civics to candidates for American citizenship.
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>EANWHILE</font>, the Clinton Administration has begun a project of instant mass naturalization, Citizenship USA. Hundreds of federal workers from other agencies have been detailed to the INS to process citizenship applications. In one case in California, special personnel worked from dawn to dusk for two months and naturalized sixty thousand resident aliens. According to an article by Ruth Larson in the <I>Washington Times</I>, a career INS official stated that a White House staffer admitted to him, ``Quite frankly, it's 250,000 registered voters who are likely to vote Democratic.''
<P>
Attitudes about citizenship and American identity are revealed in the words and actions of Clinton appointees. For example, Eugene Garcia, Clinton's bi-lingual-education chief from 1993 to 1995, told a conference of bi-lingual educators, ``The border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that border shall be nonexistent.'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has suggested that the inspiring Oath of Allegiance, in which new citizens promise to ``absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, . . . support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; . . . bear arms on behalf of the United States; . . . take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: so help me God,'' is ``anachronistic'' and should be changed.
<P>
One of Mrs. Meissner's top political appointees, Executive Associate Commissioner Robert Bach, was the principal author of a Ford Foundation report on immigrant communities in 1993. Bach recommended that non-citizens be permitted, indeed ``encouraged,'' to vote in city and school-board elections. In fact, the terms ``citizen'' and ``citizenship'' are rarely mentioned in the report; instead Bach uses the term ``established resident.'' He is critical of assimilation, suggests that too much ``homogeneity'' may be ``the problem in America,'' and emphasizes that long-established residents should ``accommodate'' the newcomers with multi-lingualism instead of assimilating them into mainstream society. Another of Mrs. Meissner's chief lieutenants, Alexander Alienikoff, has, according to Georgie Anne Geyer, ``argued constantly that it was time no longer to distinguish or differentiate between citizens and legal aliens.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration has unleashed the coercive power of federal agencies  against opponents of its anti-assimilation and multi-lingual policies. Thus on February 24, 1995, after the city council of Allentown, Pennsylvania, voted 6 to 1 to declare English the official language of their city, the city clerk received a call from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warning him that Allentown could lose federal funds if the city council did not repeal the ordinance. A Clinton appointee, Assistant Secretary Roberta Achtenberg, launched an investigation and suggested that the city's ordinance might violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Twenty-three Congressmen sent a letter to HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros demanding an explanation. Finally, after the city government promised not to implement the ordinance, the inquiry was canceled.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N</font> August 1995, the chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Clinton appointee Mary Frances Berry, subpoenaed members of the Florida-187 Committee to appear before a Commission hearing on ``racism.'' Mrs. Berry demanded that the group -- which supports a Florida initiative patterned after California's attempt to deny most public benefits to illegal aliens -- turn over all its computer printouts, reports, policy studies, memoranda, and internal documents. JoAnn Peart, a housewife from Delray Beach, one of the individuals subpoenaed, contacted Republican Congressman Mark Foley, who asked the Subcommittee on the Constitution to hold oversight hearings on the Civil Rights Commission's action. A group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to President Clinton stating that the Commission's action was a ``clear violation'' of citizens' ``right to engage in political activities without being intimidated or harassed by a government entity.'' Shortly after this uproar Mary Frances Berry withdrew the subpoenas.
<P>
For the past several decades Americans have had a continuing argument over two visions of the future, an argument that will determine the fate of our national identity. Do we promote English or multi-lingualism? Do we strengthen American citizenship or do we diminish it? Should we be a multi-ethnic nation or a multi-cultural one? A multi-ethnic nation means an America composed of individual citizens belonging to racial and ethnic groups from all over the world. On the other hand, a multi-cultural nation emphasizes group identity, not individual citizenship. It establishes different legal and language ``rights'' for different racial and ethnic groups, rejects assimilation, and erases distinctions between citizens and non-citizens.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Clinton Administration has joined the battle on the side of multi-lingualism and multiculturalism. The words and deeds of Clintonites Achtenberg, Aleinikoff, Bach, Berry, Cisneros, Garcia, Kunin, and Meissner are clear and consistent: expand official multi-lingualism wherever possible; water down the substantive meaning of citizenship; blur distinctions between citizens and non-citizens; advocate voting by non-citizens; and use Federal Government power to harass opponents of these policies.
<P>
Recently, Congress has started to challenge the Administration. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R., La.) succeeded in cutting bi-lingual education. Congressmen Toby Roth (R., Wisc.), Randy Cunningham (R., Calif.), and John Porter (R., Ill.) and Senator Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) have introduced legislation strengthening the use of English. On August 1, a bill making English the official language of the U.S. and allowing states to eliminate multilingual ballots passed the House. Despite these efforts, the multi-lingual/multi-cultural infrastructure will remain intact. For example, Congressman Roth's initiative to eliminate bi-lingual education is stalled in the House, and the Senate will almost certainly restore multi-lingual ballots when it votes on ``official English'' in September. If the bill passes, a veto is expected. Most importantly, a serious and sustained intellectual and moral argument against the continuing assault on American national identity has not yet been heard. In the final analysis, the struggle between multi-ethnic America and multi-cultural America will be won by the side that is able to articulate an intellectual and moral argument that resonates with the American people.
<P>
The Clinton Administration and their multi-lingualist allies have not made a compelling case for their radical new vision of America, but they have largely succeeded in scaring off and intimidating potential opposition. Their strategy is name calling -- denounce opponents of official multi-lingualism as ``mean-spirited,'' ``racists,'' and ``bigots.'' Thus the American Civil Liberties Union characterizes opposition to official multi-lingualism in terms of ``hate mongering'' and ``fostering bigotry and intolerance.''
<P>
No wonder opponents of official multi-lingualism have been hesitant to make this a major issue, knowing they will be vilified as ``racists'' and ``bigots.'' My guess, however, is that the great silent majority of Americans from all ethnic and racial backgrounds is waiting -- indeed hungering -- to hear the voice of multi-ethnic America challenge the multi-lingual/multi-cultural forces and dislodge them from the moral high ground.
<P>
This voice of multi-ethnic America would tell us: We the People of the United States, a self-governing and free people, have a moral right to transmit our way of life and our national heritage to future generations of Americans. Fluency in English is essential for full participation in our society. To tell newcomers to America otherwise is to lie to them. To be an American citizen is a privilege, not a right. To cheapen citizenship and blur the boundaries between citizens and non-citizens is to mock the sacrifices that have sustained our nation for more than two hundred years. If we don't take citizenship seriously we don't take our constitutional democracy seriously.
<P>
Therefore, we should establish English as our official language, eliminate bi-lingual education and multi-lingual ballots, and end the corruption of our naturalization process. Moreover, as people on both sides of the immigration debate -- including Linda Chavez, John Miller, Dan Stein, and the late Barbara Jordan -- have suggested, it is time to launch a new civic integration effort, similar to the Americanization initiatives earlier this century. Nothing could be more welcoming and inclusive than fostering English and teaching the responsibilities of citizenship to newcomers. Those of us whose parents or grandparents came through Ellis Island at the turn of the century are particularly grateful that Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson advocated Americanization, instead of multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism.
<P>
Opposition to official multi-lingualism does not mean that Americans should not learn foreign languages, or that we are not free to speak whatever language we want, or that languages other than English cannot be used in places such as courts and hospitals. It does not mean ``English only.'' It means that English should be the <I>official</I> language of <I>public</I> business in our liberal democracy.
<P>
Yes, as with people everywhere, there is bigotry among us. However, the genius of America is that we have worked to overcome unfair discrimination and irrational prejudice. To make the learning of English a priority and to strengthen the substance of citizenship does not mean we are ``racists'' and ``bigots'' -- it means that we take our national heritage and our democracy seriously.
<P>
It is the advocates of bi-lingual education who have prevented Latino kids from advancing. It is a patronizing establishment that is stealing their keys to the American dream.
<P>
The position advanced by the multicultural establishment amounts to a bluff. It is at odds with the feelings and instincts both of the American majority and of the minorities that these policies are allegedly designed to help. What is needed is an open discussion of the facts and values in question. Once that happens, the bluff will be called and the great American public will demand that we end official multi-lingualism, eliminate bi-lingual education and foreign language ballots, take naturalization seriously, and, in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, launch a new campaign for Americanization and civic integration.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>S THIS</font> country to remain the United States of America, pursuing the course of success as charted by the Founders, or are we resigned to watch a different type of country emerge in its place? That is the question Bob Dole should be asking his fellow citizens.
<P>
The spectacle of someone like me, an immigrant, who is also a recent arrival on the political scene, offering advice to America's senior professional politician is one of concern to me. No doubt, after nearly fifty years as a professional pianist, I would be startled if someone who apparently began lessons just a few years ago proposed a different way of playing. But then, my ``lessons'' in politics began at the age of eight, when German troops occupied Budapest.
<P>
It is, thus, of even greater concern to me that the Dole campaign -- the means by which to forestall the alteration-beyond-recognition of this miracle called America -- appears glued to the bottom of a hole in the ground. The other side continues to set the agenda; we remain on the defensive.
<p>
It is in this moment of despair that I request your attention, Senator Dole. One might think: A look at you, a look at the alternative would be sufficient to get you about 85 per cent of the popular vote. Alas, it is not sufficient. What the campaign needs is a different perspective. The time for traditional strategies which secure the Irish vote, the Jewish vote, the union vote, the senior-citizen vote, the black vote, the Southern vote, the women's vote, has passed. The time has come to seek the <I>American</I> vote.
<P>
Notwithstanding thirty years of concerted effort by the other side to subdivide us into irreconcilable groups, most of us still believe that we are, first and last, Americans.
<P>
It is easy to overlook the simple and obvious, precisely because you, Senator Dole, ``hold these truths to be self-evident.'' But people in Seattle and San Francisco, in San Antonio and Fort Myers, in Topeka, New London, St. Joseph -- even in Washington, D.C. -- would love to be reminded by you that this nation was founded on a set of principles which reflect the most thoughtful deliberation on the human condition ever undertaken. Talk to them about the thousands of years it had taken to establish equality before the law for every individual, now threatened by the ever-increasing demand for group rights; they need to realize that <I>group rights signal the end of individual rights</I>. Explain that one cannot ``almost'' guarantee private property, that its sanctity is the cornerstone of all civilization. They know the strength of your sentiments about judges who legislate from the bench; add to this the reminder that separation of powers -- not permitting the same people to make, interpret, and enforce the law -- is the fragile membrane protecting us from dictatorship. You might add, too, that you agree with the Founders, who envisioned no role in education for the Federal Government but who most certainly charged it with responsibility for the common defense.
<P>
Americans would love to hear you say that you will move to dismantle those regulatory and judicial straitjackets which are choking tolerance and voluntarism. Above all, reassure them that people who say ``In God we trust'' are echoing, not violating, the Founders' intent.
<P>
The language the Founders spoke was English; their deeply held beliefs came from the Old and New Testaments. Yet they benefited not only those whom the Founders represented but, in uncommon measure, those who arrived later, speaking different languages and desiring the freedom to live by their different beliefs. Above all, they bestowed upon their posterity the incomparable blessings of a polity in which the peaceful transition of power is the norm.
<P>
The other side will point to its standardized list of grievances aimed at the Founders. You might remind them that the founding principles were but a road map to guide us toward an ever-improving future. The map was based largely on the English legacy, which -- like all others -- was stained with blood. But unlike all others, it was from the start striving for a justice which cannot be bought or sold; for freedom on the high seas and in people's minds; for decency in human conduct and for honorable compromise in place of strife. We ought to continue speaking the language of this legacy. English has given us the word <I>fairness</I>. No other language has yet come up with even a translation of this word.
<P>
Americans may know, but will be glad to hear you say, where your ideas have originated. This would also create an opportunity to discuss where the other side obtained its. By ``other side'' I do not mean true Democrats: indeed, many of <I>them</I> might seize the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer to those whose ideas clearly derive from the opposing doctrine.
<P>
This doctrine has worn many labels -- Fascism, Bolshevism, National Socialism, Communism, Trotskyism, Social Democracy, Maoism, and present-day so-called Liberalism -- but all stand for some variation of socialist philosophy. The practices were developed in the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin School for Behavior Control, priding itself in such stellar graduates as Hitler and Stalin.
<P>
Nothing even remotely comparable in violence is contemplated by latter-day disciples: the current approach is low-key, sophisticated. Your recent encounter with tobacco, Senator, was a measure of its success. Tobacco, of course, has long been selected for an experiment in incremental behavior control. The process begins with an eminently reasonable suggestion, such as setting aside a few tables in restaurants, a few rows in airplanes. No one could possibly object. Semi-scientific ``evidence'' follows and selective name-calling commences. A <I>crescendo</I> is generated in the public discourse, leading to public hysteria, as the selected target is declared the dragon to be slain at all cost. As with every other item on the agenda, we are never told where the campaign intends to end. We sit in Edgar Allan Poe's cell, helplessly watching as the four walls and the ceiling close in on us.
<P>
By now, the targets, methods, and slogans of the other side have achieved such perfection (they <I>appear</I> so reasonable, compassionate, equitable) that exposing their true origins, along with the destruction that invariably follows in their wake, is the only way for our side to win. Lead us on to a winning course, Senator Dole. If they say, ``Character does not matter -- issues matter,'' tell them that <I>principles</I> matter even more. Serve notice that henceforth issues will be discussed first as they relate to our founding principles. Thus, the issue is not affirmative action, but equality before the law; not cutting off immigration, but inviting only those whose desire to become American; not the level of funding for Goals 2000, but restating where government has, and where it has not, a role to perform. Take the lead, and watch candidates -- and voters -- line up behind you.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>MMIGRATION</font>  experts generally agree that the Clinton Administration has devoted  more attention to immigration than either of its two Republican predecessors. Mr. Clinton's policies, however, tend to be reactive, and he always has at least two reactions: his initial public statement (determined largely by public-opinion polls, which show support for restrictions), and then the actual policy (as determined by his advisors and the various special interests they represent).
<P>
Let's begin with a look at Clinton's record on illegal immigration, since that is a major focus of his re-election campaign, particularly in California, a must-win state. Less than three months after taking office Clinton sent to Congress his Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which included cutting 93 Border Patrol positions. Four months later, Clinton responded to pressure from California Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (who was gearing up for re-election) by giving a speech in which he proclaimed that ``our borders leak like a sieve'' and urged that $45.1 million be spent to beef up the Border Patrol, including six hundred new agents. He failed to mention that the House had already approved an additional $60 million for the Border Patrol, or that the Senate Appropriations Committee had approved an additional $45 million.
<P>
In September 1993, the Border Patrol chief in El Paso, Silvestre Reyes, proved, on his own initiative, that illegal immigration could be reduced by up to 75 per cent, without a massive increase in money or personnel, by focusing on deterrence instead of apprehension. The Administration, apparently incensed that an employee would dare to be innovative without prior approval, ostracized Reyes and dismissed his hugely successful strategy as unworkable in other border areas. During the next few months, because of California's Proposition 187, Sen. Feinstein's neck-and-neck race with Republican challenger Michael Huffington, and Democrat Kathleen Brown's floundering bid to unseat Gov. Pete Wilson, the Administration was motivated to come up with its own plan to curb illegal immigration in San Diego. Thus, on October 1, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno unveiled the multi-million-dollar Operation Gatekeeper, heralded as an El Paso-type deterrence strategy, but actually more like the old (and unsuccessful) cat-and-mouse apprehension strategy.
<P>
Clinton repeatedly holds up Operation Gatekeeper as proof that he is more serious than Republicans about controlling illegal immigration. Border Patrol statistics, however, show that the number of illegal aliens apprehended in San Diego actually <I>increased</I> in all but three months of the first year and a half of Gatekeeper, rather than declining by the 70 per cent or so that Administration officials had promised.
<P>
These statistics presented something of a problem for the Administration until April 1996, when apprehensions in San Diego suddenly began to plummet. Two months later, the Administration was facing allegations that Border Patrol officials were falsifying arrest records to get the numbers down.
<P>
The Clinton Administration's record on political asylum is similar. During his first presidential campaign, Clinton berated George Bush for the latter's policy of returning Haitian boat people to Haiti for asylum interviews. Clinton pledged to provide a safe haven for the fleeing Haitians. Soon after the election, however, media reports that Haitians were building large numbers of boats to take advantage of his generosity spurred an angry public reaction. He immediately announced that he would maintain the Bush policy. This was only the first of many Clinton flip-flops on Haiti.
<P>
And then came the Cuban rafters. First, Clinton directed that their asylum claims be screened on board the Coast Guard ships that picked them up. When the ships filled up, Clinton directed that the Cubans be diverted to Guantanamo for asylum interviews. When Guantanamo began to fill up, with no end in sight, Clinton made a deal with Fidel Castro: the United States would admit a <I>minimum</I> of twenty thousand Cuban immigrants each year if Castro would agree to halt the outflow of rafters. Attorney General Reno announced that no Cubans would be admitted to the United States directly from Guantanamo (this was supposed to entice them to leave Guantanamo and return home voluntarily). The vast majority of Guantanamo Cubans are now settled in Miami -- after being transported directly from Guantanamo.
<P>
Seven months into his term, Clinton proposed legislation that included expedited exclusion for frivolous asylum claimants, an increase in INS asylum personnel, and various anti-smuggling provisions. But it didn't take long for the President to succumb to pressure from immigrant-advocacy, refugee-rights, and lawyers' groups and abandon the legislative package in favor of a watered-down package of administrative reforms that would have had little impact except for a provision that decouples the work permit from the asylum-application process.
<P>
For most of the past four years, the Administration has spoken about the need to reform the asylum system and reduce fraudulent applications. In most cases these statements have come in reaction to the latest crisis: Haiti, Cuba, the World Trade Center bombing, the <I>Golden Venture</I> incident (Clinton promised that the Chinese arriving on that ship would be swiftly deported, but many still are languishing in U.S. jails). But all the while, it has been broadening the asylum system to advance its social agenda. Under U.S. law, asylum is for people facing <I>state-sponsored political persecution</I>, but we now grant asylum, for example, to women facing genital mutilation. The latest Administration proposal reportedly is to grant asylum to aliens who are HIV positive (even though such aliens are not legally permitted to immigrate to this country).
<P>
Finally, there is President Clinton's record on legal immigration. In June 1995, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended a modest cut in legal immigration and the elimination of some extended-family immigration categories. President Clinton immediately endorsed the recommendations as ``consistent with my own views'' and added that they ``are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization.'' Both Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Tex.) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) modeled their immigration bills on the Commission's recommendations, believing logically enough that they would encounter little resistance after Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement.
<P>
Unfortunately, Barbara Jordan died before the Smith and Simpson bills reached the floor, allowing Clinton to renege on his endorsement without risking a Jordan tongue-lashing (one Commission staffer told me he's glad he's not the one who will have to explain Clinton's reversal to Miss Jordan on the other side of the Pearly Gates). So, during the Senate Judiciary Committee markup of the Simpson bill, Attorney General Reno and INS Commissioner Meissner personally lobbied senators to support an amendment by Sen. Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.) to split the legislation into one bill on illegal immigration and one on legal, thus effectively killing any chance for legal-immigration reform in the Senate. Two days before the final House vote on the Smith bill, President Clinton sealed the fate of legal-immigration reform by announcing his support for an amendment by Reps. Dick Chrysler (R., Mich.), Howard Berman (D., Calif.), and Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) to eliminate from the bill the reductions in legal immigration.
<P>
In sum, the Clinton Administration has rejected the one proven strategy for controlling illegal immigration, broadened the grounds for asylum, and killed legal-immigration reform.
<P>
(One final note: If you did not find your favorite Clinton immigration flip-flop here, I apologize -- the list was so long I had to pick and choose.)

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>ORE</font> than a thousand people have died and millions have had to flee their homes, the wires have reported, during recent flooding of the Yangtze River. By historic standards this is a modest flood. Tens of thousands drown every few years in Yangtze floods, and there have been cases when millions died from the uncontrolled waters of China's largest river spilling its banks.
<P>
Lord knows the Communist dynasty ruling in Peking has many crimes to account for, but attempting to tame the waters of the Yangtze to save its citizens from those deadly floods surely does not rank among them. Yet the Clinton Administration has given extraordinarily high priority to sabotaging the financing of the Three Gorges Dam, China's $12-billion effort to control the floods. To save fresh-water dolphins, Siberian cranes, and picturesque rugged scenery, the Administration has worked assiduously to stop the project. Samuel Berger, deputy National Security Advisor, intervened with the supposedly independent Ex-Im Bank to stop commercial credits for it. As a result, Caterpillar and other U.S. companies seeking to sell equipment in competition with Japanese and European manufacturers have been handicapped, and the cost of building the dam increased. Behind the scenes the Administration also threatened to use its veto power at the World Bank and other international agencies to prevent them from lending money for the Three Gorges project.
<P>
Now, there may be legitimate criticisms of the design of the Three Gorges dam. It may be Stalinist gargantuism. Maybe a design with several smaller dams would have been better? Maybe the scenery and endangered species could have been accommodated to a  greater degree, while still providing flood control and electricity? Such questioning of detail would be one thing. But the U.S. position under the Clinton Administration has been one of outright hostility to the aims of the Yangtze project, reflecting a humanity-hating environmentalism that dwells on possible dangers to birds and fish while cavalierly disregarding the needs of tens of millions of people. This extreme brand of environmentalism pervades the Clinton Administration.
<P>
Indeed, its ``integrating'' this environmentalism into all aspects of government has been a major internal goal of the Clinton Administration. In foreign policy, for example, this has meant creating a new under-secretary position for environmental affairs at the Department of State, a position given to Green ex-Senator Timothy Wirth; designating a senior officer at each embassy as ``environmental point person''; and identifying environmentalist doctrine as part of the United States vital interests. A memorandum from Secretary of State Warren Christopher dated February 14 to all embassies and bureaus of the State Department said that ``environmental concerns'' will henceforth be a key component of U.S. foreign policy. Environmental issues are to be ``integrated'' into ``bureau and mission program plans,'' into ``trip plans,'' and into ``talking points for bilateral meetings involving the President and other senior officials.'' In short, every U.S. official is under orders to become an environmentalist scold.
<P>
One hopes that the vast majority of U.S. officials will just go through the motions, generating the usual statements about recycling, energy conservation, ozone-layer protection, dolphin protection, and suchlike, and inserting them into their memoranda. But there has been a steady entrenchment of this stuff even as the bits and pieces of science underpinning it are demonstrated to be junk.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>AKE</font> that mother of all scares, global warming. Simply put, there isn't any global warming. It isn't happening, according to the most sophisticated temperature measurement by balloon and satellite. There's a lot of theory and many fancy computer modelings about why it should be happening. But it just isn't there on the thermometers.
<P>
So now we have parts of the Clinton Administration engaging in Statistical Fraud 101. Any time series of a phenomenon like average temperature by year will bump up and down, and elementary junk science yields a handy means of ``proving'' an upward trend. Search a series for a couple of low years and start off with those; then cut off your trend line when you've got a couple of high years. The global-warming junkmeisters at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just last month did that in an article in Nature magazine using temperature data from 1963 to 1987. Given that 1964 was extraordinarily cold and 1987 very hot, these cheerleaders for Al Gore produced a good-looking uptrend.
<P>
Of course when you include the data from a few years before 1963 and the years since 1987 -- as Patrick Michaels, a University of Virginia climatologist, quickly did -- you get what every reputable calculation of the thermometer data shows, which is that there is no up-trend.
<P>
More recently, the Administration made a major shift leftward to embrace a canon of environmentalist fundamentalism that it had previously found too hot politically -- mandatory limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Green Czar Timothy Wirth announced a new U.S. policy of mandatory limits on carbon-dioxide emissions at a press conference in Geneva July 16 saying the United States was proposing a ``radical'' international accord: ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed on internationally.'' This radical approach has never been the subject of any reasoned Administration statement or testimony, let alone the subject of major study by a serious scientific panel. Indeed, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study a couple of years ago said that if global warming does occur humanity can adapt, since the computer-forecast changes in climate are similar in magnitude to natural changes. But the Administration is going by green-faith, and science is useful to it only insofar as it supports that faith.
<P>
By pushing an international accord on suppressing greenhouse gases, evangelists of environmentalism such as Mr. Wirth are able to take the huge issues of constraining our power stations and industries out of domestic policy forums. If the accord is agreed to in Geneva, then it gains international legitimacy and opponents at home are disparaged as ``flying in the face of world opinion and advocating that we flout international law.''
<P>
At the same time that users of the carbon fuels of coal, oil, and gas are under pressure from the threatened mandatory international controls driven by the warming scare, the nuclear-power industry is not being allowed to dispose of its wastes. The Clinton Department of Energy, under environmentalist influence, is stalling on the opening of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear-waste repository in Nevada with years' more studies of possible seismic and other dangers. What was supposed to open in 1998 now cannot open before 2010, the Administration says.
<P>
Nuclear power plants have such a good safety record in operation that their opponents rely on hypothetical problems of waste disposal to stop new plants and to get existing ones closed. And so high-level wastes are accumulating onsite year by year at a hundred nuclear plants around the country because the Administration won't open the long-term repository that has been built in Nevada.
<P>
Meanwhile the green assault on synthetic chemicals is being pushed within the Environmental Protection Agency in a bold move to dispense with a hitherto unchallenged part of science -- the EPA proposes to simply omit from it as cancer-test guidelines the test of statistical significance -- the classic scientific tool for measuring the possibility that study results reflect chance rather than a regular association. As the newsletter <I>EPA WATCH</I> reported: ``Reducing the role of statistical significance or eliminating it altogether, could open the door for EPA to drastically expand the number of substances subject to environmental regulation.'' The newsletter might have added: and allow the EPA to regulate in an even more arbitrary fashion than now -- at home and abroad.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1992</font>, the economy grew by 2.7 per cent. Candidate Bill Clinton described that as ``the worst economic performance in fifty years.'' In 1995 the economy grew by around 2 per cent. Yet in this January's State of the Union message, the President said the economy is ``the healthiest in thirty years.'' So on which, if either, occasion was Bill Clinton telling the truth?
<P>
By every conceivable measure of income, output, or productivity, the economy has performed poorly on Clinton's watch, particularly in comparison with what Bob Bartley dubbed ``the seven fat years'' of 1983 to 1989.
<P>
<b>Gross domestic product:</b> Real GDP, the most comprehensive measure of the economy's output, grew by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.9 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Productivity:</b> Growth of output per hour in the non-farm business sector averaged only 0.5 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department figures on ``multifactor productivity'' show the ratio of capital to labor falling in 1993 - 94, which inevitably slows the growth of productivity, real wages, and family incomes.
<P>
<b>Real disposable income:</b> After-tax personal income rose by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.5 per cent in 1983 - 89.
Real labor compensation: Real hourly wages and benefits rose by 7 per cent in 1981 - 88, but were virtually flat from 1988 to 1995.
<P>
<b>Employment:</b> As measured by the household survey, employment grew by only 1.9 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Measured by an alternative survey of business (which may count the same workers twice), payroll employment grew by 2.6 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, but that too was down from 3 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Labor force:</b> The supply of new workers slowed to 0.8 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.8 per cent in 1983 - 89. Demographics can't begin to explain this huge and sudden drop in the willingness to look for work, but disincentives in our tax and transfer payments can.
<P>
<b>Savings:</b> Gross private savings amounted to only 14.6 per cent of GDP in 1993 - 95, down from 17.2 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
Was this trip really necessary?
<P>
Even in the very few areas where the economy appears to have fared relatively well, it still fails to measure up to the lofty standards set by the Reagan years. The Clinton Administration points with pride to growth of real exports, which did indeed rise at an 8.3 per cent rate over the past three years. But imports grew faster -- at a 10 per cent rate. In 1983 - 89, by contrast, real exports grew by 9.4 per cent a year, and imports by 8.6 per cent.
<P>
One statistic almost summarizes all the rest: Median family income fell by more than 5 per cent from 1989 through 1994 (the latest available figure). By contrast, median family income rose by 12.6 per cent from 1982 to 1989. These figures are before taxes, so they understate the actual drop in living standards following the 1993 increase in taxes on incomes, Social Security benefits and gasoline.
<P>
Income statistics for 1995 and 1996 are unlikely to look much better. Real wages were flat in 1995, and employment nearly so (by January 1996, employment was only 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier). Wages picked up a bit in early 1996, but so did inflation. The increase in consumer prices averaged 3.6 per cent in the first half of this year, wiping out nominal wage increases in the process. Recent employment gains have slowed to 1.5 per cent or less, compared with the same month a year ago.
<P>
Because employment grew at about the same slow 2 per cent pace as the economy in the past three years, it follows that output per worker (productivity) must have grown very slowly. Indeed, productivity growth averaged only 0.6 per cent in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 in 1983 - 89. There is no mystery at all about why real wages have stagnated in the past three years, despite a flood of misinformed news reports on that topic. Real output per worker and real income per worker are just two different ways of looking at the same thing. If we don't produce more, there won't be more to go around.
<P>
The Clinton Administration would much prefer to reduce all these uncomfortable economic comparisons to a single statement -- namely, the claim that the President himself has personally ``created'' nearly ten million jobs. The reason for that single-minded focus is obvious: ten million new jobs sounds like an impressive number. In fact, it isn't. If employment had grown as rapidly in 1993 - 95 as it did in 1983 - 89, the economy would have generated two million <I>more</I> jobs than it did between the end of 1992 and 1995.
<P>
There are two ways the unemployment rate can go down. One is for employers to offer more jobs. The other is for fewer people to go looking for jobs (to be listed as unemployed you must be looking for a job and not finding one). As it happens, surprisingly few people have been looking for work. Growth in the labor force has slowed to a crawl. This puts severe limits on future employment growth, and therefore on economic growth as well. And it is one link, but only one, between the decidedly mediocre growth of output and income and the 1993 increase in marginal tax rates.
<P>
The 1996 Economic Report of the President complains, ``some claimed these tax rate increases [e.g., in 1993] would do severe harm to the economy by creating disincentives for individuals to work and save. Again, these forecasts turned out to be false, just as did the earlier supply-side forecasts of rapid growth from tax reductions.'' It is difficult to imagine what numbers the President's economists have been looking at. If 3.9 per cent economic growth from 1983 to 1989 did not constitute ``rapid growth from tax reductions,'' then what are we to make of 2.3 per cent growth from Mr. Clinton's higher tax rates?
<P>
When it comes to ``disincentives for individuals to work,'' look at what the Economic Report itself says: ``The increase in the overall labor-force-participation rate has slowed since the late 1980s. . . . The stagnant participation rate has been one of the more enduring aspects of this expansion.'' Many secondary earners, mostly women, dropped out of the job market after the counterproductive, revenue-losing tax-rate increases of 1990 and 1993. The percentage of families with two or more earners, for example, dropped to 56.4 per cent in 1993 from 58.2 per cent in 1989, while the percentage with zero workers rose. This should come as no surprise. Assuming the first earner makes more than $140,000, the very first dollar of a second earner's income is now taxed at the same demoralizing 36 - 40 per cent rate as the first earner's last dollar.
<P>
More and more people are also retiring earlier. This too was quite predictable. The extra 1993 tax on Social Security benefits severely punishes older people who keep working, or who made the mistake of having saved enough to afford a modest retirement. The increase in the already punitive estate tax also undermines a major incentive for working and saving in later years.
<P>
In 1993, the earned-income tax credit increased the share of the loot given to those with incomes well above the poverty level. That too discouraged additional work and additional workers. Marginal tax rates on any extra income are now 50 - 75 per cent for two-thirds of EITC recipients.
<P>
The reduction in the supply of willing workers is what kept the measured unemployment rate low, despite the fact that employment has grown by only 1.3 per cent a year since 1991, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department demographers had forecast that the labor force would grow by 1.3 per cent a year in the 1990s, but it has not even grown by 1 per cent. If the number of job seekers had grown as rapidly as the demographic experts suggested, there would be a lot more people looking for work, and the unemployment rate would now be well above 8 per cent. If the labor force had grown as rapidly as in the Eighties, the unemployment rate would exceed 11 per cent.
<P>
What about ``disincentives . . . to save''? Since tax rates went up in 1993, personal saving has dropped to 4.2 per cent of after-tax income, down from 5.9 per cent in 1992. Measured in constant 1992 dollars, real personal saving was only $223.8 billion in 1995, compared with $310.5 billion ten years earlier. Increased tax rates on high-income individuals and on corporations directly reduced the amount of disposable income left to save, as well as reducing incentives to save.
<P>
Apologists for Clinton's economic policies often blame Alan Greenspan for the sluggish growth of output and income. Has the Fed been discouraging growth through excessively tight monetary policy? Hardly. Short-term interest rates have been much lower in the past three years than they ever were in 1983 - 89, in both nominal and real terms. In other words, the Fed was less accommodating in the 1980s than today, but we had higher growth then.
<P>
By the time of the November election, living standards will have gone nowhere but down for seven years. This is unprecedented. In the 49 years that figures on median family income have been collected, they never before declined for seven years. The worst economic performance in fifty years, as Mr. Clinton used to say, is arguably right now.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> conventional wisdom is that the Republican Party is the party of the rich, while the Democrats represent the working class. But under Ronald Reagan's policies working-class Americans prospered, and under Clintonomics, the working class has lost ground. Only the rich have prospered on Clinton's watch.
<P>
During the 1980s, each uptick in the share of total income going to the wealthy was trumpeted on the front page of every major newspaper as evidence that the Reaganomics had created an era of greed and income disparity. And indeed, the wealthy were better off. The share of total income going to the top 20 per cent of households rose by 2.4 per cent, and the share going to the top 5 per cent rose by 1.9 per cent during the Reagan Administration. Yet during just the first two years of the Clinton Administration (the latest data go only through 1994), the top 20 per cent increased their share of the income pie as much as they did during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration. And the top 5 per cent have done even better, increasing their share of total income by 2.5 per cent.
<P>
In fact, the share of total income gained by the top 20 per cent of households hit an all-time high in 1994 (49.1 per cent), as did the share going to the top 5 per cent (21.2 per cent). The top quintile's share of total income was significantly lower in every year of the Reagan Administration than in either of Clinton's first two. In 1988, the year under Reagan when the rich did the best, the top quintile received 46.3 per cent of total income and the top 5 per cent received 18.3 per cent. In other words, income gains in the 1980s were more evenly divided among the income classes than has been the case in the 1990s.
<P>
How can this be? Clinton's first priority after taking office was to raise taxes on the rich precisely in order to reduce income inequality. This is why the very centerpiece of his economic program was an increase in the top tax rate from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent -- to force the rich to pay more. Yet all the evidence thus far shows that income inequality became worse following the tax increase. Nevertheless after release of the latest income data, the <I>Washington Post</I> and other media outlets editorialized against the Republican Congress's proposed tax cut because it ``would add to what is already so disturbing a trend'' of greater income inequality.
<P>
At least Reagan could argue that although the rich got richer, so did everyone else. Real median family income (in 1994 dollars) rose from $36,825 when he took office to $40,890 by the time he left. Furthermore, the average real income of those in the bottom quintile of households rose from $7,954 to $8,391, and the income of those in the second lowest quintile rose from $18,856 to $20,797. The third and fourth quintiles also saw significant increases.
<P>
By contrast, median family income has been flat during the Clinton Administration. During its first two years, real median family income averaged $38,343, down from $38,632 in 1992 and well below the level when Reagan left office. The income of the bottom quintile has averaged $7,681 and that of the second quintile has averaged $19,176. In 1992 these groups averaged $7,698 and $19,205, respectively. However, the average income of the top quintile rose from $96,240 in 1992 to $105,945 in 1994, and that of the top 5 per cent went from $152,751 to $183,044.
<P>
Other measures of income also show that the non-rich have not benefited at all from Clinton's policies. Workers, for example, are no better off today than they were when Clinton took office. In January 1993 real average weekly earnings for private-sector workers were $253.76 (in 1982 dollars). In May 1996, the most recent month for which there are data, real earnings were $253.80. That works out to a real pay increase of just one cent per week for every year Clinton has been in office.
<P>
History teaches us that it is virtually impossible to reduce the share of income going to the wealthy by raising their taxes. The reason is that the negative economic effects of raising marginal tax rates reduce everyone's incomes. The only way to raise the share of income going to the non-wealthy is by increasing the rate of economic growth. The source of the wealthy's gains during the Clinton years has been lower interest rates and a strong stock market.
<P>
Workers, meanwhile, have seen their incomes squeezed by Clinton's policies -- the prosperity has not trickled down. Only an aggressive pro-growth policy of supply-side tax cuts and less regulation will improve their living standards. Contrary to conventional wisdom, throughout American history a rising tide really has lifted all boats. Clinton's austerity has succeeded in lifting only the yachts of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers.

<FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><font size=+1>RODUCTIVITY</font> growth has been only 0.5 per cent a year on Bill Clinton's watch, the lowest rate through an Administration since Herbert Hoover. Worker productivity since 1993 has been only about one-third the rate under Ronald Reagan (1.3 per cent) and has even been well below the rate under George Bush (0.9 per cent).
<P>
We care about productivity rates because this is what drives the real wages of workers. Given the anemic productivity rates since 1993, it should hardly be surprising that the growth of average real (inflation-adjusted) labor compensation under Clinton has also been very low. This is the primary reason, even with low unemployment and inflation, why many Americans are concerned about their economic future. This is the primary pocketbook issue on which Clinton's record is vulnerable.
<P>
The average rate of worker-productivity growth has declined somewhat unevenly for thirty years, interrupted only by a temporary upswing during the Reagan years. The reasons for this long-term decline are not fully understood by economists, let alone policymakers, but the following conditions are at least partly responsible:
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Too many young workers have low job skills, despite a long-term increase of real spending per student by over 30 per cent a decade. The average composite SAT score peaked in 1963, declined almost continuously through 1980, and has since been roughly stable.<br>
2. Taxes as a percentage of GDP have increased by about 5 points beginning with the Vietnam War and the expansion of the welfare state in the mid 1960s.<br>
3. The costs of health, safety, and environmental regulation and of civil litigation increased sharply beginning in the early 1970s.<br>
4. The net national saving rate has declined sharply over the past 15 years, reflecting the combination of a decline in the private saving rate and an increase in the federal deficit. The private sector has been able to maintain a somewhat higher investment rate only by a substantial increase in borrowing from foreigners.</blockquote>
<P>
President Clinton did not create these conditions, but he should be judged by what, if anything, he has done to alleviate them.
<P>
As it has turned out, the Clinton Administration and, more generally, the national Democratic Party, has been an enemy of the very types of policies that are necessary to increase productivity growth. Let me count the ways:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In response to the teachers' unions, Clinton has opposed school vouchers, even in the District of Columbia (where his daughter attends a private school). In response to the industrial unions, Clinton proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage (which reduces the opportunity for on-the-job training) and opposed a bill that would have relaxed the restriction on ``quality circles'' in non-union firms.<br>
 -- At almost every decision point, Clinton has sided with the current beneficiaries of federal spending rather than with present and future taxpayers. Both Bush and Clinton addressed the deficit more by increasing taxes than by reducing domestic spending. As a consequence, the top marginal rate on earnings was increased from 28 per cent to 42 per cent. For any given reduction in the deficit, however, the economic benefits of reduced spending have proved to be much higher than the benefits of higher tax revenues. In other words, it matters a lot <I>how</I> we balance the budget.<br>
 -- Fortunately, there has been relatively little new regulatory legislation on Clinton's watch; indeed a substantial deregulation of agriculture and telecommunications was approved (though without much of an Administration role). But Clinton and congressional Democrats blocked other regulatory-reform measures. Of greater concern, Clinton seems to have given the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration almost free rein. For example, the FDA has proposed major restrictions on tobacco marketing with no clear statutory authority.
 -- In response to the trial lawyers, Clinton vetoed bills to restrict shareholder suits and to reform product-liability law. The costly litigation explosion is another factor in the deterioration in productivity.<br>
 -- Senior members of the Administration have demonized corporate CEOs, the banking industry, drug firms, the insurance industry, oil companies, the medical profession, and tobacco firms. Clinton has jeopardized foreign investment by threatening to extend U.S. law to the operations of parent companies abroad. Which firm, industry, or profession is next?<br>
 -- Clinton opposes proposals to reduce the tax bias against saving and investment while refusing to even acknowledge the multi-trillion dollar implicit debt of the Social Security system.</blockquote>
<p>

In sum, the damage done by President Clinton is not primarily that productivity growth has declined on his brief watch. It is that with few exceptions, he has actively opposed the measures that the United States must take to reverse this disturbing trend. Ironically, Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992 issuing a challenge to the American people to have ``the courage to change.'' Now he is the adversary of the very changes in policies that are imperative to build a prosperous future for our children. On this record, Clinton has no claim to the mantle of compassion.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>F</font> Woody Allen was right that 90 per cent of life is just showing up, then Bill Clinton has a stellar fiscal record. The federal budget deficit has tumbled from $255 billion in 1993 to a projected $117 billion this year. And Clinton was there when it happened. But that just about covers the extent of his involvement. For evidence of this, let's review the Clinton record over the past three and a half years:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton announces his new Administration's first economic program: a $16-billion ``fiscal stimulus.'' The spending package is later abandoned by the Democratic Congress as too fiscally irresponsible.
<P>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton wins passage of his $250-billion tax hike -- which New York Sen. Pat Moynihan accurately describes as ``the largest tax increase in world history.'' It passes both houses of Congress without a single Republican vote. The package contains approximately $2 of new spending for every $1 of new taxes.
<P>
 -- In September 1993 the Clinton White House lobbies to defeat the bi-partisan Penny - Kasich deficit-reduction bill, which would have cut federal spending and the deficit by $90 billion over five years.
<P>
 -- In January 1994 Bill and Hillary Clinton unveil ``ClintonCare.'' The proposed hostile federal takeover of one-seventh of the U.S. economy would add at least $75 billion to the deficit over the next six years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
<P>
 -- In September 1994 the President furiously lobbies liberal Democrats in Congress to oppose a Balanced Budget Amendment -- a measure supported by 75 per cent of the American public. Labor Secretary Robert Reich is a little too honest when he confirms most Americans' suspicions about this Administration: ``The President is against simply balancing the budget.''
<P>
 -- In October 1994 the President signs into law his $30-billion ``crime bill.'' The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> describes the legislation as a ``once-in-a-lifetime  federal spending bonanza'' containing ``a vast array of new social programs'' including federally funded exotic-dance classes, sensitivity-training courses, and midnight-basketball leagues. The cost of the Clinton bill has to be shaved after the Democratic House of Representatives rejects the original version as too expensive.
<P>
 -- In January 1995 Bill Clinton submits a 1996 budget plan that calls for $12 trillion of spending over the next seven years and $200-billion deficits for as far as the eye can see. Even <I>Washington Post</I> reporter David Broder blasts the document as a ``symbol of Clinton's failed leadership.'' Because of the debt Clinton is adding, writes Broder, ``the annual net interest is projected to climb from $198 billion in 1993 to $270 billion in 1997 -- when it will, for the first time, be larger than the projected defense budget.''
<P>
 -- In March 1995 Clinton again helps torpedo the Balanced Budget Amendment -- this time by strong-arming five Democratic senators, who had campaigned as champions of the amendment -- to flip-flop and vote no.
<P>
 -- In June 1995, under pressure from the GOP Congress, Bill Clinton submits a new, revised budget proposal. It still doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In July 1995 the Clinton White House begins its successful ``Medi-scare'' strategy to undermine public support for a GOP plan to rein in stampeding Medicare costs. Even the <I>Washington Post</I> editorializes that the Clinton Administration has become a gang of ``medagogues.'' On Medicare and Medicaid, the White House is ``engaged in an irresponsible campaign based on distortion and fear.''
<P>
 -- In October 1995 Bill Clinton confirms what most of the public is already painfully aware of: ``I raised your taxes too much.''
<P>
 -- In December 1995 Bill Clinton vetoes the historic balanced-budget legislation enacted by the Republican Congress -- listing 82 reasons why it cuts too much spending. He complains of cuts in everything from foreign aid to corporate welfare.
<P>
 -- Later that month Bill Clinton releases his unprecedented third and then fourth budget proposals of the year. But they <I>still</I> don't balance the budget.
<P>
 -- In February 1996 Bill Clinton releases a $1.65-trillion 1997 budget that calls for $360 billion in added spending, or $3,100 per American household, over the next seven years. Then with a straight face he tells the nation that ``the era of big government is over.'' Oh, and the proposal <I>still</I> doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In April 1996 Clinton signs the GOP budget after the Republicans capitulate to his demands and add back some $10 billion of deficit spending.
</blockquote>
<P>
<font size=+3>W</font><font size=+1>HEW!</font> This really is a pillar of fiscal integrity we have in the White House. The point of this demoralizing three-and-a-half-year budget odyssey is this: The Clinton Administration cannot credibly claim credit for the reduction in the deficit unless the nation is suffering from a severe case of fiscal amnesia.
<P>
On at least three separate occasions in 1993 and 1994 -- the fiscal-stimulus package, ClintonCare, and the crime bill -- the Administration attempted to make the deficit situation worse, but amazingly was constrained by a Democratic Congress. On four other instances, bipartisan deficit-reduction initiatives were rebuked by Clinton. 
<P>
Since the Republicans took control of Congress in November of 1994, Clinton's fiscal obstructionism and demagoguery has been elevated to Olympic levels. The Republicans' budget-balancing plan was thrashed almost daily by the White House as ``mean-spirited,'' ``radical,'' ``harmful to children, the poor, and the environment,'' and ``just plain wrong for America.'' Yet in typical Clinton fashion, one day the budget is denounced as ``wrong for America,'' the next day the White House is staging a Rose Garden press conference claiming credit for the impressive first-year deficit reduction that the ``mean-spirited'' Republican budget produced.
<P>
So how much of the credit for the impressive drop in the deficit this year does the Administration deserve? The standard spin from the White House these days is that the ``enormous progress'' on the deficit vindicates the Clinton ``$500-billion deficit-reduction'' package of 1993. It turns out we can roughly calculate how much of the deficit decline is attributable to Clinton, and how much to Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress. Back in April 1995, just before the Republicans released their seven-year balanced-budget plan, the CBO announced that Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would produce $211 billion of red ink in 1996.
<P>
Instead, the deficit will fall to $117 billion. That's a $94-billion improvement -- almost entirely attributable to the GOP budget. Over the entire seven-year budget window, the Gingrich plan chops a shade over $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) of deficit spending from the Clintonomics baseline.
<P>
The budget deficit would be lower still had it not been for Bill Clinton's vetoes of Republican Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and appropriations bills. Those vetoes canceled an estimated $10 to $15 billion in budget cuts for 1996 -- savings that would have been magnified in future years.
<P>
GOP partisans can hardly exult in the deficit story of the past five years, however. Despite this Administration's sorry record of fiscal obstructionism, there is still the unarguable underlying fact that Bill Clinton's overall fiscal performance has been far superior to that of his predecessor, George Bush.
<P>
All the deficit reduction of the last three years is simply recovering the lost ground of the early 1990s -- Richard Darman's reign of fiscal terror. It is a popular myth that George Bush inherited a budget crisis ``baked in the cake'' from Ronald Reagan. When Reagan left the White House in January 1989, the deficit was $150 billion and forecast to decline gradually till it reached $110 billion in 1995. The CBO concluded that continued deficit reduction would occur if Bush (and Darman) simply left fiscal policy on automatic pilot.
<P>
Instead, we got Bush's infamous reversal on ``no new taxes'' and a 1990 budget package that dealt a body blow to an already ailing economy and sent the deficit into the stratosphere. From 1990 to 1995 the national debt soared $622 billion above the levels anticipated in 1989. Richard Darman's enduring legacy to the nation is this: 1990 - 94 was the worst five-year deficit performance since World War II. Now really, how hard has it been for Clinton to improve on that rotten fiscal record?
<P>
The Left is now again busy trying to rewrite history to suggest that the Bush 1990 and the Clinton 1993 tax hikes contributed mightily to the decline in the deficit. The top marginal income-tax rate has risen by 50 per cent -- from 28 per cent in 1989 to 42 per cent this year. Yet federal revenues grew faster in the 1980s with Reagan's substantial across-the-board tax cut than during the 1990s with these two giant tax hikes.
<P>
Overall real federal revenues (1982 to 1989) grew by 24 per cent during the seven-year period after the Reagan tax cuts took full effect. But (as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget Office) overall federal revenue growth from 1990 through 1997 will be only 18.5 per cent. If federal revenues had grown in the 1990s at only the pace they did after the Reagan tax cuts, federal receipts in 1996 would be almost $50 billion greater and the deficit would be one-third smaller.
<P>
Income-tax receipts after adjusting for inflation rose by 16.3 per cent in the seven years after the full Reagan tax cut. Income-tax receipts will have climbed by 16.1 per cent in real terms in the seven years since 1990.
<P>
So where is the evidence that these tax increases actually raised revenues?
<P>
If tax hikes don't account for the lowering of the deficit, what does? America's victory in the Cold War. (The extent of Bill Clinton's contribution to that effort was in obtaining draft deferments.) In the 1980s the nation invested $2 trillion on the Reagan military build-up to vanquish the Evil Empire -- perhaps the only truly successful government program of the last half-century. Now we are rapidly demilitarizing, creating a vast budget windfall. Over the past eight years the Pentagon's budget has fallen by almost $110 billion in real terms. How's this for a coincidence: that's almost precisely how much the real budget deficit has fallen over that period.
<P>
Normally in post-war years the United States Government not only moves immediately back to a balanced-budget regime, but cuts taxes and then runs budget <I>surpluses</I> to begin paying off the wartime debt. In the post - Cold War 1990s none of those things have happened. No tax cut. No balanced budget. No liquidation of the debt. Instead defense cutbacks have helped camouflage a sustained non-defense spending build-up. Between 1989 and 1995, real defense outlays have fallen by one-third, while everything else we spend money on -- from peanut subsidies to the Mark Hatfield Memorial Courthouse in Portland -- has climbed by $300 billion, or 30 per cent. Last year federal spending on non-defense programs consumed 18 per cent of national output, a larger share than at any previous time in American history. The nanny state is alive and well in America.
<P>
So much so that we can now add the most recent and depressing entry to the Clinton fiscal chronology:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In July 1996 the CBO announces that the Clinton deficit-reduction honeymoon is over. After 1997, the Clinton baseline outlook steadily deteriorates in every year for the next decade. Then the government's finances implode. Runaway entitlement expenditures -- particularly for Medicare and Medicaid -- ravage the budget. The CBO predicts that unless transfer payments are curtailed the nation faces a future of ``unsustainably high levels of federal borrowing,'' with the national debt ascending relentlessly from 60 per cent of national output today, to 150 per cent by 2025.</blockquote>
<P>
Thank you, Bill Clinton.

<FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><font size=+1>ILL</font> Clinton's 1993 tax package included the biggest hike in income-tax rates since Herbert Hoover's misguided tax increase in 1930. Supporters of the tax hike argued that the higher taxes on the rich would bring in much-needed revenues to reduce the budget deficit, and would also help close the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor.
<P>
Yet the most remarkable feature of the Clinton tax hike has been its failure to generate additional revenues. Even liberals, after all, presumably do not favor higher tax rates just for the sake of punishing success. Do they? Yet consider the following: Taxes consumed 19.2 per cent of economic output (GDP) the year Reagan left office. Since that time, there have been two major tax increases, the Bush tax hike of 1990 and Clinton's record increase of 1993. The impact on tax collections? The Congressional Budget Office estimates revenues this year will total 19.1 per cent of GDP, down by one-tenth of a point.
<P>
The futility of higher tax rates can be seen by examining income-tax revenues as a percent of GDP. Higher income-tax rates were to be the major revenue raisers in both the Bush and the Clinton tax hikes, yet income-tax revenues have fallen from 8.6 per cent of GDP when Reagan left office to 8.5 per cent this year, according to the CBO. These numbers are particularly compelling since income-tax revenues typically rise over time as a percentage of GDP in countries with ``progressive'' tax systems, as even modest increases in income gradually push people into higher tax brackets. The Clinton Administration no doubt would point out that revenues fell under Bush and have risen in the last four years, but this pick-up in revenues is mainly a function of the business cycle and does not change the underlying fact that government is collecting less as a percentage of output even though (or rather, because) the top income-tax rate is 50 per cent higher today than it was at the end of the Reagan era.
<P>
The failure of income-tax-rate increases can also be confirmed by examining the growth of income-tax revenue in constant dollars. During the Reagan years, when tax rates were reduced twice, inflation-adjusted income-tax revenues rose an average of 2.2 per cent each year. In the post -  Reagan era, which has seen two massive tax-rate increases, revenue growth has slowed to 1.3 per cent annually. Once again, the White House would argue that this comparison does not distinguish between Bush and Clinton, but, since the two Presidents had virtually identical policies of raising tax rates on the rich, such a distinction would be meaningless.
<P>
Income-tax revenues also grew substantially faster in the 1960s after President Kennedy's 30 per cent across-the-board tax cuts than in the 1950s with tax rates as high as 90 per cent. In the 1950s real income-tax receipts were flat. Following the Kennedy tax cuts, the revenues increased at a 4.8 per cent clip. After LBJ's surtax, revenue growth again fell by more than half. There seems to be a pattern emerging here.
<P>
So if the Bush and Clinton tax increases failed to raise revenues, why has government borrowing declined by more than $100 billion since Clinton took office? Two reasons. First, large real cutbacks in the defense budget of nearly 6 per cent annually; and second, a slow down in the growth of inflation-adjusted domestic spending from the enormous 6.3 per cent annual average under George Bush to 2.5 per cent under Clinton. Yes, it's a sad but true fiscal fact that federal spending has been far more restrained during the Clinton Administration than it was during the Bush Administration. But both Presidents' attempts to gain revenues by raising tax rates have been utterly futile.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HERE</font>  was the nation's First Stepmother when, according to the best liberal opinion, the future of America's children was being destroyed by the passage of welfare reform? The welfare-rights coalition and Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman were frantically lobbying the White House for a presidential veto. In their effort to influence the President, NOW members even launched a hunger strike (and they might just have caught his eye if they had slimmed down). But while this pitched battle was going on, Hillary Clinton -- missing in action. 
<P>
Yet the First Lady, whose public life has been ostentatiously dedicated to the well-being of children, has curiously escaped being held to account by her liberal allies. She may have persuaded them that she was pleading their case behind closed doors, but it's more likely that Edelman and Co. recognize what one liberal advocate in Arkansas reluctantly concluded long ago: ``We learned not to expect anything of Hillary. What was the one thing she would go to the wall for? Bill's Presidency.'' 
<P>
Yet with the Administration deeply divided over whether or not to sign the welfare bill, there's little doubt that Hillary's influence would have been decisive. Richard Reeves enjoyed lunch at the White House with the Clintons recently and reported that the President glanced guiltily at Hillary to seek permission before ordering a piece of blueberry pie. If Hillary controls Bill's pastry consumption, she certainly could have prevented him from swallowing the distasteful gruel of welfare reform. But although Hillary has been committed to spending other people's money on behalf of liberal causes, she has been unwilling to spend Bill's political capital to advance the agenda. In the Clinton household, politics counts for more than principles and even friendship (just ask Lani Guinier).
<P>
Confronted with the First Lady's unprecedented unpopularity -- the latest polls show her favorability rating below sea level (30 per cent) -- one defender argues that Hillary makes us uncomfortable because she is so good. Ruth Rosen, professor of history at the University of California at Davis, explains that Hillary is ``the perfect scapegoat because she has a moral compass and is not afraid to follow it.''
<P>
In fact, Hillary's compass always pointed straight to the White House. Betsy Wright, Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor, speculates that the Clintons thought that Bill could win the Presidency from the time they married. Bill had the vision, Hillary provided the focus and discipline. When his mother had trouble accepting a daughter-in-law whom she regarded as a prickly, unattractive feminist, he reportedly explained: ``Look, Ma, I have work to do. I don't need to be married to a sex goddess.'' 
<P>
A politically successful partnership with a division of responsibility was formed from Clinton's early days as governor. Bill bobbed about in the centrist waters of Arkansas and joined the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in the mid Eighties. It fell to Hillary, with her collegiate history of liberal activism, to nail down the Democratic base. Hillary accordingly served on the national boards of the Legal Services Corporation, the Children's Defense Fund, and the leftist New World Foundation.
<P>
But her espousal of liberal causes was strictly for export. Back home she had shed her maiden name, thick glasses, 15 pounds, and opposition to capital punishment. In particular, her advocacy on behalf of neglected children was a wholesale, out-of-state operation. While she toiled on the national scene urging Congress to live up to its moral responsibilities, the child-welfare system in Arkansas became a national disgrace. Its comparative infant mortality rate increased during her husband's 12-year tenure. But national reputations are not made by small local improvements.
<P>
Following Bill Clinton's jarring defeat for re-election in 1980, Hillary was better able to protect her investment in him than in Whitewater. Having already reformed her feminist appearance, she went to work on her irritating tendency to aloofness and superiority. An aide to Governor Clinton explained, ``This is a very personal state. Now, for Clinton that empathy is natural. But Hillary learned how to project it.''
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size==1>UT</font> not convincingly. Her sense of superiority is still apparent. People aren't having trouble -- as Ann Lewis endlessly insists they are -- reconciling themselves to a new kind of First Lady who is independent, accomplished, and outspoken. The dislike of the First Lady has nothing to do with people's inability to adjust to ``the changing nature of women's roles'' or with any discomfort we mortals might feel when confronted by the noble and virtuous. People dislike the First Lady because they reasonably resent someone who believes herself to be morally superior to them even as she pursues power and status like the most cynical of politicians.
<P>
In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be influential and prominent without the scrutiny and accountability that politicians must endure. She wants to be viewed as having a successful, independent career while having traded on her influence and access as the governor's wife. Her formidable skills of advocacy are used to attack Bill's opponents, who can't fight back against his wife as they would against the President himself. Above all, she wants the rewards associated with success in the private sector while pursuing political advancement in the foundation world and public sector.
<P>
Hillary insists that pro-bono legal work is ``the heart and soul of the law,'' but her own work in the cause of legal aid or children's rights was either compensated or politically useful. The righteous Wellesley graduate who told her fellow students that the ``acquisitive, and competitive corporate life . . . is not the way of life for us'' earned $129,000 in directors' fees from Arkansas corporations. 
<P>
She notes in addition the burden she has carried to support the family. When questioned about apparent influence peddling, conflicts of interest, or cattle futures, she impatiently cites the enormous financial sacrifices the Clintons have made to permit Bill's public service. But while the Clintons were making these sacrifices for the common good in Arkansas, the state's taxpayers footed the bill for food, shelter, servants, and entertainment; the Arkansas state auditor estimated their upkeep cost at $750,000 annually.
<P>
Hillary bitterly resents being questioned about such matters. She has always hated the media and now believes the press is becoming ``the handmaiden of the Right,'' no less. But the press rises above it, and women journalists in particular would rather burnish the feminist icon than examine its calves of clay. We're told about the unswerving ``sense of mission'' that has kept Hillary too busy to respond cogently to accusations of improprieties. It's Hillary's ``do-good energy'' that makes her ``fierce and protective.'' 
<P>
These warm maternal qualities are not always evident to those who know her well. An admiring friend whose divorce Hillary handled confessed that she was fearful of her own attorney. ``I would never cross her,'' she declares. Hillary encouraged the media to investigate some alleged infidelities of George Bush during the 1992 campaign -- that ``sense of mission,'' no doubt. And her temper in general has been well documented. When she advised in her recent book that, in order to stay married, sometimes ``you have to bite your tongue,'' one can't help wondering if that's in order to improve her aim.
<P>
Fortunately, Hillary's brusque self-confidence trumped her pragmatism when it came to reforming the health-care system. This was one reform that wasn't about Bill; it was her baby, to be loved, cherished, and delivered on time. She was fighting not for ClintonCare but for Rodham Rx. Convinced that her efforts had produced a near-perfect product, she would brook no criticism and make no compromise. If Hillary Clinton had a dash of modesty, our health care would probably have been socialized. But she allowed the worst to be the enemy of the bad.
<P>
Despite her withdrawal into purdah, Hillary remains the motive force behind ideological liberalism in the White House and the Administration generally. She had a hand in the major liberal appointments, like that of Donna Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services. She has salted the agencies with her followers. And she is a presence who inspires awe and even fear in senior aides.
<P>
Her legal writings, her Arkansas practice, and her record in the world of legal activism all show her to be a devout believer in the power of government to transform human lives for the better. Her sense of mission, which this belief inspires, allows her to bend the rules -- whether in Whitewater or in organizing the White House Health Care Task Force -- with a clear conscience. She is one of nature's Commissars. Among New Democrats, that makes her a Lenin in a den of Daniels. But it is her ill fortune to come within a heartbeat of power in a conservative age of diminished expectations for centralized power and what government can achieve.
<P>
At first she resisted this truth and tried to push through a total restructuring of health care by the sheer power of presidential authority and her own self-confidence. But she was defeated. And just as after the 1980 Arkansas gubernatorial election, she learned from her defeat. Her prudent silence in the face of welfare reform is one evidence of a lesson learned. Another, as Ramesh Ponnuru  points out, is her return to reforming health care by a Fabian policy of gradualism. If Hillary has her way, health care will be socialized little by little, and we won't notice until the trap is sprung.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> June 22, 1994, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, to no fanfare whatsoever, issued Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 (IB 94-1). The bulletin applied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a 1974 law designed to protect pension funds from reckless managers. Section 404 of the law makes creating benefits for pension beneficiaries the ``exclusive purpose'' of pension investing. This is the part of ERISA that Reich's bulletin re-interpreted, saying pension-fund managers could consider both the interests of beneficiaries and secondary benefits to other parties when investing pension funds. A hard-to-follow exercise in bureaucratic minutiae? Well, yes. Insignificant? No. Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 was an opening shot in a Clinton Administration policy offensive potentially as radical in scope as its health-care plan, an attempt to tap into a portion of the nation's $3.5 trillion in private pension-money funds to advance its social agenda.
<P>
The re-interpretation of ERISA, and the supporting efforts surrounding it, exemplify the way the Clinton Administration has tweaked regulations and interpretations of law to make policy advances; the way its mid-level personnel has agitated for an agenda at odds with the Administration's public, centrist pose; and the cozy relationship between the Clinton Executive Branch and the activist Left. The Executive Branch and the larger federal bureaucracy by themselves -- without grandiose legislative proposals or high-profile public advocacy -- provide endless opportunities for prosecuting an ideological agenda and protecting the cold political interests of a President. This most political Administration has taken every opportunity afforded it, prospering in Washington's legal and bureaucratic thickets.
<P>
The Clinton Administration re-interpreted ERISA so as to clear the way for so-called Economically Targeted Investments (ETIs). A long-time favorite of the Left, the thrust of ETIs is to steer private pension funds to public purposes (investments in public housing, infrastructure projects, jobs programs, etc.). For the Left, ETIs are a handy way to control middle-class dollars -- diverting retirement funds from more profitable uses -- without an actual tax increase. Clinton, who promoted ETIs in Arkansas, included in his 1992 policy manifesto ``Putting People First'' a proposal for $80 billion of federal investment in social projects to be leveraged with public and private pensions. Once he took office, his Administration began to push the ETI agenda, beneath headlines and the notice of much of the public.
<P>
Assistant Labor Secretary Olena Berg banged the drums across the country for ETIs. A former board member of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which had already gone in big for social investments, she boasted that ``This is the beginning of a turning point.'' In February of 1994 she urged big investors, according to <I>Business Week</I>, ``to invest the dollars now held by pension funds in ways that create more jobs.'' HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, meanwhile, was setting up what he called a ``precedent-setting initiative to attract pension-fund investments to housing for low-income people''; six pension funds agreed to invest in affordable housing projects with $100 million in federal backing. After the Administration issued IB94-1 in June of 1994, it also set up a federal ``clearinghouse'' to showcase successful social investments. 
<P>
The pedigree of ETIs -- Miss Berg herself calls them ``a radical notion'' -- has been documented by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which has worked aggressively to expose the Clinton offensive on pensions. A moving force behind the idea is the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA), a socialistic spin-off of the radical Institute for Policy Studies. CPA has flacked tirelessly for ETIs at least since 1990. In the Clinton Administration, it finally had a sympathetic ear. A CPA conference on the idea in 1995 drew some half-dozen Administration participants. CPA's ``public capital program'' manager tells of working closely with Administration officials on ETIs. Indeed, the idea of a clearinghouse had been proposed by CPA, and the Administration initially even selected the organization as the contractor for the project.
<P>
All this has effectively been shut down by Rep. Jim Saxton (R., N.J.), vice chairman of the JEC, who sponsored a bill that passed by a wide margin, repealing Reich's IB 94-1 and abolishing the clearinghouse. The pension issue is a natural for the GOP, and Democrats sense it. But the feckless Sen. Nancy Kassebaum has sat on a companion bill in the Senate. Which is par for the course: the Administration pushing to the limits on behalf of its agenda, while Republicans pull up short on the counterattack. ``They're chillingly pragmatic about all this, realizing that they can't advance the liberal parts of their agenda publicly so they find imaginative ways to try to do it anyway,'' says one House aide. There have been a number of underground ways the Administration has continued a liberal march without much attention, manipulating the bureaucracy and advancing its agenda by stealth. If declaring the end of ``the era of big government'' is the Clinton Administration by day, this is it by night.
<P>
Take RU-486. Abortion is one of the issues on which Clinton can't leave the Left -- despite the ``rare'' rhetoric -- so he was eager to deliver on the ``abortion pill.'' In January of 1993 Clinton wrote HHS Secretary Donna Shalala -- FDA Commissioner David Kessler's boss -- a memo asking HHS to promote the ``testing, licensing, and manufacturing'' of the drug. Kessler had pre-emptively reacted to the pressure five weeks after the 1992 elections, unilaterally reversing Bush Administration policy. He wrote to RU-486's manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, prodding it to apply for approval in the U.S. (``further clinical trials may not be required,'' he added helpfully). Everybody all around got the hints -- Kessler doing Clinton's bidding to save his job, Roussel Uclaf doing Kessler's bidding to avoid future run-ins. RU-486 is slated for FDA approval as early as September, and the Clinton Administration will have provided America with the drug as surely as if it had sponsored legislation to do so. 
<P>
<font size=+3>F</font><font size=+1>EDERAL</font> departments, meanwhile, have become touchstones for the organized Left and agents for advancing a PC agenda otherwise seen only on college campuses. The EPA, for instance, is a breeding ground for self-perpetuating activism. Since 1993, according to a GAO report, grants awarded for workshops, conferences, and non-scientific studies -- mostly the province of environmental advocacy groups -- have nearly doubled, from roughly $130 million to about $250 million. The American Association of Retired Persons has received some $40 million in 23 different grants since 1993; the Environmental Defense Fund has grabbed $1.8 million. Meanwhile, despite an amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) stipulating that it wouldn't apply to domestic partners, the EPA includes domestic partners in its own leave plan. EPA chief Carol Browner proudly cited the policy in an e-mail celebrating June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month -- ``In Headquarters, and in some Regional Offices, activities are being organized by the Chapters of the Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees (GLOBE) of EPA. Please join them . . .''
<P>
More broadly, the Administration has made full use of the propaganda power of the executive branch (see Christina Hoff Sommers, next page). The Civil Service subcommittee of the House Reform and Oversight Committee under Rep. John Mica (R., Fla.) has documented an Administration effort to ``roll out'' a weekly message through the public-affairs offices of federal departments, including those in field offices nationwide. (Veterans Affairs, Labor, and the EPA seem to be heavily involved.) ``It's putting hundreds of government employees at work flacking for you all over the country,'' says a House aide. House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Clinger (R., Penn.) conducted a May hearing on the Administration's wide-ranging politicization of the federal bureaucracy: 
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- VA Secretary Jesse Brown included a long ``message'' on employees' check stubs. ``As I have been telling the nation's veterans organizations this summer,'' Brown wrote, ``the Administration's [budget] plan is much better for veterans and their families.''
<P>
 -- In February 1995 an internal EPA e-mail discussed how ``Enviros are looking for some help in the conference committee on unfunded mandates,'' and suggested what the agency could do to support their lobbying. 
<P>
 -- A state director of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management wrote a letter last year advising public-land constituents of the department's opposition to a GOP grazing bill and inviting them ``to come together to work for the health of the public lands and the long-term economic stability of the West.'' Cabinet Secretaries can certainly take positions on public issues, but their departments aren't supposed to be arms of a permanent political campaign.</blockquote> 
<P>
Unions have been an integral part of this campaign too. Federal public-employee unions were kept apprised of crucial early strategy meetings organized by the Treasury Department to prepare for the looming budget crisis in 1995 (the meetings, again, were uncovered by Saxton's Joint Economic Committee). Ordinarily, public-employee unions would be concerned about a government shutdown and Treasury's planned raid on their pension trust funds during it. Instead, the unions eagerly participated in the Administration's shut-down strategy. ``We will be '<B>ON THEIR CASE AND IN THEIR FACE</B>,''' the American Federation of Government Employees president wrote of GOP freshmen in an August 1995 letter to members, well in advance of any shutdown. ``The question is not whether we work, but in what kind of America we will work.'' The Administration has paid back the unions for their loyalty. The Office of Personnel Management provided names and home addresses of its employees -- a clear breach of their privacy -- to the unions representing them. Mica's subcommittee discovered an OMB letter confirming that other federal agencies would be doing the same. 
<P>
There is a certain virtuosity to all this. The Democrats simply are more comfortable with power than the Republicans. That's why the Clinton Administration can -- after some initial stumbles -- push and pull all the political levers like an expert lathe operator. Two other factors are at work as well. One is necessity. The political imperative in the current environment is to move, as Ralph Reed once famously said of the Christian Coalition, ``quietly, with stealth, under cover of night.'' The other is lack of scruple. The Administration reflects the Clintons' ruthlessness in pursuit of power. The theme of former Republican officials brought to Capitol Hill to testify on Clinton Administration practices is always: We never would have done that, we couldn't have gotten away with it. Well, for whatever reason, the Clinton Administration can. For Republicans, the reward for their virtue is in heaven. The reward for the Clintonites' shamelessness may well be in a second term.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OUNDED</font> in 1989, Ervin and Associates, a contracting firm based in Bethesda, Md., and specializing in affordable housing, more than tripled in size in its first five years. In July, 1994 its work was commended by Assistant Secretary for Housing Nicholas Retsinas in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Employment, Housing, and Aviation. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the company raised over $165,000 to help the families of HUD employees who lost their lives. On John Ervin's office wall hangs a framed picture of his staff with HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros to mark the occasion, and a letter from the Secretary notes, ``The HUD family will always be grateful for your kindness.''
<P>
Well, maybe not ``always.'' Ervin has filed a suit against the department claiming its rampant politicization is running him out of business. Specifically, Ervin charges that the head of HUD's housing division, Helen Dunlap, has steered lucrative federal contract awards -- known by industry types as ``honey pots'' -- to her ``contractors of choice,'' in keeping with her animus against white males. Since Miss Dunlap's political appointment in 1994, Mr. Ervin's federal contacts have been cut almost in half, and the firm has had to downsize its full-time staff from 47 to 23. Moreover, Ervin claims, HUD's employment practice reflects an institutional bias. HUD counters that Ervin is a ``disgruntled contractor'' and that safeguards prevent contract patronage. His suit is pending in D.C.'s district court, but briefs filed by Ervin and documents he has obtained from HUD highlight disturbing practices -- blatant hiring quotas, outright hostility to white males, and possibly favoritism in contracts -- that go unnoticed in the thicket of the federal bureaucracy. 
<P>
Mr. Ervin asserts he has been recommended for many contracts by so-called source evaluation boards -- panels of career civil servants that are meant to combat patronage -- only to see Helen Dunlap ``orchestrate'' efforts to ``bypass the normal procurement processes which are intended to prevent the very abuses'' Ervin is being subjected to. In one case, Ervin alleges Miss Dunlap awarded a $30-million asset-management contract to the purportedly ``disadvantaged'' firm Williams and Adley, breaching a prior contract which Ervin says HUD previously informed him was legally his. Following objections raised by Ervin and career housing-division employees, according to <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I>, the HUD inspector general launched an investigation into contract malfeasance by the housing division. Miss Dunlap was demoted from her political appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Operations.
<P>
Despite this, Helen Dunlap reportedly waged a power struggle with her replacement (a white male), holding duplicate staff meetings immediately after his and asserting that she was still in charge and didn't intend to surrender. And she apparently won; she inexplicably regained her jurisdiction over contract awards and, Mr. Ervin claims, vindictively blackballs his firm from obtaining such awards. ``They throw the fox out of the hen house and then let it back in,'' says Ervin.
<P>
This attitude carries over into the way Miss Dunlap manages her division. <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I> quotes one high-level HUD source who says Dunlap ``made many enemies after joining the department.'' According to anonymous moles in HUD, she refers to the men in her front office as ``TOMs,'' or ``Tired Old Males,'' and has said that ``the only fitting position for a male is a secretary.'' It is not without reason that some of these career employees have been known to call their office a ``white boys' hell.''
<P>
But discrimination is not confined to Helen Dunlap and HUD contracts. Department managers are ranked on how well they achieve cultural diversity within their divisions. They are given evaluations with ratings of Outstanding, Fully Successful, and Unacceptable; an ``outstanding'' manager ``takes actions and makes decisions regarding hiring, promotions, training, upward mobility, recommendations for selection, and other personnel or administrative matters that further the Department's . . . Affirmative Employment Program policies and foster diversity within the HUD workplace.'' In short, color over merit.
<P>
Internal hiring data obtained by John Ervin under the Freedom of Information Act indicate what close attention is paid to ``diversity.'' A chart produced by HUD breaks down each department division by race and gender, noting changes over a six-month cycle. From September 1995 to March 1996, for example, Miss Dunlap's Office of Housing severely cut white men from the better professional and administrative positions (professionals down 10 per cent compared to 1 per cent department-wide).
<P>
In a previous analysis by HUD for 1996, the department reported a ``manifest imbalance'' (representation ``substantially below'' the civilian labor force) within its housing division in professional Hispanic females, and administrative and technical white females. An accompanying chart entitled ``Internal Movement Numerical Objectives'' called for 90 ``planned'' division hirings -- 20 white females, 20 black females, 20 black males, 10 Hispanic males, 10 Hispanic females, 5 Asian males, and 5 Asian females. Figures for white males were nil.
<P>
What is most striking, however, is not that HUD uses quotas in its hiring and promotions, but that the basis for these quotas in divisions across the country appears to be the Civilian Labor Force statistics for Washington, D.C. That is, a district field office in, say, Kansas City must strive to reflect the demographic composition of D.C. workers (the city's population is over 70 per cent minority). Kansas City's HUD field office has a total of five employees at the professional level: three white males, two black males. In a HUD document titled ``Assessment of Underrepresentation,'' the department categorizes all employees by race and gender and suggests in a ``number needed'' column that Kansas City should hire two white women, two black women, and a male and female each of Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian derivation.
<P>
Interestingly, in every assessment of white-male underrepresentation spanning HUD's 10 regions and 79 field offices, there is no ``number needed'' advisement for more white males.
<P>
While Nelson Diaz, head of HUD's office of General Counsel, mandates an obligatory three-and-a-half hour ``sensitivity training'' seminar for his employees, he apparently could use a little of this himself. According to attendees at a September 22, 1993, meeting of field counsel, Mr. Diaz declared that there are ``too many white faces at HUD.'' Subsequently, attempts were made to remove John Dellera (who is white) as Assistant General Counsel for New York/New Jersey. ``I doubted that the reassignment was bona fide and suspected it was an unlawful attempt to coerce my resignation so that Nelson could appoint some political friend to the job,'' Dellera wrote friends. Diaz replaced Dellera with a female Hispanic -- the office was deficient in the Hispanic female professional category, according to HUD reports. 
<P>
If the department isn't violating the letter of the law after the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision -- which held that race preferences will receive ``the strictest judicial scrutiny'' and will ``seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment'' -- it certainly violates the spirit. Not that it seems to matter. A May 16, 1996 HUD report dismisses the decision: ``<I>Adarand</I> did not provide clear judicial precedent on the constitutionality of specific affirmative action/ set-aside programs.'' Until the Supreme Court more clearly defines its guidelines, John Ervin just hopes to stay in the black -- despite being a white male trying to do business with Helen Dunlap's HUD.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N THE</font> novel <I>Primary Colors</I>, a senior Democratic senator is having an interview with the Bill Clinton figure, called Jack Stanton. It is well along in 1992, after the revelations about Gennifer Flowers and the record of evading the draft. The senior statesman does not know quite what to make of this precocious candidate, who carries about him the pronounced scent of things disreputable. Stanton is good with ``the folks'' -- he thrives on the engagement with ordinary people in a campaign. And he makes a ``nice speech.'' But then the senator turns and says, ``I have never seen a politician carry so much trouble around with him. You're like that cartoon character . . . Pigpen. A permanent cloud of dirt follows him around.''
<P>
Or as the Greeks would have it, character is destiny. Bill Clinton's permanent cloud was no accident; it sprang from something in his character. And when that something was conveyed into the work of a new Administration, it produced the surprises that should have been, by then, no surprise: an Administration that took, as the defining measures of its first moments, positions its leaders had never acknowledged in public or sought to justify in the course of the campaign. A candidate who had offered himself as a New Democrat, more sensitive on social issues, took as his first dramatic initiative an advanced position on gay rights, including gays in the military. A candidate who had lamented abortions, with a vow to make them ``rare'' as well as legal, moved on his first day in office -- in fact, moved even before he was sworn in -- to sign executive orders that would sweep away every inhibition on abortion in the federal service. The subsequent stories of Whitewater and Travelgate, of billing records curiously lost and rediscovered, of thuggish aides commandeering files from the FBI -- all of it plays out the script of characters straining their meager wit at the project of concealment rather than the task of governing. Indeed, it might be said that the project of concealment was what knitted this team together as its binding purpose. The first thing that must be understood then about Bill Clinton and the bully pulpit is that his Administration was constituted on premises that could not be expressed in public; and the principal genius of his staff was expended in covering up the incidents in his past that would imperil his moral claim to govern.
<P>
In June of 1993, I was at dinner with a seasoned Republican congressman, a man much liked on both sides of the aisle, and he remarked that, after the first, rocky months of Clinton's Presidency, his constituents had seen through him. Or they saw him clearly as he was. And what, I asked, did they see? ``That he is a man who will lie to them,'' he said, ``as readily as he will look at them.'' Three years later, when a jury in Little Rock handed down the first convictions of people close to the Clintons, a young reporter could remark on television that this event, though jolting, would have no measurable effect on the public standing of the President. For the public, he said, had long ago ``discounted'' Mr. Clinton's veracity. That is to say, a large portion of the public has absorbed now, with a serene acceptance, that Bill Clinton is an affable, incorrigible liar, but they have concluded that nothing in his vices threatens any public harm. In one recent survey, about 54 per cent of the public did not think that Bill Clinton could be considered ``honest and trustworthy.'' But the same surveys also reported that about 62 per cent think he has honesty and integrity enough to serve as President. There has evidently been a scaling down. The public has apparently absorbed those premises that were the hallmarks of ``modernity'': that there may be a separation between politics and morality, between private character and public office, and that a man overflowing with vices may nevertheless have considerable virtues as a public man.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T</font> became the standard refrain for a while among the Democrats that Clinton's personal life had nothing to do with his competence to deal with his public functions. But that argument quietly evaporated when Paula Jones filed her suit over sexual harassment. For since the outcry over Anita Hill in 1991, it had become a staple of the Left that sexual harassment deserved to be treated seriously, as a wrong claiming a high place in the public concern. With that sentiment kindling, there was a willingness to call forth the indignation of the public when the accusations broke over Sen. Bob Packwood. But when Paula Jones filed her own complaint, the Democrats were compelled to fall mute. They could no longer rail against Packwood and insist on the high significance of his offenses without sharpening the accusation against their own sitting President. It remained for Packwood to be removed from office by an Ethics Committee dominated by his own party. But the experience was quite enough to establish that Clinton's ``private'' conduct had a deeper public resonance after all. The need to defend Clinton induced his party to recede from an issue that it regarded as central, not peripheral, to the public business. His private troubles did indeed disarm or impair his party in addressing what it thought to be public matters of moral consequence.
<P>
Yet, as Madison said, if men were angels there would be no need for government. And a public steeped in Christianity has made its allowances for the sinful. (An echo sounds from a lyric of Stephen Sondheim: ``And as for being saintly, even faintly . . . no. But who needs Albert Schweitzer when the lights are low?/And oh, oh, oh, can that boy f -- oxtrot.'') At times it may indeed be true that the people needed urgently in a public mission are not virtuous in all things. That Churchill and Grant were heavy drinkers did not diminish the public need for them when their personal gifts marked them out for a mission that they, distinctly, could perform. If an inspired political man was able to summon the support of the public for a policy of putting abortion ``in the course of extinction,'' the pro-lifers would not be likely to desert him, if it turned out that his private life showed embarrassing lapses. And on the other side, we should not be shocked that the people who are determined to preserve unconstrained rights of abortion in America are quite as determined to cling to Bill Clinton even though his personal life could sustain, by itself, the tabloids at the supermarket.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>LL</font> of that we understand. And all of that we could readily grant: If we could accept Clinton's public purposes, we too might be able to share an urbane laugh over his character. But in his case there is a precise connection between his character and the political culture he represents: his personal libertinism reflects the core of what can be taken these days as liberal jurisprudence -- the notion of the ``autonomous self,'' unencumbered by moral restraints, which seeks, as its first freedom, sexual freedom, and as its primary legal support, the right to an abortion. In the ``culture war,'' the moral tradition is set against the ethic of that class that now controls the media, the universities, and the courts; and for all his faults, Bill Clinton is the exquisite reflection of that ethic and that class. In what other Administration could we find a highly placed officer, the deputy general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services, advancing the proposal for gay marriage, because it would ``expose and denaturalize the historical construction of gender at the heart of marriage''? A biped who makes these sounds can find its habitat only in a Democratic Administration. The Left on the campuses may wince when Clinton glides with the public wind and rejects gay marriage. But they are tolerant of his political weaving because they understand that he could never have been elected as a man of the modern American Left.
<P>
That difference, between the character of Clinton's policies and the character of his public rhetoric, is the measure of his considerable skill as a political man. He presides over an Administration of the post-McGovern Democrats, yet all that is happily overlooked by Middle America as he plays, with a flourish, on the chords of conventional morality. But how does he do it? How is he believable even for a moment when he strikes moral poses and presumes to engage in moral teaching?
<P>
``It should not fly, but behold! It does fly.'' He should have not the slightest standing to teach anything of moral consequence in public; and yet: he stands and he teaches. Indeed, the logic of his situation is that he cannot do otherwise without appearing defensive and giving the game away. One observer pointed out that Clinton was raised in a gambling town, where he learned early on the art of bluffing, or presenting the ``poker face.'' With his record, he is the last person to be preaching to young people about the virtues of chastity, and yet he preaches. As a man who evaded his obligations to serve in the military, it is clear that he cannot summon the least moral authority to send anyone else into combat. But of course, as Commander-in-Chief, he must be able to do just that. And his strength as a public man seems to reside precisely in his cheekiness, his unflagging willingness to brazen it out.
<P>
It is remarked, of course, that Franklin Roosevelt presided over a global war even though he himself had never served in the military. And among present-day Republicans, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm did not serve, though they were of age during the war in Vietnam. Still, there is something different about a man who used every stratagem to avoid his obligation. There is a moral point here that deserves to be respected even by people who feel an affinity with Clinton over Vietnam: There is a kind of covenant society must have with the men who honored the claims of their own government, and accepted their obligation to serve in the military. They accepted those duties at a certain hazard to themselves, and many of them died. In the aftermath, we may have good reason to wish we had sent none of them into a war that did not command the conviction of the leaders who were directing it. But part of the covenant with the men who served -- to use language closer to the ground -- is that we don't make jerks of them. And that we emphatically do when we show a willingness to honor a man who prospered because he was not foolish enough to risk himself as they did. A public that elects Clinton is engaging in a gesture of contempt for the men who served, and veterans who voted for him are engaging in a gesture of self-contempt.
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size=+1>UT</font> gamely putting all of that aside, what was Clinton to teach as he took hold of the bully pulpit? What was left? Could we imagine the scene as it must have been at Yale, over twenty years ago, as Bill Clinton, Robert Reich, and their friends would stay up in bull sessions, flexing their powers of conjecture, pondering the ways in which they might lead the country into bold paths of reform once the levers of power were put in their hands, as surely they would be? Could we imagine the moment of insight? ``We are going to come out against children smoking!'' Or: ``We are going to come out against dead-beat dads!'' Or: ``We are going to come out, forthrightly, unequivocally, against violence, and especially against the freedom to shoot people with assault weapons!''
<P>
That could hardly have been the vision that marked their dreams. But it may be the only recipe that is available to the generation that resolved long ago that there were no transcendent moral truths, particularly any truths grounded in ``nature.'' This group can rise to moral teaching mainly by sounding the themes of public pieties, with proposals so wanting in controversy that they would mesh even with the social policies of Joseph Goebbels and his party. They too had an ambitious scheme of allowances for children, and they were headed by a man who was an exemplary figure to the young in his shunning of tobacco. Still, even in this domain, the authority of Mr. Clinton must be equivocal. When he enjoins upon teenagers a life of chastity and abstinence, it clearly cannot be because he would respect that life in principle. In fact, it is hard to see why Mr. Clinton would not approach the problem of teenage smoking in the way that his Administration approaches teenage sexuality: After all, some youngsters will be determined to smoke anyway, as some youngsters will be determined to have sexual relations, and so we might as well provide them with cigarettes containing filter tips.
<P>
But of course even the health of children reaches its limit as a moral concern when it runs up against the interests of Mr. Clinton's core constituency. The President's solicitousness for children may be nearly maternal, but it evaporates dramatically when it comes to those children, with legs dangling out of the birth canal, who are the targets of ``partial-birth'' abortions. That children may become hooked on nicotine has become, for Mr. Clinton, a high public concern. That they may have their skulls crushed and their brains suctioned out, if it suits the interests or ``mental health'' of the women bearing them, is an injury that does not register. For in the presence of a trumping political interest, that infant simply does not register as a real being, capable of sustaining pain.
<P>
In the meantime, the editors of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> carefully unfold, over several years, the record of Whitewater, the Rose Law Firm, Webster Hubbell, Filegate. What is revealed is the pattern the editors characterize as ``Arkansas mores.'' The academic degrees may be from Yale, but the style of politics and moral fastidiousness is really Dogpatch U.S.A. But even the editors, worldly as they are, begin to show their puzzlement: The record unfolds and deepens, and yet it triggers no moral outrage in the public. That absence of reaction may itself be the news: namely, that we are dealing with a public shaped now by the changes of the Sixties and the public teaching of <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>. This may be a public coarsened now in its moral sensibility; and there may be nothing any longer in Clinton's repertoire that could stir this public to outrage.
<P>
We may well recall that old joke about the lawyer who is promised unbounded success in business and love, to be paid for in the end by the delivery of his soul. And he asks, guardedly, ``What's the catch?'' The accomplishment of Bill Clinton is that he has made the country into one large lawyer-joke. Clinton has marked off the record of an incorrigible liar, faithless to his wife, who cannot be trusted to honor any law beyond his own interest -- and the public says, ``Yes -- but what is the problem?''
<P>
And yet, it may be said on behalf of Mr. Clinton that he is one of the few men on the scene who is suited to the political pulpit, because he is possessed of the most genuine interest in engaging people, wherever he finds them, and joining the argument. On the Republican side he is matched by the likes of Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett, and Pat Buchanan. And when Mr. Clinton goes to church, one has the hunch that he goes because he knows he needs it. But his comings and goings in church also seem to offer another measure of the religious sensibility of our time. Apparently, the religious sense abroad in the land is of a God whose capacity for forgiveness is boundless, and whose demand for contrition is optional. What seems to be left out, conspicuously, is a God who would invite some serious testimony about the plan to amend one's life and confirm it in a new cast. If that understanding of God were dominant in the public mind, people might be moved to ask of Bill Clinton some rather searching questions. But it may be as some of us have begun to suspect, that Mr. Clinton is indeed a representative man of his age. He is, as he is, scaled to the current moral sensibility of the public, and to the notion of God that most people in the country think they can afford.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton promised zero tolerance for those in government who ``cut corners and cut deals.'' But less than three years later the Justice Department cut a highly questionable deal with Arthur Coia, president of the mob-ridden Laborers International Union of North America, whose 700,000 members for the most part fill low-skilled construction jobs.
<P>
Corruption in the Laborers Union is an old and open book. As far back as 1978 a Justice Department report to the White House contended that the Chicago mob dominated Angelo Posco, then president of LIUNA, and in 1986 the President's Commission on Organized Crime, pointing to the looting of union benefit funds by the mob, death threats, and murders of opposing candidates, urged the Justice Department to file civil-racketeering charges. In 1988, the FBI announced a RICO investigation of LIUNA.
<P>
On November 4, 1994, the Justice Department delivered a draft of its 212-page RICO complaint to the Laborers: the key demand, Coia must go. The complaint chronicled a massive web of corruption that had continued for decades, with capos from an assortment of crime families either running locals directly or installing their appointees. LIUNA, it said, has been ``continuously and systematically controlled, exploited, and dominated in the conduct of its affairs by the Cosa Nostra.''
<P>
The complaint was unsparing concerning Coia personally. Four consecutive presidents of the union, including Coia, were ``controlled and influenced by organized-crime figures.'' Indeed, according to the complaint, Coia had tried (unsuccessfully) to replace the previous president in 1986 because he believed ``that [Angelo] Fosco's conduct harmed LIUNA and <I>the Cosa Nostra's control of LIUNA</I>'' (italics added). From 1986 to July 1994, the complaint charged, Coia had conspired with the Todaro crime family of Buffalo to transfer training funds of upstate New York locals to Buffalo, where the money would be used for the benefit of Cosa Nostra families and associates. (They were foiled when the victim-locals protested and a court upheld them against Coia.) Some of the material was old but nonetheless telling, like the 1981 indictment of Coia's father (who, as secretary-treasurer of the union, was second in command), New England mob boss Raymond Patriarca, and Coia himself for racketeering and taking bribes from an insurance swindler: it fizzled when the judge ruled the statute of limitations had expired.
<P>
Despite the damning indictment, within three months Justice had cut a deal: Coia could stay. In fact, Coia would be Justice's subcontractor to clean up the  union -- giving the ``appearance,'' in the delicate phrasing of Bill McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, of putting the fox in charge of guarding the chicken coop. Why did Justice make such an unprecedented arrangement? The official explanation is that the government saved money that would otherwise have been wasted in lengthy litigation, and that Coia himself -- who was more knowledgeable? -- could root out the mob more efficiently. Indeed, Justice professed great pride in this pioneering method of dealing with union corruption, and Attorney General Janet Reno cited it as a model for future racket busting.
<P>
There is no doubt that Coia had wielded a canny combination of carrot and stick. He threatened an all-out fight in the courts if he personally were pushed out. Showing he meant business, he hired the firm of Williams & Connolly, which also represents President Clinton on Whitewater, to represent him in his negotiations with Justice. To represent LIUNA he hired Robert Luskin, himself a former Justice Department official. Luskin made an unusual offer on Coia's behalf: the union would hire him and a contingent of former FBI investigators to root out corruption. Moreover, Coia agreed to a consent decree acknowledging significant corruption in the union (which he had previously denied) that gave the Justice Department the option, until 1998, of putting LIUNA under trusteeship if it was not satisfied with Coia's progress.
<P>
Did Justice have other inducements to keep Coia in place? What has raised eyebrows is Coia's role as one of Clinton's most important political and financial allies. Coia has co-chaired a series of fund-raising dinners for the Democrats, each of which has raised millions of dollars. In 1994 alone, LIUNA contributed over a million dollars to Democratic candidates. It has become one of the largest donors of ``soft money'' to the Democratic Party. It even loaned $100,000 to Clinton's inaugural committee. Coia personally contributed $1,000 (the maximum permitted) to Clinton's Legal Defense Fund. He joined the board of the Back to Business Committee, where, humorously, he lent his moral authority to the committee's vigorous denials of merit in any of the ``character'' charges against the Clintons.
<P>
Money translated into social access. Soon the President and Coia were Bill and Arthur, eating breakfast together, exchanging gifts of specially made golf clubs. (The President's thank-you note for his arrived on Coia's desk the same day as the Justice Department's complaint.) Coia was invited to a small White House dinner where the President played the saxophone; a Judiciary subcommittee documented over 120 such contacts.
<P>
<font size=+3>D</font><font size=+1>ID</font> all this have any influence on the decision-making process at Justice? At hearings by Rep. McCollum's subcommittee at the end of July, Justice Department officials vigorously denied it and Democratic members of the committee indignantly insisted that there was absolutely no evidence of any White House interference.
<P>
Was there then only the <I>appearance</I> of a quid pro quo? Coia knew the Justice Department complaint was coming. There were obvious channels for a discreet phone call. The President and Coia were represented by the same law firm, and attorney - client privilege would forever protect such a channel of communications. Or Coia might have approached White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. According to Coia himself, the President had designated Ickes as his White House contact. Before taking his White House post, Ickes had represented a number of unions on mob-related charges, including the Laborers. Indeed the court-appointed trustee for a Teamsters local demanded that Ickes's firm withdraw as the local's counsel because of what it complained was its ``lack of independence'' from mob influence.
<P>
But even if there were no contacts between the White House and Justice, there did not have to be interference for there to be influence. Janet Reno's Justice Department has bent itself out of shape to be helpful to the President on Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Paulagate. The political appointees at Justice could not but be sensitive to the President's friendship with Coia. Last week, Ronald Fino, for 16 years an FBI informant within the Laborers on the Cosa Nostra, speaking behind a protective screen, warned McCollum's subcommittee that you can no longer tell a mobster by his fedora hat. ``Projecting an image of goodness, popping up and chairing charitable fund-raising functions combined with a voice for social justice, the racketeer builds a formidable defense against the Justice Department and prosecution.''
<P>
However the decision was made, and whatever the merits of the agreement between Justice and LIUNA -- and it is too soon to tell whether Coia will truly clean up the union or merely get rid of mob rivals -- several things are clear, all of them disquieting.
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Coia had a tremendous victory as he was transformed overnight from accused racketeer to racket-busting pioneer. In effect now endorsed by the Justice Department, he is a sure winner in the union elections in September and is thus guaranteed control of LIUNA until well after 1998, when Justice loses its power to intervene if dissatisfied with Coia's ``progress.'' Significantly, under terms of the agreement, LIUNA's $1-billion pension fund, the pot of gold which had been the mob's chief target, is off limits to the team of investigators Coia agreed to hire. Reform in this area, U.S. Attorney James Burns acknowledges, is ``up to the union.''
<P>
2. The President continued to lend Coia the prestige of his public friendship (including 24 White House visits) <I>after</I> he had been warned about the forthcoming Justice Department complaint. At the McCollum hearings, documents were produced showing that the FBI wrote the White House counsel's office in 1994 that Coia ``is a criminal associate of the New England Patriarca organized crime family'' and the subject of an FBI criminal probe. Another Justice Department memo that same year referred to Mrs. Clinton's staff having been warned, on the occasion of her planning to speak at a LIUNA conference, that ``we plan to portray him as a mob puppet.'' (Undeterred, in early 1995, while Coia was still fighting off the complaint, Mrs. Clinton went to Florida to address LIUNA's conference, Coia proudly accompanying her.)
<br>
Kenneth Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center, which focuses on ethical issues in government, says: ``The appearance problem is enormous here. In the case of a federal judge, a conflict of interest includes the appearance of a conflict of interest. The rationale is that the public should have confidence in its public institutions. If the President allows himself to be seen with a figure like this, it is a betrayal of public trust.''
<P>
3. Even as the Justice Department was chronicling the mob's wholesale pillaging of LIUNA's pension and training funds, departments of the Federal Government were providing the union with millions of dollars for ``training and education.'' A current study by the Heritage Foundation finds that in fiscal 1994 the EPA, HUD, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services between them gave over $11 million to LIUNA, most of it as ``training funds.'' Bizarrely, the Department of Labor, in its annual Inspector General report, cites the prosecution of Michael LaBarbara for stealing training funds from a LIUNA local, while at the same time LIUNA received $475,000 more in, yes, training grants. The taxpayer hardly anticipates that government agencies will be showering discretionary funds on people with colorful nicknames.
<P>
One of the documents released by the McCollum committee shows just how far Coia thought he could go. At Coia's behest Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler sent a memo to both Harold Ickes, who oversees the Clinton campaign from the White House, and Debra DeLee, chief executive of the 1996 Democratic convention, urging them to consider giving Coia a speaking role at that convention.</blockquote>
<P>
Sorry, folks. With all the publicity, he won't be at the podium.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FIRST</font> defense of Clinton partisans against new revelations of corruption, illegality, and general wrongdoing in the Whitewater scandal is to point out that it all occurred a long time ago, before Mr. Clinton was elected President. By implication if not overtly, Mr. Clinton's behavior as President is held to be above suspicion.
<P>
Unfortunately for the tactic, the Clintons seem to attract scandal the way Newt Gingrich attracts controversy. And this tendency didn't stop with Whitewater. Here is a brief list of Clinton scandal since Inaugural Day 1993:
<P>
<B>Filegate:</B> The President's director of personnel security, Craig Livingstone, was caught collecting <I>hundreds</I> of secret FBI files on Reagan and Bush Administration officials. President Clinton, who disclaims familiarity with the facts, nonetheless asserts that this was merely ``a bureaucratic snafu.'' FBI director Louis Freeh -- whose agency complied with the White House's extraordinary requests for these files -- calls it a ``massive'' and ``egregious'' violation of privacy rights. Prosecutors and Congress want to know, among other things, who hired Livingstone and whether he acted on his own, as White House spokesmen claim. Two FBI special agents assigned to the White House insist they were told that Hillary Clinton was Livingstone's patron. While the First Lady has a finger in most White House appointments, including the chef, chief usher, head of the correspondence unit, and Secret Service detail, she denies any association with Livingstone. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will have to sort this out. He will probably invite Mrs. Clinton to testify a second time, under oath, before the grand jury.
<P>
<B>State Department files:</B> The first time Clinton officials were found rifling through files was at the State Department; 160 personnel files of former Bush officials were collected, and disparaging information from two of the files was leaked to the <I>Washington Post</I>. The State Department's inspector general found that this conduct probably violated the Privacy Act. He referred the case to Attorney General Janet Reno for possible criminal prosecution. Miss Reno chose not to pursue the matter.
<P>
<B>Travelgate:</B> The first time Clinton officials misused the FBI was when they concocted criminal charges against the director of the White House Travel Office, Billy Dale. This was done to throw lucrative government travel business to two of the Clintons' Hollywood friends and campaign supporters. Dale, who had worked for Republican and Democratic Presidents, was forced to spend $500,000 on his defense. He was eventually prosecuted on charges of embezzlement by the Clinton Justice Department, but found not guilty after less than two hours of jury deliberation. Independent Counsel Starr is looking into whether former presidential aide David Watkins lied to government investigators to cover up Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travel Office firings. Watkins's own notes show that the First Lady ordered the firings, but Mrs. Clinton has told investigators she had no role in them. Again, she can be expected to give sworn testimony about this to the grand jury.
<P>
<b>The Clinton Cabinet:</B> The Clintons are not the only Administration officials being investigated by an independent counsel. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was forced to resign, is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes from Tyson Foods, Inc., the giant Arkansas poultry company. Of course, the Tysons have been prominent supporters of Mr. Clinton's political career. Moreover, Tyson Foods' top lawyer, James Blair, helped Mrs. Clinton turn a $1,000 cattle-futures investment into $100,000 in less than a year. (Mrs. Clinton originally claimed that her superior financial skills were learned from the pages of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; in truth, this remarkable investment has never been fully explained.)
<P>
An independent counsel is investigating whether HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI during his background investigation about the size and number of payments he made to his former mistress. And before his tragic death, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was being investigated for, among other things, possible financial irregularities.
<P>
<B>The Clinton Sub-Cabinet:</B> Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell -- Mrs. Clinton's former partner in the Rose Law Firm -- is now imprisoned at Cumberland Federal Penitentiary. He was convicted of defrauding some of his clients. Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned after he interfered with Justice Department lawyers' efforts to search the late Vince Foster's office. Former Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy resigned over tax problems and his role in the Travel Office firings. Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and former Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson resigned after it was learned that they had tipped off the President's staff that the Resolution Trust Corporation was sending criminal referrals involving the Clintons to the Justice Department.
<P>
<B>Health Care Task Force:</B> As head of the task force, Mrs. Clinton insisted that the group's meetings be closed to all but six hundred carefully selected government and industry officials who shared her goal of nationalizing America's health-care system. Mrs. Clinton and the task force were sued by three organizations claiming that the secret meetings violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A federal court agreed. Moreover, during the litigation, the presiding judge, Royce Lamberth, became concerned that certain Administration officials may have provided false and misleading information to the court. Judge Lamberth is currently considering whether to bring sanctions against any of these officials.
<P>
<B>Paula Jones:</B> Paula Jones's allegations of sexual harassment by Bill Clinton go back before his Presidency. But his legalistic contortions to evade a trial are a minor scandal in themselves. Incidentally, the Clinton lawyer who alleged that Billy Dale's willingness to have his lawyers plea-bargain was a sign of guilt might want to ponder the fact that the President's lawyers held negotiations with Paula Jones's team on the terms under which she would withdraw her suit. Mr. Clinton maintains that the Constitution immunizes him from civil suits involving allegations of personal misconduct that occurred before he became President. Of course, no such immunity exists. At one time Mr. Clinton claimed immunity as a member of the armed forces. Public outcry caused him to beat a quick retreat from that argument. Recently the Supreme Court agreed to consider the President's immunity claim, thereby delaying the case until after the election.
<P>
<B>Whitewater:</B> While Whitewater per se occurred before the Clintons came to Washington, actions that look like cover-up attempts have taken place in the White House. Last summer, for example, critical Rose Law Firm billing records, containing information about Mrs. Clinton's apparent legal work on the Castle Grande real-estate scam, were discovered outside the First Lady's personal office in the White House residence. The records, sought by lawmen since 1994, were not turned over until this January. Mrs. Clinton has steadfastly denied providing legal advice on Castle Grande. Furthermore, she denies knowing the whereabouts of the long-sought billing records prior to their discovery. Mrs. Clinton was required to give her testimony to the grand jury this January. Since then, the FBI found her fingerprints on the records.

<title>Economic Effects From Universal, Unlimited IRAs</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>The Economic Effects Of Legislation Enacting
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</center></h1>
<p>
<pre>

			Increase in GDP			Additional Jobs
	Year		(In $ Billions)		 	 (In Thousands)
        ----            ---------------			---------------

	1996			  153				  489
	2000			  418				1,182
	2010			1,090				1,936
	2020			2,158				2,377
	2030			4,246				2,897
	2040			8,352				3,532
	2060		       32,318				5,078
</pre>
The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures represent the change in nominal 
GDP relative to the baseline for that year.  For example, GDP will be 
$2.2 trillion higher in the year 2020 than it would otherwise be in the 
adsence of universal IRAs.  And, by the year 2020, there will be 2.4 
million more jobs in that year than in the absence of universal IRAs.  By 
the year 2060, the increase in GDP from universal, unlimited, 
tax-deductible IRAs will be $32 trillion in excess of GDP otherwise 
available, and 5 million more jobs will be created than otherwise 
available.<br>
<p>
The estimated economic effects illustrated in the above table assume that 
the assets held within universal IRA-type accounts without any penalty 
tax on distribution would have a maximum holding period of just five 
years, and that each contribution would be uniformly withdrawn over five 
years.  In other words, on average, each dollar contributed to the IRA 
would be withdrawn at a rate of 20% per year. (<i>The maximum assumed 
holding period of five years indicates a weighted average holding 
period of 2 1/2 years.  It is the League's view that over a period 
of time such a weighted average holding period will be low and thus 
the assumption is quite conservative.</i>)<br> 
<p>
Since the duration of the average holding period is a determinant of 
gains to be derived from universal IRAs, a sensitivity test indicates 
that if the five-year assumed holding period was increased or decreased 
by just one year, the aggregate IRA assets would be increased by 15%-20% 
within ten years.  It is estimated that adding just one year to the 
assumed holding period would ultimately reduce the effective personal 
income tax rate on savings by 60%.<br>
<p>
<h3><i>Clearly, it is in the interests of everyone, including the 
government, to encourage maximum tax-deductible IRA saving to be held for 
the longest duration possible.</i></h3><br>

<b>NOTE:</b>  The above table was taken from a study commissioned by the 
Savers &amp; 
Investors League by the respected consulting firm of Fiscal Associates, 
Inc..  In that study, they addressed the future dynamic gains to be 
derived from the enactment of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type 
legislation.  The study was completed in 1993 and all subsequent yearly 
figures were calculated assuming the enacted legislation would have 
occurred in 1993.<br>

	1996	    $    (36)	      $     27		   $      231
	2000		 (67)		    69			  916

	2060	      (4,314)	  	 6,677			6,297		
</pre>
<p>
The above estimates of the governments's static revenue estimates for 
universal IRAs show a substantial loss in federal revenue.  However, the
estimates also indicate that the dynamic economic results flowing from 
universal IRAs will create sufficient added tax revenues to more than 
offset the static losses.  For example, in the year 2000, the extra tax 
revenue from the expanded, dynamic economic growth will more than offset 
the $67 billion in forgone ordinary income taxes.  With the gap growing 
each year, by the year 2060, the net dynamic federal tax revenue gain in 
excess of static revenue loss from the ordinary income tax will be in 
excess of $2.3 trillion.<br>
<p>
Forecasting the GDP growth for the next sixty five years, it is estimated 
that the net present-value of our nation's GDP to be derived from 
universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs is almost $6.3 trillion dollars 
greater than it would be in the absence of this legislation.<br>

In the year 2000, it is estimated that the after-tax income of taxpayers, 
under its current definition, will be increased by $151 billion due to 
the added growth generated by universal IRAs.  Furthermore, most of that 
gain in after-tax income - 85% - will go to taxpayers with incomes under 
$100,000, and over 60% will go to people with $50,000 or less of adjusted 
gross income.  Additionally, the bulk of the percentage change in 
after-tax incomes will flow to those taxpayers with adjusted gross 
incomes between $10,000 and $100,000.  The percentage increase in the 
after-tax income for taxpayers within these classes ranges between 12% 
and 23%.<br>
<p>
The above table clearly portrays a dramatic improvement in everyone's 
standard of living, <i>and particularly those in middle-income 
America</i>.  These results, which will grow as the IRA assets grow, are 
directly derived from the enactment of universal IRA legislation.<br>

<p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The above table was taken from a study commissioned by the 
Savers &amp; 
Investors League by the respected consulting firm of Fiscal Associates, 
Inc..  In that study, they addressed the future dynamic gains to be 
derived from the enactment of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible 
IRA-type legislation.  The study was completed in 1993 and all subsequent 
yearly figures were calculated assuming the enacted legislation would 
have occurred in 1993.<br>

SAVERS &amp; INVESTORS LEAGUE<br>
</b></font>
<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for your
invitation to testify on the Contract With America provisions
that are designed to encourage greater saving and investing. 
We support these goals.  However, it is our strong view that the
Contract does not go far enough to properly correct the existing,
extremely serious tax bias against saving.
<P>
Others on this panel, as well as many other panels in many other
Congresses, have made proper, impassioned pleas for Congress to
restore and expand tax-deductible IRAs, as well as to reduce the
negative impact of the capital gains tax on saving and investing.
Basically, these pleas have been shunted aside by Congress for
two erroneous reasons:  (1) the allegation that they cost too
much in lost tax revenue; and (2) they're perceived by some as
tax loopholes for the rich.
<P>
In the League's judgment, both of these arguments are totally
specious.  These arguments are contrary to the government's own
fiscal interests, as well as being contrary to the taxpayer's,
and our nation's, financial well-being.  Further, removing the
income tax bias <I>against</I> saving does <I>not</I> mean that
such removal is biased <I>for</I> saving.  The resulting taxation
becomes &quot;neutral.&quot;
<P>
It is important to state at the outset that all economists agree
that the ordinary income tax is biased against saving.  The question
is-how much bias?  Is this bias harmful?  To help understand this
bias and its magnitude, Table 1 utilizes two tax brackets to better
illustrate the impact of the ordinary income tax on saving, and
how this cancerous tax eats away at the government's tax revenue.
An actual mutual fund was used for this factual illustration.<p>
<b><center>The Impact of Income Tax Bias On Tax Revenues</b></center>
<p><UL>
<LI>In Table 1, two taxpayers' $100 of income (wage) were taxed
at 15% or 50%, respectively.  The after-tax balance ($85 and $50)
was invested in the mutual fund.  Each end-of-year fund distribution
was taxed to the taxpayer as shown, with the balance reinvested.
This investment was maintained from 1926 to 1992, for a sixty-seven
year duration.  The investment and tax impact during similar durations
in the future will not reflect a significant difference from those
portrayed herein.  Thus, the past is prologue.

(# Includes the 1992 tax on realized gain when the fund
is sold  Note that the long string of government tax collections
from saving would never have occurred if the taxpayers had consumed
(spent) their $85 or $50 net-after-tax income.  It is this second
tier of year after year taxation that produces the income tax
bias against saving.</h6>
<p><UL>
<LI>Obviously, the taxes collected each year bounced around from
year to year.  This reflects the investment climate of the times,
as the U.S. went through good times and bad times, including the
worst depression and World War II.<p>
<LI>Note that as time went on, the expected larger tax revenues
each year from the high bracket taxpayer vs. the low bracket taxpayer
gradually narrowed.  This narrowing spread of tax revenues from
the higher and lower tax bracket taxpayers continued until the
30th year.  <I>From that point forward, the government increasingly
collected more tax revenue from the 15% bracket taxpayer then
from the 50% bracket taxpayer!  </I>
<P>
<LI>These tax revenue losses from the high bracket taxpayer vs.
the low bracket taxpayer continued to grow progressively from
year to year, and culminated in an even larger loss when each
taxpayer sold their fund in the 67th year, and the investment's
unrealized gain was realized and taxed.</ul><p>
<b><center>Valid Conclusions To Be Drawn From Table 1</b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The income tax bias against saving is shocking.  The longer
you save, the worse it becomes, and the government's tax base
related to saving gets smaller.<p>
<LI>There is no escape.  Selling one investment to buy another
usually triggers more tax.  Thus, the government's tax base is
reduced from that point forward, forever.  And, the ever-diminishing
tax base, over what it would be otherwise, is effectively passed
on from one taxpayer to another as savings and investments are
transferred.<p>
<LI>Don't be misled by the fact that when taxes are paid, the
related savings or investment may or may not be liquidated to
pay the tax.  The source of funds to pay the tax may come from
elsewhere.  Regardless, the capital that's otherwise available
for future taxation is reduced by the amount of the tax.<p>
<LI>By increasing tax rates on saving to escape this tax receipts
dilemma, the government wipes out its tax base faster, thereby
eventually collecting less and less tax revenue.<p>
<LI>This tax bias against saving occurs regardless of whether
the return on saving is interest, dividends, or realized capital
gain.<p>
<LI>Is it any wonder that our taxpayers and our government increasingly
feel that they're on a fiscal treadmill that's always accelerating
without forward progress?  They are!  Raising income tax rates
on saving only makes the treadmill move faster, and the problem
gradually gets worse.<p>
<LI>Taxpayers may come and go, but their year-by-year losses of
capital due to the income tax on saving can never be replaced.
Thus, the government's tax base related to saving perpetually
shrinks from what it would otherwise be if this pernicious and
needless tax bias were not present.  Is it any wonder that governments
gradually fail due to fiscal exhaustion?  Ratcheting up taxes
on saving only hastens the demise.  <I>Think about it.</I></UL>
<P>
If the facts in Table 1 don't make your hair stand on end, what
happens to taxpayers' saving under the ordinary income tax will
make your hair curl.  See below.
<p>
<b><center>The Impact of the Income Tax Bias On Saving</b></center>
<P>
Having observed how taxes gradually gnawed away at the government's
tax base over the past sixty-seven years, let's look at how each
taxpayer's investment fared under the ordinary income tax over
the same period of time.<P>

<table border><caption><b>Table 2: Taxpayers' After-Tax Mutual<br>Fund Values On 
12/31/92</b> </caption>
<th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<td>$49,052 <td>$4,598<tr>
</table><p>
In order to evaluate the impact of the income tax that created
these after-tax values, it is proper to measure the value of each
taxpayer's $100 of pre-tax income if it could have been invested
in the mutual fund <I>without any tax</I>.  This value then becomes
a proper benchmark value against which the impact of any tax methodology
may be measured.
<pre>			Table 3:Benchmark Values

	Each Taxpayer's Mutual Fund Values On 12/31/92

	From $100 Investment Without Tax = $120,649
</pre><p>
When one measures the taxpayers' after-tax values in Table 2 vs.
the Benchmark Values of Table 3, each taxpayer's values are the
following percentage of Benchmark Values (Table 2 &#247; Table
3):<p>
<table border><caption><b>Table 4: After-Tax Values As A % Of Benchmark 
Values</b></caption> <th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<th>41% <td>4%<tr>
</table><p>
In short, the 15% taxpayer lost 59% of his benchmark values due
to the ordinary income tax.  That's four times his tax bracket!
The 50% taxpayer lost 96% of his benchmark values!  Such tax
bias against saving amounts to outrageous, idiotic confiscation
worthy of tax revolt!  <I>It must be stopped immediately!  </I>The
tax grievances leading to the Boston Tea Party pale in comparison.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax is grossly biased against saving.
If these taxpayers hadn't saved, their after-tax spending would
have been 85% and 50% of their before-tax income, respectively,
not 41% and 4% of their unbiased, benchmark values.  Not only
are taxpayers grievously abused by this income tax on saving,
as shown above, the government's own tax base is needlessly and
scandalously whittled away by the ordinary income tax, as shown
in Table 1.<p>
<b><center>Tax-Deductible IRA-Type Plans</b></center>
<P>
Now, let us measure the tax treatment of tax-deductible IRA-type
plans.<p>
<table border><caption><b>Table 5: $100 Of Pre-Tax Income<br>
That Is Deducted As An IRA Contribution<br> 
And Invested In A Mutual Fund On January 1, 1926</b></caption><tr><th><th>
15% Taxpayer <br>$ and % <th>50% Taxpayer<br>$ and %<tr>

</table>
<h6>*  Equals the Benchmark Values in Table 3</h6><p>
From the above you will note that-
<UL>
<LI><I>Each</I> dollar saved and deducted by each taxpayer on
1/1/26 grew, without tax, to $1,206 by 12/31/92.<p>
<LI>Upon the IRA withdrawal, the government not only recaptured
its tax that was deferred on 1/1/26 (i.e., $15 and $50, respectively),
the government also received the full free-market investment growth
on these deferrals, i.e.-
</UL><p>
<pre>
	Table 6: Government Tax Collections On 12/31/92

15% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $15 x $1,206 = $18,097 See (a) above

50% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $50 x $1,206 = $60,324 See (a) above
</pre><p><ul>
<LI>Note that the taxpayers effectively contributed $85 and $50
out of their <I>own</I> pocket to their tax-deductible IRAs. 
The remaining part of the $100 contribution (i.e., $15 and $50)
represented the government's deferred tax.  Thus, upon withdrawal
on 12/31/92, the taxpayers received <I>their portion</I> of the
IRA contribution ($85 &amp; $50), plus the full investment growth
thereon, <I>without further tax</I>.  For example-
</UL>
<P>
<pre>
	Table 7: Taxpayers' After-Tax Values On 12/31/92

 15% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $85 x $1,206 = $102,552 See (b) above

 50% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $50 x $1,206 =   $60,324 See (b) above
</pre><p>
<UL>
<LI>It is important to recognize that tax-deductible saving is
<I>neutral</I> taxation, and it is fair to all taxpayers, regardless
of their tax bracket.  Each taxpayer defers otherwise taxable
income.  This tax deferral is subsequently taxed upon a withdrawal,
at which time it is taxed at progressive, ordinary income tax
rates.  What is avoided is the senseless, self-defeating second
layer of ordinary income tax that's imposed on the taxpayer's
investment income and realized gain.<p>
<LI>With tax-deductible IRA-type plans, all taxpayers effectively
enjoy a <I>zero</I> tax rate on <I>their own portion</I> of their
contribution to the IRA, e.g., the $85 and $50 illustrated above.
This is the same amount that would have been consumed (spent)
if it had not been saved via the tax-deductible IRA-type plan.
Thus, for this &quot;spending&quot; amount that is saved and
invested, tax-deductible IRAs produce a zero tax on realized capital
gain and a zero tax on dividend and interest income.  This is
proper, neutral taxation, and every taxpayer, regardless of tax
bracket, is treated fairly. 
</ul>
<P>
Surely, too, and properly so, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type
plans are more favorable, simpler, and more fiscally sound than
reducing the capital gains tax and indexing the asset basis for
inflation.  While reducing the capital gains tax is also very
appealing and very sound, such a partial removal of the income
tax bias against such saving is not the best course to follow.
<p>
<b><center>Measuring The Cost Of IRAs</b></center>
<P>
Government tax policy is driven by staff revenue estimates.  IRAs
are staff-labeled as &quot;tax-expenditures&quot; and staff-described
as being &quot;most similar to those direct spending programs
which have no spending limits, and which are available as entitlements
to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the programs.&quot;
They liken it to Medicare, Social Security, etc.!  <I>Nothing
could be more inaccurate than those staff descriptions!</I>  
<P>
IRA-type tax deductions are not &quot;spendings,&quot; they're
voluntary savings!  The government's tax analysis faces 180_ in
the wrong direction!  This leads to Committee decisions and government
tax policy that is also faced 180_ in the wrong direction!
<P>
As illustrated with tax-deductible IRA-type plans, the government
gets back every nickel of the tax deduction, plus growth thereon,
at free-market rates of total return!  The alleged revenue loss
the government incurs is the second layer of tax that it should
not impose in the first place, because it is progressively destructive
to the government's tax receipts and imposes confiscatory taxation
on all taxpayers who save!  <I>And &quot;saving&quot; is the life
blood of any progressive civilization. </I>
<P>
Even the government's 1995 Budget document demonstrates that its
&quot;tax expenditure&quot; revenue estimates for tax policy deliberations
are grossly misleading.  For example:
<p><pre>
	Table 8: U.S. Budget Analytical Perspectives-Fiscal Year 1995
			1994 Tax Expenditure Loss From IRAs
			-----------------------------------
	
	1994 Tax Expenditure 		$5.415 Million

	*Discounted Present-Value
	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 	$1.735 Million

	*This figure had never been disclosed before
</pre><p>

The above $5.4 million IRA tax expenditure corresponds to the
Joint Committee on Taxation figures that are used by the Ways
&amp; Means Committee in their tax policy deliberations.  However,
the <I>present-value figure</I> reflects the more realistic fact
that all IRA tax <I>deductions</I> are recovered by the government
with free-market rates of growth thereon!  In effect, therefore,
the government admits that its tax expenditure figures used for
Committee tax policy deliberations are over three times too high
when measured on a more realistic basis ($5.4 &#247; $1.7 = $3.3)!
 Further, the $1.7 million present-value figure represents the
senseless and self-defeating second layer of tax that should never
be imposed in the first place.
<P>
A few years ago, a highly respected Washington, DC, actuary analyzed
the government's methodology in determining tax expenditures relating
to tax deferred saving.  His conclusion was &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost
useless for budget purposes...Any tax law based on such arbitrary
and capricious figures can only be good by accident.&quot;  Amen.
<P>
In short, universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving (as found
in the bipartisan H.R. 328, the Individual Investment Account
Act) totally removes the income tax bias against saving.  It is
very important to recognize and accept the fact that such tax-deductible
saving represents <I>neutrality</I> in regards to the basic taxpayer
decision of whether to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;consume&quot;
income.  Thus, the removal of the tax bias against saving via
H.R. 328, <I>does</I> <I>not</I> mean that such removal favors
saving over consumption; it <I>does not</I>, it is neutral.
<P>
Clearly, when the question is raised as to the cost of enacting
tax-deductible saving legislation, the paramount question is quite
different-namely, what's the cost of the existing, unrelenting
fiscal drag on the economy that arises from the existing tax bias
against saving?  Common sense and rational tax revenue estimation
clearly show that eliminating the income tax bias on saving can
only be positive, not negative, legislation.<p>
<b><center>The Tax Revenue Impact of Unlimited, Tax-Deductible Saving
<br>As Proposed in H.R. 328</b></center>
<P>
The League strongly supports H.R. 328 (and S. 159, its companion
bill in the Senate) that provides for universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type &quot;investment accounts.&quot;  This legislation also
includes the removal of other senseless biases against saving
usually found with existing IRAs, such as penalty taxes, forced
distributions, etc.  See the summary of H.R. 328, attached.
<P>
To illustrate the fiscal impact of H.R. 328, the well-known and
respected economics advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, in 1993
prepared an economic forecast of the revenue aspects of H.R. 328
on two bases:  <I>static</I> (government method) and <I>dynamic</I>
(a far more rational method for measuring the impact of taxes
on saving).<p>

*The above net present-value calculations assume a discount rate
of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society given
by a long-term return on mutual funds.  The favorable swing (i.e.,
loss to gain:  -b to +a) in estimated revenues is mind-boggling
(e.g., $136 billion in year 2000)!  A copy of the complete Fiscal
Associates report is available to you upon request.

Fiscal Associates' forecasted results also portray a dramatic
increase in taxpayers' after-tax income and related standard of
living that will flow from the prompt enactment of H.R. 328.

<P>
<I>Note how middle-income America will enjoy the bountiful fruits
of unlimited, tax-deferred saving and free-market enterprise that
flows from unlimited, tax-deductible saving via the enactment
of H.R. 328.</I>
<P>
The above positive fiscal results can not be ignored by Congress,
nor the public.  While there may be differences among economists
as to the efficacy of dynamic vs. static scoring and the underlying
assumptions and methods, the &quot;dynamic&quot; results are not
only dramatically favorable, <I>they do reflect common sense and
a far more rational method of estimating the program's fiscal
results.</I>  
<P>
H.R. 328 is bottomed on plain common sense and reflects the economic
facts of life that when you reduce the costs of saving, you get
more of it.  Further, H.R. 328 induced-saving is always measurable
and held in trust for productive, free-market investment that
will grow to everyone's advantage, including the government's,
as it collects its taxes on the enhanced values at ordinary income
tax rates when benefits are paid.  Compounding this tax collection
growth are the added taxes arising from enhanced GDP and the broad
based increase in taxes generated thereby.
<P>
It is important to recognize that unlimited, tax-deductible saving
<I>without</I> penalty taxes, forced distributions, and no income
nor estate tax at death, will greatly increase the propensity
of most taxpayers to save increasing amounts over that which they
would save under the biased-against-saving ordinary income tax.
New saving and increased saving have no offsets to eventual government
tax receipts, because, by definition, these amounts of saving
would have otherwise been spent, thereby forgoing any further
enhanced tax receipts by the government via personal, free-market
investment growth.
<P>
Similarly, to the extent that the &quot;new saving&quot; portion
of a taxpayer's tax-deductible contribution matches or exceeds
his or her tax bracket (e.g., when 15% or more of the tax-deductible
contribution represents <I>new</I> saving for a 15% tax bracket
taxpayer), that new saving portion will match or exceed the government's
borrowing that's needed to replace the temporary loss of revenue
from tax deferral.  Thus, net national saving is maintained or
enhanced.<p>
<b><center>Conclusion</b></center>
<P>
There is no rational reason to defer an aggressive Congressional
push to enact universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving as proposed
by H.R. 328.  To the extent that existing budgetary rules, or
precedents for tax revenue estimation methods, if any, appear
to impede the consideration and enactment of H.R. 328, it is most
appropriate to very seriously consider their inapplicability and
their inappropriateness to this legislation.  Surely, sound, vital
legislation that increases personal saving within the U.S., as
well as the government's tax revenue receipts derived therefrom,
must not be held hostage to rules and precedents that are inappropriate
and self-defeating to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
The 1994 election reflects a strong voter/taxpayer demand for
a bipartisan government to be bold and sensible in removing the
dead-weight burden of irrational, self-defeating government from
their backs.  The anti-saving bias of the ordinary income tax
is a classic example of faulty government, and it must be removed.
 H.R. 328 is a most attractive, sound way to show that this Committee
and Congress is thoughtful and resolute in seeking proper solutions
to our nation's economic problems.
<P>
We appreciate your request that we testify on this most important
matter.  On behalf of savers and investors, and their vital interests
in the fiscal soundness of our government, we thank you for your
serious interest.  As always, action is what counts.
<P>
<B>SUMMARY OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT ACT, H.R. 328</B>
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions from any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.<p>
<LI>All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.<p>
<LI>No penalty tax on any withdrawal.<p>
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.<p>
<LI>With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
Beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.<p>
<LI>Principal Residence Rollovers:<p>
<ul><LI>Home Purchase:  Up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.<p>
<LI>Home Sale:  Proceeds from sale of a principal residence may
be rolled over into the investment account without tax.  The tax
basis of the account is thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax
basis of former residence, plus the existing law's $125,000 exemption
on the home's sale after age 55.<p>
<LI>This home sale rollover provision is particularly attractive
to &quot;empty nesters&quot; who won't sell their home due to
the income tax on the gain that mainly arises from inflation.
This provision lets them roll over an unproductive asset (home)
for productive investments in the account.  Thus, they may be
able to live better in retirement.  The government will probably
make money on this, because otherwise the &quot;empty nester&quot;
may opt for a &quot;stepped-up basis&quot; for his home upon death.
This rollover provision is a valuable option for many people.
</ul><p>
<LI>Tax-deductible premiums for life insurance are an acceptable
investment within the account, provided the proceeds are payable
into the account for investment therein and eventual taxable distribution.

<font size=4><b><a name="top">Summary</a> Statement of W. Thomas Kelly, President<br>
SAVERS &amp; INVESTORS LEAGUE</b></font><br>
<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting
me to comment on those provisions of the Contract With America
that are designed to encourage savings and investment.  The League's
views may be summarized by three important points.
<p>
<b><center>Our First Important Point:</b></center> 
<p>
First, we support the Contract's American Dream Savings
Account provision.  It is certainly a move in the right direction.
However, in our view, these provisions do not go far enough.
Legislation should be adopted promptly to fully remove the ordinary
income tax bias against saving.  
<P>
This cancerous tax bias is a constant, progressive drain on the
fiscal soundness of our government and on the economic growth
of our nation.  This tax bias must be removed- totally.
<P>
This total removal is accomplished by (1) allowing unlimited
tax deductions and tax deferrals for IRA-type saving; (2) income
taxes would be imposed only upon any plan withdrawal at then existing
progressive tax rates, like wages; and (3) there would be no penalty
taxes nor forced distribution at any age.  
<P>
These three, simple, basic criteria are embodied in the bipartisan
Individual Investment Account Act of 1995 (H.R. 328), as sponsored
by Mr. McCrery of this Committee, and S. 159 sponsored by Senator
Breaux of the Finance Committee.
<p>
<b><center>Our Second Important Point:</b></center>
<p>
Our second important point is that no consideration of
how to improve our nation's rate of saving can ignore the staff
procedures for measuring the alleged &quot;tax expenditure costs&quot;
of IRAs.  These staff procedures are so flawed that the Committee's
tax policy considerations are seriously compromised.  
<P>
Even the Treasury Department's 1995 Budget document, for the
first time ever, disclosed that its tax expenditure figures for
IRAs were overstated by over three times when measured on a more
rational, realistic basis.  And, even these severely reduced costs
continue to reflect the self-defeating second layer of tax on
saving that should not be imposed upon our government, our taxpayers,
and our nation.
<P>
Much debate arises over static vs. dynamic scoring of the alleged
costs of IRA-type plans.  Static scoring stands logic and sound
tax policy on its head.  For example, it assumes that IRA tax
deductions are an expense rather than creating a government asset.
The dynamic scoring of IRAs is fiscally sound and entirely proper.
<P>
The dynamic scoring of H.R. 328 by well-respected economists
show that tax receipts grow quickly, and become progressively
larger each year over those otherwise collected under the ordinary
income tax.  
<P>
These increasing tax receipts reflect the growth in saving, in
production, in GDP and in jobs; and the resulting reduction in
the cost of capital brought about by unlimited, tax-deductible
saving.  
 
<P>
And, because the gains arising from increased capital flow
in very large measure to labor, it is estimated that unlimited,
tax-deductible saving will increase the after-tax income
of <I>all</I> middle-income taxpayers by 12% to 23% within six
or seven years following enactment.
<p>
<b><center>Our Third Important Point:</b></center>
<p> 
Our third important point is to recognize that unlimited,
tax-deductible IRA-type plans are <I>not</I> tax loopholes for
the rich.  The full removal of the income tax bias against saving
not only restores the taxation of saving to one of proper neutrality
in terms of saving vs. consumption, it is also neutral in regards
to the taxation of realized capital gain vs. dividends or interest
income.
<P>
Unlimited, tax-deductible, tax-deferred saving is not
a favoring of savers in any tax bracket; it is solely one of restoring
fiscally sound tax neutrality at all tax brackets.
<p>
<center><b>Summary</b></center>

<P>
In summary, the removal of only a portion of the tax bias
against saving, as found in the American Dream Savings Account
legislation, is only a partial correction of the tax bias
against saving when a full correction is both imperative
and sound.
<P>
The unlimited, tax-deductible Individual Investment Accounts of
H.R. 328 are tax revenue gainers, not losers. Thus, there is no reason, other than 
an irrational, existing staff scoring dogma, to deny our nation, including
all taxpayers and our government, the singular advantages
that will flow from this sound legislation.
<P>
The League urges the Committee to thoroughly explore the economic
growth and rational tax revenue implications of H.R. 328.

<font size=4>NEW CONGRESS: IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID </font></center>
<p>
Washington, D.C., December 15, 1994 - Our nation is in a &quot;saving&quot;  crisis. 
This crisis is self-inflicted due to the erroneous way our government measures
alleged tax revenue loss from tax-deferred plans like IRAs. 
<p>
In short, the government treats IRA tax deferrals as an expense, when in reality,
the tax deferrals, by their very nature, are government assets.  Certainly, every
IRA owner recognizes that he or she has a tax liability if and when an IRA
withdrawal is ma de.  It's obvious that when the taxpayer has a liability to the
government, the government has an asset of like amount.  That's not and expense! 

Does this governmental error make a difference?  Absolutely-and the cost to
taxpayers, our nation, our economy, and to the government's tax collections, is
mind boggling high! 

The respected economic advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, prepared an analysis that
measured the future fiscal effects of legislation that allows any person to have
unlimited tax deductions for any IRA contributions.  See Table 1. </PRE>

<h6> *The net present-value calculations
assume a discount rate of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society
given by a long-term return on mutual funds.  This study was prepared in 1993 and
published in Wealth Is Not A Dirty Word, Mill Run Press, P aoli, PA.  The swing
(i.e., loss to gain) in estimated revenues (b-a) is mind boggling (e.g., $136
billion in year 2000)! 
</h6>
The government measures tax revenue on the unrealistic &quot;static&quot; basis
shown above, i.e., the government assumes people don't change their actions when
tax laws are changed, and ignores expanded tax collections from a soundly growing
economy.  [R emember how a static estimate raised taxes on boats, thereby killing
hobs and losing tax revenue?] The &quot;dynamic&quot; basis reflects the realistic
fact that people respond to tax law changes.  In this case, new net saving will
grow dramatically. 
<p>
Increased saving, created by unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would increase
production, increase jobs, reduce interest costs, and increase tax revenue. 
Taxpayers after-tax income (and related standard of living) by the year 
2000 would be increased as shown in Table 2. </PRE>

Clearly, Congress must immediately put a stop using the thoroughly discredited
static &quot;tax expenditure&quot; method for estimation tax revenues from
tax-deferred plans such as IRAs.  The static method directs governmental tax policy
180 degrees in th e wrong direction.  Without changing any other provision of the
law, correctly measuring the tax impact of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would
swiftly increase the after-tax income of middle America by 12% to 20%! 
<p>

On November 8th, the American people voted for rational, substantive change, not
just slogans.  There's no sounder change than H.R. 3179 and S. 929 (103rd
Congress).  These identical bills achieve the desired results portrayed above and
will be reintroduc ed in the 104th Congress. 
<p>

Every caring American should write his or her Representative and Senators now and
urge immediate enactment.  There is no reason for delay.  Every day of delay makes
matters worse.

<P>
Congress, as well as the current (and former) Administration, feel compelled to raise taxes,
coupled with illusionary spending cuts.  Voter/taxpayers are sick and tired, to the point of
revulsion, of the hackneyed demagoguery that always accompanies every budget debate.
  The claim is always made that the sky will fall unless taxes are raised.  Don't elected officials 
ever feel sick from being forced to participate in such a mindless exercise?
<P>
Grass roots voter/taxpayers are awakening to the fact that raising taxes has never, repeat never, cut
 our nation's deficit or debt.  Surely, members of Congress must know this, too.  As all Americans 
with common sense know, only enhanced private saving and private enterprise, coupled with 
governmental spending restraint, can reduce our nation's true deficit and debt.  Federal taxes are not only far too high, they impose a double, even triple tax on saving.
<P>
It is time for every member of Congress, as the elected representative of his or her constituents, to break away from the arcane and incredibly erroneous governmental revenue estimations that have no credibility whatsoever, except among
government people.  They blithely forecast deficit and debt reduction, when realism shows the exact
opposite.  Every member's vote on this important budget and tax matter should reflect plain common sense, not a blind 
acceptance of budgetary legerdemain that cannot be explained nor defended to constituents.
<P>
Regardless of party affiliation, a vote for common sense budget policy will: (a) reject the 
present budget package; and (b) subsequently focus on real, current spending cuts
 and a tax and budget policy that will enhance personal saving and investment, not destroy them.
<P>
It's important to recognize that when people save (regardless of tax bracket), they are placing their savings on the marketplace for others to use. 
 Obviously, the others (in all walks of life and in all tax brackets) who use this saving expect to profit therefrom, while paying for its use.  The 
dynamics of such &quot;free market&quot; capitalism builds upon itself.  
This is what makes nations prosper, 
thereby creating real jobs at all levels.  Clearly, saving should only be taxed once - when it's 
consumed (spent).
<P>
Thus, taxing such saving before it is consumed not only destroys the taxpayers' return, it removes badly needed 
private capital from the marketplace, thereby concurrently destroying the 
government's &quot;private savings&quot; tax base as
 well.  This is a surefire recipe for gradual economic strangulation, not only at the personal and family 
levels, but at the national level as well.
<P>
Our nation is now feeling the ever-tightening economic noose around its neck.

   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
 United States of America in Congress assembled,  
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  
   This Act may be cited as the `Capital Formation and Jobs Creation  
 Act of 1995'.  
 SEC. 2. 50 PERCENT CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   (a) General Rule: Part I of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the  
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to treatment of capital  
 gains) is amended to read as follows:  
                  `PART I--TREATMENT OF CAPITAL GAINS  
                 `SEC. 1201. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
 `SEC. 1201. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   `(a) General Rule: If for any taxable year a taxpayer has a net  
 capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall be a deduction from  
 gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible  
 by the income beneficiaries as gain derived from the sale or  
 exchange of capital assets.  
   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net  
 capital gain for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below  
 zero) by the amount which the taxpayer takes into account as  
 investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii).  
   `(d) Transitional Rule:   
       `(1) In general: In the case of a taxable year which includes  
     January 1, 1995--  
           `(A) the amount taken into account as the net capital   
         gain under subsection (a) shall not exceed the net capital  
         gain determined by only taking into account gains and   
         losses properly taken into account for the portion of the  
         taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, and  
           `(B) if the net capital gain for such year exceeds the  
         amount taken into account under subsection (a), the rate of  
         tax imposed by section 1 on such excess shall not exceed 28  
         percent.  
       `(2) Special rules for pass-thru entities:   
           `(A) In general: In applying paragraph (1) with respect   
         to any pass-thru entity, the determination of when gains   
         and losses are properly taken into account shall be made at  
         the entity level.  
           `(B) Pass-thru entity defined: For purposes of  
         subparagraph (A), the term `pass-thru entity' means--  
               `(i) a regulated investment company,  
               `(ii) a real estate investment trust,  
               `(iii) an S corporation,  
               `(iv) a partnership,  
               `(v) an estate or trust, and  
               `(vi) a common trust fund.'  
   (b) Deduction Allowable in Computing Adjusted Gross Income:  
 Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code is amended by inserting  
 after paragraph (15) the following new paragraph:  
       `(16) Long-term capital gains: The deduction allowed by  
     section 1201.'  
   (c) Technical and Conforming Changes:   
       (1) Section 13113 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993  
     (relating to 50-percent exclusion for gain from certain small  
     business stock), and the amendments made by such section, are  
     hereby repealed; and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be  
     applied as if such section (and amendments) had never been  
     enacted.  
       (2) Section 1 of such Code is amended by striking subsection  
     (h).  
       (3) Paragraph (1) of section 170(e) of such Code is amended   
     by striking `the amount of gain' in the material following  
     subparagraph (B)(ii) and inserting `50 percent of the amount of

     amended to read as follows:  
       `(2) Capital gains and losses:

         case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the amount  
         deductible on account of losses from sales or exchanges of  
         capital assets shall not exceed the amount includible on  
         account of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets.  
           `(B) Deduction under section 1201: The deduction under  
         section 1201 shall not be allowed.'  
       (B) Subparagraph (B) of section 172(d)(4) of such Code is  
     amended by striking `paragraphs (1) and (3)' and inserting  
     `paragraphs (1), (2)(B), and (3)'.  
       (5) Paragraph (4) of section 642(c) of such Code is amended   
     to read as follows:  
       `(4) Adjustments: To the extent that the amount otherwise  
     allowable as a deduction under this subsection consists of gain  
     from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than   
     1 year, proper adjustment shall be made for any deduction  
     allowable to the estate or trust under section 1201 (relating   
     to deduction for excess of capital gains over capital losses).  
     In the case of a trust, the deduction allowed by this   
     subsection shall be subject to section 681 (relating to  
     unrelated business income).'  
       (6) Paragraph (3) of section 643(a) of such Code is amended   
     by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: `The  
     deduction under section 1201 (relating to deduction of excess   
     of capital gains over capital losses) shall not be taken into  
     account.'  
       (7) Paragraph (4) of section 691(c) of such Code is amended   
     by striking `sections 1(h), 1201, and 1211' and inserting  
     `sections 1201 and 1211'.  
       (8) The second sentence of section 871(a)(2) of such Code is  
     amended by inserting `such gains and losses shall be determined  
     without regard to section 1201 (relating to deduction for  
     capital gains) and' after `except that'.  
       (9) Subsection (d) of section 1044 of such Code is amended by  
     striking the last sentence.  
       (10)(A) Paragraph (2) of section 1211(b) of such Code is

       `(2) the sum of--  
           `(A) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over  
         the net long-term capital gain, and  
           `(B) one-half of the excess of the net long-term capital  
         loss over the net short-term capital gain.'  
       (B) So much of paragraph (2) of section 1212(b) of such Code  
     as precedes subparagraph (B) thereof is amended to read as  
     follows:  
       `(2) Special rules:   
           `(A) Adjustments:   
               `(i) For purposes of determining the excess referred  
             to in paragraph (1)(A), there shall be treated as  
             short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount  
             equal to the lesser of--  
   `(I) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1)  
 or (2) of section 1211(b), or
